durham s review into the origins of the russia probe will lead to a criminal investigation of either former president barack obama or former vice president joe biden while noting that their concern of potential criminality in the conduct of that probe is focused on others barr during a press conference otherwise focused onthe december 2019 shooting atnaval air station pensacola spoke at length about the durham investigation he said he has a general idea of how the investigation is going and confirmed that some aspects are being investigated as potential crimes trump weighs in on unmasking barr did say however that not every abuse of power no matter how outrageous is necessarily a federal crime as for president obama and vice president biden whatever their level of involvement based on what i know i don t expect durham s work will lead to a criminal investigation of either man barr said our concern of potential criminality is focused on others later monday afternoon president trump told reporters he was surprised by barr aposs comments this comes after both obama and biden the presumptive democratic presidential nominee have faced heightened criticism from republicans for any potential rolein the early stages of the probe trump last week even called for obama to be summoned to testify before congress the politically explosive environment bringing the country into uncharted territory with a former president accused by critics of involvement in a political probe related to his eventual successor and thesitting president now essentially calling for retribution against his predecessor has built ever since the doj moved to dismiss its case against michael flynn list of officials who sought to aposunmask apos flynn released biden comey obama chief of staff among them

committee and share their concerns about each other if nothing else it would make for great television however i have great doubts about whether it would be wise for the country he said in a statement last week barr expressed similar reservations on monday making clear he aposs concerned about potential wrongdoing during the russia probe while also stressing that this process should not be a vehicle for retribution brennan says he aposs willing to be interviewed by durham says he has aposnothing to hide apos he said this will not be and cannot be a tit for tat exercise noting that the
