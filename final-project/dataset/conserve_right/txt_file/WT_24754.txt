attack on women of color the resolution passed mostly along party lines in a 240 187 vote with four republicans and newly minted independent justin amash of michigan voting with democrats this congress must speak loudly and with one voice to condemn the president s words and more importantly to condemn the sentiments behind them said rep jerrold nadler new york democrat the united states should be a beacon of hope and refuge to those who need its protection and it should welcome with open arms those who embody our values and ideals top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens the resolution specifically condemned comments mr trump tweeted out over the weekend directed at democratic reps alexandria ocasio cortez of new york ilhan omar of minnesota ayanna pressley of massachusetts and rashida tlaib of michigan suggesting they return to the dysfunctional governments from which they came rather than criticizing the u s democrats also highlighted other charged comments mr trump has made in the past including his remarks following the 2017 neo nazi rally in charlottesville virginia and his description of certain countries as s hole countries most republicans however rallied around the president and rejected arguments that his comments were racist though some did criticize the rhetoric he used monday rep mario diaz balart a florida republican said the term racist is thrown around too loosely as a political weapon this has got to stop but it s got to stop on both sides this is fuel to the fire it s not a way to bring closure to the issue said rep tom cole oklahoma republican adding that the president s comments were not appropriate the house voted on an anti hate resolution this year in light of the controversy surrounding ms omar but the original resolution centering on her tweets using anti semitic tropes was watered down in the final resolution that passed into a general condemnation of many forms of prejudice republican lawmakers argued that democrats push to finalize a vote on the resolution was a political play and said democrats didn t reach out for republican input what happened to the 72 hour rule ensuring members have an opportunity to review legislation seek feedback from constituents before voting on it what happened to regular order asked rep doug collins georgia republican republicans also cried hypocrisy for singling out the president s comments but not explicitly condemning specific remarks made by ms omar and ms ocasio cortez i think it s very one sided mr cole said we ve have people routinely using language from concentration camps to what i would consider anti semitic remarks and there haven t been resolutions on those sorts of things it s only now the vote was held after more than an hour of gridlock on the house floor when speaker nancy pelosi california democrat made comments criticizing the president and explicitly called his statements racist as well as divisive and dangerous every single member of this institution democratic and republican should join us in condemning the president s racist tweets she said to do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the american people her comments were found to be in violation of house rules which prohibit personal criticism of the president and references to any racial statement he may have made however democrats rallied behind her and voted against punishing the speaker by striking her words from the record or by barring her from debating on the floor several other warnings were issued about this rule which also extends to other members of congress before the house vote the president called on republican lawmakers to oppose the measure and to not show weakness he tweeted that his comments were not racist the so called vote to be taken is a democrat con game mr trump said i don t have a racist bone in my body the president and his team pushed back aggressively against ms ocasio cortez and the three other liberal women as the squad that hasn t done squat in a cabinet meeting mr trump held aloft a photograph of ms omar with some of her accompanying tweets saying she has engaged in anti american and anti semitic rhetoric he said the lawmakers should work for the good of our country i think it s terrible when people speak so horribly about our country the president said asked where the lawmakers should go at his earlier suggestion to leave the u s mr trump replied wherever they want or they can stay it s up to them but they should love our country and they should work for the good of our country they shouldn t hate our country the lawmakers comments about the u s are so horrible that i almost don t want to read it it s so bad mr trump added it s my opinion they hate our country and that s not good it s not acceptable the president said senior white house counselor kellyanne conway also accused the media of a double standard in the president s feud with the freshman democrats she said journalists are siding with the female lawmakers who accuse mr trump of racism but the media won t stand up for trump supporters
