apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic london ap queen elizabeth ii has been overheard on video calling chinese officials very rude in a conversation with a senior police officer at a buckingham palace event the comments made tuesday were unusual because the 90 year old monarch rarely comments publicly on political matters and media accompanying her are asked not to eavesdrop on private conversations the incident came hours after prime minister david cameron was caught on microphone calling nigeria and afghanistan fantastically corrupt top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore the queen s comments recorded

planning and was hailed by both sides at the time as an unqualified success the video captured police commander lucy d orsi telling the queen that arranging the state visit by chinese president xi jinping in october had been a testing time elizabeth responded they were very rude to the ambassador asked about the queen s remarks at a daily news briefing in beijing on wednesday foreign ministry spokesman lu kang declined to address them directly but said xi had made a very successful visit to britain last year the working teams from both sides made huge efforts to make this possible this effort has been highly recognized by both china and britain lu said despite lu s comments china appeared to regard the queen s comments as sensitive information about the remarks were difficult to find on china s heavily censored internet and government monitors cut the signal of the british broadcasting company when it reported on the comments in the video an official introduced the queen to d orsi and explains that the officer was in charge of policing for the visit the queen responded oh bad luck the official tells the queen that d orsi had been seriously undermined by the chinese in the handling of the visit when d orsi asked if the queen knew it had been a testing time the monarch interjected i did the officer recalled a moment when chinese officials walked out of a meeting with barbara woodward british ambassador to china in which the chinese told the brits the trip was off they walked out on both of us d orsi said extraordinary the queen said it was very rude and undiplomatic i thought d orsi said d orsi s mother is by her side during the encounter and tells the queen she is very proud of her daughter both the metropolitan police and the palace refused to comment on what they described as private conversations the palace stressed that xi s visit had been extremely successful british officials laid on dollops of pomp and splendor including a state

glowingly of the two countries global partnership at the elaborate state dinner which featured turbot and venison there were no public hints of tensions at the time although prince charles the heir to the throne and a supporter of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama shunned by the chinese did not attend the gala banquet the two countries signed more than 30 billion pounds 46 billion in trade agreements during the trip and cameron said britain would be china s partner of choice in the west british foreign secretary philip hammond said the visit got a bit stressful on both sides
