tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion tough words softened by gentle deeds are preferable to gentle words trampled by rough and reckless action president trump vows to begin deporting illegal immigrants by the millions a campaign promise that helped elect him and may well do so again he didn t invent the chaos on the border but he is the first president to try to do something about it the nation yearns for an equitable immigration system that enables the orderly entry of foreign nationals without infringing the rights of law abiding americans there s nothing in the president s words or deeds that dash that wish mr trump announced on twitter last week that u s immigration and customs enforcement ice would begin sending home migrants who have received and ignored final deportation orders next week ice will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the united states they will be removed as fast as they come in with the hours ticking down prior to the ice operation the president tweeted a reprieve at the request of democrats i have delayed the illegal immigration removal process deportation for two weeks to see if the democrats and republicans can get together and work out a solution to the asylum and loophole problems at the southern border if not deportations start top stories cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning it was classic trump designed to get anti trumpers off their ample bottoms and up in arms more inclined to resist than resolve however that they will change the chaos that enables migrants towing children free entry to the united states is doubtful in new york state which is moving close to granting driver s licenses to illegal immigrants state attorney general letitia james lashed out at ice s family op this is an immoral and unconscionable act by a president and an administration hellbent on dividing our country and as new york s top law enforcement officer i can assure new yorkers we will do everything in our power to fight back against these inhumane policies inhumane and its antithesis are inexact terms whose real world applications invite reasonable people to disagree the job of the state s top law enforcement officer however is fairly precise to administer the law and leave philosophical musings at the sophomore smoker ice is performing its duties in accordance with the law that new york and other de facto alien havens are hesitant or unwilling to enforce more than 2 000 families have been designated for the first phase of removal from cities that include los angeles new york chicago miami and houston if millions are to face deportation in accordance with the president s order agents will need the wisdom of solomon to avoid a repeat of parent child separations that provoked such anger last year the problem is with devious adults who rent children as props to gain preferred immigration status as a family unit mr

deportations every year during his two terms in office and mr trump has yet to reach 300 000 deportations in a year the president sometimes uses harsh language but harsh action hardly u s jurisprudence rests on the foundation of human compassion balancing respect for the rights of law abiding citizens to live unmolested with an appreciation of the rights of wrongdoers to be judged and punished if punishment is necessary with fairness and justice that parity has been turned upside down by the breakdown on the border the united states spends 116 billion annually according to the federation for american immigration reform for welfare education health care and law enforcement of millions of uninvited guests no price tag can be hung however on the grief suffered by families of the 4 000 persons killed by illegals during the past two years the statistic cited by the illegal alien lobby that the foreign born take lives less frequently than u s citizens is no defense of tragedy every victim would be alive were it not for his encounter with someone who had no right being here the president has given congress another chance to craft a system for orderly immigration that doesn t plunder the rights of the law abiding if there s no progress over the next two weeks to cure the chaos the only remaining solution as barack obama learned is deportation there seemed to
