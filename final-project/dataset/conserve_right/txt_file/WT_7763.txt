apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic drugmakers are racing to land a vaccine or treatment for the new coronavirus but the science takes time meaning americans are left with an onslaught of canceled parades suspended sports leagues and school closures while they wait for next season s cures the u s official in charge of infectious diseases told congress that within a few weeks he may be able to announce that someone has received the first trial shot for the virus that popped up in china in december and has caused worldwide havoc that s good news see also medical history can increase risk for covid 19 however that doesn t mean we have a vaccine that we can use dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases told the house oversight committee on thursday it s record time to get the vaccine tested it s going to take a year to a year and a half to really know if it works he said likewise the top scientists are figuring out whether any existing drugs work against the illness known as covid 19 an anti viral drug known as remdesivir shows promise and is being used in emergencies in hard hit washington state though the results of clinical trials at home and abroad won t be clear until april the upshot is that americans face an outbreak without a pharmaceutical solution instead government and business leaders are scrambling to increase testing root out cases and disrupt chains of transmission by scrapping large gatherings and sports events while asking churches and universities to move their operations online we need something for today which is social distancing and for next year which is a vaccine said gerard anderson a professor at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health the u s had recorded more than 1 300 cases and nearly 40 deaths as of late thursday according to a johns hopkins university tracker tours of the capitol and white house in washington have been suspended while new york postponed its famous st patrick s day parade for the first time in more than 250 years new york gov andrew cuomo also instituted a mile wide containment zone thursday surrounding a hard hit synagogue in the new york city suburb of new rochelle large gatherings are banned and the national guard is cleaning public areas mr trump said he s open to the idea of restricting travel to parts of washington state and california which are seeing local transmission we haven t discussed that yet is it a possibility yes if somebody gets a little bit out of control if an area gets too hot he said mr trump late wednesday decided to ban foreign nationals in dozens of european nations from traveling to the u s for 30 days starting friday he cited the rapid spread of the virus abroad and fears that travelers were bringing cases despite his previous efforts to block cases from east asia italy remains in lockdown ordering its 60 million residents to avoid travel except for work emergencies or food supplies german chancellor angela merkel called on her nation to rally to the fight estimating that up to 70 of the german population could be infected because the virus is new and there is no treatment or vaccine barry r bloom a professor at the harvard t h chan school of public health said without those two tools there is only a pair of things the u s can do testing testing testing and rolling out social distancing interventions in a thoughtful manner reducing unnecessary large aggregations of people including events concerts and entertainment worship services dr fauci on thursday acknowledged the u s is far behind on that first item testing the system is not really geared to what we need right now dr fauci told house lawmakers that is a failing it is a failing let s admit it dr fauci offered blunt testimony as members of congress fume over the lack of testing at hospitals and nursing homes back home saying it s held back the domestic response while such nations as south korea are offering drive in service the idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it we re not set up for that dr fauci said do i think we should be yes but we re not dr robert redfield the director of the centers for disease control and prevention said he would like to see coronavirus testing used for broad health surveillance to get a clearer picture of how the virus is spreading dr fauci agreed saying the cdc is conducting covid 19 surveillance tests in six cities in the u s with hopes to expand further in the coming months under surveillance testing the cdc allows anyone who walks into a clinic or hospital to be tested for the virus but dr fauci said the u s is unable to administer this practice universally at this point the system right now as it exists of having a much broader capability of determining what the penetrance of the virus is in society right now is not operational for us we hope to get there reasonably soon but we are not there now dr fauci said senate minority leader charles e schumer said the lack of capacity is scrambling the ability to contain the virus effectively if they had the tests they d know who had the virus they could quarantine at home and others could go out and about with their lives and shop in the stores go down the streets and go through their normal activities the new york democrat said the lack of testing has forced many in containment areas to quarantine themselves when they may not have the virus at all administration officials have assured the public that millions of test kits are being sent out to public health labs around the country after early stutter steps in manufacturing and accuracy they ve tapped the private sector to significantly ramp up production democrats are worried that patients won t be able to afford a test once it is available rep katie porter california democrat prodded officials into an impromptu game of price is right telling them to guess the cost of testing and related services she then used extensive questioning to force dr redfield to commit to making sure the covid 19 test is affordable while the crisis persists citing cdc authority to do so she seized on the concession declaring excellent everybody in america hear that you are eligible to go get tested for coronavirus and have that covered regardless of insurance mr trump continued to strike an optimistic tone from the white house saying the testing has been going very smoothly if you go to the right agency if you go to the right area you get the test he said during a meeting with irish prime minister leo varadkar mr varadkar praised america s ability to lead the way on a long term solution as countries around the world struggle to stamp out a virus that s sickened over 127 000 people and killed more than 4 000 you ve got great scientists great companies great universities and we need them working on treatments working on tests and working on a vaccine because that s that s what will get us on top of this mr varadkar said right and we re making great progress there i will say mr trump said on a potential vaccine dr fauci said it was relatively easy to grab sequencing information from china and develop a trial shot we knew the gene that would code for the protein we wanted to make our vaccine dr fauci told congress all we did was pull the information right out of the database we made it synthesized it very easily overnight stuck it into our platform and started making it that doesn t mean that we have a vaccine we can use the doctor warned saying it s important not to hurt healthy people by giving them unvetted vaccines drug therapies by contrast are given to people who are already sick the most promising drug remdesivir is made by gilead inc ceo daniel o day told mr trump on march 2 that it expected information from clinical trials in china by april noting its product has been wielded against other coronaviruses the same family as sars and mers and we re hoping it has the effect now against covid 19 mr o day said so we know in vitro that is has a very high effect university of richmond biology professor eugene wu said the drug does show strong potential as an antiviral amid the outbreak though conditions for stress testing it could be better scientists at gilead do not yet know if remdesivir is safe for widespread human use he said and the middle of a large outbreak of a potentially lethal infection is not the ideal time to perform a carefully controlled clinical trial madison hirneise
