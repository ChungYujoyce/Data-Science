 obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump s defenders are preparing to make war against house democrats tightly controlled public hearings on impeachment this week the rules of which give impeachment ringmaster rep adam b schiff california democrat a distinct advantage over the white house their strategy as gleaned from the house republican leadership team and trump confidants is to turn mr schiff s advantage into a liability and make the hearings as much about his crusade against the president as the charge that mr trump pushed ukraine to investigate corruption involving political rival joseph r biden and his son hunter all of these rules are dependent on the interpretation of schiff who has a major bias is a proven liar with regard to this case and is a material witness mr trump s personal attorney rudolph w giuliani told the washington times see also impeachment democrats worry about bleachbit repeat mr schiff s presence is a major challenge to the legitimacy of the impeachment inquiry he said adding that the chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence makes matters worse by threatening contempt charges against anyone who objects to his role it looks like it s the schiff hearings with him as judge jury and executioner said mr giuliani a key figure in the inquiry as mr trump s off the books agent in ukraine the president warned congressional republicans on sunday not to fall for what he called the fools trap an argument by some that his phone call with ukraine s president wasn t perfect but doesn t amount to an impeachable offense see also rep eric swalwell defends democrats rejection of gop impeachment witnesses no it is much stronger than that he tweeted before shifting into all capital letters nothing was done wrong house minority leader kevin mccarthy california republican sounded the same alarm about mr schiff on sunday he accused the committee chairman of orchestrating a calculated coup to remove a legitimately elected president this has been orchestrated and if it goes out longer we will find the lies we will find out how they manipulated the truth mr mccarthy said on fox news channel s sunday morning futures mr schiff who is spearheading the house inquiry has dismissed republican attacks as a desperate attempt to change the subject from what he sees as clear evidence of mr trump s wrongdoing under the rules which democrats forced through the house on a party line vote oct 31 mr schiff and other democratic leaders have broad authority to determine how the inquiry proceeds and what americans see at the public hearings which are scheduled to begin wednesday mr schiff quickly brought down the hammer on republicans request to call hunter biden and the anonymous whistleblower who complained about mr trump s july 25 conversation with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to testify at the open hearings mr schiff said in a statement that he would not allow republicans to use public impeachment hearings to pursue sham investigations into the bidens or to facilitate the president s effort to threaten intimidate and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm rep devin nunes of california the ranking republican on the intelligence committee said he requested hunter biden because he would shed light on the issue at the center of the house democrats impeachment case that mr trump abused his oval office power to get an investigation of the bidens for political reasons republican defenders of the president have said he at most raised long standing bipartisan concerns about corruption in ukraine hunter biden landed a 50 000 a month job on the board of ukrainian natural gas company burisma holdings despite having no experience in the energy field while his father was the point man for obama white house policy in that country the vice president later forced ukraine s leaders to fire the country s chief prosecutor who has since said he had been looking into graft at burisma mr biden who is a top 2020 democratic presidential hopeful and his son have insisted they did nothing wrong under the inquiry rules mr schiff and the democratic chairmen of two other house committees conducting inquiries have the authority to deny republicans requests for witnesses the rules require republicans to provide justification for each witness they request and for the witnesses testimony to conform with the scope of the inquiry set by the democrats in his letter saturday to mr schiff requesting witnesses mr nunes raised numerous objections to the hearing process your failure to fulfill minority witness requests shall constitute evidence of your denial of fundamental fairness and due process he wrote later adding that americans see through this sham impeachment process his remarks mirror claims by democrats that noncooperation with their investigation provides further grounds for impeachment mr nunes requested open hearing testimony by other players in the ukraine corruption scenario including devon archer a business associate of hunter biden and christopher heinz a stepson of former secretary of state john f kerry two other republican requested witnesses who could give potentially explosive testimony are democratic national committee staffer alexandra chalupa and former democratic opposition research operative nellie ohr at the dnc ms chalupa worked with the ukrainian embassy in washington to get political dirt on mr trump during the 2016 presidential campaign mr nunes said ms ohr who worked at the opposition research firm fusion gps which was involved in creating the unsubstantiated trump russia dossier has testified that ukrainian officials helped former british spy christopher steele compile the dossier that launched the fbi and special counsel investigations that sought but failed to find trump russia collusion mr schiff signaled that few if any of these witnesses would appear at the hearings rep sean patrick maloney a new york democrat on the intelligence committee said some witnesses on mr nunes list likely would be called i can t speak for the chairman but i think we will end up calling some of the witnesses on that list and here s my test do these witnesses have important knowledge or evidence about the president s conduct he said on fox news sunday democrats limited the scope of the public hearings to three questions about mr trump s actions did he or his agents ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival did he or his agents attempt to pressure or leverage foreign leaders did he or his agents attempt a cover up the impeachment case against mr trump hinges on accusations first lodged by the whistleblower that he pressured mr zelensky in a july 25 phone call to investigate the bidens mr trump also pushed for mr zelensky who was newly elected on an anti corruption platform to open an investigation of ukrainian interference in the u s 2016 presidential election democrats argue that mr trump made 391 million in u s military aid to ukraine conditional upon mr zelensky s announcement of the investigations which they describe as the quid pro quo of the president s self serving deal although the military aid was put on hold for a short time it was delivered and there is no evidence that the ukrainians began any investigations into the bidens at mr trump s behest or otherwise mr zelensky has said he did not feel he was being pressured or coerced on the phone call a transcript of which the white house has released the public hearings wednesday will feature state department officials william taylor and george kent who in their closed door interviews said they were concerned that mr trump s policy in ukraine crossed the line from diplomacy to election politics the impeachment panel will hear testimony friday from marie yovanovitch former u s ambassador to ukraine who has said mr giuliani conducted shadow diplomacy in ukraine and worked to get her fired as ambassador gabriella mu oz and dave boye
