apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the party the secret world of china s communist rulersby richard mcgregorharper 27 99 320 pages given the daunting odds against their success the men who met on july 1 1921 to found the chinese communist party the gongchangdang rank among history s greatest optimists just eight were present in shanghai s french quarter proposing a plan for a communist revolution even though the proletariat working class was a measly 2 percent of the population after harnessing the galloping steed of anti japanese nationalism among peasants to win power in 1949 that same party now numbers 78 million members history s largest political organization richard mcgregor the former beijing correspondent for the financial times offers little new in his account of the party s founding and rise but his consistent realism and knack for incorporating dramatic anecdotes and revealing quotes render his book a skilled overview and smooth read as china takes its place on the world stage as a rising superpower his analysis of the party s enduring grip on power will engross and perhaps unnerve westerners hoping for democracy here in china top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore the author notes that yes mao zedong promised an iron rice bowl of socialist welfare but it was fatally empty yes he adds the sometimes fraternal sometimes adversarial soviet union collapsed which isolated china but after each catastrophe the party has reconstituted its armor and outlasted outsmarted outperformed or simply outlawed its critics mr mcgregor astutely concludes that the party studies the suicides of other socialist polities to avoid taking a spot in history s graveyard some western china experts predicted the party s demise after the tiananmen square uprising of 1989 but it became stronger in fact one telling incident not related in the book concerns a young chinese editor who ran a statement calling for a proper investigation when his superiors flayed him he retorted that he had no idea what had happened in 1989 behind this enforced amnesia mr mcgregor notes is the party s smart use of propaganda in short order preparations were under way for the olympics a move that distracted and inspired a people who seek global prestige stirring up nationalism is another buttress with beijing adamantly insisting on reunification with taiwan while ensuring it maintains control of the military an issue mr mcgregor reviews so much for the optimism of westerners in 1989 that a sophisticated dignified civilized china would loosen its grip was it the latest instance of the west romanticizing china a phenomenon that spans the latter s failed socialism and its politically dictatorial corrupt and environmentally devastating modernization now under way mr mcgregor offers compelling insights regarding the party s spies and informants a control operation that maintains extensive files on members and others mr mcgregor quotes an unnamed college professor who says the party is like god he is everywhere you just can t see him but its dark powers encompass illegal surveillance home searches forced repatriation detention re education through labor being locked in psychiatric asylums phone tapping harassment and let s add forced abortions and executions so why do party members remain dedicated one factor is money mr mcgregor cites an official who explains that a powerful party member paid 300 000 chinese yuan for his position but within two years netted in five million is there any other profession as profitable as this under heaven ironically a new class of baohufu the suddenly rich supports the party because it is generating wealth overall as the book observes chinese officials have placed velvet leashes around the necks of their people who enjoy the right to travel attend college worship at temples and become rich they are able to discuss public affairs and even protest to some extent as individuals but if the dissent becomes widespread and especially if resisters formally organize e g an alternate party the soft tether becomes a noose committed to maintaining chinese democracy with socialist characteristics the official slogan while some party elders this week called for more freedom of speech this reviewer urges caution the worms infesting the political apple notably vicious cheating for money and power the advancement of one s clique and reliance on personal connections and networks to flout the law are deeply embedded and many it is more than a little telling that mao who extolled socialism moved into the imperial palace after seizing power and is sometimes called a red emperor access to internet sites that reference this book including amazon are blocked here in an exclusive post from london mr mcgregor asserts that this confirms that the party is very secretive and sensitive about its inner workings the chinese officials i have spoken to directly are aghast second hand i am told the party is doing an internal report to circulate within party organs but it still cannot speak to me directly because such issues are not to be shared with nonparty or low ranking members mr mcgregor concludes somberly and rightly that china will destabilize the world whether it collapses or succeeds it is bound to unsettle the existing order the rest of the world will have to adjust to compete be it for dominance of the sea lanes or oil in africa clearly the west faces a serious competitor that has impressively sometimes worryingly become a resilient giant far
