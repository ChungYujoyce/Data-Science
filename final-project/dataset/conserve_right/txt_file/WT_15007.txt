it being summer said gao jun deputy general manager of chinese theater operator new film association in an interview with the associated press the movie features many of the chinese film industry s biggest names including chow yun fat fan bingbing and john woo who this week attended a red carpet celebration of the movie woo better known as a director of action movies has a cameo the great revival shows the heft the authoritarian government wields even as china boasts a fast growing commercial movie business as well as scores of television stations and entertainment websites i think they tried to add a few things to make the big ticket movies more attractive one is increased drama and the others are new techniques and all star casts said jiang xiaoyu a beijing based movie director and critic in an interview with aptn but these are just superficial and i believe the new generation of more rational audience members would like to see the real historical truth the makers of the great revival are following the successful formula used for an earlier propaganda epic the founding of a republic that 2009 movie marked the 60th anniversary of the formation of the people s republic of china it made 415 million yuan 61 million at the box office as young audiences weary of traditional propaganda movies flocked to get a glimpse of the stars the movie featured action stars jackie chan and jet li hong kong comedian stephen chow of kung fu hustle fame and crouching tiger hidden dragon star zhang ziyi to ensure success next week as was the case in 2009 screenings of new hollywood releases have been put on hold to reduce competition transformers dark of the moon will not be released until about a month after its u s opening kung fu panda 2 which is already in theaters gets to stay though it s unclear on how many screens after the hollywood blockbuster avatar became the highest grossing film in china s history two years ago local theaters were ordered to remove the two dimensional version in an effort to reduce competition for china s homegrown films the great revival is likely to be seen by twice as many people as its 2009 predecessor said gao the theater operator he said that china now has about 2 000 more movie screens than it did two years ago one star who won t appear in the movie is tang wei who was left out of the final cut tang was slated to play the first love of communist china s founding father mao zedong but there are rumors she is still suffering a backlash after she was reportedly blacklisted for playing a traitor in the 2007 world war ii era spy thriller lust caution gao said tang was cut because historians questioned the accuracy of her character not because of her role in lust caution some local media reports have suggested she was cut due to time constraints of the movie both the great revival and its propaganda predecessor were commissioned by the main film regulator and made by the powerful state owned china film group which is involved in most major productions on the mainland and controls the import of foreign films the group s chairman han sanping along with huang jianxin directed both movies and personally asked some of the celebrities to participate injecting star power and big budget production values have been seen as a clever way for party propagandists to reach chinese in their 20s and 30s who grew up in the relative prosperity of economic reform and are often cynical about propaganda the success of such propaganda blockbusters has been helped by politically savvy theater operators who flood their screens with showings and by state owned companies that buy tickets for their employees some students and members of the army have also been given free tickets besides the new film the communist party is marking the 90th anniversary in other dramatic ways it s launching a musical campaign that will have students and party members singing red songs praising the party at public events local television stations will also broadcast shows featuring red songs and classic movies that celebrate the party and tell the story of mao and his colleagues struggle and sacrifice
