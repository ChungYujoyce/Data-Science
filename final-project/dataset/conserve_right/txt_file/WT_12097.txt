neal rejects rodman s risky n korean trip north korea will achieve nothing by threats or provocations which will only further isolate the regime white house spokesman jay carney said in the north korean capital pyongyang a military spokesman said the government of kim jong un will completely nullify the korean armistice because of ongoing military exercises between the united states and south
