apost understood that wallace voice over we aposll have a live report from las vegas with the latest on the investigation we aposll talk with the owner of the town aposs biggest hotels and casinos steve wynn who decided a year ago las vegas was a soft target steve wynn chief executive wynn resorts we profile or inspect or examine everybody that enters the building wallace steve wynn only on fox news sunday and then even gun rights advocates are calling to revoke bump stock like the las vegas gunman used to make his automatic weapons fire faster rep paul ryan r wis speaker of the house fully automatic weapons have been outlawed for many many years this seems to be a way of going around that wallace on camera is this the start of sweeping gun control we aposll ask chris cox executive director of the national rifle association plus as president trump decides to decertify the iran nuclear deal his his secretary of state denies he is considered quitting rex tillerson u s secretary of state the vice president has never had to persuade me to remain the secretary of state because i have never considered leaving this post donald trump president of the united states we must put an end

and our power player of the week a professional football player goes out of this world to make a difference unidentified male my perspective shifted i wanted to come home and really help inspire that next generation wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington we aposll get the latest from the investigation into the las vegas mass shooting in a moment with a live report but we begin with breaking news hurricane nate made landfall early this morning striking biloxi mississippi with rain and winds of 85 miles per hour causing flooding and power outages nate has now been downgraded to a tropical storm let aposs get the latest on nate aposs path chief meteorologist rick reichmuth is in the fox weather center in new york rick rick reichmuth fox news chief meteorologist hi chris yes the fourth hurricane to make landfall in the u s this hurricane season which is quite remarkable taking a look at the satellite picture you can see it moved onshore it still is moving very quickly which is great news it means it aposs not going to sit in any one spot and allow it to rain for that long so the flooding won apost be as bad as it could have been that said over time this is going to pull up in across parts of the tennessee valley ohio valley and eventually across parts of the northeast because it aposs interacting with a cold front coming in it aposs going to bring a lot of moisture out so this is the future radar throughout the day today rain moving in the north georgia mountains tennessee valley in toward the central appalachia during the overnight hours and by tomorrow all of that moisture moves in across parts of the northeast so a very wet start to the week and a wet commute to the day tomorrow as well but take a look at this overall rainfall totals are going to be extreme some spots potentially up to 10 inches far inland from the storm that means flooding could be widespread especially across parts of the central and southern appalachians chris wallace rick thank you now to las vegas where investigators are still looking for a motive into why stephen paddock open fire on a crowd last sunday night killing 58 people and wounding almost 500 will carr is live in las vegas with the latest will will carr fox news correspondent chris authorities say as stephen paddock was perched on the 30 second floor of mandalay bay he left a note on his nightstand now 60 minutes reporting that note had calculations so he could maximize his accuracy as he fired down upon the crowd and when that happened thousands scattered people raced over in this direction they physically pushed down this fence and then they ran over unto airport property trying to get to safety and while questions continue to swirl around motive authorities are putting out billboards across town asking for help there are also reports that the fbi is starting to believe paddock had severe mental illness that went undiagnosed fifty eight people were killed in the attacks almost 500 injured before paddock shot and killed himself investigators are continuing to question paddock aposs girlfriend marilou danley we aposve learned the couple traveled and went on at least a dozen cruises as the investigation continues this community continues to try to heal vice president mike pence took part in a community prayer walk on saturday begin video clip mike pence vice president of the united states we do more with those who mourn and grieve with those who grieve but we do not grieve like those who have no hope because heroes give us hope applause end video clip carr along those lines a carpenter drove into town from chicago and he put up 58 wooden crosses on each cross is a victim aposs picture and their name really a touching reminder of all the people aposs lives that were lost chris wallace will carr reporting from las vegas will thanks the las vegas massacre raises new questions about how to prevent these attacks joining me now for an exclusive interview one of the giants of las vegas steve wynn chief executive of wynn resorts who aposs been thinking about this problem for a long time steve it was over a year ago when you said that las vegas was a target city and you were going to harden your hotels and casinos what did you do wynn actually it was two years ago thanksgiving and i got every consultant and adviser i can think of to come through from a ray kelly to the people from seal team 6 it took us from thanksgiving until may to develop and institute and recruit a program of counterterrorism and it will be two years this may wallace and wynn it started in 2015 wallace and without going into great detail what kind of things do you have on your facilities wynn basically we had to recruit and expand security by tens of millions of dollars to cover every entrance to retrain the entire workforce from housekeeping and room service and people are in the tower and observing people we had to cover every exit and every aspect of the building to see if we could identify and preempt any kind of terroristic or violent action it is never perfect of course but what you can do to use local vernacular you can change the odds i guess wallace so given all of that and i know that you had a hidden metal detectors and you had profilers in your casinos watching the people walking in and out would any of those measures have prevented steven paddock from checking in to one of your hotels instead of the mandalay bay to have brought in these suitcases carrying his arsenal a couple of suitcases at that time checking in to a room on a high floor knocking out the window and raining terror down on people below wynn well i know that my friends at mgm are particularly fastidious about trying to protect their employees and their guests having said that there are a couple of things in retrospect and it aposs always good to look over your shoulder on these things but we have a routine with housekeeping with room service with audio visual who anybody that goes in the room to do an inspection we also have rules about do not disturb if a room goes on do not disturb for more than 12 hours we investigate we constantly we don apost allow guns in this building unless they aposre being carried by our employees and there aposs a lot of them but if anybody aposs got a gun and we find them continually we eject them from the hotel wallace so if he had suitcases carrying these automatic or semi automatic weapons would you have been able to spot that if they were in the suitcases being carried up to his room wynn well we certainly wouldn apost invade the privacy of a guest in a room but let aposs put it this way the scenario that we aposre aware of would have indicated that he didn apost let anyone in the room for two or three days that would have trigger a whole bunch of alarms here and we would have on behalf of the guests of course investigated for safety and it would have been provocative situation i aposm sure that the same is true in other hotels but in this hotel a 36 hour a 24 hour 36 hour do not disturb one of room is a predicate for investigation wallace after the shooting last weekend you started having security at the entrances to your hotels wand people wand inspect bags being brought in are you going to keep doing that and with 20 20 hindsight the benefit there have you thought of new measures that you aposre going to take to try to prevent another one of these massacres from happening using one of the wynn resorts as a perch to fire down on thousands of people on the street below wynn well if i can clear the record we have been guarding the doors for two years every single day 24 hours a day we have magnetometers at any place at every employee entrance and at every place of human collection like the night clubs we don apost wand the people at the door that aposs not necessary we profile or inspect or examine everybody that enters the building and under most circumstances it aposs unnecessary to wand people or to do any kind of invasive procedure the things we aposre looking for that represent potential threats are much more obvious and allow us a great deal of freedom in allowing us to not interfere with the normal flow of people in and out of the building which is close to 15 000 or 20 000 people a day wallace i understand that stephen paddock had gambled and stayed at your properties along with a lot of other places along the strip i know you talked to your security team afterwards looking back after talking to all of them how much of a profile did you have on him and was there anything in that profile that should have raise a red flag wynn it aposs an interesting question he aposs been staying in las vegas since apos06 so you know we aposre talking about 11 years with his girlfriend or at least in recent years frequent visitor once or twice a month to this hotel and others the most vanilla profile one could possibly imagine a modest gambler at least by our standards you know nothing serious paid promptly never owed any money anywhere in las vegas he didn apost fit the profile of a problem or a compulsive gambler what was if there was anything interesting that we discovered in the years of service and we have butlers and waiters and masseuses and the people in the beauty shop that know this woman and this man completely they talk about normal mundane things but if there aposs anything interesting that stood out over the six years nobody that aposs ever worked here have ever seen the gentleman or the lady take a drink of wine beer or alcohol of any kind now a lot of people don apost drink but considering their frequency of all the restaurants and their behavior as normal tourist taking advantage of everything that aposs available in our resort they never ever imbibed in any liquor their behavior was conservative private understated in every way you never ever would stop a man like this coming in you know in the building however nobody in this company aposs history no public person has ever walked in the service elevator unless they were accompanied by a security that wouldn apost happen secondly wallace did he go on a service elevator steve wynn i aposm just saying anything like that i aposm not sure whether he did but nobody ever goes in the back of the house unaccompanied by security but another thing being in a room for three days in a do not disturb situation that would have triggered an alarm here and would have considered what have been considered as a potentially dangerous thing from the guest aposs point of view that maybe the person was ill and we would want to inspect and see that they were safe we go into their room we aposd want to know more about anybody who was sequestered in a room for more than 12 hours that would be that would be something that would our people have been trained too look out for so chris wallace steve you and i have known each other for some years you are very smart man who knows almost everything has seen almost every aspect of human conduct do you have a theory do you have an instinct for the big question why steven paddock did what he did wynn no no but i have this feeling chris this is a man who behaves rationally privately a little introverted liked to play video poker but he was a rational man and every historical review of his behavior indicates that he was a rational man so was his girlfriend and yet he prepared over an extended period of time a totally irrational act now this sounds like someone either totally demented a behavior which he never evidenced or someone who aposs sending a message this is a plan we don apost know what that message is or if there is one but this behavior according to my employees is as stunning as unexpected as anybody any of them have ever met and that aposs the status you know that i hear from the sheriff and watching television that seems to be the moment the momentary analysis of this situation i really don apost have anything to add to that wallace steven wynn thank you thank for you time and we aposll be watching how you and the rest of las vegas respond to this terrible tragedy thanks again sir wynn we aposll be fine we aposll be fine the president did a good job wallace up next after still another mass shooting the debate over gun control re ignites but this time even the national riffle association is calling for more regulation we aposll talk with the nra aposs executive director when we come right back commercial break wallace in the wake of last sunday aposs mass murder in las vegas we all followed an all too familiar pattern shocked questions and calls for more gun control most of us also learned about a device bump stock that allow rifles to fire faster and now even some of the strongest advocates of gun rights are calling for more regulation joining me here is chris cox executive director of the national rifle association mr cox welcome to fox news sunday chris cox executive director national rifle association thanks chris wallace the nra surprised a lot of people this week calling for atf to review bump stocks here is part of your statement let aposs put it on the screen the nra believes devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations this regulation had been on the books for seven years why is the nra suddenly concerned and what specifically would you like to see atf do cox well what we called for was atf to review any device changes semiautomatics to function like fully automatics as you probably know it aposs illegal to convert a semiautomatic to fully automatic atf did approve this under barack obama and what the national rifle association has said is atf needs to do their job review these and if there aposs a further regulation then we aposll work on further regulation but chris what we saw last week was pure evil and we aposve seen evil existed in this country we aposve seen box cutters in airplanes cars bombs trucks full of explosives and yes firearms so as we have this conversation we need to look at the broader picture we need to have an honest discussion about what works and what doesn apost work and our concern is that all this focus on devices takes away the attention from the underlying behavior and until we address that these things are going to continue to happen wallace well let aposs just talk about the underlying behavior you aposre the nra so we aposre going to talk to you about the specific technique would you be ok with banning bump stocks cox well we don apost believe that bans have ever worked on anything what we aposve said has been very clear that if something transfers a semiautomatic to function like a fully automatic then it ought to be regulated differently fully automatics are regulated differently in this country if something copies a semiautomatic into a fully automatic then those should be related as well wallace did you get any blowback from some of your members because it aposs unusual for the nra after one of these incidents to call for more regulation of either guns or parts of guns cox there were nra members at that concert there were nra members that were shot at that concert and nra members that were murdered at that concert so what we aposre getting from nra members is grief and fear the same way americans are grieving and scared that something like this might happen again so will there be disagreement over policy discussions of course there aposs an ongoing discussion of gun control in this country we had it during the debates last year we had it throughout the campaign when the most pro gun control candidate was defeated by the most pro second amendment candidate these conversations happened what we are concerned about is that we aposre having a conversation when people are grieving there used to be a common decency in this country where people pause from talking about policy unfortunately with dianne feinstein and michael bloomberg they want to exploit a tragedy from day it aposs shameful but apparently that aposs the new normal and that aposs why we aposre talking to you today wallace well i want to pick up on that because while the nra is talking about bump stocks there are number of gun control advocates a number of them democrats who are calling for more sweeping measures here aposs a few begin video clip hillary clinton former democratic presidential candidate i can apost believe one whole political party in the greatest country on earth is totally sold to the gun lobby rep nancy pelosi d cali house minority leader they aposre going to say if you give them a bump stock it aposs going to be a slippery slope i certainly hope so end video clip wallace now i know that sets your teeth on edge you say common decency let aposs wait what aposs enough time i mean here where 58 people killed almost 500 injured is it common decency to wait a day two days a week a month i mean it is understandable you can i know you don apost agree with their solution but what aposs wrong with saying we need to address this issue cox well let me talk about hillary clinton and nancy pelosi both and get back to that point you can see pelosi has said and i take her at her word i take dianne feinstein at her word when she says that she had 51 votes in the senate for mr and ms america to turn in all of your guns they would do it look the talking points might change for dianne feinstein but the underlying agenda never does and the truth is hillary clinton ran as a most pro gun control candidate in america and she lost and but she gets an award she gets an award for hypocrisy because she will never spend a moment a breath without armed security surrounding her for the rest of her life she will never dial 911 she aposll never lived in a high crime area but her life is no more valuable than a single mom living in chicago working the late shift who wants to own a gun and carry it to defend herself that aposs why we aposre calling on congress to yes look at firearms but also crosstalk wallace i want to pick up on that and i aposm going to throw a little monkey wrench at the control room because we aposre going to play an earlier bite because you and i talked earlier this weekend and you said that you want to have a sensible conversation about gun control wayne lapierre the head of nra talked this week and i want to play a clip from what he said here he is begin video clip wayne lapierre ceo national rifle association one thing the american public always knows that the elites always protect themselves and they always protect themselves with guns and they lecture the american public how you shouldn apost do that end video clip wallace the reason i pick up on that is because you are in effect with saying the same thing about every clinton is that a sensible way to have this conversation to try to turn it into class warfare where you aposre for gun control somehow you aposre part of an elite cox it aposs not class warfare chris it aposs what the american people want the american people want to protect themselves they want to be able to defend themselves yes we aposre willing to have a conversation crosstalk wallace but wait no that aposs actually that aposs not actually true i mean yes second amendment but if you talk about background checks if you talk about automatic weapon well let me just say that there are a lot of people in fact a majority of people according to the polls would like to see those gun controls i aposm just i have to say i aposm put off at the argument that if you believe in gun control you aposre an elite i have to tell you mr cox i know very few people outside of public officials she was a former first lady she was former secretary of state who have armed bodyguards one of the few people i know private people who has armed bodyguards is wayne lapierre cox chris as a law abiding gun owner i am armed security but i couldn apost bring a gun into washington d c because my license gun because they won apost allow me to protect myself crosstalk wallace that aposs not my point sir crosstalk wallace my point is no my point is you cannot have a gun and you can believe in gun control because you think it aposs dangerous now we can argue about the merits of it but i think to dismiss people and say well that aposs just the elite and they have armed guards is it seems to me does a disservice to your argument cox it aposs the hypocrisy that bothers the american people chris it aposs the hypocrisy coming out of hollywood it aposs the hypocrisy coming out of politicians and it aposs the hypocrisy coming out of a lot of people in the media who refused to accept that law abiding people in between new york and los angeles and in between washington d c and miami deserve the right to defend themselves that aposs what the national rifle association exists for and look we can talk about background checks this murderer in las vegas passed them so did the gentleman or the murderer in orlando tucson aurora fort hood wallace let aposs talk about background checks and let aposs talk about specific issues because you aposre certainly right he did pass them and he brought all these guns legally there is a 72 hour limit on background checks and as a result some people call that the charleston loophole because dylann roof the man who bought a gun through a background check and then killed nine people in a church you can see his picture there he got the gun because the background check wasn apost complete in 72 hours even though he would have failed that background check question for you mr cox when it aposs a matter of life and death and i understand you don apost want background checks to go on forever that aposs not appropriate but when it aposs a matter of life and death couldn apost it be four days or five days and not three days and he gets his gun cox sure the national rifle association has worked to include every mental health record every court adjudication every criminal record to make sure that people don apost fall through the cracks the national rifle association wallace that aposs not that aposs not true sir cox that aposs absolutely true chris wallace no it isn apost forgive me in february president trump signed a measure that said that the social security administration no longer has to provide information on mental disorders to the national background criminal check and the nra supported that cox that is a complete misrepresentation of our position a complete misrepresentation of what president trump did what he said is you can apost arbitrarily deny a senior citizen their second amendment rights based on no finding of dangerousness the only finding was that they asked somebody to help them manage their financial affairs if you think that somebody needing help with a checkbook should eliminate them from exercising their second amendment then you under crosstalk wallace mental disorders now i agree it wasn apost everybody it was some people with mental disorders and you backed that cox their definition of a mental disorder was someone who asked for help handling their finances that is not a prohibitive category chris and it shouldn apost be a prohibitive category wallace let me ask you about another measure that has been talked about and before i do i want you to just watch this video here it is begin video clip gunfire inaudible unidentified male stay down end video clip wallace you hear that gunfire one reason that stephen paddock was able to fire so quickly so many shots so quickly was because he had a high capacity magazine he had a bunch of them that held between 60 and 100 rounds now i understand second amendment supreme court has ruled on it why do you need a magazine that holds 100 rounds cox there aposs no one in america who watches that video that aposs not horrified and nra members that were at that concert i aposm sure were more horrified than you and i were and so the question and it aposs a fair question and it aposs to ask if banning me from owning these sorts of things would prevent a criminal for going out and misusing them that is a fair question and what you have to do is look at what has congress done congress banned semiautomatics and high capacity magazines for 10 years 10 years and bill clinton aposs own justice department said it had no impact on crime california still bans those magazines but it didn apost prevent san bernardino or santa barbara in europe there aposs virtually entire bans on everything but it didn apost stop murderers using machine guns crosstalk wallace we aposre running out of time sir but even when you see that horrific video and he is firing this ph because of the bump stocks and it aposs because of the magazines that he is able to fire 100 rounds in a few seconds less than a minute no qualms about allowing people let me flip it around why should in 30 seconds if you will why do shooters need people to hunt to protect themselves why do they need magazines with 100 rounds in them cox people need first of all it aposs intentionally designed to scare people people own magazines of different capacities for different reasons wallace you know 10 rounds would be enough cox it depends on what you have it for it depends on what you have it for people can own things safely and responsibly and be a danger to no one and that aposs the part of this conversation it can apost be a fair and balance conversation if you aposre not willing to discuss the broader problems that we have with the violent culture coming out of hollywood with video games that fundamentally change how military simulators work wallace mr cox it aposs obviously we didn apost agree we aposre going to settle this in this short period of time thank you so much for coming in today please come back and we aposll continue the conversation cox i aposll look forward to it thanks chris wallace hopefully not as another one of these terrible tragedies up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss where things stand in the debate over gun control plus what would you like to ask the panel about chances for new gun laws in the wake of the las vegas massacre just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up secretary of state tillerson knocks down reports he considered quitting begin video clip rex tillerson secretary of state i serve at the appointment of thee president and i am here for as long as the president feels i can be useful to achieving his objectives end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the relationship between president trump and rex tillerson coming up commercial break begin video clip paul ryan r wis speaker of the house apparently this allows you to take a semiautomatic turn it into a fully automatic so clearly that aposs something that we need to look into sen dianne feinstein d california i hope senators will finally summon the political courage to stand up and say enough is enough end video clip wallace some rare bipartisan agreement this week from democratic senator dianne feinstein and house speaker paul ryan at least on the issue of bump stocks and it aposs time now for our sunday group former national security council staffer gillian turner columnist for the hill juan williams julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press and tom rogan of the washington examiner julie what do you make of republicans like paul ryan saying that they want to take a look at bump stocks is this the beginning of a conversation a broader conversation of gun controls or are they trying to limit it to this one device which is so hard to defend julie pace washington bureau chief the associated press i aposm not sure we aposre going to see any broader conversation on gun control i think the fact that republicans and the nra came out the white house as well came out and expressed an openness on bump stocks is certainly an interesting development because we rarely even see republicans go after some of the low hanging fruit on this gun control debate here i think that there aposs going to be a reluctance on the part of gop lawmakers to go any further on that certainly the nra would push back pretty aggressively if they started to do that but i think on this issue look there aposs not a huge constituency for bump stocks i think most people can agree that if you aposre going to take a device put it on a semi a legal semiautomatic weapon and turn it into a fully automatic weapon that that aposs something that needs to be addressed you have unanimity on that across the political spectrum wallace we asked you for question for the panel and on this issue of gun control in the wake of the las vegas massacre rick reuss tweeted this what conceivable gun legislation could have prevented the evil that occurred in las vegas tom as chris cox of the nra pointed out stephen paddock bought all these guns legally he passed all the background checks so how do you answer rick tom rogan washington examiner well i think the broader point here is that whether we aposre talking about this particular incident of gun violence or the broader issue of terrorism in the age of isis and i aposm not drawing connection between the two points but the relevance of potential mass casualty events makes them similar in terms of issue you could for example put in checkpoint at every major public event at every major hotel you could have personal inspections but the ultimate problem comes down to what measure of freedom of movement ease of movement are you willing to give up in return for a greater measure of security and ultimately that fixes right back to the second amendment debate i suspect what we will see here if you look at the two most recent supreme court cases on the second amendment heller and mcdonnell there aposs actually quite a lot of wiggle room there for local governments especially when it comes to the public carrying element to do things so i think it aposs going to down ph fast wallace yes we should point that out i did an interview some years ago with antonin scalia who wrote the heller decision and he specifically said there is an unfettered right to the second amendment but that doesn apost mean there can apost be gun controls reasonable sensible ones that don apost infringe all right let aposs turn to another hot topic the trump administration on friday announced broad new exceptions to the obamacare mandates on birth control the insurance plans have to provide contraception coverage to their employees here was president trump earlier talking about religious freedom begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we are ending the attack son your religious liberty and we are proudly reaffirming america aposs leadership role as a nation that protects religious freedom for everyone end video clip wallace gillian the religious right is delighted with this the president aposs decision and he aposs made several in this regard to say that employers for reasons either of religion or moral beliefs are not to be forced to provide birth control contraception to their employees on the other hand women aposs groups are incensed by this decision gillian turner former white house national security council and groups on the right look at this as a victory but i would caution the president and all republicans that chipping away at the affordable care act executive order one executive order at a time is going to be an awfully painful exercise over the next few years if we look at what chuck schumer said to the president last week over the phone which was allegedly repeal and replace is now dead for the final time wallace well let me back up and just for folks who don apost follow it like we do the president and schumer talked and the president talked about maybe we can do a deal with the democrats and then schumer said turner and then schumer said mr president repeal and replacing obamacare is officially dead it died its last death a couple of weeks ago if we take him at his word the president really has two paths forward one is reforming obamacare through executive action which is the option i refer to is going to be incredibly painful for everybody involved you can also try and cut a deal with dems i think the president is showing this week this past week that he aposs trying to pursue both those options at once i mean maybe he aposll forge a certain degree of success with congressional democrats on this but he aposs not going to get a deal that aposs going to replace repeal and replace obamacare whatever way we look at this going forward because of the republicans failure to get this done for the president it aposs going to be painful for him wallace juan i want to pick up on this because i aposm curious about the politics of it on the one hand look the president promised this on the campaign trail he aposs keeping a promise that helped get him elected on the other hand if you look at the polls most people support the idea of the provision of contraception so you know he aposs pleasing his base but he aposs turning off a majority of voters juan williams fox news political analyst yes but he aposs pleasing his base and it aposs an interesting political dynamic here chris because he aposs not only pulling the contraception mandate but he aposs also pulling money for the promotion of obamacare and to enroll people at this point so he aposs actively trying to undermine obamacare i think to make the case to schumer and the democrats this is imploding and you aposre going to come to me to want to make a deal to try to rescue it i think that is his bargaining position is with regard to the politics with the base the base has no wall they have no obamacare repeal they have a debt deal with chuck and nancy if you aposll recall i think there aposs a little bit of anxiety inside that white house with steve bannon gone about making sure that you are always playing to the base but i worry that it aposs less catering at this point than pandering to people who are i think misinformed about the consequences it aposs almost like trump is now saying you know what yes we didn apost get done what we promised you conservative base but we are still actively here trying to drain the swamp or disrupt things well has your life improved that aposs what ronald reagan asked is your life better off today than it was when i when wallace well that aposs not a rhetorical question williams no wallace some people would say the economy aposs doing pretty well williams oh yes and we lost jobs for the first time because of a hurricane wallace yes have you have you heard of harvey and irma williams yes but have you heard first time in seven years have you heard about a tax cut deal that benefits the rich disproportionately not the blue collar worker i think people will have to get that information at some point wallace tom rogan i think corporate tax reform this is one of the things that i think the president deserves courage on and house republican leaders it is not fashionable in the age of bernie sanders to say corporate tax reform but if you speak to economists investment productivity that is the key wallace i have to say only on our panel do we go from birth control to corporate tax reform without missing a beat we have to take a break here up next will president trump decertify the iran nuclear deal this week and what about his relationship with secretary of state rex tillerson commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states you guys know what this represents unidentified male inaudible trump i don apost know maybe it aposs the calm before the storm unidentified female what storm mr president trump you aposll find out end video clip wallace president trump raising a lot of questions during a photo op with his top military brass and we aposre back now with the panel well one thought about a possible storm is that the president may and in fact is expected to announce this week that he will decertify the iran deal say that it aposs no longer in the national interest but that doesn apost end the deal it then goes to congress and the congress has 60 days to decide whether or not they are going to re impose the sanctions that were lifted as part of the deal and if they don apost do that then guess what we aposre still in the deal which raises the question gillian what would that have ph step ph he decertifies but the sanctions stay lifted what would that accomplish turner well it aposs a sort of middle ground for the president which is why maybe he aposs going to go in this direction it aposs a middle ground in that it doesn apost kill the deal but it passes the buck to congress so the first reason i think the president is not going to recertify is that he enjoys nothing more than passing the buck to congress making them make these hard decisions like we saw with daca what will happen if he does not recertify iran aposs compliance with the jcpoa on october 15th wallace which is the iran deal turner the iran deal it hands it to congress and they have 60 days to debate and then make their own decision via a vote the second reason i don apost think he aposs going to recertify is that the albatross around his neck at this moment is every 90 days he aposs got to very publicly sign an agreement that shows iran has been complying with this deal it is something that is a thorn in his side on the foreign policy spectrum like nothing else it is an obama from president trump aposs perspective this is an obama era legacy he wallace so once he decertifies he aposs off that hook turner he aposs just itching itching to free himself from that pace this is exactly what we aposve heard that it aposs the act of having to certify every 90 days that trump actually has to sign a certification that is driving him crazy that that is one of the driving factors in this debate which is pretty amazing actually wallace defense secretary mattis testified before congress this week and he was asked the key question on this matter begin video clip sen angus king i maine do you believe it aposs in our national security interest at the present time to remain in the jcpoa that aposs a yes or no question james mattis defense secretary yes senator i do end video clip wallace you can tell how excited secretary mattis was to have to answer that question juan the president is apparently going against almost his entire senior national security team in making this decision to decertify why do you think that is williams well i think he aposs playing to the base we were talking about this a moment ago but i think that this is a very aggressive step to say listen to the base i promised you during the campaign that i would get rid of this iran deal i said it was the worst deal ever for the united states it was a rip off and i am going to act on my campaign promise because it aposs not only his inner circle and there aposs lots of reports this week that you know tillerson called him a moron and all that but also that tillerson kelly mattis have some kind of suicide pact where they said you know if he fires any one of us we aposre all going but that they are there because in the word of bob corker the head of the senate foreign relations committee a republican they act as a buffer they are stopping chaos in terms of our foreign policy from becoming imposed by the president it aposs a very intriguing situation but the president i think in this instance is playing to the base one more wallace yes we should point out those were the views of senator or the statement of senator corker not of the williams yes wallace ok speaking of splits between the president and top advisers let aposs talk about this split with rex tillerson there was a report this week that tillerson had seriously considered quitting over the summer and that at one point not to be president but to some other people he called the president a moron that led to this begin video clip rex tillerson secretary of state it continues to be misreported there has never been a consideration in my mind to leave donald trump president of the united states we have a very good relationship we disagree on a couple of things sometimes i aposd like him to be a little bit tougher but other than that we have a very good relationship end video clip wallace other than that i think my inaudible pace i mean that point nearly is the kiss of death from inaudible wallace what aposs really going on here and is tillerson out or not pace so this has been a complicated relationship for a long time months ago i had a senior administration official tell me that trump likes the idea of tillerson the businessman the texas swagger more than he actually liked tillerson himself he really gets annoyed at the way tillerson handles himself in meetings he doesn apost like the idea that tillerson especially on this north korea issue has been pushing this idea of diplomacy which he is the nation aposs top diplomat that is in general what he is supposed to do so this is highly complicated tillerson has been frustrated by being undermined by presidential tweets he aposs been frustrated that jared kushner has picked up a large part of the foreign policy portfolio and the big challenge for tillerson right now and i think the thing that i aposve heard that he is going to have to decide about in terms of his future here is what kind of juice does he have left with foreign government when he is traveling around the world when he is meeting with foreign leaders and he says this is a position of the united states government do they believe him anymore and frankly talking to diplomats around town they don apost always believe him wallace i want to pick up on exactly that point with you tom because whether tillerson stays or not you would think that his effectiveness as secretary of state has been dramatically diminished leaders around the world are watching all this play out and we aposve seen the president in the case of north korea as soon as tillerson said in china last week that we have avenues to talk to north korea the president tweeted don apost waste your time rex i mean rogan it aposs unity of message stupid would be the foreign policy equivalent of the famous line and that is so critical here because you know as julie suggests when foreign diplomats hear from american diplomats not just about tillerson right it aposs about all the foreign service officers in every embassy around the world if they are having those lunch meetings with foreign officials and journalists and they are not seen as credible in line with the president it aposs a huge problem but it aposs also a huge problem for president trump in the sense that if you talk about the iran deal now with that short window if he decertifies effectively to get the french crucially on board who may come on board with him about reforming the deal if they don apost trust the only guy who aposs in the room in paris with them secretary of state tillerson their willingness to say to all their domestic manufacturers who have those nice deals in iran hey by the way we aposre going to push on this but those manufacturers say then well you aposre talking to tillerson trump is tweeting tillerson aposs an idiot that that that that that is very hard diplomacy wallace you aposve got about 30 seconds turner if i if i may i believe secretary tillerson aposs future hinges on whether or not he did call president trump a moron and i mean this in a very specific sense if he did it will ultimately be made known to the president it is a fireball offense for any secretary of state throughout the course of u s history i aposm including people like henry kissinger here it is not something a secretary of state can survive and so all of the policy issues all of the disagreement will fall by the wayside and it will come down to whether or not there is proof that he spoke about the president inaudible wallace all right i aposve got i aposve got 10 seconds did he call him a moron or not pace i personally have not confirmed it but i will say i had someone point out that he aposs an eagle scout and he did not specifically deny it in his press conference wallace thank you panel see you next sunday that aposs boy scouts up next our power player of the week from the football field to outer space how a former astronaut is using his story to inspire others commercial break wallace only 362 americans have had the chance to fly into space but one astronaut is using his unique path there to inspire young people on their own journeys here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape leland melvin author chasing space no matter where you come from no matter what zip code you aposre in you know with grit with grace and perseverance and a lot of second chances you can do anything you put your mind to wallace leland melvin has gone to remarkable places including 374 orbits of our planet but it aposs his journey to get there that aposs the real story melvin my mother gave me a chemistry set when i was probably seven or eight years old it was a non osha certified age inappropriate chemistry set where i created the most incredible explosion in her living room wallace melvin was hooked he played football and won at scholarship to the university of richmond as a wide receiver but that was never his passion melvin i didn apost watch you know monday night football on the nfl i was doing chemistry labs so it wasn apost something that was my favorite thing but it was it was something that got me to college wallace football did more than that he was drafted to play in the nfl but even trying out for the dallas cowboys was a balancing act melvin by day i aposm catching footballs for america aposs team with danny white and all these people hershel walker and at night i aposm watching material science engineering videotapes and that was the hardest thing i aposve ever done in my life wallace a hamstring injury ended his football career melvin went back to school got his masters and became a research scientist at nasa then in 1998 he applied to be an astronaut melvin only a few of us have been in the nfl and been engineers at nasa and scientists at nasa and so i think that kind of differentiated me from some of the other candidates unidentified male so and liftoff of space shuttle atlantis wallace in 2008 melvin went on the first of two shuttle missions his role operating the robotic arm to install a lab on the international space station but he says orbiting the earth every 90 minutes made a more profound impression melvin you aposre connected to everyone as you go around the planet and so it aposs one of these things where my perspective shifted i wanted to come home and really help inspire that next generation wallace at a book fair in washington this summer melvin shared his life lesson melvin opportunities come to you but you have to be prepared for that opportunity and having that one person in your life all you need is one that has your back and believes in you wallace there aposs a big push these days for kids to study stem science technology engineering and math but melvin talks about steam adding thee arts melvin if you say that stem is the most important thing then you aposre leaving out the artists and the musicians and the creators that are that are truly part of anything that you aposre designing or building wallace melvin aposs book is called chasing space featuring a photo that aposs gone viral at him and his two dogs what he wants is for young people to chase blank whatever their passion is melvin when i share the story i share the experiences and a kid who was on a path of going maybe nowhere sees a spark and looks up in the night sky and one day i may watch them in my rocking chair heading off to mars that aposs what gets me so stoked end videotape wallace
