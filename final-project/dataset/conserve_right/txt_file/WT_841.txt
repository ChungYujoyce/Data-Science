tion of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump speaking in unusually somber tones told americans on tuesday to brace for a very very painful two weeks and begged them to stay at home as much as possible through april 30 saying 100 000 to 200 000 people could die from covid 19 despite his team s best efforts to fight the coronavirus and that they want to depress that number mr trump wanted to get the nation raring to go by easter but sobering models forced him to reverse course and plead with people to work and learn at home avoid nonessential travel and stay out of restaurants for additional weeks i want every american to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead mr trump said at the white house top stories hogan says maryland can begin testing residents for covid 19 without appointment symptoms trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick the president called for sacrifices as his coronavirus task force said the virus could kill far more americans than car crashes or influenza do each year as sobering a number as it is we should be prepared for it said anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases administration officials said the models are guided by epidemiology but aren t gospel actual outcomes will be guided by human behavior social distancing a term that has become part of the lexicon is going to be the answer to our problems dr fauci said mr trump said social distancing is working noting up to 2 million people might have died had the nation done nothing a hundred thousand is according to modeling a very low number mr trump said i think we re doing better than that still the estimates are sobering the notion of 100 000 to 200 000 fatalities is double triple or multitudes more than the number of deaths the u s would typically see from influenza and pneumonia in a given year mr trump is contending with the fallout in a year in which he hoped to ride economic optimism to reelection in november it s a matter of life and death frankly it s a matter of life and death the president said we had the greatest economy in the world we had the best unemployment and employment numbers by far the sober tone is a turnabout for mr trump who one week ago pressed to open up businesses noting the nation doesn t shut down for other drivers of death we lose thousands of people a year to the flu we never turn the country off we lose much more than that to automobile accidents we didn t call up the automobile companies and say stop making cars we don t want any cars any more he told a fox news virtual town hall on march 24 influenza kills from 12 000 to 61 000 people in the u s per year while car crashes kill roughly 35 000 to 40 000 according to federal data estimated covid 19 deaths don t come close to the annual u s death toll from heart disease or cancer each of which kills roughly 600 000 to 650 000 per year according to the centers for disease control and prevention still the daunting covid 19 estimate exceeds annual suicides at 47 000 or deaths from diabetes at more than 80 000 the pandemic has hit americans unevenly with some unable to make mortgage and rent payments and tapping food banks while others are revving up netflix and waiting to see whether they take a hit the president said everyone needs to do their part as health care workers brave the worst it s like military people going into battle going into war mr trump said the bravery is incredible you have lots of things flying around in the air you don t know what you re touching is it safe things are happening that we ve never seen before in this

the world with more than 185 000 and its death toll of over 3 800 exceeds that of china s although many doubt the official numbers from beijing recoveries in the u s total more than 6 900 according to the johns hopkins university tracker everyday life has been turned on its head parents are juggling telework with home school duties churches are streaming their services on youtube and restaurants

private hospitals in new york need to start coordinating more closely amid reports of facilities that are nearing or at capacity and that are suffering from stressed overworked employees he said private hospitals in the state have to help the public ones when they get up near capacity transfer patients elmhurst got up to capacity you had other public hospitals that had open beds mr cuomo said at his daily briefing on the outbreak elmhurst hospital in queens has become symbolic of the strained system mr trump recently described seeing haunting images of body bags being hauled out of the facility which is near his native home the crisis is hitting close to home for the new york governor his brother cnn host chris cuomo said tuesday he tested positive for the virus but said he will do his show from the basement of his family home new jersey has the second worst death toll at nearly 270 while michigan has emerged as a worry spot with nearly 6 500 cases and almost 200 deaths
