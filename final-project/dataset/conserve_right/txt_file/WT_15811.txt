apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion most of our elected representatives are used to having praise lavished upon them at regular intervals by minions and are considered the smartest people in the room whenever they speak perhaps that is why rep paul d tonko felt he would go unchallenged in writing that we cannot simply drill our way out of the energy crisis u s must reduce energy appetite letters friday in fact the united states has enough energy underground and offshore not only to match but surpass the middle east where energy is concerned mr tonko writes in his letter it is nearsighted to claim that president obama is deliberately blocking access to our nation s energy resources he then writes china invests twice what america does in creating clean energy jobs so what china has four times the population of the united states and i wonder if mr tonko counts among china s investments in clean energy the wind turbines they sell to this country top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore as for mr tonko s point that mr obama has proposed eliminating taxpayer giveaways to the big five oil companies which combined had a profit of 75 billion those oil companies paid about 22 billion in taxes on their profits in a vibrant economy one that is growing at a sustained rate of 4 percent annually our economy would double every 20 years that means all things being equal we will need 25 percent more energy every five years under the obama administration gas prices at the pump have gone up 50 percent in the past two years alternative energy technology is currently neither profitable nor viable yet the obama camp continues to try to ram it down our throats perhaps mr tonko should get on the phone with china and tell it to step up production because his current contentions aren t making sense dennis baker ma
