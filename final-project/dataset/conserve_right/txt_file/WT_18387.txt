e indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion north korea s outrageous and provocative threats to the united states and our allies japan and south korea have certainly had the intended effect of causing world attention to focus on the hermit kingdom and its new dear leader kim jong un it appears that the main purpose of these outbursts is to promote the young leader s image as a powerful military figure who can handle international crises for example last year when the united states announced an agreement to send food aid to north korea in exchange for close international monitoring of its nuclear program the new leader responded arrogantly by ordering the launch of a long range missile in violation of u n security council resolutions obviously food aid was canceled besides china the real power in pyongyang today and the driving force behind the orchestrated rise of north korea s new supreme leader is his aunt kim kyong hui she along with husband jang sung taek was chosen by her brother kim jong il before he died as the one to consolidate the son s authority it should be noted that jang sung taek is the vice chairman of the national defense commission and most importantly is the regime s key link with beijing in response to north korea s continuing threats and following its third nuclear weapon test on feb 12 with iranian technicians on site plus its deployment of medium range missiles the obama administration took some appropriate counteractions by flying b 52 bombers over south korea deploying stealth b 2 bombers and f 22 stealth fighters as well as moving two u s navy aegis abm capable destroyers off the coast of south korea the administration also announced plans to upgrade missile defense for guam and alaska top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning these moves were certainly welcomed by our western pacific allies but were quickly undercut by our announcement of how we would respond to an overt north korean aggressive act in effect we stated that our response would be limited to a proportional response in kind this defies logic why would you announce in advance how you would respond to an aggressive act by your enemy with essentially nothing to lose north korea cannot only control the engagement but the outcome when are we going to learn proportional responses in war don t work they only invite aggression you must keep your enemy off balance you must retain the initiative by creating a situation e g force posturing that if he takes aggressive action our response will be unpredictable but devastating the enemy must be made to realize that he has nothing to gain and that s how you maintain deterrence we further weakened our military demonstration of resolve by postponing an intercontinental ballistic missile test that we needed to conduct the reason given was that it may be seen as being provocative i would hope so but i am sure north korea viewed the announced postponement as a sign of weakness secretary of state john f kerry s visit to beijing on april 13 further undercut our military moves by offering to curtail the recent beefing up of our anti ballistic missile defenses if only north korea would abandoned its nuclear program this ineptness in statecraft bargaining is mind boggling what mr kerry obtained in beijing was nothing more than the old tired statement that the two countries announced that they endorsed the principle of a nuclear free korean peninsula china must be made to understand that their direct assistance to north korea s and iran s nuclear and missile programs is not only destabilizing but that we consider this assistance an unfriendly act and provocative i was meeting in beijing with gen liu huaqing china s top military officer when kim jong un s father took over after the death of his father eternal leader kim il sung and was making erratic statements the general told me don t worry nothing happens in north korea that we are not aware of since this control still exists i believe we should in our negotiations with china make it clear that if beijing actually wants a nuclear free peninsula they need to take some positive steps a good indication of their sincerity would be for them to withdraw the 16 wheel trucks they transferred to north korea so that they could launch their new missiles against the united states that would be a significant signal until china takes such a visibly constructive act we should not participate in any future six party talks other actions we should take include immediately rescind the proportional response in kind strategy announce that should north korea launch a missile in violation of u n security council sanctions we will intercept it as a target of opportunity announce that we are restoring the tactical nuclear armed tomahawk cruise missiles to our inventory it would be carried primarily by our nuclear submarines so that we have a secure tactical nuclear capability for too long we have let an illegal action stand we should demand that north korea return the uss pueblo an unarmed surveillance ship which was seized illegally in international waters in 1969 if it s not returned we will retain the option to destroy it if we take the above actions we will be along with our allies in a much stronger position to achieve our objectives of peace and stability in the western pacific we will also have sent a strong message to iran james a lyons u s navy retired admiral was commander in chief of the u s pacific
