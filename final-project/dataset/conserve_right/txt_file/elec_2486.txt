national review biden s middle class tax pledge envision a presidential campaign without handshakes rope lines or rallies expose the fraudulent trump russia plot at all levels apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions the consensus view on the right is that hillary clinton was a primary reason for donald trump s success in 2016 but not all conservatives agree about why that was for devotees of the trump as savior narrative clinton and all the allegedly nefarious forces at her beck and call was a uniquely formidable opponent defeating her required a different kind of republican one who d be willing to fight as dirty and as tough as the democrats this was a flight 93 election and trump was the hero we needed to storm the cockpit others on the right see it differently it wasn t so much that trump was the one person who could beat clinton but that she was the one candidate he could beat in other words it was only thanks to the fact that she was so unpopular that trump had a chance trump reluctant republicans and independents could be persuaded that he was better than clinton when presented with a binary choice the latter seems vastly more plausible for the simple reason that trump didn t have to convince those voters that clinton was unlikable and a little scary he simply had to exploit their pre existing opinion of her indeed trump s continued obsession with bashing clinton points to how central she is to his identity this has consequences for 2020 because the white house s entire strategy boils down to making trump s opponent more unlikable than he is if trump wasn t responsible for hillary s unfavorable numbers in the first place it remains to be seen whether he can hillaryize another democrat it may not be all that hard though because the democrats are doing everything they can to keep the flight 93 panic alive on the right they re doing this by running so far to the left that many trump skeptical republicans feel as if they have no choice but to vote for him again i hear this from my fellow conservatives every day democratic candidates have openly praised socialism the green new deal the abolition of private insurance voting rights for incarcerated felons federal funding of abortion late into pregnancy confiscatory wealth taxes and even the right to sex change operations paid for

i think clinton s true historical significance isn t being recognized again conservatives including yours truly invested a lot of time and energy in shaping public perceptions of clinton but the blame or credit doesn t just go to the right clinton herself did much to help the effort she was never the natural politician her husband was she lacked his gift for reading the electorate and speaking to voters concerns she collected all of her husband s baggage without any of her husband s skill at deflecting criticism she wasn t very likable this was a huge advantage for bernie sanders in 2016 he came way closer to beating clinton in the primaries than most people thought he would by tapping into the passion of the base and the frustrations of other democrats who didn t relish a clinton dynasty and disliked both hillary personally and the corrupt practices of the establishment she represented she ran on the implied claim that it was simply her turn to be president a poisonous framing in a populist moment just ask jeb bush in retrospect not being hillary was almost as big a boon for sanders as it was for trump if the clinton machine had not scared away more talented and resourceful politicians from running in 2016 it s possible that someone other than sanders would have captured the passion of the party just as obama did when he toppled hillary as the inevitable nominee in 2008 but that didn t happen and as a result the democratic party got the message that sanders style socialist populism was the key to success just as the gop has concluded that trump style nationalist populism is the future of the right sanders frustration at no longer being the undisputed voice of the base is palpable they said our ideas are crazy and wild and extreme he recently complained and now it turns out all of the other candidates are saying what we said four years ago he s right of course there are larger historical forces at work here but it sure looks like hillary clinton s candidacy was an inflection point because it galvanized not only the gop s turn toward nationalism but the democrats turn toward socialism she ll never be president but she s made history nonetheless
