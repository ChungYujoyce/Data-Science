country s president agreed publicly to investigate democrats according to a transcript of his closed door testimony released by impeachment investigators on wednesday taylor last month methodically recounted his conversations with other diplomats and expressed his concerns about the influence of the president s lawyer rudy giuliani on ukraine policy referring to his own detailed notes he has a

week top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time takeaways from the taylor transcript an irregular diplomatic channel taylor told investigators he began to realize after taking the top job in ukraine in may that were two diplomatic channels on ukraine one regular and an irregular one that was guided by mr giuliani the military aid and a meeting between trump and ukraine president volodymyr zelenskiy was blocked by the second channel taylor said the irregular channel included ukrainian envoy kurt volker european union ambassador gordon sondland energy secretary rick perry and giuliani taylor says the two channels eventually began to diverge in their goals as trump pushed for investigations of political rival joe biden s family and ukraine s role in the 2016 presidential election trump s calls for those probes and the delay in military assistance to ukraine are the center of the democrats investigation a clear understanding taylor told the investigators he understood that the military aid not just the white house meeting was conditioned on ukraine opening the investigations sondland had told him that everything was dependent on zelenskiy making such an announcement that was my clear understanding security assistance money would not come until the president committed to pursue the investigation taylor told the lawmakers even though sondland insisted after talking to trump that there was no quid pro quo taylor said he understood the reason for investigating burisma a gas company linked to joe biden s son was to cast vice president biden in a bad light and that it could help trump s reelection house intelligence chairman adam schiff d calif asked taylor in the questioning so if they don t do this they are not going to get that was your understanding yes sir taylor said are you aware that quid pro quo literally means this for that schiff asked i am taylor said wary of the job taylor recounts his own struggles with the decision to take the job in ukraine after trump had ordered the ouster of the previous ambassador marie yovanovitch he said he was worried about snake pits in washington and kyiv and raised his concerns with secretary of state mike pompeo as he was offered the job later in the summer after a few months in ukraine he told volker and sondland that he would quit if zelenskiy gave an interview promising the investigations trump had sought and then the military aid was never released in a text he described that scenario as his nightmare when asked to explain that text taylor told lawmakers the russians want to know how much support the ukrainians are going to get in general but also what kind of support from the americans so the russians are loving would love the humiliation of zelenskiy at the hand of the americans and would give the russians a freer hand and i would quit worries about military aid taylor said he decided at the encouragement of then national security adviser john bolton to write a cable to pompeo outlining his concerns about the holdup in military aid he did not get a reply but he was told that pompeo had brought the cable with him to at least one white house meeting at which the secretary argued in favor of releasing the aid to ukraine i know that secretary pompeo was working on this issue that he wanted it resolved taylor said i was getting more and more concerned that it wasn t getting resolved and so i wanted to add my concern and my arguments from the perspective of kyiv and the ukrainians about how important this assistance was taylor told the lawmakers that he wrote the cable in the first person which he thought would get pompeo s attention he also hinted in the cable that he might resign in the deposition taylor described the importance of the military aid that ukraine was receiving from the u s to fight the insurgency backed by russia in the east what we can say is that that radar and weapons and sniper rifles communication that saves lives it makes the ukrainians more effective it might even shorten the war focus on ukraine or greenland taylor testified that as he was pushing for the aid to ukraine to be released he was hearing from colleagues in washington that it was difficult to arrange a meeting with trump on the issue he said that may have had to do with travel schedules but also the president s keen interest in buying greenland from denmark which the national security council was looking into i think this was also about the time of the greenland question about purchasing greenland which took up a lot of energy in the nsc taylor told the lawmakers schiff responded okay that s disturbing for a whole different reason trump sparked a diplomatic dispute with u s ally denmark in august after he proposed that the u s buy greenland and the danish government rejected the idea gop pushback in a preview of the public hearing republicans criticized taylor by arguing that he received none of the information firsthand taylor says in the interview that he hadn t spoken directly to trump or giuliani rep lee zeldin r n y grilled taylor on whether he had primary knowledge that trump was demanding that ukraine investigate the bidens republicans also suggested in the interview that ukrainians wanted to help hillary clinton s campaign against trump in 2016 associated press writers colleen long lisa mascaro laurie kellman matthew
