tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn the white house released a memo of president donald trump s july 25 telephone conversation with ukraine s newly elected president volodymyr zelenskiy the white house says a memorandum of a telephone conversation is not a verbatim transcript it records the notes and recollections of situation room duty officers and national security council staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place the white house says a number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and or interpretation zelenskiy who took office in may spoke through a translator top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time trump congratulations on a great victory we all watched from the united states and you did a terrific job the way you came from behind somebody who wasn t given much of a chance and you ended up winning easily it s a fantastic achievement congratulations zelenskiy you are absolutely right mr president we did win big and we worked hard for this we worked a lot but i would like to confess to you that i had an opportunity to learn from you we used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our elections and yes it is true that these were unique elections we were in a unique situation that we were able to achieve a unique success i m able to tell you the following the first time you called me to congratulate me when i won my presidential election and the second time you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election i think i should run more often so you can call me more often and we can talk over the phone more often trump laughter that s a very good idea i think your country is very happy about that zelenskiy well yes to tell you the truth we are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country we brought in many many new people not the old politicians not the typical politicians because we want to have a new format and a new type of government you are a great teacher for us and in that trump well it s very nice of you to say that i will say that we do a lot for ukraine we spend a lot of effort and a lot of time much more than the european countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are germany does almost nothing for you all they do is talk and i think it s something that you should really ask them about when i was speaking to angela merkel she talks ukraine but she doesn t do anything a lot of the european countries are the same way so think it s something you want to look at but the united states has been very very good to ukraine i wouldn t say that it s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the united states has been very very good to ukraine zelenskiy yes you are absolutely right not only 100 but actually 1000 and i can tell you the following i did talk to angela merkel and i did meet with her i also met and talked with macron and i told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions they are not enforcing the sanctions they are not working as much as they should work for ukraine it turns out that even though logically the european union should be our biggest partner but technically the united states is a much bigger partner than the european union and i m very grateful to you for that because the united states is doing quite a lot for ukraine much more than the european union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the russian federation i would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense we are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more javelins from the united states for defense purposes trump i would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and ukraine knows a lot about it i would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with ukraine they say crowdstrike i guess you have one of your wealthy people the server they say ukraine has it there are a lot of things that went on the whole situation i think you are surrounding yourself with some of the same people i would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and i would like you to get to the bottom of it as you saw yesterday that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named robert mueller an incompetent performance but they say a lot of it started with ukraine whatever you can do it s very important that you do it if that s possible zelenskiy yes it is very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier for me as a president it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation we are ready to open a new page on cooperation in relations between the united states and ukraine for that purpose i just recalled our ambassador from united states and he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting closer i would also like and hope to see him having your trust and your confidence and have personal relations with you so we can cooperate even more so i will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with mr giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that mr g1uliani will be able to travel to ukraine and we will meet once he comes to ukraine i just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody but friends around us i will make sure that i surround myself with the best and most experienced people i also wanted to tell you that we are friends we are great friends and you mr president have friends in our country so we can continue our strategic partnership i also plan to surround myself with great people and in addition to that investigation i guarantee as the president of ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly that i can assure you trump good because i heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that s really unfair a lot of people are talking about that the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved mr giuliani is a highly respected man he was the mayor of new york city a great mayor and i would like him to call you i will ask him to call you along with the attorney general rudy very much knows what s happening and he is a very capable guy if you could speak to him that would be great the former ambassador from the united states the woman was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the ukraine were bad news so i just want to let you know that the other thing there s a lot of talk about biden s son that biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it it sounds horrible to me zelenskiy i wanted to tell you about the prosecutor first of all i understand and i m knowledgeable about the situation since we have won the absolute majority in our parliament the next prosecutor general will be 100 my person my candidate who will be approved by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in september he or she will look into the situation specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue the issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case on top of that i would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide to us it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country with regard to the ambassador to the united states from ukraine as far as i recall her name was ivanovich it was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because i agree with you 100 her attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous president and she was on his side she would not accept me as a new president well enough trump well she s going to go through some things i will have mr giuliani give you a call and i am also going to have attorney general barr call and we will get to the bottom of it i m sure you will figure it out i heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything your economy is going to get better and better i predict you have a lot of assets it s a great country i have many ukrainian friends their incredible people zelenskiy i would like to tell you that i also have quite a few ukrainian friends that live in the united states actually last time i traveled to the united states i stayed in new york near central park and i stayed at the trump tower i will talk to them and i hope to see them again in the future i also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the united states specifically washington dc on the other hand i also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation as to the economy there is much potential for our two countries and one of the issues that is very important for ukraine is energy independence i believe we can be very successful and cooperating on energy independence with united states we are already working on cooperation we are buying american oil but i am very hopeful for a future meeting we will have more time and more opportunities to discuss these opportunities and get to know each other better i would like to thank you very much for your support trump good well thank you very much and i appreciate that i will tell rudy and attorney general barr to call thank you whenever you would like to come to the white house feel free to call give us a date and we ll work that out i look forward to seeing you zelenskiy thank you very much i would be very happy to come and would be happy to meet with you personally and get to know you better i am looking forward to our meeting and also would like to invite you to visit ukraine and come to the city of kyiv which is a beautiful city we have a beautiful country which would welcome you on the other hand i believe that on september 1 we will be in poland and we can meet in poland hopefully after that it might be a very good idea for you to travel to ukraine we can either take my plane and go to ukraine or we can take your plane which is probably much better than mine trump okay we can work that out i look forward to seeing you in washington and maybe in poland because i think we are going to be there at that time zelenskiy thank you very much mr president trump congratulations on a fantastic job you ve done the whole world was watching i m not sure it was so much of an upse
