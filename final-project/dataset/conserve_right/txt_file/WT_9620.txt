tougher china policy called the asia pivot which seeks to bolster u s military forces and build up alliances in the region to counter china s growing military power and regional aggressiveness the advisers said the rebalancing toward asia is a mistake and that mr romney will not agree to support it as president mr talent in one meeting described the asia pivot as a fig leaf with no substance mr williamson in two separate talks in tampa revealed his admiration for clinton administration china hand kenneth lieberthal one of the most pro china national security officials of an administration that produced a china influence peddling scandal and the loss of nuclear warhead secrets to beijing through espionage mr williamson quoted his china expert friend mr lieberthal during one briefing readers of inside the ring will recall how mr lieberthal was taken to task by rep dana rohrabacher at a congressional hearing in 2008 when the california republican questioned mr lieberthal s credibility as a china expert because mr lieberthal acknowledged working for a major washington consultancy that had received money from china mr williamson at one point quoted mr lieberthal s book that praised president obama for his role in improving u s relations with china another off the record gop foreign aid session in tampa hosted by the international republican institute included mr williamson mr talent and former state department officials paula dobriansky and mitchell reiss who all spoke about mr romney s strategic priorities all of them said that foreign aid and the war on hiv aids in africa would be romney s highest priorities said one surprised participant no one listed china among the future priorities for a romney presidency the rise of liberal foreign policy advisers

romney on the campaign and leaving his consulting business salisbury strategies former u n ambassador john r bolton once called a special adviser to mr romney has more recently been described in appearances as an informal adviser to the candidate an apparent demotion two other romney advisers former senior pentagon officials dov zakheim and eric edelman did not appear at the tampa briefings an indication their influence with the campaign and the candidate may be fading none of the more than 20 conservative advisers listed on the romney campaign website was invited to speak in tampa although some provided briefings to the press one republican who took part in the tampa foreign and defense policy meetings said it appears there was a high level decision by the romney campaign staff to move left on foreign policy and leave conservatives high and dry although it is not clear mr romney is behind the shift other conservatives have voiced worries about mr romney s announced choice to run any presidential transition team that would be in charge of all key political appointments liberal republican and former world bank president robert b zoellick a target of conservatives since his days as a protege to james a baker former secretary of state and secretary of the treasury romney campaign spokesman alex wong declined to comment on the record about the liberal conservative shift obama mum on flexibility query president obamaset off a firestorm of controversy earlier this year after he was overheard telling russia s president that he and his negotiators will be ready to more easily negotiate an agreement on missile defenses after the november election rep michael r turner chairman of the house armed services strategic forces subcommittee wrote the president may 23 asking for an explanation and so far has received no response a turner aide said mr obama told dmitry medvedev that after my election i have more flexibility on missile defenses the comment picked up by news cameras and microphones triggered concerns among republicans that the president is planning to step up his disarmament oriented policy agenda if re elected mr turner stated in his letter that after initially contacting the white house about the troubling comments he was told the president was referring to the difficulty of negotiating an agreement with russia on missile defense during an election year the inference is that the american people may not like the deal your administration is planning to negotiate mr turner said if that is the case why make it at all what is it that you and your administration are concerned the american people would object to in such a deal with russia he asked would it be limitations unilateral or bilateral with russia on the speed range or geographical deployment of u s missile defense interceptors mr turner also said he is concerned with the president s apparent belief that missile defenses hinder u s nuclear arms cuts including plans to cut nuclear forces up to 80 percent under a pentagon nuclear posture review implementation study that was carried out in secret with no briefings to congress many in congress me included are deeply troubled that you may be willing to further trade or give away u s missile defenses to get closer to your goal of a world without nuclear weapons mr turner wrote many of the concerns could be put to rest if mr obama would direct his administration to share draft missile defense agreements that have been shared with the russians he said the failure to provide copies of the drafts does nothing to resolve concerns about just what your administration is prepared to offer to russia regarding missile defenses after your last election he said a national security council spokesman could not be reached for comment on the president s failure to respond to mr turner s letter china missile buildup a new report by taiwan s defense ministry says china has increased the number of cruise and ballistic missiles pointed at the island nation by more than 200 missiles china also has added new medium range df 16 missiles to the more than 1 600 missiles now targeting the democratically ruled state 100 miles from the communist mainland the annual 2012 china military power report released in taipei this week said a small number of df 16s were added to the hundreds of mobile short range df 11 and df 15 missiles within range of the island china has been building up its missile forces against taiwan for at least the past 15 years and the missile buildup is rarely mentioned by u s officials who likely fear raising the issue will upset china s military the report first reported by the taipei times on tuesday also said china has deployed its aircraft carrier killing df 21d anti ship ballistic missile that can overcome the difficult technical challenge of flying ballistically in space and having enough accuracy to hit a ship at sea hundreds of miles away the report stated that china has not slowed its large scale military buildup near taiwan despite improved relations between taipei and beijing the taiwan government report contrasts with the pentagon s annual report to congress on the chinese military which stated that as of october 2011 china had deployed between 1 000 and 1 200 short range missiles near taiwan it made no mention of the new df 16 medi
