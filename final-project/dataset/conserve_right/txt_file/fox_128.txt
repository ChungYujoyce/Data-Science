united states brett kavanaugh is one of the finest human beings you will ever have the privilege of knowing or meeting wallace president trump stands by his pick even after charges kavanaugh engaged in sexual abuse as a teenager plus trump we have great people in the department of justice we have great people but there aposs a lingering stench and we are going to get rid of that too wallace the president issues a warning following reports deputy attorney general rod rosenstein floated the idea of wearing a wire to record him we aposll have a live report and discuss what comes next on both fronts with lindsey graham a key member of the senate judiciary committee and we aposll get analysis from our sunday panel including bob woodward author of the bestselling book fear then as mr trump heads for the u n general assembly we talk with secretary of state mike pompeo the north koreans have not agreed to give up a single missile a single nuclear weapon and the escalating trade war with china how hard is president trump prepared to go in this face off with china and for how long and our power player of the week a soccer icon crosses the pond and makes a splash here in d c all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington well it looks like we aposll have a dramatic face off on capitol hill this week between supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh and the woman accusing him of sexual assault 36 years ago when they were both in high school christine blasey ford has tentatively agreed to testify before the senate judiciary committee on thursday but her lawyers and committee staff are still negotiating the details right now we can tell you about the latest fox news poll which shows this controversy has hurt public support for the judge when asked who do you believe 36 percent say the accuser ford while 30 percent say kavanaugh one third say they are unsure and when asked whether they support the judge aposs confirmation to the supreme court voters say no by a margin of ten points last month before the allegation the negative margin was just one point meanwhile there aposs another explosive controversy whether president trump will fire deputy attorney general rod rosenstein after reports that in may of 2017 rosenstein was so worried about mr trump aposs behavior he discussed wearing a wire to record the president and polling cabinet members about invoking the 25th amendment to remove him from office secretary of state mike pompeo became the first top administration official to speak on this when i interviewed him yesterday begin video clip mike pompeo secretary of state chris i aposm not going to comment on that in any way other than to say this i aposve been pretty clear since my beginning of service here in this administration if you can apost be on the team if you aposre not supporting this mission then maybe you aposve just got to find something else to do i aposve told that to my senior colleagues i aposve told this to junior folks at the cia and the state department we need everyone who aposs engaged in helping achieve president trump aposs mission and i hope that everyone in every agency doj fbi state department is on that mission and if you aposre not if you aposre not you should take this time to go do something more productive wallace and i assume that talk about wiring the president talking about the 25th amendment is not being on the team pompeo not remotely end video clip wallace we aposll have more of our interview with pompeo later this hour but first let aposs get the latest on all of these developments from fox news chief congressional correspondent mike emanuel on capitol hill mike mike emanuel fox news chief congressional correspondent chris while there aposs a tentative agreement for this hearing it is still not entirely clear if it will happen vice president pence says in the end the senate will confirm begin videotape mike pence vice president of the united states i believe that judge brett kavanaugh will soon be justice brett kavanaugh emanuel but first the effort continues to have christine blasey ford tell her story to lawmakers with kavanaugh given a chance to respond chairman grassley has threatened to go right to a committee vote on monday if there is no deal and a white house spokeswoman responding one week ago dr christine ford claimed she was assaulted at a house party attended by four others since then all four of these individuals have provided statements to the senate judiciary committee denying any knowledge of the incident or even having attended such a party then there aposs a controversy following the bombshell new york times report on deputy attorney general rod rosenstein advisors to mr trump are strongly urging the president not to follow through on threats to fire him rosenstein was quick to deny the report i never pursued or authorized recording the president and any suggestion that i have ever advocated for the removal of the president is absolutely false end videotape wallace on judge kavanaugh with a 51 49 republican majority the key will be keeping the gop unified chris wallace mike emanuel reporting from capitol hill mike thanks for that joining me now a key member of the judiciary committee republican senator lindsey graham we should note for the second week in a row we invited all 10 committee democrats to join us and for the second week none of them accepted and with that senator graham welcome back to fox news sunday sen lindsey graham r sc judiciary committee you must be mean laughter wallace well or they don apost want to talk what aposs the latest on negotiations over having this hearing what issues have been settled what issues are still outstanding and how close are you to getting fed up with the witness dictating to the committee the terms of her testimony graham well chairman grassley has bent over backwards to make this happen the offer is thursday at 10 00 she made 10 conditions through her lawyer we accepted six we are not going to turn over to the other side how many witnesses to call there will be two witnesses dr ford and then judge kavanaugh and we will hire our own counsel they contest those two things if they continue to contest those two things there won apost be a hearing if they really want to be heard they can be heard in a small room with a lot of security limited press availability she will be treated fairly but we aposre not going to turn the hearing over to her lawyers and we aposll see i hope she comes i will listen if she does wallace so are you saying the committee has basically given her a take it or leave it these are the conditions here are the conditions you either accept this or there will be no hearing graham she made 10 conditions a request for 10 conditions we gave six we aposre not going to let her determine how many people would call we aposre going to call dr ford and then mr kavanaugh is the way you would do it in any other condition and we will hire our own lawyers and that aposs it if they can apost accept that that means they really don apost want to testify judge kavanaugh is ready to go right now monday thursday anytime and here aposs what i told my colleagues this accusation has to be looked at in terms of our legal system it aposs too old for criminal trial it aposs 36 years old you couldn apost bring a civil suit because you can apost tell the court what time it happened and where it happened and if you try to get a warrant based on this you couldn apost get a warrant because the three people named by dr ford as having been at the party outside of kavanaugh all say they don apost know what she aposs talking about so you couldn apost go to criminal trial you couldn apost sue civilly you couldn apost even get a warrant but i will listen to what she has to say wallace i want to ask about one of these conditions or one of these things that you have rejected the idea that an outside counsel a woman will do the questioning for your side graham yes wallace is that your pure optics is that basically that the 11 men who were on the republican side of the judiciary committee don apost want to be seen as being disrespectful or insensitive to a woman who says that she was the victim of sexual abuse graham well you got 11 politicians who haven apost done a trial in about 20 years i thought it would be really smart to have somebody come in and knows what the hell they aposre doing to ask the questions to be respectful you know i don apost know what dr ford expected us to do with an anonymous letter if she wanted to stay anonymous those who betrayed her need to apologize but she will be treated respectfully but she will be challenged just like judge kavanaugh when i voted for sotomayor and kagan i wasn apost just a white male republican i was some kind of really smart wonderful person i know what the game is here i am no different now than i was then i may ask questions that i feel i need to but i think it would be smart to have a professional litigator do this give ms ford or dr ford a chance to be heard give judge kavanaugh a chance to be heard compare what she says with everything else in the record and i aposll make a decision wallace president trump was pretty restrained on this issue until friday when he tweeted this i have no doubt that if they attack on dr ford was as bad as she says charges would have been immediately filed if i ask that you bring those filings forward so that we can learn date time and place now you know and i know that ford has said that she didn apost say anything about this to anyone for decades and that brought with the president aposs tweet a sharp response from one of the few undecided key republican senators susan collins take a look begin video clip sen susan collins r maine i was appalled by the president aposs tweet we know the allegations of sexual assault are one of the most unreported crimes that exist so i thought that the president aposs tweet was completely inappropriate and wrong end video clip wallace senator does the president realize and frankly do you realize that if you aposre seen if all of you are seen as not treating this woman sensitively respectfully that this nomination could go down graham well here aposs what i do know i was a prosecutor defense attorney and a judge for every woman that comes forward regarding the allegation like this god only knows how many never come forward also know that sometimes people are accused of things they didn apost do i would advise the president to let us handle this it is very true that a lot of women get abused and take to their grave and every now and then you have a situation where people provide inaccurate information all i can say about this allegation it aposs too old for criminal trial you never bring a lawsuit because it aposs uncertain you couldn apost even get a warrant because the people who are supposedly validating what dr ford said wallace right graham all say they weren apost there they don apost know what she aposs talking about that aposs the context of this case wallace but meanwhile senate democrats a lot of the women say that you and your site have already insulted dr ford take a look at this begin video clip sen kirstein gillibrand d new york i consider that to be bullying i consider that to be disregarding i consider that to be something set up for failure sen mazie hirono d hi senate judiciary committee guess who aposs perpetuating all these kinds of actions it aposs the men in this country and i just want to say to the men in this country just shut up and step up end video clip wallace your reaction senator graham well senator scott and myself represent the people of south carolina we got elected by the men and women of our state i am not going to shut up with all due respect when i voted for sotomayor and kagan nobody on the other side told me to shut up they told me how fair i was how good i was all i would tell my colleagues i know you hate trump i aposm going to look at this from a prism of being reasonable and fair to judge kavanaugh everything i know about judge kavanaugh goes against this allegation i want to listen to dr ford i feel sorry for her i think she aposs being used here people in my view are using her if she truly wanted to be anonymous the person who brought this accusation to the public owe her an apology i will do the following listen to dr ford compare the two everything in the record and make a decision this accusation is 36 years old i don apost know when it happened i don apost know where it happened and all the people who have been named say it didn apost happen so these two senators have an agenda that aposs related to their hatred for president trump i aposm trying to be fair here and get this thing done in a reasonable way to judge kavanaugh as well as dr ford wallace senator i aposm sure some of the people listening to you would say you know several times now you aposve talked about how weak her cases how long ago it was the lack of details the lack of any corroborating evidence do you have an open mind on this and is there anything that dr ford could say that would persuade you to vote against kavanaugh aposs nomination honestly graham i want to i want to listen to her but i aposm being honest with you and everybody else what do you expect me to do you can apost bring it in a criminal court you would never so civilly you couldn apost even get a warrant what am i supposed to do go ahead and ruin this guy aposs life based on an accusation i don apost know when it happened i don apost know where it happened and everybody named in regard to being there said it didn apost happen i aposm just being honest unless there aposs something more no i aposm not going to ruin judge kavanaugh aposs life over this but she should come forward she should have her say she will be respectfully treated what did you expect us to do with an anonymous letter to begin with what do you expect somebody to do with an accusation this vague not verified wallace right graham in any way bring it forward i will listen but i aposm not going to play a game here and tell you this will wipe out his entire life because if nothing changes it won apost with me wallace i just want to point out is a fact and i want to move on because we are running out of time that there is no statute of limitations on sex assault cases in maryland so there are weaknesses with the case obviously but she could legally bring it i just want to turn graham well it would go nowhere wallace ok i want to return to reports that deputy attorney general rosenstein was so concerned about the president in may of 2017 that he reportedly talked about wearing a wire to tape the president pulling the cabinet about invoking the 25th amendment graham right wallace should one last question here should the president fire rosenstein and to what degree does this revelation taint compromise the investigation by the special counsel robert mueller whom rosenstein appointed him graham he shouldn apost fire rosenstein unless you believe rosenstein aposs line he said he did not do the things alleged but there is a bureaucratic coup against president trump being discovered here before the election the people in question tried to taint the election tip it to clinton aposs favor after the election they are trying to undermine the president i don apost know what rosenstein did but i know what mccabe ohr page and strzok did they tried to destroy this president if rosenstein is involved he should be fired if he is not involved leave him alone but he can make that decision we need a special counsel to look at this not mr horwitz the i g rosenstein is doing the country a great disservice by not appointing a special counsel to look at all of this wallace and when you say all of this you are talking about the fbi aposs behavior in investigating the president and as far as robert mueller is concerned does that investigation go forward graham it goes forward as far as i know there aposs nothing connected to mr mueller but during the campaign it aposs clearly the department of justice the fbi was tipping the scales for clinton this revelation after president trump was sworn in shows they were trying to undermine the election there aposs a bureaucratic coup going on at the department of justice and the fbi and somebody needs to look at it wallace senator graham thank you thanks for your time graham thank you wallace we aposll follow whatever happens with the judiciary committee this week graham thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss those reports rod rosenstein had such serious doubts about president trump aposs fitness he discussed ways to remove him from office plus what would you like to ask the panel about the accusation of sexual misconduct against judge brett kavanaugh just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip debra katz attorney for christine blasey ford she clearly considers this an attempted rape she believes that if it were not for the severe intoxication of brett kavanaugh she would have been raped trump if she shows up and make a credible showing that will be interesting and we aposll have to make a decision end video clip wallace the lawyer for christine blasey ford and president trump on the allegation of sexual assault that now threatens judge brett kavanaugh aposs nomination to the supreme court and it aposs time now for our sunday group katie pavlich from townhall com juan williams columnist for the hill and author of the new book what the hell do you have to lose from the washington post bob woodward author of the bestseller fear trump in the white house and fox news correspondent gillian turner who has no book to hawk this week gillian turner fox news correspondent well may be i aposm working on one wallace well ok then we will put that book up all right bob where you think the kavanaugh nomination stands now and assuming we have this hearing what aposs going to determine whether or not he gets confirmed to the supreme court bob woodward the washington post what a moment where is cecil b demille the great filmmaker i mean 1952 he did a movie called about a circus called the greatest show on earth this is about what we are going to experience i think the good news for both sides is i think this little known senator grassley is a real advocate of whistle blowers he aposs been the person behind all these acts and so he aposs going to make sure that both of them get to do it in an open kind of fair minded way i think he aposs very sensitive to dr ford aposs position on this he aposs given speeches about the retribution that can be visited on the whistle blower so in a sense not perfect but she aposs got significant protection wallace and she has gotten at least five or six concessions from the committee so far in terms of well what day it aposs going to be held the conditions under which it aposs going to be held but i think it aposs important to note that lindsey graham made it clear this is not a done deal yet we ask you for questions on the panel and on this accusation of sexual misconduct against judge kavanaugh we got this on facebook from glenn dutra why is the committee letting the democrats and her lawyers call all the shots about the hearing katie how do you answer that katie pavlich townhall com well it aposs is a very sensitive issue and as bob said senator grassley has dedicated his entire career to protecting people who come forward with accusations in a way that can be credible meaningful listen to if the problem here is christine blasey ford aposs attorneys have turned this into a game the majority on the senate judiciary committee has done everything possible to make those happen they aposve given multiple extensions and as you just said they agree to showing up for hearing but they also say that there are details that have to be worked out now last week the details of those concessions were brett kavanaugh testifying first unable to respond to the accusation or testifying without him in the room there are still things that have to be worked out in terms of where you go from here and the bottom line is because our attorneys have turned this into a political game we don apost know a lot about the accuser but we sure know a lot about wearing her attorneys are coming from republicans are going to have to make a decision about when that ultimate deadline is and if they aposre going to move forward with the hearing or the vote and her attorneys have the ball is in their court when it comes to whether she aposs going to testify ahead of that boat wallace but gillian in this metoo era no matter how fair or unfair the demands are if the republican majority 11 men are seen as cutting off and preventing this woman from telling her story that aposs going to be political dynamite isn apost it turner everybody saying they want hearings both sides are eager chomping at the bit for a hearing and for her to testify but there aposs a lot of downside and not a lot of upside for both republicans and democrats here i aposd say that when it comes to the politics chuck grassley seat might not be on the line in november but he is the most vulnerable lawmaker on capitol hill right now his late night tweet storm on friday uncharacteristically beleaguered sounding underscores wallace like a second trombone of the band turner exactly very uncharacteristic for him and i think underscores the catch 22 of the situation he aposs in politically the democrats are going to be angry at him no matter how he handles this i think the maga crowd was they aposre angry at him because they feel now he aposs being spineless and then the anti conservatives feel that he aposs turning his back on a core principle i guess as they aposve described it as the principle that the accused doesn apost have to bear the responsibility of proving your innocence so it aposs a loss loss for him wallace let aposs turn to the other big story this week and that is the report in the new york times that in may of 2017 shortly after he took office that rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general was so concerned about donald trump aposs behavior that he talked to some of his colleagues at justice and the fbi about wearing a wire to secretly tape the president and also polling cabinet members about invoking the 25th amendment to the constitution to unseat him here aposs the one thing that president trump has said about this so far begin video clip trump you aposve seen what happened at the fbi they aposre all gone they aposre all gone they aposre all gone but there aposs a lingering stench and we are going to get rid of that too end video clip wallace juan what you do make of this story and what do you think the president is going to do when he talks about that lingering stench juan williams fox news political analyst well the real news here is that the president has authorized release of this fisa document releases of also some of these emails these transactions that aposs how we know about the mccabe email that suggests that rod rosenstein was looking at the 25th amendment or taping secretly taping the president i think it aposs a fool aposs errand for a journalist to speculate as to is it right is it wrong but i will note this there aposs no evidence that he actually pursued or actually did it you will note in the statement he said i never authorized or pursued such activity so if that becomes clear that in fact he is lying about it than that something else but my point to you is this the president wants that fisa document released a lot of his supporters especially the hard right people in the freedom caucus of the house devin nunes and others have pushed this idea get it out there because it would therefore justify the president going after this investigation not only firing rosenstein but remember he just tweeted this week he doesn apost have an attorney general he aposs still going after jeff sessions for not reining this thing in so he aposs after rosenstein he aposs after sessions and i think is actually damaging the credibility ultimately of robert mueller wallace bob there is this dispute and frankly different papers in town are on different sides of this issue whether or not rosenstein he apparently said it at least the part about wearing the wire if there aposs a question as to whether he was serious or whether he was being sarcastic but i have to say on the overall issue of concern and to some degree in chaos or disarray in the white house this reads like a chapter right out of your book woodward it does but the whole question and this is the great advantage of working long term on a book like this you can check and you can talk to enough people was he joking or was he not and the key issue was action taken and i aposve seen no evidence that action was taken but on this business of the fbi and the justice department and you had lindsey graham saying let aposs have another special counsel to investigate oh that aposs exactly what we need another special counsel to get to the bottom of things there is at the same time a smell about all of this and what the fbi has done in the justice department does not have clean hands but we can apost live in an environment where we are going to solve all of our problems with massive special counsel investigations you really have to let somebody kind of clean house and figure this out wallace all right we have to take a break here we aposll see you all a little later when we come back our interview with secretary of state mike pompeo we discussed some other big issues north korea china iran and the president aposs controversial order to declassify key documents in the russia o investigation commercial break wallace coming up we asked secretary of state mike pompeo how president trump plans to deal with north korea china and iran ahead of the u n general assembly in new york begin video clip wallace do you have any plans or does the president have any plans to meet with iranian officials this next week end video clip wallace much more of our interview with the secretary of state next on fox news sunday commercial break wallace president trump heads to the united nations tomorrow to spend the week meeting with world leaders on his plate north korea china and iran ahead of his trip we went to the state department yesterday to discuss global tensions with secretary of state mike pompeo begin videotape wallace mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday mike pompeo secretary of state it aposs great to be with you chris wallace this week north korean leader kim jong un talked about dismantling missile test sites nuclear fuel facilities president trump called it very positive begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we had very good news from north korea south korea they met and we had some great responses where making tremendous progress with respect to north korea end video clip wallace but the north koreans have not agreed to give up a single missile a single nuclear weapon nor are they giving us the inventory of their arsenal is that tremendous progress pompeo you have to step back to where we began this administration with a well developed program inside of north korea we have now achieved the ceasing of missile testing the ceasing of nuclear testing we have gotten the remains of 55 americans we aposre in deep discussions about how to proceed with respect to denuclearization president moon traveled to pyongyang for the third time this past week and made progress we aposre continuing to make progress these are all the right steps forward it aposs the right path and we aposve made clear to the world that the economic sanctions the pressure that has caused chairman kim to come as far as he has come to date will remain in effect until denuclearization occurs and so we aposre hard at it president trump has given me the task to use our entire diplomatic team to achieve the outcome that the world has demanded through u n security council resolutions we aposll talk a lot about that in the week ahead in new york wallace but again you talked about denuclearization they haven apost given up a single nuclear weapon or missile or an inventory and now they aposre talking in the meeting the summit with south korean president moon they talked about quote corresponding measures such as a treaty to end the korean war one is that on the table and two whatever happened to the position of the administration that north korea has to get rid of all of its arsenal before we give any concessions pompeo the administration aposs position hasn apost changed one jot ph from the time we entered this discussion we are working diligently to achieve many of the outcomes that you describe we aposve at extended conversations about this i don apost want to get into the details of the negotiation that are underway but we aposve talked about particular facilities particular weapons systems those conversations are underway and we are hopeful that we can deliver this outcome for the world wallace but to get to this point about corresponding measures you say the position hasn apost changed one bit does that mean they have to get rid of their entire nuclear arsenal and missiles before we take we give concessions for instance a peace treaty pompeo everybody aposs got their own idea of what a concession might be some thought it was a concession for president trump to go to singapore i certainly didn apost think so president trump doesn apost but what we aposve make clear is the economic sanctions the driving force to achieve the outcome we aposre looking for will not be released the u n security council will not reduce those sanctions until such time as we aposve achieved that final denuclearization wallace i i want to pick up on that because the south koreans are already talking about renewing economic relations with south korea the russians and the chinese are looking the other way there aposs been apparently rampant smuggling of oil fuel into south korea isn apost the u s policy of maximum pressure on north korea isn apost that releasing its grip pompeo absolutely not i mean i aposve just i hear i aposve read what you should you should be very careful about everything that you read in the press around the world the entire u n security council remains committed to enforcing the u n security council resolutions i am confident we will renew that and renew the commitments to that in the week ahead it aposs one of the things we aposll talk a great deal about to to a country every nation has told me personally they remain committed to enforcing the u n security council resolutions wallace let aposs turn to china where we are on the verge of a major trade war the u s has imposed sanctions or tariffs on 250 billion of chinese imports the chinese have retaliated they have just announced they aposre pulling out of a new round of trade talks this week how hard is president trump prepared to go in this face off with china and for how long pompeo we know this much the trade war on by china against the united states has been going on for years and here aposs what aposs different in this administration to the extent one wants to call this a trade war we are determined to win it you know i i ran a small business in kansas before i came to congress i saw how companies were treated differently when they attempted to do business whether they were trying to sell goods into china or to purchase goods to export from china i watched how american companies were treated unfairly differently a different set of rules if they wanted to invest in my business in kansas they could have had i wanted to invest in a chinese supplier there i couldn apost these are fundamentally unfair the american people know that and president trump aposs going to fix it wallace when you say he aposs you aposre going to win it pompeo yes we aposre going to win it wallace as long as it takes pompeo we aposre going to win it we aposre going to get an outcome which forces china to behave in a way that if you want to be a power a global power transparency rule of law you don apost steal intellectual property the fundamental principles of trade around the world fairness reciprocity those of the things president trump has told his counterpart there who he very much likes those are the things the american people are demanding and the american workers deserve wallace president trump announced this week that he aposs reducing the number of refugees that will be allowed into this country from 45 000 this year to 30 000 next year which would be the lowest cap since the refugee program began in 1980 now take for instance syria there are 5 million syrian refugees now in the middle east the u s has allowed only 60 syrian refugees into this country this fiscal year which ends next week is that this administration aposs idea of compassion pompeo chris this country has been the most generous nation in all of recorded civilization with respect to taking refugees from around the world and admitting people from outside of the united states it continues to be so under president trump and will be during our administration let aposs talk about the refugees in syria the best place for those refugees to go back to would be to their homes it aposs where they want to go we aposve provided billions of dollars in aid in humanitarian aid all around the world in the trump administration and we aposve let in over 4 million people to our country over the past two decades this is a generous nation to focus just on this legal term refugees on this notion of refugees doesn apost encompass the full scope of american generosity second point president trump is also committed to making sure america aposs secure and the vetting that aposs taking place is important it reduces risk in the american homeland and then finally the work that we aposve done to get our allies to share this burden we now have hundreds of millions of dollars coming in from gulf states to support syrian reconstruction and redevelopment things that never happened this was good work driven by the president led by american diplomacy to get other countries to share the burden of making sure that these refugees are well taken care of wallace new subject this week the president ordered the release of previously classified documents about the russia investigation that release has been delayed at least temporarily but he says they show that the russia probe began as a hoax begin video clip donald trump president of the united states it aposs a terrible witch hunt and it aposs hurt our country and the things that have been found over the last couple of weeks about text messages back and forth are a disgrace to our nation end video clip wallace you were cia director until just this may did you see any legitimate reason to investigate ties between any trump associates and the kremlin did you see any legitimate basis to surveilled carter page pompeo i aposve consistently said i aposm not going to talk about the investigation i had the role of cia director and so i don apost have anything to add to that today wallace but can you tell us whether or not it was a hoax or whether there were legitimate national security concerns pompeo well i aposve been very clear we have real risk to outside agents trying to do harm to america there aposs no mistake about that there are many countries seeking to meddle in our elections the chinese the iranians the north koreans and certainly what the russia did in 2016 are all clear indications that there are those who want to undermine american democracy and we have an obligation both the intelligence community our military our diplomats all of the u s government to prevent that from ever happening wallace finally there was an attack on a military parade in iran this weekend in which at least 24 people were killed and your iranian counterpart foreign minister zarif blames it on the u s did the u s play any role in that attack and do you have any plans or does the president have any plans to meet with iranian officials this next week at the u n general assembly pompeo well i will take your second question first i don apost know that there are any plans to date the president aposs been pretty clear if there are constructive conversations to be had with the iranians the president is happy to have them he aposd be willing to do so wallace even with president rouhani this week pompeo well you know the leader of the country is ayatollah khamenei that aposs who aposs running the show in iran i think i think that would be an important and interesting conversation with respect to wallace wait wait wait i mean are you just is that talk or are you just saying you would like the president would like to meet with the ayatollah pompeo the president has said he aposll talk with anyone if we can have a constructive conversation we want iran to stop being the large the world aposs largest state sponsor of terror but make no mistake about it there aposs no indication that they have any intent of doing this just this past couple of weeks they aposve come after american interests inside of iraq in basra and in baghdad and with respect to the attacks overnight i saw the comments of zarif when you have a security incident at home blaming others is an enormous mistake and the loss of innocent lives is tragic and i wish zarif would focus on keeping his own people secure rather than causing insecurity all around the world wallace mr secretary thank you pompeo thank you chris wallace good luck this next week at the u n pompeo thank you sir end videotape wallace up next we aposll bring back our sunday panel to discuss secretary pompeo aposs tough talk about a number of trouble spots and more from our latest fox news poll how does the battle for control of congress look just six weeks before the midterms commercial break begin video clip mike pompeo secretary of state the trade war on by china against the united states has been going on for years here aposs what aposs different in this administration to the extent one wants to call this a trade war we are determined to win it end video clip wallace secretary of state pompeo talking tough about china in our interview that also covered north korea and iran and we aposre back now with the panel gillian as our foreign policy expert that i aposve now offended everybody else gillian turner fox news correspondent without a book wallace on the panel without a book what stands out for you not just china of all the things that pompeo said turner pompeo continued a thread that aposs been it started two weeks ago when bolton appeared at the federalist society gave his first big speech as national security advisor it continued through nikki haley aposs interviews last week and now your sit down with pompeo today and that is the administration is really hitting the reset button they aposre going back to square one just in time for unga which is return to america for wallace u n general assembly turner the u n general assembly return to this emphasis on america first the message is loud and clear everybody aposs on the same same page it aposs as if all of the cabinet went to the same briefing took the same exact notes and they said right north korea china russia all of these issues we aposre facing unilaterally but we have to remind the american people know at one and a half years in that it aposs america first and pompeo really hit that hit that high note on every single one of the issues you asked him about today so that jumped out at me wallace bob you write a lot in your book fear about president trump aposs attitude towards north korea i thought there was an interesting interesting that for all the things that kim jong un has not done since the singapore summit pompeo clearly wanted to accentuate the positive bob woodward the washington post well he did but in the book i spent a lot of time on north korea because as president obama told president trump as he was coming in this is what will keep you up at night and it aposs a very serious matter and there almost was a war i mean i lay it out it was frightening and that people in the pentagon were horrified that president trump was thinking about withdrawing dependents in south korea because there was a back channel message to the white house saying if you do that that will be a signal that war is imminent so that didn apost happen i think pompeo aposs right we aposre talking so much better to be talking the intelligence people say in a very direct way north korea is not going to get rid of their nuclear weapons because that aposs their leverage but to keep the dialogue and if it aposs a path that takes decades fine wallace i want to go back to the fox news poll because with just 44 days until the midterms there aposs some very interesting numbers in the poll let aposs put them up on the generic ballot question who do you back in your district 49 percent of likely voters now say the democratic candidate 42 percent say the republican so democrats plus seven and this may be a big reason why when asked which issues are extremely important to them 55 percent say a candidate who shares their view on health care followed by taxes immigration and president trump and on the top issue there aposs growing support excuse me there aposs growing support for obamacare thirty six percent now say the law went too far you can see that aposs down by 12 points but 51 percent say obamacare is about right or didn apost go far enough katie what do you make of those numbers katie pavlich townhall com editor and there aposs also a number showing that 64 percent of people think that they want more people insured even if it cost the government more money which goes in the direction of what democrats have been arguing for for years when it comes to the economy the problem for republicans is they have been campaigning on tax reform saying that more people have money in their pockets that is true but according to this polling the majority of people do not feel there aposs been an increase in their own personal experience with having more money for their families as a result of tax reform and about a third of voters say that it aposs made no difference in the economy that aposs a big problem because republicans that aposs been the main message from republicans that aposs what they aposve been doing on capitol hill next week republicans are planning to vote in the house on tax reform 2 0 and so they aposre going to have to come up with some other kind of economic message and a solution to health care because they tried to pin that on obama rightfully so but as a result of the failures to repeal and replace it and the lack of action on that throughout the last year with new premium increases coming republicans now share some of the blame for the problems with inaudible wallace so if you aposre a republican congressman or a republican campaign consultant how worried are you by this poll pavlich i think pretty worried you know the generic polling early on in the year you know you kind of dismiss because it aposs so early but we are getting close to election day the time for changing narratives is is very much closing rapidly at this point but we aposll see on election day whether voters come out on the democratic side they have a very difficult time getting voters out in midterms republicans i think are enthused by this kavanaugh fight republicans seeing barack obama out on the campaign trail and trump voters who he aposs seemingly got after for voting for trump are enthused to come out so in the end going to be all about turnout wallace juan your reaction to the numbers and also very strong numbers in support of robert mueller aposs investigation let him take the time to do it right and yes we support his investigating this juan williams fox news political analyst well i think you know we aposre at a critical moment here you saw for example the paul manafort plea and now he aposs cooperating with authorities this week we saw were michael cohen another one of the president aposs intimates his personal attorney for a time also is now talking after pleading guilty to charges in new york so i think that there aposs a moment here where the american people are making a judgment they see that in fact the mueller investigation is netting a number of not only indictments but guilty pleas and i think that aposs why you see the continuing support for mueller and for giving him additional time you know that the president aposs lawyers had been pushing for somehow some kind of resolution before the midterms well that hasn apost happened i don apost know if they were trying to comfort the president and calm him down but clearly the american people think mueller should have enough time to get this job done by the way i thought mike pompeo did a better job than vladimir putin in answering your questions i thought he was pretty smart but the problem is for mike pompeo wallace i can see that as his inaudible mike pompeo better than putin williams well i give him my endorsement but i aposm going to say that i think mike pompeo has the unenviable task of dealing with north korea no real accomplishment trade deals no real accomplishment troops still in afghanistan it aposs a trump foreign policy that aposs come up empty even for trump supporters wallace and let me just say that was simply the opinion of juan williams and not necessarily williams right oh no not not the owner of the ship wallace i i just steer it try to steer this ship and keep it from going on the on the rocks thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the most famous world sports star you may have never heard

premier league at age 16 the next year he was on the english national team and at age 18 the legendary manchester united bought his rights for 35 million rooney just hunger and love of the game i
