administration on thursday did sanction two chinese shipping companies suspected of helping north korea evade sanctions but not the country itself so what was trump referring to the white house wouldn t say press secretary sarah sanders issued only a brief statement saying that trump likes north korean leader kim jong un and doesn t think these sanctions will be necessary but a person familiar with the action later told the associated press that trump s tweet was not about reversing existing sanctions instead the person said the president was talking about not going forward with additional large scale sanctions on north korea at this time the person was not authorized to discuss the president s comments and spoke on condition of anonymity it was the latest example of the confusion sometimes sparked by trump s governance by tweet which has often sent agency heads scrambling trying to figure out what he meant or trying to implement policy proclamations that have not gone through
