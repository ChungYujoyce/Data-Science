ecomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn president trump urged venezuela s military leaders monday to turn on leader nicolas maduro casting the struggle in the troubled south american nation as a major test of whether the world can rid itself of a socialist stumbling block speaking in miami the president also connected venezuela to cuba saying mr maduro has become a puppet of the communist regime in havana he accused mr maduro of denying his people medicine and other life sustaining assistance to prop up his government and he told venezuelan generals they will lose everything unless they reject mr maduro and back national assembly leader juan guaido whom the u s recognizes as the president see also maduro dismisses trump s almost nazi style speech the eyes of the entire world are upon you today every day and every day in the future you cannot hide from the choice that now confronts you mr trump said in a speech to the venezuelan expat community at florida international university about 80 miles south of his mar a lago estate while ostensibly aimed at south americans whose cooperation is needed to oust mr maduro his remarks were also clearly aimed at a domestic audience of venezuelan exiles who chafed at mr maduro s policies and now live in florida a critical swing state their presence in the state has ballooned over the past five years reaching an estimated 36 000 registered voters according to one bloomberg report they are seen by republicans as sort of the next cubans in terms of support said susan macmanus a politics professor emerita at the university of south florida while democrats focus on mexican americans seething over mr trump s border wall or family separation policy or puerto ricans upset with the administration s approach to hurricane maria recovery efforts the president is expanding the gop s courtship of exiles from despotic regimes in latin america more than once mr trump cross referenced venezuelans cubans and nicaraguans as people who fled oppression in pursuit of american liberty and cheered the resistance movement in venezuela they are risking their lives and venezuela s future for a man controlled by the cuban military and protected by a private army of cuban soldiers mr trump said maduro is not a venezuelan patriot he is a cuban puppet that s what he is alfonso aguilar president of the latino partnership for conservative principles said there s good reason for mr trump to single out those nations it highlights once again the hispanic community is not monolithic he said it s being smart he s identifying constituencies within the hispanic community he can win it also aligns perfectly with mr trump s new favorite target of the 2020 election the democratic party s increasing openness to socialist style expansion of government services mr trump said venezuela is an example of socialist failure a new day is coming in latin america the president told an adoring crowd socialism is dying and liberty prosperity and democracy are being reborn venezuelans rank roughly sixth in terms of latino hispanic blocs in florida trailing cubans puerto ricans mexicans and colombians and nearly tied with dominicans according to ms macmanus mr aguilar said many venezuelans are settling in miami dade county a competitive area and while it s not a huge electoral bloc overall it s big enough in a close election it can make a huge difference he said florida has been ground zero for close elections with george w bush s razor thin victory over al gore in 2000 and mr trump s 2016 win by only a little more than 1 percent over hillary clinton in november sen rick scott and gov ron desantis both republicans each won by less than 1 percentage point underscoring the pivotal role the emerging venezuelan bloc may play alongside cubans colombians or nicaraguans who fled similar circumstances they voted republican in the governor s race ms macmanus said mr desantis had a strong anti socialist platform that was well articulated in southern florida mr trump isn t the only u s politician entering the fray in venezuela currently sen marco rubio and rep mario diaz balart both republicans visited a town on the colombia venezuela border where international aid is being held up by mr maduro who fears the cargo of food and medicine is a pretext for u s intervention mr rubio on sunday tweeted pictures of overturned trucks and large containers that blocked the route into venezuela mr aguilar for one said he is surprised the growing field of democratic primary candidates haven t made the venezuela situation as big of an issue as the president or specific democrats such as sen robert menendez of new jersey who are speaking out but aren t on the ballot in 2020 they re leaving a vacuum that s going to cost them mr aguilar said some florida democrats did speak up monday however calling on mr trump to grant temporary protected status or tps to venezuelans fleeing mr maduro s regime tps allows migrants who flee natural disasters armed conflicts or other awful conditions to stay in the u s legally for a time latin american nations have been among the biggest beneficiaries with some 200 000 salvadorans still in the u s under tps 18 years after a series of earthquakes struck their home country but the trump administration has taken a dim view of tps attempting to finally end status for the salvadorans and others mr trump steered clear of tps in his speech monday rep donna e shalala who represents parts of miami dade county said nearly 22 000 venezuelans filed for asylum in the u s in 2018 and they need immediate protections the president has no business in south florida she tweeted if he does not plan t
