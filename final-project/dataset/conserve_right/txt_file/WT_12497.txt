suvs sedans and minivans totaled 24 7 million units compared with 17 2 million for the united states the cabinet s planning agency announced last week beijing will loosen those controls by allowing full foreign ownership in the industry starting with electric vehicle producers this year limits for commercial vehicles would end in 2020 and for all passenger vehicles in 2022 that would end a 50 percent cap on foreign ownership of an auto venture a limit that required automakers to share technology with potential competitors adding to president donald trump s trade complaints against beijing

new opportunity we re going to consider should we go with a partner what are the advantages or should we go by ourself said ghosn this is a new freedom for carmakers which is welcome still while electrics may be china s future most brands lose money making them profits come from sales of suvs that are wildly popular with chinese drivers who see them as the safest option on the country s rough chaotic roads first quarter suvs sales rose 11 3 percent over a year earlier to 2 6 million or almost 45 percent of all auto sales according to caam electrics accounted for just over 2 percent ap
