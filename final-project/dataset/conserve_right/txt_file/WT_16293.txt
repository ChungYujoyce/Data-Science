apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis opinion the obama administration is trying to turn a historical page the president s current pacific tour is promoted as a return to asia an acknowledgment of the region s rapidly growing economies and of course a recognition of china as a world power history has a way of dictating its own terms however when asked the greatest challenge to a statesman british prime minister harold macmillan reminded a young inquirer events my dear boy events top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots as much as the administration wants to focus on a too long neglected theater the trip is also an attempt on the eve of a presidential campaign to deflect attention from the dismal middle east scenarios where mr obama plunged with such enthusiasm only a little over two years ago massive pr only partly obscures washington s inability to extricate itself from the mideast even with a much publicized exit from iraq with an intermediate stop in kuwait and a devil take the hindmost withdrawal from afghanistan the arab spring is turning out to be as feckless as its 1968 prague spring namesake offering little resolution of fundamentals e g jobs for the world s largest rising demographic of young workers syria where wish has betrayed realism in american policy ticks ominously mr obama s repeated profitless overtures to tehran s mullahs are concluding with an imminent prospect that iran will obtain a nuclear weapon nato s vaunted southeastern tent peg turkey lurches from one contradictory foreign initiative to another while dealing with a domestic economic bubble about to burst furthermore mr obama s company of players including speechwriters cavalierly promoted to geopoliticians will encounter a host of equally difficult and no less pressing issues meetings with an alphabet soup of asia pacific organizations and brief encounters with national leaders won t resolve outstanding strategic issues that washington long has had on the back burner taking precedence is japan cornerstone of all u s asian strategies but one that this administration too often has given short shrift but washington will have to continue dealing with a japanese administration holding on to power by its sandal straps unresolved is the question of the redeployment of u s forces on okinawa with the current tokyo government more beholden than previous conservative administrations to rapacious locals and now washington has handed prime minister yoshihiko noda another piece of hot tofu the trans pacific partnership a nine nation free trade pact from chile through the u s and japan to singapore tokyo s highly subsidized and politically powerful agricultural lobby sees a threat to its protected food markets at a time when commercial and political relations with china not included in this party round are japan s overriding concerns the north korean ghost haunts from offstage a juvenile delinquent holding weapons of mass destruction to neighbors heads a trading partner to every other world pariah whose only alternative to its current policy path is anarchic implosion realists should ask more seminal questions will mr obama s one on one in hawaii with outgoing chinese president hu jintao smooth the unequal bilateral playing field in trade a not insignificant contributor to world currency and fiscal imbalances it s not likely that chinese currency manipulation and intellectual property theft will be remedied beijing s ultramercantilism also is emerging as a wild card in coming american presidential debates in beijing itself a communist party leadership generational switch perhaps not going as smoothly as some thought a few months ago is under way as regime dogmatists try to finesse the problem of rising inflation while maintaining rapid growth the leadership s management of the economy has long been seen as the only card the regime holds as civil dissidence rises thus the combination of mr obama s continued denigration of america s historic role washington s domestic economic policy woes and the increasingly aggressive chinese menace challenge the obama administration s call for a new american return to asia in fact it s a call as historically inaccurate as mr obama s earlier istanbul and cairo speeches summoning myth rather than history for an accommodation with islam america s asian role has loomed large since the late 19th century but alas mr obama did not take a leaf from ronald reagan s economic playbook the gipper used his stimulus in part to rebuild american defenses to face down the soviets a call now to american pacific destiny rings hollow as the u s navy s decades old dominance in east asia erodes in the face of a rapid chinese buildup with an american fleet that will soon be smaller than any other since pre world war ii however revolutionary its new technologies careful that trumpet call could sound tinny sol sanders a veteran international correspondent writes weekly on
