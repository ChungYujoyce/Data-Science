national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge in the political battles over climate change there are three distinct and relevant questions first does mankind have a material effect on the earth s climate second if mankind does impact the climate is that impact harmful and third if we assume that mankind is harming the environment will any given american policy or collection of policies have a meaningful beneficial impact so far the conservative movement has mainly pushed back on the scientific consensus related to the first question the extent of human influence over the earth s climate to see a textbook example watch ted cruz s recent interview with katie couric earlier this year when he confronted her with the miserable recent history of environmentalist predictions the short version of fiorina s argument is this if the scientific consensus is that man made climate change is real there is also consensus that america acting alone cannot stop it indeed the chinese are only too happy to watch us constrict our economy as they capture the market in clean coal advertisement the short version of fiorina s argument is this if the scientific consensus is that man made climate change is real there is also consensus that america acting alone cannot stop it indeed the chinese are only too happy to watch us constrict our economy as they capture the market in clean coal california enacts regulations that will make no difference in global climate the obama administration enacts regulations that will make no difference in global climate yet americans are asked to pay the price for to take one example climate regulations that by 2030 would only save the world the equivalent of slightly over 13 days of chinese emissions we ve already been made to pay the price for the veto of the keystone xl pipeline when even the state department declared that it would have negligible impact on the environment related the left doesn t seriously dispute the notion that american regulations aren t going to save the planet but they justify the demand for american sacrifice by essentially ascribing a mystical power to our national policies as if our decision to fall on our own sword will so move india and china and the rest of the developing world which has a lot of fossil fuels left to burn to lift its people out of poverty that they ll essentially have their own come to jesus movement in defiance of national interest and centuries of national political culture america leads they proclaim the world laughs is the proper response nations as the saying goes do not have friends only interests our geopolitical competitors will not sacrifice their strategic interests for the sake of combating global warming nor will developing nations sacrifice their economies or their people s lives by restraining their own economic growth americans have proven time and again that they re willing to sacrifice if convinced that their sacrifice has a purpose that it accomplishes an objective there s certainly room for cruz s climate change skepticism in the national debate but there just may be more room for fiorina s economic scientific and geopolitical realism the left is asking america to sacrifice for nothing for no true economic benefit no true climate benefit and no true or meaningful global leadership that s a bad deal even for those who believe in man made climate change yet that s the deal the left demands get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
