china an associated press investigation tracked salmon squid and cod processed by north koreans working at chinese factories and shipped to american stores including walmart and aldi the north korean workers found in chinese factories aren t allowed to leave and receive only a fraction of their pay most goes straight to the north korean state this means that american consumers buying seafood labeled caught in the usa processed in china may inadvertently be subsidizing the government of kim jong un as it builds nuclear weapons and also supporting forced labor u s customs and border protection said it is reviewing the allegations and if warranted would pursue all enforcement actions and prohibit goods from importation as appropriate the companies that responded also vowed to investigate ties with suppliers top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century at this point anything made by north korean workers anywhere is presumed to be made with forced labor the state department said in a

passports are typically withheld by north korean supervisors gop congressman chris smith from new jersey who has repeatedly called for tougher enforcement said the labor department has already identified trafficking in 12 sectors of goods exported by china cbp should be stopping every shipment from those sectors and now trafficking tainted salmon too he said a white house national security council spokesman said the north korean government s scheme to outsource its labor underscores why the united states has pushed for restrictions on north korean foreign workers the spokesman said all countries should at a minimum ban companies from bringing in north korean crews as pledged in recent united nations sanctions china is among the countries that have promised to comply already banning imports of north korean seafood and saying no more north korean workers will be allowed starting next year but all nations must go further and reject what is clearly a despicable practice that only serves the regime s nuclear ambitions said the nsc spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn t authorized to comment walmart said its supplier has addressed the problem although it did not specify how walmart and aldi said they are committed to human rights and fair labor practices and expect the same from their business partners at a time when north korea faces sanctions on many exports the government is sending tens of thousands of workers worldwide bringing in revenue estimated at anywhere from 200 million to 500 million a year that could account for a sizable portion of north korea s nuclear weapons and missile programs which south korea says have cost more than 1 billion north koreans overseas work in construction in the gulf states shipbuilding in poland logging

suppliers as well we re middlemen said liszt we do make a practice of trying to go and visit the plants that we buy from in person but it s not a perfect world that we can see into every single one some u s brands and companies had indirect ties to the north korean laborers in hunchun including chicken of the sea owned by thai union trade records show shipments came from a sister company of the

penalized ap observed north korean workers in chinese factories building hardwood flooring sewing garments and manufacturing electronics fordham university economics professor giacomo santangelo said
