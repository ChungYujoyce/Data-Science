considered to be in the lead in iowa according to the final public opinion surveys told supporters that i imagine i have a strong feeling at some point the results will be announced and when those results are announced i have a good feeling we re going to be doing very very well here in iowa a couple of hours after the populist senator from vermont spoke his campaign released internal reporting numbers which they said represented the results from nearly 40 percent of the caucus precincts in iowa we recognize that this does not replace the full data from the iowa democratic party but we believe firmly that our supporters worked too hard for too long to have the results of that work delayed senior adviser jeff weaver said the sanders campaign figures show the populist senator from vermont at 30 percent buttigieg at 25 percent warren at 21 percent biden at 12 percent and klobuchar at 11 percent a couple of hours later the buttigieg campaign also released incomplete internal numbers compiled from reporting by the campaign apos s precinct captains from across the state the numbers suggested buttigieg winning approximately 25 percent of the final alignment raw vote and roughly 28 percent of the traditional state delegate equivalent totals our precinct captains reported full caucus results in 1 259 precincts this represents approximately 75 percentof the total precincts and just over 150 000 total votes we have partial results for another 42 precincts the campaign noted we believe firmly that our supporters worked too hard for too long to have the results of that work delayed but mo elleithee the founding executive director of georgetown university apos s institute of politics and public service and a fox news contributor scolded the campaigns if i were all of the campaigns i d be privately angry and publicly quiet let the process play out so you don t have another situation like the republicans had in 2012 where they got it wrong and had to correct it two weeks later let the process play out announce the winner and then start pouncing on the party to make sure it doesn t happen again but for now all this public sniping isn t helping he emphasized elleithee a senior spokesman for hillary clinton s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the democratic national committee argued that nobody can declare victory there s nothing to declare every just gets to wait until tomorrow the chaotic situation brought back memories of the 2012 republican caucuses when initial results pointed to a narrow victory by former massachusetts gov mitt romney it was ultimately revealed that former sen rick santorum of pennsylvania was the winner elleithee noted that the ultimate winners the people who can claim momentum are all going to miss out on the opportunity to declare momentum in the moment so they re going to have to find other ways to manufacturer it there s no winner there s just waiting as the utter mess in reporting the results made national headlines political pundits started to write the iowa caucuses obituary predicting the state would lose it s role leading off the nominating calendar jeff link a longtime iowa based democratic consultant and presidential campaign veteran told fox news i think we still have time to get this right today it s more important to be right than to rush out numbers that you later have to correct but it s not ideal longtime new hampshire democratic party chair ray buckley contrasting the first in the nation presidential primary with iowa s caucuses told fox news that the nh apos s primary is conducted by local elected officials overseen by the secretary of state nh uses paper ballots and has run smoothly for 100 years we expect a great turnout in the democratic primary by democrats independents and those who register on primary day the we expect a great turnout line also appears to be a slight at iowa where the state party said monday night they were on track to match the 2016 democratic caucuses turnout which was significantly lower than the historic high of 2008 get all the stories you need to know from the most powerful
