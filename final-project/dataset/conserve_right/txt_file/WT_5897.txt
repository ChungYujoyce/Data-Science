countries repeated familiar charges beijing accusing washington of interfering in asian affairs and washington accusing beijing of violating the law of the sea and encroaching on the natural resources of other countries washington however found itself handicapped as president trump did not attend the meeting sending in his place neither vice president mike pence or secretary of state mike pompeo but his recently appointed national security adviser robert o brien other major powers sent their heads of government those attending as guests of asean included japanese prime minister shinzo abe indian prime minister narendra modi and chinese premier li keqiang washington s diplomatic move was underlined when seven of the southeast asian leaders skipped an important meeting with o brien sending instead their foreign ministers their action was technically appropriate in terms of diplomatic protocol for a meeting with o brien who trump anointed his special envoy to the meeting in bangkok american officials fearing a boycott urged all southeast asian heads of state to attend monday s meeting but asean leaders decided to send only thai prime minister prayuth chan ocha as host the vietnamese prime minister as host of next year s summit and the leader of laos who oversees asean u s relations a southeast asian diplomat told the associated press on condition of anonymity because he lacked authorization to discuss the issue during the meeting o brien read a letter from trump who invited asean leaders to a special summit in the u s early next year o brien at a news conference denied that he regarded the meeting as a snub saying he only experienced very very gracious and generous hospitality and meetings from all the leaders here asean and other leaders in the indo pacific he declared that he had a great set of meetings and didn t feel like there was anything at all untoward o brien spoke with a sharper edge when discussing one of asean s main concerns china s aggressive territorial claims over the south china sea a major concern of four southeast asian nations with competing claims brunei malaysia the philippines and vietnam taiwan is also involved in a long simmering territorial conflict in the busy waters a key waterway for global commerce dwarfed by china s military rival claimant states have looked at the u s as a counterweight to the asian powerhouse o brien took a swipe at china saying beijing was using intimidation to try to stop asean nations from exploiting their offshore resources blocking access to 2 5 trillion in oil and gas reserves alone china has long warned washington not to interfere in territorial disputes it regards as a purely asian issue it opposes naval and aerial patrols by the u s and its allies in the disputed waters but american forces have maintained their presence and continued freedom of navigation sail bys designed to challenge china s vast territorial claims chinese premier li said he was confident that a regional code of maritime conduct that china is negotiating with asean states could be concluded in three years responding to a question about o brien s comments he told reporters regretfully while the tree desires tranquility the wind keeps blowing some nonregional countries have done everything to make trouble and raise tensions they want to impose their will on our countries o brien delivered a retort to li saying we don t believe that any country should just seal off massive portions of the pacific ocean and claim that their territorial waters like it s a lake like it s a lake up in lake tahoe an island in the middle of the u s noting the u s heritage as a maritime trading nation he told reporters that international law allows us to go in international waters when we choose and for the reasons that we chose and so we don t think that sailing the high seas in any way infringes on any other country he stressed that china s actions threatened to deprive southeast asian nations of the natural resources that rightfully belong to them it s against the rules it s not fair it s not right and so the united states has never been shy about calling that out he said now that doesn t mean we don t want good relations with china we want great relations with china the other major issue tackled by asean leaders resulted in progress after seven years of negotiations for a massive free trade deal called the regional comprehensive economic partnership however the initiative backed by china only won approval for now from 15 of the 16 nations involved as india was not yet able to commit itself rcep which does not include the u s aims to level trade barriers between asean members and six other countries in a bloc encompassing roughly a third of all global trade
