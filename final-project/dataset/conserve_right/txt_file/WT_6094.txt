apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the state department is pushing back against a chinese disinformation campaign that has sought to portray the trump administration s new tougher policy toward beijing as a racist iteration of the outdated post cold war clash of civilizations theory the united states does not have a china policy that is based upon academic theories about a clash of civilizations or concepts based on ethnicity religion or race connie y chung a state department spokeswoman told inside the ring together with our allies and partners the united states seeks to advance transparency the rule of law market based economic competition and other principles that underpin security and prosperity for the world china has openly committed to upholding these values and principles she added top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ms chung said the united states welcomes constructive engagement with china on areas of common interest but she added at the same time however the united states will remain forthright in pressing the chinese government to respect human rights the rule of law and the chinese people s aspirations for freedom chinese government officials and state run media have been hammering the notion that the trump administration s new china policy is racist during a speech in singapore june 2 chinese defense minister gen wei fenghe accused the united states of adopting racist policies and asserting that china favors human civilizations that are colorful equal and inclusive under china s communist system however beijing s leaders have promoted the notion of chinese civilization represents the most superior race in the world and one that is destined to dominate the globe unfortunately some people recently pick ed up the decadent idea of clash of civilizations gen wei stated as racist and narrow minded as it is this is not right how can we tolerate such a regress of history the general was referring to the widely misstated views of kiron skinner secretary of state mike pompeo s director of policy planning and a key policymaker in the department ms skinner came under fire in april from anti trump critics after remarks she made in a forum on the challenge posed by a newly aggressive china asked to explain the new approach ms skinner said the threat from china may have deeper historical strategic roots than are commonly known in china she said we have an economic competitor we have an ideological competitor one that really does seek a kind of global reach that many of us didn t expect a couple of decades ago and i think it s also striking that it s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not caucasian she acknowledged later the comment was partially inaccurate the united states battled against japan in world war ii and the vietnamese in the vietnam war her interlocutor at a security forum former policy planning director anne marie slaughter then stated that the comments sounded like the late political scientist samuel huntington s notion of a clash of civilizations ms skinner who is black then responded some of those tenets but a little bit different and all of those things together are a bit perplexing for the american foreign policy establishment i think we have to take the rose colored glasses off and get real about the nature of the threat and i think we also have to give a kind of respect for i think what the chinese seek to accomplish despite the fact that ms skinner herself never mentioned the clash of civilizations china s state media have falsely portrayed the incident as indicative of racist american policies toward china china s global television organ cgtn suggested ms skinner was being racist and asked how widespread are these views within the administration chen weihua a propagandist with the communist party newspaper china daily tweeted that ms skinner s statement was a nazi type racist comment in the united states pro china academic michael swaine also seized on the comments tweeting this is a rather appalling racist based assessment of the nature of the chinese threat and coming from the state dept makes it even worse mr huntington s clash of civilization theory was first put forth in 1992 he argued that ideological battles were being replaced by cultural and religious identity clashes and that those would be the main source of conflict in the post cold war world since then china s brand of communism with chinese characteristics and russian soviet style revanchism have shown that ideological conflict is still driving global competition trump fourth of july speech president trump will preside over a rousing patriotic fourth of july ceremony on thursday that will include impressive military displays

policymaker on china last week outlined the trump administration s new indo pacific strategy which has a clear focus on beijing randall schriver assistant defense secretary for indo pacific security affairs told the heritage foundation in a speech that the new strategy represents a government wide challenge to china s drive to replace the u s led system of rules laws and norms in pursuit of that goal chinese communist party leaders led by general secretary and president xi jinping are using a tool kit of coercion that includes deploying advanced weapon systems to disputed south china sea islands and influence operations to interfere in the domestic politics of other nations aimed at undermining the integrity of elections and threatening internal stability mr schriver said they engage in predatory economics and debt for sovereignty deals oftentimes enabled by corruption which takes advantage of the pressing economic needs to structure unequal bargains he added and they promote state sponsored theft of other nations military and civilian technology the chinese global ambition to impose its system of authoritarian rule around the world mr schriver noted the protests in hong kong against creeping chinese imposition of its authoritarian model the people of hong kong bravely spoke out against the controversial extradition bill because they knew it could potentially expose them to china s justice system and further erode their judicial independence he said a grouping of security partners beyond traditional treaty allies was identified in the report they include singapore mongolia new zealand and taiwan on taiwan mr schriver said taipei supports the u s strategy by investing in its military and defense needs the objective is to let beijing know that it becomes unattractive for any chinese military action to resold the dispute over taiwan s status we re working very closely with taiwan as a security partner under the taiwan relations act to make sure the taiwan does have those capabilities he said adding that the partnership is very strong and the pentagon remains very focused on the evolving chinese military threat to the island on arms sales mr schriver said the growing threat to taiwan is driving decision making on what weapons to sell a new u s arms package to taiwan worth more than 2 billion is expected to be announced soon contact bil
