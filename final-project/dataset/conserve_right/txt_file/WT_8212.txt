warning that inaction or weak responses will lead to further laser attacks and potential miscalculation that could lead to a conflict broadcast board nomination fight after a delay of nearly two years the white house recently moved ahead with the nomination of conservative filmmaker michael pack to head the u s government s information operations system a system that is in dire need of upgrade and reform the white house on feb 25 sent mr pack s nomination to be the first chief executive officer of the broadcasting board of governors to the senate as a delaying tactic opponents of mr pack on the senate foreign relations committee earlier had sent back his nomination papers several months ago the bbg as it is known is part of the u s agency for global media an independent federal agency in charge of government funded media networks the system receives around 730 million annually now the nominee faces further delays as bureaucrats within the bbg who oppose mr pack work with senate democratic allies to prevent him from being confirmed his chief critic is new jersey sen robert menendez the ranking democrat on the foreign relations committee who is expected to place a hold on the nomination mr menendez also has positioned a longtime loyalist michael kempner on the bbg a menendez spokesman said the senator had no comment on the situation as part of its reform plan the trump administration is planning to take legal action that would remove the current board structure and appoint an interim director if the pack nomination gets bogged down as one person familiar with the controversy put it the deep state is fully in charge of the bbg a menendez spokeswoman referred questions to the foreign relations panel suzanne wrasse a spokeswoman for the committee said paperwork for the nomination must be filled out by mr pack once we have all of the necessary forms and paperwork then the file is complete and we can begin the review process she said mr pack who declined to comment is expected to oversee a major housecleaning at the moribund u s foreign radio broadcasting system which critics say is failing to aggressively promote american policies and counter foreign information and influence operations the trump administration is planning a major overhaul of the u s information operations system including the voice of america and several other foreign broadcasting outlets chief among the targets for replacement is voice of america director amanda bennett a former journalist and a holdover from the obama administration under ms bennett voa has run numerous stories criticizing mr trump for his tough immigration policies other outlets facing restructuring and personnel changes include radio free europe radio liberty radio free asia radio and television marti and several middle east broadcast outlets radio free asia s new director bay fang is also a democrat who once worked for uber democrat john podesta critics say the bbg radio outlets and the voice of america in particular have reduced the amount of hard hitting news and commentary producing instead fluff journalism lacking seriousness and focus another criticism has been a lack of counterintelligence activity regarding the numerous foreign employees employed by the bbg outlets charges of infiltration by foreign spy services or the hiring of foreign government sympathizers also have been raised as well as the failure to aggressively counter foreign disinformation campaigns despite disclosures about russian meddling in the 2016 election and growing chinese interference in the u s election process rfe rl and the other bbg networks have not stepped up anti disinformation activities critics also say the current bbg governors are either obama democrats or anti trump republicans who are opposing mr pack because they will lose their high paying jobs on the board our foreign broadcasting efforts remain hopelessly lost and detached from foreign policy said christian whiton an information operations expert and former state department senior adviser in the trump and bush administrations the whole concept of playing pretend bbc is antiquated and irrelevant to today s information environment he said we need to wield information against adversaries like china and iran and our leaderless public broadcasters aren t getting it done mr whiton said public diplomacy has been a joke in recent decades wielding the truth to wage nonviolent political warfare is a lot better than resorting to actual warfare he said the administration needs pack in place to fix the broadcasting piece in a letter to the president a group of experts called the bbg inefficient and non performing and said the bbg s failure to promote efforts to bypass foreign internet firewalls was inexcusable dick carlson former voa director during the last years of the cold war said he has known mr pack for 30 years he s smart and patriotic and he ll be an excellent head of the radios mr carlson said the current media system is in need of overhaul he added over the years it s been run in a poor way by committees and it has not worked out very well mr carlson said follow bil
