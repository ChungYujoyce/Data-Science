within striking distance of hillary clinton after a horrendous week his running mate indiana gov mike pence said he couldn t be more proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with mr trump despite the

weeks to make up ground lost in must win battleground states before voters have their say on nov 8 a washington post abc news poll released sunday showed mr trump trailing mrs clinton the democratic nominee by just 4 points 47 percent to 43 percent a margin that is relatively unchanged from a similar poll taken ahead of the first presidential debate that suggests the fallout from a 2005 access hollywood tape in which the mogul speaks about women in lewd terms and accusations of groping were largely offset by a string of leaked emails that portray mrs clinton s campaign in an unflattering light i think it s amazing that trump is as close as he is right now considering the one sidedness of the news media barrage former house speaker newt gingrich told abc s this week still nearly seven in 10 of those polled said mr trump probably made unwanted sexual advances toward women and more than half said his apology for remarks on the hot mic tape was insincere an nbc news wall street

media coverage about his running mate was the real problem we will absolutely accept the result of the election look the american people will speak in an election that will culminate on nov 8 mr pence told nbc s meet the press but the american people are tired of the obvious bias in the national media that s where the sense of a rigged election goes here mr pence said the media should keep delving into emails that show mrs clinton and her staff making unflattering remarks about catholics and needy hispanics at the same time mr pence said there should be severe consequences for overseas hackers trying to meddle in u s politics investigators say russians are responsible for the emails published by wikileaks an anti secrecy organization democratic vice presidential candidate tim kaine a u s senator from virginia was more forceful about reports that russia was behind the attacks i can t think of a precedent of a foreign nation trying to destabilize an american election he told fox news he said he is confident that mrs clinton s private email server which she set up during her tenure at the state department was not breached though he tried to pivot away from the substance of the emails which he said were illicitly gained i don t give credence to any of these dumped documents because i don t even know if they re accurate he told abc s this week mrs clinton plans to be relatively quiet on the campaign trail in the days leading up to the final presidential debate wednesday in las vegas some analysts insist she is boxed in by the latest reports given her famous husband s
