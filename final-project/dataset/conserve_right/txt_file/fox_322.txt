at least it was a contest i m happy even if i lost matteo salvini put a brave face on last night selection result after his far right league failed to capture the historic red fortress of emilia romagna in recent weeks salvini had tried to turn the regional contest into a referendum on national politics bidding to give a final shove to the teetering five star democratic coalition and force an early general election yet the league s much expected final breakthrough will have to wait the northern italian region s incumbent democratic president stefano bonaccini took 51 4 per cent of the vote as against 43 6 per cent for his league rival lucia borgonzoni a less close outcome than most polls had predicted the centre left s relief at the result was palpable an op ed in la repubblica bore the title stalingrad has not fallen the democrats national leader nicola zingaretti tweeted a photo of himself receiving news of the result sat with his feet on his desk and his face adorned by a beaming smile insisting that the national government had emerged strengthened from this test zingaretti also paid tribute to the sardines movement whose mass protests have spread across the region and italy in recent monthsas a demonstration of civic opposition to salvini themovement sname is a reference to the densely packed participants as well as the sardines now touted as a distinct political force much of the credit will go to bonaccini himself who campaigned on his record as one of italy s most popular governors and doggedly focused on local issues such as the expansion of free kindergartens and school transport while the various liberal and social democratic lists backing his candidacy from the greens to matteo renzi s italia viva won 48 2 per cent of the vote around 150 000 electors backed bonaccini for president without endorsing any of the centre left parties this contrasted with the league s borgonzoni whose election rallies were instead dominated by salvini personally

last few decadesthese structures have waned andin recent years the league has begun building a base in towns across the region in 2019 capturing the mayoralties in well heeled ferrara and forl in this sense the biggest danger for bonaccini was not so much that disgruntled working class italians would shift directly from the left to the league a widely exaggerated phenomenon but that a deeper sense of disillusionment and alienation might depress turnout as in 2014 when it slumped to just 37 8 per cent this time however the climate of polarisation really did mobilise voters as turnout nearly doubled clearly a reflection of the importance that both the sardines movement and salvini attributed to this contest yet even this 67 7 per cent turnout was still the second lowest ever the one
