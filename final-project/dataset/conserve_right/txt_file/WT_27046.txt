said i don t think any president of the united states should use the tragedy of 9 11 as a political tool i think that is wrong i think it s beneath the dignity of the office what omar said omar told a los angeles gathering of the council on american islamic relations on march 23 that many muslims saw their civil liberties eroded after the sept 11 attacks for far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second class citizen and frankly i m tired of it and every single muslim in this country should be tired of it she said in the speech according to video posted online cair was

hijacked planes hitting the twin towers trump also tweeted we will never forget the president elevated criticism largely from omar s political opponents and conservatives who say omar s phrasing offered a flippant description of the assailants and the attacks that killed nearly 3 000 people neither trump s tweet nor the video included omar s full quote or the context of her comments in minnesota trump kept his remarks at a trucking company in burnsville mostly focused on the 2017 gop passed tax cut who echoed trump other prominent gop voices joined trump in criticizing omar first
