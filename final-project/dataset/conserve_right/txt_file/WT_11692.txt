the end of the western world and the birth of a new global order by martin jacques penguin 2009 the title says it all no matter where one travels around the world there is a sense of inevitability that the people s republic of china prc is destined to be the next pre eminent global power this rise can only happen in lockstep with america s demise which also is seen as inevitable due to u s fiscal indiscipline hitherto the arrival of a new global hegemon has ushered in a major change in the international order as was the case with both britain and then the united states the author a columnist for the united kingdom s leftist manchester guardian writes given that china promises to be so inordinately powerful and different it is difficult to resist the idea that in time its rise will herald the birth of a new international order charm offensive how china s soft power is transforming the world by joshua kurlantzick yale university press 2008 this must read shows how beijing is pulling all the levers of statecraft to make headway winning friends and influencing people in short the chinese have courted the world by taking advantage of the fact that america s eye has been off the ball and much of the world neglected while we ve been bogged down in wars in iraq and afghanistan for the chinese soft power means anything outside of the military and security realm including not only popular culture and public diplomacy but also more coercive economic and diplomatic levers like aid and investment and participation in multilateral organizations the author a fellow at the council on foreign relations explains it can threaten other nations with these sticks if they do not help china achieve its goals but it can offer sizable carrots if they do the recent entreaty for beijing to bail out the collapsing eurozone is an example of how the prc can buy u s allies by sprinkling financial goodies around top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots mao a reinterpretation by lee feigon ivan r dee 2003 this is one of the most dastardly dissertations published thus far in the 21st century because its aim is to let mao off the hook for the tens of millions of souls who perished under his monstrous rule it was not until the late 1950s that mao became a genuinely creative and original thinker and actor the author sings not only did mao begin the process of opening up china to the outside world he also created the industrial infrastructure that laid the basis for the resuscitation of the chinese economy during the deng years he takes offense that mao is frequently compared to hitler and stalin and praises the chinese villain for being more of an anarchist than a marxist and for leading a truly populist inclusive revolution as opposed to one framed by ivory tower intellectual elites it s helpful to read this book to understand to what lengths sino apologists will go to whitewash the history of the chinese communist party ccp mao s great famine the history of china s most devastating catastrophe 1958 1962 by frank dikotter walker 2010 this groundbreaking work which is based on chinese archives never before seen is vital to countering pro communist revisionist trash like the mao encomium by mr feigon the author proves that chairman mao s so called great leap forward was responsible for over 45 million deaths much more than the previous estimates of 15 32 million although usually explained away as the result of mass famine accidentally caused by backward agricultural policies this book shows that millions were tortured and starved in mass murder by design similar to what was perpetrated in nazi germany pol pot s cambodia and the soviet union it s important not to forget that today s chinese rulers operate in the party that mao built and they still play by his rules jesus in beijing how christianity is transforming china and changing the global balance of power by david aikman regnery 2003 the former beijing bureau chief of time magazine gives a peek behind the bamboo curtain to expose how the purportedly modern enlightened communist party continues to persecute and brutalize its own citizens today for the crime of religious devotion beijing s fundamental operating principle is control and it cannot control faith so it tries to suppress it whether it s bulldozing house churches throwing 80 year old catholic bishops into jail confiscating bibles from private homes or sentencing pastors to hard labor it s dangerous to believe in christ in the middle kingdom it s a warning that the world would be a much meaner brutal place if tyrannical china supplants freedom espousing america as the dominant power accepting authoritarianism state society relations in china s reform era by teresa wright stanford university press 2010 this is one of the most original works on the prc in years because it shatters the myth that as china becomes richer it also will naturally become freer to the contrary beijing has co opted society s upwardly mobile ironically some of communism s biggest supporters are china s new millionaires and the white collar professional class the status quo in the country is working out well for them so there s no reason to rock the boat this newly enriched mob supports repressive policies to keep the masses down because that limits competition for the country s wealth china fragile superpower how china s internal politics could derail its peaceful rise by susan l shirk oxford university press 2007 this alternate theory sheds light on what could happen if the prc does not in fact gobble up the planet shove america aside and take everything over there s a good chance the whole place could simply crack up and fall apart due to massive demographic political financial social environmental security and resource oriented crises that are all simmering at the same time the worst nightmare of china s leaders is a national protest movement of discontented groups unemployed workers hard pressed farmers and students united against the regime by the shared fervor of nationalism the author a former deputy assistant secretary of state writes during an internal crisis keeping the lid on at home is much more important than foreign relations how an imperiled ccp would react to an existential threat is anybody s guess but beijing desperation could pose the most serious danger of a chinese war this begs the question what happens to the prc s nuclear weapons if the nation breaks up the china threat how the people s republic targets america by bill gertz regnery 2000 this classic was ahead of the curve in warning that the rise of the red dragon was a phenomenon to fear not welcome the fundamental lesson of the 20th century is that democracies cannot coexist indefinitely with powerful and ambitious totalitarian regimes the respected washington times national security editor posits sooner or later the competing goals and ideologies bring conflict whether hot or cold until one or the other side prevails this book lays out all beijing s machinations from proliferating arms and developing space based weapons to stealing technology and encircling democratic taiwan the more things change the more they stay the same the beijing consensus how china s authoritarian model will dominate the twenty first century by stefan halper basic books 2010 this cautionary tale argues that the democratic age is over and it s being replaced by a chinese model based on market authoritarianism that prioritizes economic growth while suppressing political liberties china is the principal international creditor and we see the possibility of a shift away from pax americana and toward the rising economies of asia the author predicts the market democratic model that america has promoted as the universal endpoint of political economic evolution has been blamed around the world rightly or wrongly for its unregulated excess and for bringing on a multiyear global downturn the result is a global turn away from freedom in favor of systems based on more internal control this dynamic could undo centuries of progress that have sanctified the value of the individual bowing to beijing how barack obama is hastening america s decline and ushering a century of chinese domination by brett m decker and william c triplett ii regnery 2011 ok full disclosure this book was co written by me but that means i can guarantee that it s full of original information about beijing s massive military buildup corporate espionage currency manipulation christian persecution forced sterilizations slave labor and human organ trafficking its goal is to convince the reader why the beijing consensus must not be allowed to come to pass the takeaway is that the world s largest debtor nation cannot remain a superpower for very long but president obama is driving the u s economy into the ground creating china s opportunity to dominate us america needs to clean up its own financial house to re solidify its place as the leader of the free world brett m decker is editorial page editor of the washington times and co author of the new book bowing to beijing
