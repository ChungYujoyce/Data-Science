apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic bismarck n d ap north dakota is well down on the list of top soybean producing states but for farmers who grow the crop the escalating u s china trade war is every bit as important as it is to their colleagues in top soybean states like iowa and illinois and it might even be a factor in the u s senate race in the state a look at what s at stake what s this trade war all about the trump administration early this month imposed a 25 percent tax on 34 billion worth of chinese products in response to complaints beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology china retaliated with taxes on an equal amount of u s products including soybeans the trump administration then announced 10 percent tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods which won t take effect until at least september prompting a world trade organization challenge by china top stories ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender how big of a deal are soybeans in north dakota north dakota isn t a large grower of soybeans ranking ninth among soybean growing states and producing less than 6 percent of the nation s crop but soybeans have grown in popularity in north dakota in recent years thanks to strong prices and this year the 6 6 million acres planted by farmers equals the size of the state s staple spring wheat crop nearly three fourths of the soybeans grown in north dakota are sent by rail to the pacific northwest and from there shipped to countries in southeast asia according to the north dakota soybean council china is the no 1 international destination for north dakota soybeans said simon wilson executive director of the nonprofit north dakota trade office he estimated the annual worth of north dakota beans sold to china at about 1 4 billion for us this is a big deal when you have the largest market effectively putting tariffs into place wilson said so how big of a deal is it we re in the crosshairs right now said joe ericson 37 a trump supporter who with family farms about 5 000 acres of soybeans and other crops near wimbledon ericson president of the north dakota soybean growers association traveled to washington d c this month for american soybean association meetings and met with lawmakers about farm issues including tariffs that s the top priority he said adding that farmers are hopeful congress will give them some sort of safety net to ride out tariff related market disruptions ericson said he forward contracted much of his crop this year meaning his price is set and won t be impacted by market drops but those who sell right off the combine will be hurt he said farmers typically don t store a lot of soybeans to sell later when prices rise to save space for other crops such as corn that produce more bushels many soybean farmers also grow corn and if they flood the market with corn it could hurt the prices they get for that crop creating a double whammy it s a tough environment right now ericson said we ve just got to get through it hopefully the president knows what he s doing is that the only hope not necessarily according to republican north dakota agriculture commissioner doug goehring who farms soybeans near menoken goehring also has a background in international marketing through previous work with the united soybean board and the u s export soybean council and said he thinks the country will be better off down the line because of what trump is doing u s farmers and ranchers have been exposed to the highest tariffs in the world by other countries it s unfair and it s wrong goehring said this needs to get addressed in the long run we ll be much better off the u s also needs to tap into other markets he said the rest of the world has to come to us for beans goehring said if china is buying up beans from brazil everybody has to come to us goehring acknowledged that there s a lot of anxiety in the ag community about the tariffs and that as a soybean farmer myself i get that but he added we don t need to be drama queens about this is it all about soybeans no the u s also has imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and that could indirectly hurt farmers by driving up the cost of farm equipment according to wilson trade wars nobody wins he said wilson also thinks the tariff issue could go past the harvest and into the election and that the positions of north dakota s two u s senate candidates on the tariffs might sway some farmers votes if farmers don t feel they are being heard those are things that come into question he said democratic u s sen heidi heitkamp is facing a challenge by republican u s rep kevin cramer in a race seen as critical for control of the senate heitkamp seems more inclined than cramer to criticize the trump administration on the issue heitkamp has called the escalating trade war damaging and misguided and said the trump administration isn t listening to the needs of rural america cramer has said that while he doesn t view tariffs as a good long term tool he believes trade disparities have harmed american farmers for decades and that there are a lot of people pulling for the goals of the president as the administration works to secure better trade deals goehring said the trade war is likely to be a different scenario and situation by fall and ericson also questions if it will be an issue come november i don t know if this tariff thing is really congress s deal he said adding that the senate race in north dakota is going to be close no matter what mark jendrysik chairman of the university of north dakota s political science department said he s uncertain how this will all shake out are farmers already feeling negative effects from the tariffs that might give heidi an opening he said but north dakota farmers have been solid for the republicans like the rest of the state for quite a while follow
