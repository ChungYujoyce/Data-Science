befitting frank sinatra s centennial birthday and old blue eyes fascination with presidential politics he helped orchestrate jfk s and ronald reagan s inaugurals tuesday s gop debate will occur at the venetian las vegas it sits atop the ruins of the sands hotel in early 1960 home to the famed summit featuring frank dean sammy and their ring a ding pals not that anyone is calling the nine presidential hopefuls in tuesday s main event the new rat pack smoking boozing and late night prowling not these conservative rats that said las vegas and its various means of risking fortunes are an apt metaphor for this the fifth gop presidential debate think of it as an evening of political roulette with the following wagers the outside bet in roulette a wager made in the boxes surrounding the table s numbers donald trump the field s lead outsider enters this debate as per usual the center of attention for two reasons his call to ban muslim immigration into the u s and this fox news poll showing the bombastic billionaire giving way to texas sen ted cruz in iowa trump knows his way around a casino having wagered big on atlantic city does he stick to a safe betting strategy a voice for the disaffected slice of the gop electorate or does trump gamble on more to be gained by deconstructing cruz as for the texas senator he s making the color bet red black or green cruz is letting it ride on red a red state strategy that s made him the field s new alpha dog cruz may indeed prevail in iowa he s planning on a big haul in the march 1 super tuesday across the deep south cruz also is raking in endorsements from conservative stalwarts veteran direct mailer richard viguerie and bob vander plaats president and ceo of the family leader organization betting on one color produces modest winnings maybe not so for a candidate planning on hanging around the table until next july and the national convention in cleveland there s a void within the gop field that would be the space as yet unfilled by a candidate who can blend measured outrage at the thought of terrorism returning to u s soil with a concrete strategy of force and stick to itiveness the straight up bet wagering on a single number and hoping for a miraculous return in roulette a 35 1 payoff this would be jeb bush once a frontrunner who seemingly held all the chips well at least a lot of super pac money but now a candidate struggling for relevance 7 or fifth place in last weekend s nbc news wall street journal poll the problem bush has been anything but money in the four previous debates when he needed to shine among the contenders if this keeps up he s the vegas player who has little to show for his troubles other than a free breakfast voucher the corner bet placing the chip on a corner where four numbers intersect earning the better an 8 1 payoff this is florida sen marco rubio s ploy as he once again wagers on what s paid off in this race a four fold appeal of youth electability stage presence and media buzz if the polls are to be taken seriously the smart parlay over at the venetian s race sports book is cruz trump rubio to win place and show in cleveland not necessarily in that order the split bet placing the chips on a line between two numbers which seems appropriate for dr ben carson given that he s talking about splitting from the gop if the primary process gives way to a backroom brokered national convention next summer carson s dissatisfaction has fueled speculation of an independent run next fall in which case the house doesn t win but hillary clinton probably does the line bet made by playing chips on the vertical line separating the outside and inside betting areas this would be carly fiorina who straddles the line between political insider and outsider fiorina s cleverly marketed herself as a campaign ing nue when in fact she s a veteran of a california senate race and stumping for john mccain in 2008 with that fox news poll showing only 2 support in iowa fiorina may soon run out of chips to bet there s one other wager to mull is this new jersey gov chris christie s time to shine in the aftermath of the san bernardino mass shooting president obama s underwhelming oval office speech and trump s dumpster fire of an immigration ban there s a void within the gop field that would be the space as yet unfilled by a candidate who can blend measured outrage at the thought of terrorism returning to u s soil with a concrete strategy of force and stick to itiveness all in a manner less nativist and more deduced than what trump floated that sounds like an opening for christie actually the first term version of christie that didn t shy away from confronting entrenched obstacles or for that matter any other republican who wants to bet on national security as foremost on americans minds with less than seven week left until iowa go big or go home there s a void within the gop field that would be the space as yet unfilled by a candidate who can blend measured outrage at the thought of terrorism returning to u s soil with a concrete strategy of force and stick to itiveness get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content
