i go and fight for my neighbors it is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the executive branch but it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents cummings has also drawn the president s ire for investigations touching on his family members serving in the white house on thursday his committee voted along party lines to authorize subpoenas for personal emails and texts used for official business by top white house aides including ivanka trump and her husband jared kushner after spending several hours on his private golf course in virginia trump repeated the attack on cummings despite broad criticism from democrats elijah cummings spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through oversight trump tweeted he does nothing for his very poor very dangerous and very badly run district the latest comments come as trump has placed racial animus at the center of his reelection campaign as he believes his inflammatory rhetoric will strengthen his support among the white working class and attract a new group of disaffected voters who fear cultural changes across america cummings district is about 55 black and includes a large portion of baltimore it is home to the national headquarters of the naacp and johns hopkins university and johns hopkins hospital the city has struggled with violent crime with more than 300 homicides for four years in a row it has crumbling infrastructure and a police department under federal oversight cummings district also extends into maryland s baltimore and howard counties trump s attack on cummings was reminiscent of one he launched a week before his inauguration on civil rights legend john lewis a democratic congressman from georgia who questioned the legitimacy of his 2016 election trump tweeted in january 2017 that lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district which is in horrible shape and falling apart not to mention crime infested rather than falsely complaining about the election results and earlier this month the president drew bipartisan condemnation following his call for four democratic congresswomen of color to get out of the u s right now saying if the lawmakers hate our country they can go back to their broken and crime infested countries his comments were directed at reps ilhan omar of minnesota alexandria ocasio cortez of new york ayanna pressley of massachusetts
