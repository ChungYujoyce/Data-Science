apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic chinese president xi jinping promised to tackle corruption in the country s vast communist power structure yet in his seven months in power chinese authorities have cracked down on activists who fight for honest government more than 150 activists are estimated to have been arrested since the summer crushing hopes that mr xi would root out corruption it seems with every new emperor there is hope for a new china dream but it has turned into a china nightmare said bob fu president of the china aid association based in midland texas see

human rights and anti corruption activist better known by his pen name guo feixiong told members of congress that chinese officials have prevented them from contacting him since his arrest aug 8 and they worry that he is being tortured in custody because he was tortured the last time he was arrested this time the authorities have repeatedly denied legal representatives and family access to him so we have every reason to believe he has been tortured severely or has engaged in a hunger strike said zhang qing mr guo s wife human rights activists also fear for his safety torture is endemic in custody in china and the fact that his lawyers have had so much trouble getting to see him we are extremely worried about his whereabouts and well being said sophie richardson china director at human rights watch china s new leadership made clear in the spring that it would not tolerate any public gatherings of the kind organized by the new citizens movement a grass roots campaign for greater government transparency and an end to corruption chinese authorities have arrested at least 18 people affiliated with the new citizens movement according to human rights watch these detentions signify chinese citizens growing resolve and beijing s growing fears said rep christopher h smith new jersey republican and chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on africa global health global human rights and international organizations mrs zhang her daughter sarah yang t kumar of amnesty international the blind chinese activist chen guangcheng and mr fu testified before mr smith s subcommittee tuesday a chinese embassy spokesman in washington did not respond to a request for comment mr guo was arrested aug 8 in the southern chinese city of guangzhou on the charge of disrupting order in a public space his association with the new citizens movement is seen as the likely reason for his arrest guo s detention appears to be reprisal for his support of government transparency and calls for accountability mr smith said we are not only calling on beijing to release this brave and heroic individual we are also calling on the obama administration to raise his case individually even before he assumed the presidency mr xi who is also general secretary of china s communist party central committee pledged to go after tigers and flies a reference to powerful leaders and lowly bureaucrats xi jinping goes out in public and calls for a crackdown on corruption and he gets to run the country while anti corruption activist liu ping does that and she gets prosecuted the hypocrisy is astonishing ms richardson said ms liu along with fellow activists wei zhongping and li sihua was put on trial on monday in china s eastern jiangxi province on the charge of illegal assembly some analysts are skeptical about how far mr xi s anti corruption campaign will go in a sense corruption is the glue holding together the system providing the ability to accumulate illicit wealth is one way for the communist party to secure loyalty from its members said edward schwarck of the royal united services institute for defense and security studies in london that is why xi s campaign can only go so far before it begins to threaten the foundations of party rule the new citizens movement has shone a light on the hypocrisy behind the anti corruption campaign and is now being targeted as a consequence mr fu who first got to know mr guo in 2004 and helped his family come to the u s in 2009 said mr guo himself was determined not to flee he preferred to stay in china because he felt china needs him more than the u s mr fu told the washington times mr fu last spoke with mr guo in july and said the activist had no inkling of his impending arrest he sensed there was a major crackdown but felt he was safe because he was doing everything as per the law mr fu said mrs zhang called on the obama administration and congress to press china to release mr guo and other prisoners of conscience she also asked that officials at the u s embassy in beijing and u s consulate in guangzhou visit mr guo to ascertain his well being mrs zhang described her husband as an idealist who has been on the front lines of the struggle for democracy and freedom in china that s why he was singled out to be persecuted this way and he deserves our attention fro
