apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the u s china trade war is set to dramatically escalate friday as threatened higher tariffs go into effect and president trump is going into battle with virtually no support from the republican party establishment but that doesn t mean mr trump is fighting alone the president s get tough stance on china is bolstered by an electoral base that for years has been moving away from the gop s long held free trade orthodoxy according to conservative and business leaders who themselves oppose protectionist tariffs in trade disputes top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time we ve recognized a lot of our own base republican primary voters conservatives they are not as favorable toward free trade anymore said tim phillips president americans for prosperity a conservative advocacy group that steadfastly opposes higher duties this didn t start with the president he added the drift started well before him and it s not going to end with this tariff and protectionist move americans for prosperity plans a multiyear multi million dollar campaign to corral republican voters back into the free trade stable mr trump said thursday that the 25 percent tariff on 34 billion worth of chinese goods was just the beginning of his crackdown higher duties would hit another 16 billion worth of goods in two weeks telling reporters en route to a rally in montana he is prepared to considered another 500 billion in trade duties on chinese goods if beijing refuses to compromise it s only on china said mr trump chinese president xi jinping s government accused the u s of firing first in the trade war and vowed to shoot back china will not bow in the face of threats and blackmail nor will it be shaken in its resolve to defend global free trade said gao feng spokesman for china s commerce ministry mr trump insists that he is a free trader but that for too long the u s has allowed what he calls dumb trade charging low tariffs at home while allowing foreign rivals to impose high tariffs and other barriers to u s exports leading to huge trade deficits with china critics say the uneven playing field is further tilted by beijing s theft or forced transfer of american businesses intellectual property the president blames beijing s unfair trade practices for driving up america s annual trade deficit with china to 375 billion in the u s support for the president standing up to china extends to blue collar democratic voters who crossed party lines in 2016 to help send mr trump to the white house it s also a position long championed by democrats although they have been mostly silent since mr trump took up the cause the tariff threats have caused wild swings on wall street however stocks were strong thursday with the dow jones industrial average gaining 181 points to close at 24 356 still mr trump s resolve and that of americans facing higher import prices will be tested in a trade clash with china and other countries economists expect a tit for tat tariffs to drive up prices paid by u s consumers and force job cuts in industries that rely on raw materials from china or sales to the huge chinese market the higher u s duties will hit products including chinese made machinery auto parts medical equipment rare earth metals and electronic cigarette devices beijing is retaliating with tariffs on such u s goods as

better to do it now that five or 10 years from now said stephen moore an economist at the conservative heritage foundation who is close to the president he said china with 4 percent of its gdp tied to trade with the u s has much more to lose in a trade war we both lose if this gets to be a tit for tat situation but china would be thrown into a recession if it couldn t trade with the united states said mr moore recent polls have shown voters are split over the president s trade moves and on tariffs on china quinnipiac university national poll last month found that voters support the idea of
