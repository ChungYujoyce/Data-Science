tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap the first impeachment hearing held by house democrats quickly turned hostile as their sole witness former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski stonewalled many of their questions and declared they were focusing on petty and personal politics lewandowski a devoted friend and supporter of president donald trump followed white house orders not to discuss conversations with the republican president beyond what was already public in the report by former special counsel robert mueller trump cheered lewandowski along as he testified on tuesday tweeting that his opening statement was beautiful the hearing underscores what has been a central dilemma for the house judiciary committee all year as they investigate and potentially try to impeach trump many of the democrats base supporters want them to move quickly to try to remove trump from office but the white house has blocked their oversight requests at almost every turn declining to provide new documents or allow aides and associates to testify top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century on tuesday lewandowski who is considering a run for u s senate in new hampshire defiantly made clear he wouldn t make life easy for the democrats he demanded that they provide him a copy of the mueller report sending democratic staff scrambling to find one he read directly from the report and asked democrats to read passages to him showing that he wouldn t say much beyond what mueller wrote republicans on the panel forced a series of procedural votes immediately sending the hearing into disarray he s filibustering said a frustrated house judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler lewandowski eventually began to answer some questions he told the committee that he doesn t think trump asked me to do anything illegal but still stuck mostly to what was already in the report giving democrats little new information to go on and he made clear his dislike for the house majority in the opening statement calling them petty and asserting that investigations of the president were conducted by trump haters lewandowski was a central figure in mueller s report which the committee is examining as part of its impeachment probe the report which said trump could not be exonerated on obstruction of justice detailed two episodes in which trump asked lewandowski to direct then attorney general jeff sessions to limit mueller s investigation trump said that if sessions would not meet with lewandowski then lewandowski should tell sessions he was fired lewandowski never delivered the message but asked white house aide rick dearborn a former sessions aide to do it dearborn said he was uncomfortable with the request and declined to deliver it according to the report under questioning by rep hank johnson d ga lewandowski confirmed as accurate that trump had asked him to deliver the message at least two democrats asked if he chickened out lewandowski said no that he took his kids to the beach instead and under questioning from a lawyer for the democrats barry berke lewandowski acknowledged that he had possibly lied in a cable interview about his interactions with trump when he said he didn t remember the president asking him to get involved with sessions new rules approved by the committee last week for impeachment hearings allow staff questioning at the end of the hearing democrats say the televised hearings are to educate the american people on the mueller report and what they say is egregious behavior by the president they argue that the blockade from the white house and stonewalling from witnesses like lewandowski just gives them more fodder for lawsuits they have filed against the administration and possible articles of impeachment on obstruction you are also proving our point for the american people to see nadler said noting that one of the articles of impeachment drafted against president richard nixon involved obstruction he said lewandowski s behavior is completely unacceptable two other witnesses who were subpoenaed alongside lewandowski dearborn and former white house aide rob porter did not show up at all on orders from the white house the white house says the former aides are absolutely immune from testifying a principle that democrats are currently challenging in court the committee s impeachment investigation faces major hurdles and it s still unclear whether the panel will ever draft articles of impeachment or hold any impeachment votes the republican senate is certain to rebuff any house efforts to bring charges against the president moderate democrats have expressed nervousness that the impeachment push could crowd out their other accomplishments and house speaker nancy pelosi has said the public sentiment isn t yet there still the judiciary panel is moving ahead last week approving the rules including the staff questioning for what nadler said will be an aggressive series of impeachment hearings this fall republicans declined to use their 30 minutes of staff questioning arguing that the hearings aren t really impeachment because the house never voted to begin an inquiry tuesday s hearing featured both combative exchanges between lewandowski and democrats and friendly questions from the republican side of the dais the witness took personal shots at some democrats calling california rep eric swalwell who dropped out of the democratic presidential primary president swalwell for example the democrats taunted lewandowski as well with members occasionally reminding

hopes alive rep john ratcliffe r texas told lewandowski during his round of questioning lewandowski s political future wound throughout the proceedings which offered him a widely televised platform from which to defend trump and publicly introduce himself on the congressional political stage a poll last week showed lewandowski would win the gop nomination for senate in new hampshire trump has
