apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap some are moving factories out of china others are strategically redesigning products some are seeking loopholes in trade law or even mislabeling where their goods originate all with the goal of evading president donald trump s sweeping tariffs on goods from china but most of the companies that stand to be hurt by trump s tariffs are hunkering down and waiting because they don t know when whether or how his yearlong trade war with china will end or which other countries the president might target next consider xcel brands a new york based company that owns such brands as halston isaac mizrahi and c wonder two years ago it made all its clothing in china now it s on the move diversifying production to vietnam cambodia

moving things around said ceo robert d loren trump launched the world s biggest trade war since the 1930s by imposing tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods and threatening to tax 300 billion more he has pursued separate battles with america s allies too from south korea mexico and canada to japan and the european union over trade in steel aluminum and autos faced with the prospect of a forever war with america s trading partners numerous businesses say they re delaying investment decisions and reviewing their business relationships until they have a clearer view of how trump s trade wars might end if they will shifting to other countries could slash xcel brands labor costs in half this is crucial d loren said because fashion companies have little ability to raise prices and would have to absorb the cost of higher import taxes the trend of manufacturers leaving china predates trump s trade wars with wages and other costs in china rising companies were already shifting toward lower wage countries from vietnam to mexico a few have considered shifting production to the united states hurt by trump tariffs on the metals used to make brass coins 4 u which markets coins for awards and

manager for the company based in cheyenne wyoming but it isn t simple for some companies to completely abandon china where specialized suppliers cluster in manufacturing centers and make it convenient for factories to obtain parts when they need them over the past five years columbia sportswear has cut its manufacturing presence in china by more than 60 but some products can t be made elsewhere the company says because they re highly specialized and dependent on significant investments in tooling machinery and personnel training columbia s sorel style shoe for example features a hidden wedge heel that requires proprietary tooling and machinery moving its remaining production out of china columbia says would cost at least 3 million in machinery require it to hire and train a new workforce

uncertainty in u s china trade relations some companies worry that there may be no way out of trump s trade wars disputes that seemed to have been resolved can suddenly flare up again less than two weeks after the u s lifted steel and aluminum tariffs on mexico a move that seemed to signal a return to harmony in north american trade trump in may threatened to impose heavy tariffs on mexican
