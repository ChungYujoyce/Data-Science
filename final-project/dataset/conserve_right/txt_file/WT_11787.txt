the basis for trump administration plans to impose tariffs on chinese technology products and to curb investment by chinese firms in the coming weeks the detailed report citing u s government information says cnooc ordered the 3pla to spy on several u s oil and gas companies engaged in cutting edge shale gas technology the report outlines two cases involving u s companies that were hacked by 3pla the chinese military hackers in one case broke into a u s company s network and stole details of its plans for negotiating a deal with cnooc cnooc attributed their ultimate success in the

chinese intelligence officials including a pla director liu xiaobei endorsed the use of the intelligence information in the talks between cnooc and the company cnooc also employed the 3pla in a second

gen liu said the united states is the main target of chinese cyberoperations because it is the birthplace of the internet and controls its core resources the u s adopted a double standard regarding internet control internally the u s implemented tight control while externally the u s wantonly expanded he said the u s took advantage of its absolute superiority of the internet and vigorously promoted network interventionism in order to reinforce ideological penetration and it secretly supported hostile forces to create obstructions and conduct acts of sabotage gen liu has accused the united states of trying to subvert communist party rule in china through influencing the chinese public via the internet he made clear in published interviews that china is engaged in information warfare against america the internet has become a new field and platform for ideological struggle he said accordingly we must not lower our guard we must take control of the commanding height of the internet and maintain both the initiative and discourse power gen liu in another report criticized the united states for suborning chinese academics and targeting the pla recalling what the u s has done over the past 30 years whether they win over academics by taking advantage of foundations or affect major decision makers by utilizing ideological penetration u s actions have enjoyed great success within china s academic and ideological circles he said the last obstacle is china s military he added even if the u s cannot disintegrate china s armed forces or turn china s military against itself the u s can at least suppress the combat wisdom and willpower of china s armed forces chinese technology theft cost speaking of chinese information thievery the u s trade representative report on chinese unfair trade practices estimates that beijing s intellectual property theft costs americans 225 billion to 600 billion annually in lost information the losses are one reason the trump administration is imposing 50 billion to 60 billion in tariffs on imports from china those tariffs however do not cover the additional billions of dollars in losses caused by china s cyberthefts administration officials said a new report by a commission of the national bureau of asian research bolsters the u s trade representative s report noting that china is behind 87 percent of all intellectual property theft incidents globally the scourge of ip theft and cyber espionage likely continues to cost the u s economy hundreds of billions of dollars a year despite improved laws and regulations the report by the commission on the theft of american intellectual property states china s falling satellite sometime this week a bus sized chinese satellite is expected to fall out of orbit and come back to earth the impact area of the tiangong 1 space station is expected to enter the atmosphere sometime from saturday to wednesday and although it is expected to burn up some pieces may reach the surface the impact zone covers the entire continental united states defense analysts are calling on china to use one of its new anti satellite missiles to destroy the falling space station to prevent any debris from posing a danger that was what the navy successfully did back in 2008 when a nonfunctioning national reconnaissance office satellite was destroyed with a modified navy sm 3 anti missile interceptor fired from a ship west of hawaii by exploding the falling nro satellite the blast created smaller pieces all of which burned up in the atmosphere contact bill g
