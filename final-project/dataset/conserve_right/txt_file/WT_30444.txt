ether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion the democratic party s race to the bottom continues after the horrific mass shootings this past weekend in el paso texas and dayton ohio democrats never trumpers and their media propagandists didn t even bother wiping from their minds for a moment their all consuming hatred for president donald trump and his supporters and instead saw the murder of 31 people and injury of 50 others as a political opportunity the rest of humanity sees their actions as an ugly and ghoulish play for power top stories n y gov andrew cuomo s careless cruelty shows in coronavirus nursing home policy n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick gop vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid no matter your political opinion normal people come together to mourn when tragedy strikes not these people instead of embracing their neighbors and constituents they decided that blaming the president of the united states and his millions of supporters for the insane actions of a clearly disturbed individual was too good an opportunity make no mistake believing your race is superior to other races is in itself a mental illness to then decide that murdering those people is somehow warranted by your bigotry is absolutely a disturbed thing to do but the democratic narrative requires the normalization of white nationalism that they now claim has swept across america it would have to because they tell us that mr trump is a white nationalist and so to support him makes you one too or as former special counsel robert mueller might note the mob has found no evidence of the white nationalist crimes we have committed but we have also not been exonerated of those crimes is there racism in america of course and we work on those issues as americans every day but white nationalism this time magazine headline from may 26 2019 gives us perspective about who we are as a nation 9 people showed up for a kkk rally in dayton ohio they were drowned out by 600 protestors but now with the failure of the russia dossier hoax the only thing the democrats have left is the everyone is a white nationalist hoax the shooter in el paso was a murderous lunatic with a manifesto hodgepodge including racist rantings coupled with leftist screeds about the environment evil corporations and the importance of a universal basic income no one but the shooter is responsible for the massacre and the democrats blaming mr trump know that but as usual liberals and trump haters can t control themselves and never know when to stop no matter the damage they cause if they can punish mr trump and the nation that elected him former mccain campaign staffer and now msnbc personality nicolle wallace made that agenda clear when during her show on monday she claimed mr trump talked about exterminating latinos she said what do you do when certainly the last republican president fought for sought and it s not ideal but had 44 percent of the latino vote it was so politically powerful inside the last republican administration president obama he used the power of the presidency to try to pass comprehensive immigration reform with the latino community latino leaders at the table and now you have a president talking about exterminating latinos that of course is a disgusting lie the next day she faux apologized on twitter noting i misspoke about trump calling for an extermination of latinos my mistake was unintentional and i m sorry trump s constant assault on people of color and his use of the word invasion to describe the flow of immigrants is intentional and constant misspoke one doesn t accidentally accuse someone of calling for the extermination of people it was a lie when she said it the apology is a lie and is meant to mock those who were shocked by her comment rep joaquin castro the twin brother of democratic presidential candidate julian castro tweeted out the names and employers of trump donors the daily caller reported castro whose district includes much of san antonio claimed the donors are fueling a campaign of hate that labels hispanic immigrants as invaders sad to see so many san antonians as 2019 maximum donors to donald trump the congressman wrote proceeding to name local businesses whose owners gave the maximum to trump s campaign trump campaign communications director tim murtaugh is demanding castro delete the post democrats want to talk about inciting violence this naming of private citizens and their employers is reckless and irresponsible he is endangering the safety of people he is supposed to be representing mr murtaugh said some were defending the action as nothing more than revealing information that is already public but that s not the issue and the castros know it this is about giving permission to the social media mob to attack the people on the list house minority whip steve scalise who was shot by a bernie sanders supporter attempting to assassinate the republican softball team at a practice in 2017 tweeted this to mr castro this isn t a game it s dangerous and lives are at stake i know this firsthand as of this writing joaquin castro has not deleted the tweet and continues to defend and promote his action the goal of the democrats in the aftermath of two national tragedies is clear frighten people with the lie that americans are racists the president is a racist organized racism is sweeping the country and everyone who supports the president is part of the problem at the same time they re gaslighting their own supporters to live in fear convincing them that everyone is out to get them these are disgusting and reprehensible acts delivered by the same people who use lies to lecture us that it s everyone else who is a danger to society tammy bruce president of independent women s voice author and fox news
