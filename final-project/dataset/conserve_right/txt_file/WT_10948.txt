apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic how things have changed since that heady evening in november 2008 when president elect barack obama beamed hope globally this week in asia our veteran president appears even less effective projecting american power and advancing commercial interests than jerry seinfeld was back in 1991 trying with jason alexander and julia louis dreyfus to bribe his way into a chinese restaurant reviewing analyses of president obama s latest interactions with a vast people whose collective economic growth and expanding geopolitical influence certainly will impact americans one cannot help worrying how china s deepening ties with russia may end up constraining options for the united states throughout the world top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed laughing and more serious matters relations among rival great powers give rise to gaffes and glimpses of humor and this jaunt follows true to form in instructive ways even before and certainly after mr obama landed on chinese soil his hosts did not seem much amused by our leader s nonchalance and antics after all they take protocol seriously meanwhile vladimir putin strode about evidently unfazed by western sanctions as he schmoozed his single largest energy customer however mr putin did manage to cross another line to his detriment when he draped his own coat to warm peng liyuan wife of chinese president xi jinping in an excess of gallantry below surface level substantive concerns swirled in contrast to russia s numerous and far reaching commercial energy supply contracts with china some hailed as historic a signing ceremony between china and america involving aspirations to reduce and constrain energy consumption patterns newly emboldened political adversaries did not allow the white house time for a partial victory lap over mr obama s latest gambit that could well crimp our vital energy sector well before it tames china s gargantuan and growing
