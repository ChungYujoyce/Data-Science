president s racist i think he s honest said mr woodson a macarthur foundation genius grant recipient who heads the woodson center in washington d c as i tweeted out he s rude crude and true as democrats and media figures continue to accuse mr trump of racism for his broadside at dangerous filthy baltimore black conservatives like mr woodson have come to the president s defense accusing critics of attempting to deflect attention from the wretched conditions in urban areas long run by democrats top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director the president is raising a legitimate issue that the conditions all over this country in low income black neighborhoods that have been controlled by democrats for the past 40 to 50 years have gotten worse for the people living there but not for their representatives said mr woodson they have personally prospered derrick wilburn executive director of rocky mountain black conservatives said that what president trump said is true but that democrats representing inner city areas want to avoid that conversation if you were a democrat helping to run inner city chicago baltimore washington d c los angeles st louis take your pick and you did not do everything in your power to deflect attention away from the results your policies have produced you re a fool mr wilburn said the racism issue has divided largely along partisan lines a quinnipiac university poll released tuesday found 51 of voters say they think mr trump is a racist 8 of republicans 56 of independents and 86 of democrats while 91 of republicans said he isn t racist sen tim scott south carolina republican has criticized mr trump in the past condemning the racially offensive language of an earlier tweet telling four minority democratic congresswomen to go back and help fix the countries they came from this time however mr scott told fox news there s no doubt that i don t find his tweets to have been racially motivated i think we should take the high road and spend more time talking about how to deal with the failed policies of the left frankly republican businessman herman cain said first of all the president is not a racist but that democrats instead of focusing on rats they want to focus on race they pointed to the president s opportunity zones initiative part of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act which provides tax breaks for companies to invest unrealized capital gains into low income rural and urban areas people in poverty aren t getting help they desperately need and the exact opposite is happening because of the president s opportunity zones mr scott said i m for truth no matter who tells it malcolm x baltimore trumpderangementsyndrome pic twitter com je70d2hwu1 while the democrats defend the rats in baltimore the president defends the citizens by exposing the corrupted politicians in baltimore the democrats cry racism while the citizens cry out for help votedemsout https t co d995gkqheu star parker founder and president of the center for urban renewal and education said the president s tweet has drawn attention not only to the baltimore district represented by democratic rep elijah cummings but to the 8 700 very very sick zip codes where people are living in rat infested government owned housing so the fact that the president is pointing to this challenge in our country is very very encouraging because once you have attention to a problem you might actually try to solve it ms parker said this is a conversation that s long overdue and this is a conversation donald trump is bringing to the forefront in his inaugural he said he wanted to fix the inner cities and this is part of his plan others pointed to the improving economic conditions for blacks under the trump administration black unemployment hit

wilburn a fellow at the centennial institute in lakewood colorado the statistics are all going in the right direction in terms of employment workforce participation household indebtedness virtually all of the federally measured household economic statistics are improving under this president s policies as a result he said they can t attack him on policy so all they can attack him on is he s a racist it s a desperate attempt to hang on to a voter bloc that message runs counter to the position adopted by commentators like cnn s don lemon who referred during this week s democratic presidential debates to mr trump s racist rhetoric and racist tweets attacking baltimore mr trump fired back by tweeting that in fact i am the least racist person in the world perhaps someone should explain to don that he is supposed to be neutral unbiased fair conservatives point out that mr trump is known for taking on his critics whatever their race his july 27 tweet about the abject poverty in mr cummings congressional district came after the congressman erupted at homeland security secretary kevin mcaleenan over conditions at the border baltimore which has lost about 3 of its population since the 2015 riots has a 22 poverty rate the second highest violent crime rate and the worst homicide rate of the 50 largest cities in 2017 even mr cummings said in 1999 that parts of the city were drug infested if calling mr trump a racist brings attention to baltimore s plight then so be it ms parker said they can call someone whatever they want to she said if calling him a racist helped the problem then i hope they continue to call him racist keep calling him a racist so that people will focus on what he s saying which is this is
