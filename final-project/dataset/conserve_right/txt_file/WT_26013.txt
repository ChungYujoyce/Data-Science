tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn the first major battle for president trump s prized space force is being waged here on earth as three states each with its own convincing case to make to be the epicenter of the u s aerospace industry compete for a key component of the military s 21st century space initiative pride branding and a lot of add on business development are at stake alabama california and colorado are the three finalists to host u s space command a unified hub similar to u s central command or u s cyber command which will oversee and coordinate all aspects of pentagon space policy the establishment of space command is a key step in the process of standing up mr trump s full space force which in time would become the sixth branch of the armed forces top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning a new military branch requires congressional approval and the idea remains caught in legislative limbo on capitol hill still pentagon officials say u s space command can be organized relatively quickly and easily once selected the home of space command will become the center for all military space related programs which are currently spread across various areas of the military today we need a command and a commander that spends 100 of their time focused on space acting defense secretary patrick m shanahan said earlier this month as space command comes to fruition the host state can expect tens of millions of dollars in economic investment and bragging rights as one of the country s leading technological hot spots regional officials say the selection will cement the winner as the unquestioned leader of the military aerospace nexus the defense department this month announced the three states being considered for the post criteria include cost location quality internet connections existing military facilities access to airfields and office space and parking to handle a 1 450 member workforce the list was first reported by cnn specifically the pentagon reportedly is considering six bases four in colorado one in california and one in alabama as space command headquarters sales job in interviews with the washington times economic and aerospace officials from each of the three states talked about their public and private sales pitches to the trump administration each state stresses that it already has a deep

development at the colorado springs chamber of commerce our infrastructure is largely in place he said in all aspects of infrastructure and community colorado springs is ready to support this new
