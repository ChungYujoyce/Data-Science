christopher bodeen associated press beijing ap foreign policy hard liner john bolton s appointment as u s national security adviser comes at a particularly sensitive time for relations with beijing following president donald trump s approval of new tariffs on china and a law encouraging closer relations with taiwan bolton has taken a tough position on both issues saying beijing needed to be called out on what he characterized as systematic cheating on global trade while enjoying the benefits of an open u s market he has also urged a rethink of u s restrictions of contacts with taiwan the self governing island democracy that china considers its own territory on those and other issues bolton a former u n ambassador under president george w bush is seen as heralding a rightward shift in trump s foreign policy and an embrace of more hard line policies his appointment also raised questions over policy toward north korea following trump s acceptance of an offer for direct talks possibly before may chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said the importance of china u s relations outweighed personnel matters no matter who takes the post of any kind the significance of china u s relations needs no further explanation and it will never change hua said at a regularly scheduled news briefing to strengthen cooperation and uphold the principles of mutual respect and benefit is in line with the two sides interests and meets the expectation of the international community hua said china also hopes the u s will stick with the iran nuclear agreement a deal both bolton and trump

north korea appears to be everything china has warned against including supporting the possibility of a pre emptive military strike and dismissing direct negotiations that beijing says are vital to jump starting the denuclearization process like trump bolton has also been highly critical of the u s trade deficit with china which washington says hit a record of 375 2 billion last year in an interview thursday with the fox business network bolton accused china of stealing u s intellectual property and pursuing mercantilist policies in what is supposed to be a free trade environment i don t buy it i am a free trader but i don t think that means just getting pounded into the ground when another country doesn t abide by the commitments it s made bolton said bolton said china cheats by providing subsidies to exports and discriminating against foreign entities including through the legal system while enjoying the benefits of wto membership chinese government subsidies allow americans to buy goods cheaper to the detriment of the chinese worker he said the reality is china just doesn t have the same concern for its citizen s welfare that we do in this country bolton said and even beyond that there s simply no excuse for the stealing of intellectual property forced technology transfers it s sometimes called speaking to the washington free beacon newspaper in february 2017 bolton criticized america s one china policy under which it does not recognize taiwan as an independent nation and called for increased arms sales to the island the one china policy is inherently ambiguous bolton said china thinks it means one thing we think it means another bolton s appointment was loudly cheered by one of the administration s chief china hawks trade and manufacturing adviser peter navarro author of the book death by china confronting the dragon a global call to action i ve gotten to know him over the years and he ll be a great replacement so what we are seeing here is a president who has great judge of talent navarro told cnn on thursday though trump ultimately follows his own instincts bolton will have a sort of influence on trump s foreign diplomacy because they share a similar view on matters such as ideology threats to u s national security and values said yu wanli professor at the peking university s school of international relations in beijing trump now has a faithful implementer of his policies yu said bolto
