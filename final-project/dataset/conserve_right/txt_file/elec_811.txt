but one thing in particular kept coming up namely a number of the democratic presidential wannabes kept badmouthing profit in fact several of the democratic candidates seemed to view the existence of profit making enterprises as one of the biggest threats facing america here is a list of every time someone demonized profit during the democratic debates so we ve had an industrial policy in the united states for decades now and it s basically been let giant corporations do whatever they want to do giant corporations have exactly one loyalty and that is to profits and if they can save a nickel by moving a job to mexico or to asia or to canada they re going to do it health care it s not just a human right it should be an american right and i believe the best way to get there is medicare for all but i have an urgency about this when i am president of the united states i m not going to wait we have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care and on this debate i m sorry there are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in america from pharmaceutical companies to insurers the insurance companies last year alone sucked 23 billion in profits out of the health care system 23 billion and that doesn t count the money that was paid to executives the money that was spent lobbying washington we have a giant industry that wants our health care system to stay the way it is because it s not working for families but it s sure as heck working for them i have been to some of the largest private prisons which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration and their immigration lockups the debate we re having in our party right now is confusing because the truth is there s a big difference between capitalism on the one hand and greed on the other and so all the things that we re trying to change is when companies care more about profits when they do about people i believe we need to get to universal health care as a right and not a privilege to single payer the quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers god bless the insurers if they want to compete they can certainly try but they ve never put people over their profits and i doubt they ever will let s be clear let us be very clear the function of health care today from the insurance and drug company perspective is not to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way the function of the health care system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies we will have medicare for all when tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their day is gone that health care is a human right not something to make huge profits off of but the worst thing president trump has done is he s diverted the funds away from cross border terrorism cross border human trafficking drug trafficking and gun trafficking and he s given that money to the for profit prisons i would not be spending money in for profit prisons to lock up children and asylum seekers advertisement next actually joe biden and the obama administration deported more people than trump zuri davis is an assistant editor at reason show comments 64 editor s note we invite comments and request that they be civil and on topic we do not moderate or assume any

impoverished from always working pro bono btw several weeks ago a search showed that among the ds in the pile of turds hoping for selection only one had actually worked at a job and that turned out to be a consulting firm which had been supported by mom and dad i think this is important not a one of this pathetic collection of quasi commies has ever had to produce something of value and figure out how to sell it to the public not a one max working the truck to replace your toilet isn t real familiar with a p l statement and truth be known that guy or gal paid to come up with the newest ap probably isn t either but they both probably know that their paycheck depends on the company they work for showing a profit since it s likely mentioned at the company christmas party the d message will resonate with those in academia the press and low end whiners and the ds do not have a clue and the only one who denounced socialism hickenlooper is polling at 0 percent they will be shocked when trump wins re election though because they will literally have never met anyone who liked him pauline kael all over again i think there s an argument to be made the 30b or whatever it is annual profits of private health insurers is a small vig to pay to keep everything from becoming a federal shitshow what mean what i mean is the candidates act like the profit going to private insurance companies is somehow a large driver of health care costs considering we spend something like 3 5t annually on healthcare an extra 1 to not have the federal government make a mess of everything doesn t seem like a huge deal what i mean is the candidates act like the profit going to private insurance companies is somehow a large driver of health care costs gracie living in sf it s not uncommon where i end up pointing out that the average profit of even huge operations averages to 7 given that it is sf some witless folks claim the government could do it for less they re the ones who haven t had to deal with the dmv recently to be fair i immediately scrub my brain of any memories associated with the dmv too it s simple a simple sanity preservation measure when the occupy movement was a thing i went to the encampment in pittsburgh one day i was in my late 20s so i blended in and pointed out to several of the protestors i saw on i phones that apple sold their phone at a nearly 400 profit while exxon the company many of the signs derided only operated on a 10 profit margin you could literally hear the gears screech to a halt in their brain as they scrambled to rationalize it btw i still see you sig as the tail number hayward traffic this is piper november juliet 2 alfa zulu entering downwind 30b will be a rounding error if the government nationalizes health care 1 tell it to jfree who claims that the medical care industry is involved in all sorts of nefarious capital expenditures as a result of government regulations and then hint hint nudge nudge tells us that more government involvement will really make things ducky since libertarians don t know from economics jfree june 27 2019 at 1 25 pm medicare pays far far less than private rates and the higher rates from private payers is part of what keeps hospitals afloat financially which would mean that someone would have to be paid less and it wouldn t just be insurance companies it would be nurses and doctors therapists and billing specialists the entire universe of middle class jobs that america s health care industry supports gawdallfuckingmighty libertarian authors are the stupidest economic thinkers in the world it is not the responsibility of medicare the taxpayer to ensure that specialists and others in the healthcare industry are the highest paid in the world it is not the responsibility of medicare the taxpayer to ensure that hospital revenues and expenses can keep rising by 5 or so per year forever is there excess capacity in rural hospitals yeah cuz hospitals everywhere have spent decades using their profit margins to keep increasing capacity and growing new services not generally as a rational decision based on the roi of that marginal capacity but because non profits have to plow those profits back into their business or get taxed on them and they all seemed to prefer buying expensive new tech that would be underutilized but still have to paid for via increased charges for everything in future years rather than keep an endowment reserve so that they didn t need to raise prices so much every fucking year and now hospitals aren t well positioned as outpatient and clinic and lower tech choices are proving to be substitutable for inpatient hospitals are not in a precarious financial position anyway whatever issues they are gonna have realigning a squeeze on their income statement to an excessive inefficient balance sheet has almost nothing to do with medicare it has everything to do with 40 years of squeezing customers way beyond customers financial ability to keep being squeezed the problem is not some stupid pol talking about medicare for all the problem is the lack of a pol saying we are responsible to taxpayers and beneficiaries and it s about time we use our group leverage on their behalf this perpetually excessive medical inflation is over it s the same thing re higher education except that the solution in higher education is far easier please feel free to beat on that stupid son of a bitch every chance you get he deserves it why do i have to talk to jfree who did i piss off to get that job no way you have to talk to that fucking ignoramus just mock him every chance you get i ll pencil him in between tony and the hihn socks ran across a cnn fact check that confirmed 23b profit in health insurance industry in 2018 up from like 16 17b in 2017 then they threw in an interesting tidbit that surprised me not for the information it contained but the fact that it was included at all profit margin rose to 3 3 in 2018 from 2 4 in 2017 hmm i guess that they figure their audience is too dumb to consider that or the authors don t realize the implication and just threw that in there to spice things up with another number because that really puts the insurance vilification into context and it s ridiculous i ve known this for a couple years having looked it up while debating the issue at the time through 2015 i think average profit margins for a medical insurance 4 b commercial hospitals 8 c nonprofit hospitals 12 i also found that of the 15 most profitable by margin industries 7 were healthcare providers 1 was accounting with an average of 23 or 24 i m no fan of the industry but insurance was always the wrong target and it wouldn t be a scam without misdirection progressives want control and a dependent population so they make the problem fit their solution regardless of where costs really come from it might be noted that the ama is one of the most powerful lobbies in dc as well i think medical insurance topped out around 10 average profit margin pre aca it has never been much above 5 that i can ever find they make the problem fit their solution no shit try telling your doctor he is billing you too much and don t act surprised when he tells you to set your own fucking broken arm or in biden s case refuses to refill his viagra prescription that amount is less than the gao findings of fraud in medicare alone dems should love profit something to tax it s also conservationist profit is the difference between what people are willing to pay for a good or service and what it costs society to produce that good or service companies that earn the biggest profits are wasting the fewest resources and providing what people want the most eh that s generally true but there are a enough businesses that use artificial scarcity to prop up their own profit margins which is antithetical to providing people what they want most unless that thing is an expensive product used as a status symbol then fair enough that it s a thing that s not to say they shouldn t be allowed to do that just that they do eh that s generally true but there are a enough businesses that use artificial scarcity to prop up their own profit margins cite please perhaps he s referring to things like this straight from the pages of reason ok but that s rent seeking the business can t create artificial scarcity they have to enlist the government artificial scarcity name one pretty much every government regulation is designed to lead to artificial scarcity hence the plethora of lobbyists 2 cory booker there are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in america from pharmaceutical companies to insurers so we re gonna ban opioids this is the same kind of thought of those wayfair employees they re distraught by the conditions in the refugee camps when they found their company sold products to help furnish the refugee camps they decided to walk out of work because how dare they sell their products to someone wanting to help refugees exactly what i thought they want the illegals to sleep on the ground maybe they will all send their next paycheck for ethan allen beds for the illegals we have a giant industry that wants our health care system to stay the way it is because it s not working for families but it s sure as heck working for them but at least it was much worse before obamacare right or are they pissing over a signature democratic achievement obamacare was bought and paid for by the insurance lobby check the stocks of the big insurers since passage up about 800 forcing everyone to buy policies with all of the so called essential services means everyone buys all coverage whether they need it or not very profitable to sell things like maternity pediatric care birth control coverage to people beyond child bearing likewise to force young healthy people into max coverage plans you ve been duped by the false promise of good intentions sold to you indirectly by those you think you have beaten obamacare was bought and paid for by the insurance lobby cite missing you missed another couple of screeds against profit the used code words instead of the word profit they called it greed they railed against the greed of the pharmaceutical industry the greed of the insurance industry but also the greed of gun manufacturers and strangely the greed of the nra yes for some reason they cast the nra s support of the second amendment as motivated by greed yes in the private sector it s called greed in politics it s called goodwill the nra does kind of look like they care more about money than about supporting the 2a haha yeah when i saw there were only 9 examples of scapegoating listed i thought wow they were really holding back last night i did not watch also this being a libertarian publication someone needs to take a hard stand on the definition of terms and political philosophy there was a broad swath of candidates over the two nights who repeated their belief that healthcare is a right it was actually a pretty consistent applause line for the debate audience as everyone here knows this completely misunderstands the difference between rights and needs 1 that was the thing that struck me while i was watching they keep saying healthcare is a right and nobody asks them how so you can t expect nbc msnbc s moderators cheerleaders to ask such unseemly questions nor at whose expense they also could brush up on the difference between a right and a benefit here s a hint your right cannot cost other people money you d think this would not be hard to understand and this is what gets the left all fired up if you really believe that you have a right that is being ignored then you have a grievance then you vote for the politicians that falsely tell you that you have a right to have the government force other people to pay for your basic needs all one has to do is create enough victims and grievance to run for the dem nomination for president frickin cynical man haha here s a hint your right cannot cost other people money you re preaching to the choir here but there are commenters who simply do not agree they think if someone needs it enough they can confiscate your property to pay to supply that need btw they think they are generous and you are selfish tara smith defines an individual right as a moral claim to freedom of action where by moral she means bioethical and by freedom she means without coercing or being coerced glenn kessler over at the post has done a pretty good job of factchecking the debates and of course is being crucified for it by the readership https www washingtonpost com politics 2019 06 28 fact checking first democratic debate night utm term 2238948abf93 i m thinking this is the election for defensive voting voting to ensure that what ever f up the dems nominate does not get elected we could always follow their example vote early vote often appealing to the self interest of a business to provide you with necessary services may feel dirtier than appealing to the better nature of a government apparatchik but it is more reliable how dare people get paid to do work the only thing people should ever get paid for is voting democrat elizabeth warren the insurance companies last year alone sucked 23 billion in profits out of the health care system 23 billion there s about 330 million people in the us so insurance companies made about 70 per person in profit over an entire year that s like 2 5 hours of work at the median wage about 10 hours at minimum wage so the average person spends more on phone apps than they spend on health insurance industry profits and i m supposed to worry about this warren knows for a fact that her target audience is more than just economically illiterate they also can t or won t even do basic math here s every single time someone scapegoated profit during the dem debates beyond the retard partisan rhetoric do these people really think that profit is bad in the broadest sense profit means the gain from an activity or investment is more than the cost and includes non monetary values if i plant a bushel of corn as seed then i hope i get more than a bushel of corn as a crop ignoring all the other inputs getting 2 bushels or more indicates a profitable venture right do progressives really think that is bad i don t think you will like the real answer to that question do they think profit is bad yes for anyone except themselves they are the only ones that should enjoy good things everyone else should be under their heel and doing what they are told that s sure teh implication of at least 3 weird idea that there was 23 million that was in the health care system that got sucked out rather than that 23 billion of value that was never there before got created and profited from but can anyone translate 9 into english what s she talking about fines that were taken from international terrorists and smugglers and used to pay for their imprisonment where was that money going otherwise but can anyone translate 9 into english well proggie english kids are starving cause profit and here s what makes democrats undeniably so stupid every time we jam more government regulations plans and procedures into the mix those corporations profits just get bigger and bigger and healthcare just keeps getting more and more expensive so lets lobby for more government healthcare plans as if government bookies agencies and legislation was not only the cheapest i e next to free service but actually having the very thought all that extra leg work and monopolizing is actually going to save the people money here s every single time someone scapegoated profit during the dem debates there was another socialist irked abt profits name escapes me but his planks read we therefore demand complete confiscation of all war profits we demand profit sharing in big business we demand a ruthless fight against those whose activities harm the common good traitors usurers profiteers and so forth are to be punished with death regardless of church and race cory booker i have been to some of the largest private prisons which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration and their immigration lockups i can t argue with that private prisons should be abolished altho their profits aren t a major issue to me their mere existence is abhorrent these democrats remind me of old time puritan work ethic in which you are not allowed to enjoy your profits a long time ago democrats and leftists were revolted at people enriching themselves in business instead of investing in the politics of building community and building community acceptance of having and enjoying those profits they have been reflexively anti profit ever since please log in to post comments john stossel 5 27 2020 12 30 am jacob sullum 5 27 2020 12 01 am stewart baker 5 26 2020 7 19 pm eugene volokh 5 26 2020 6 59 pm
