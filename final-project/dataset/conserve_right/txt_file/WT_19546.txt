not be silenced ms omar meanwhile said mr trump is pushing the agenda of the white nationalists and that his comments are racist because they are attacks only on women of color in refusing to back down the president showed within 48 hours that he relishes portraying the four liberal democrats as the extremist face of the party in 2020 ms omar has been roundly criticized for saying that some

that hate our country mr trump told reporters they hate it i think with a passion politicians can t be afraid to take them on he directed most of his ire at ms omar he said she hates jews and hates israel i hear the way she talks about al qaeda the president said al qaeda has killed many americans a politician that hears somebody where we re at war with al qaeda and sees somebody talking about how great al qaeda is that was omar we re losing great soldiers to al qaeda marc short chief of staff to vice president mike pence said the criticism of ms omar is accurate i don t think that the president s intent in any way is racist he told reporters i think he s trying to point out the fact that since elected it s hard to find anything ilhan omar has said that actually is supportive of the united states of america the president criticized ms ocasio cortez for opposing amazon s plan to add a headquarters to her district in new york city it would ve been a good deal tens of thousands of jobs and new york has not been the same since that happened mr trump said it s really hurt new york and new york city amazon was going to go there they were going to relocate a major section of their business in new york she kept them out that was a terrible thing she did the president said some of the lawmakers have said horrible things about israel all they do is complain mr trump said so all i m saying is if they want to leave they can leave i don t know who s going to miss them but i guess some people will ms omar accused mr trump of hypocrisy she said his 2016 campaign was based on the theme that america wasn t good enough he talked about everything that was wrong in this country and how he was going to make it great ms omar said and so for him to condemn us and to say we are un american for wanting to work hard to make this country be the country we all deserve to live in complete hypocrisy ms ocasio cortez said of the president weak minds and leaders challenge loyalty to our country in order to avoid challenging and debating the policy he does not know how to defend his policies so what he does is attack us personally instead he tells us that i should go back to the great borough of the bronx and make it better she quipped some republicans including sen lindsey graham of south carolina were advising mr trump to tone down his rhetoric mr president you re going to win in 2020 just knock it down a notch mr graham said on fox friends he said the president needs to aim higher when talking about the liberal house democrats talk about their policies mr graham said as if speaking directly to mr trump they re american citizens that are duly elected that are running on an agenda that s disgusting they re anti semitic they re socialist you re right about their policies just aim higher don t get personal the president said he rejected that advice i disagree with lindsey on that mr trump said he said aim higher what am i going to do wait until we get somebody else in a higher position a higher office these are people that hate our country the voter will decide but when i hear the way they talk about our country when i hear the anti semitic language they use when i hear the hatred they have for israel and the love they have for enemies like al qaeda i will tell you that i do not believe this is good for the democrat party certainly it s not the party that i ve known over the years senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat said mr trump s comments drip with racism and criticized republican lawmakers for failing to call out the president you are making a deal with the devil said mr schumer wagging his finger the president of the united states is supposed to bring this country together it is clear this president won t doesn t want to and revels in dividing us no american president has done this at least two republican senators also criticized mr trump sen tim scott of south carolina the lone black republican in the senate said mr trump engaged in unacceptable personal attacks and racially offensive language he worried aloud that mr trump was helping unite a democratic party that was badly divided said sen patrick j toomey pennsylvania republican president trump was wrong to suggest that four left wing congresswomen should go back to where they came from three of the four were born in america and the citizenship of all four is as valid as mine we should defeat their ideas on the merits but sen steve daines montana republican said he was standing with mr trump montanans are sick and tired of listening to anti american anti semite radical democrats trash our country and our ideals he said in a twitter post this is america we re the greatest country in the world tom howell jr seth mclaughlin and bailey vog
