operations see also islamic state video shows beheading of american photojournalist but as soon as some accounts are blocked others spring up to circumvent the crackdown the islamic state has been forced by twitter to shift its focus to less widely used social media including diaspora an open media network with about 1 million users twitter by contrast has an estimated 500 million users several central and regional islamic state twitter accounts were moved recently to diaspora see also china secretly conducts second test of new hypersonic missile for islamic state members continuing to use
