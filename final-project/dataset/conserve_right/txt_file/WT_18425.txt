apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic chicago ap an artist admitted friday to taking shortcuts in crafting an often harrowing tale about apple inc s operations in china after the veracity of his one man theatrical show was challenged by a public radio program that had based a broadcast on his work but writer mike daisey said he stands by his monologue and called what he does theater and not journalism it uses a combination of fact memoir and dramatic license to tell its story and i believe it does so with integrity daisey said in a statement posted on his website top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots citing what he called numerous fabrications ira glass the host of the popular public radio show this american life said he could not vouch for the truth of a jan 6 broadcast excerpted from daisey s critically acclaimed one man show the agony and the ecstasy of steve jobs later friday the new york times said it had removed a questionable paragraph from the online archive of an op ed piece daisey wrote for the newspaper in october daisey also twisted the truth about his time in china during an interview with the associated press late last year paul colford a spokesman for the news cooperative said the ap was reviewing its coverage of daisey to determine what corrections will be necessary daisey is currently performing at the public theater in new york which issued a statement saying it stands by what it called a powerful work of art mike is an artist not a journalist the statement said nevertheless we wish he had been more precise with us and our audiences about what was and wasn t his personal experience in the piece in his monologue daisey describes meeting very young workers who put in very long hours and were forced to do crippling repetitive motions at factories that make apple products in china some he claimed had been poisoned by a chemical called hexane but this american life says a china correspondent for the public radio show marketplace named rob schmitz located and interviewed daisey s chinese interpreter who disputed much of the artist s claims daisey in an interview with glass broadcast as part of friday s episode of the american life admitted that he didn t meet any poisoned workers and guessed at the ages of some of the workers he met this american life said in its statement that staffers asked daisey for his interpreter s contact information while fact checking the story daisey replied the cellphone number he had for her didn t work anymore and he had no way to reach her at that point we should ve killed the story glass said but other things daisey told us about apple s operations in china checked out and we saw no reason to doubt him apple has been rebutting daisey s allegations for months to little effect the times also wrote an investigative series in january on dangerous working and living conditions for people who make apple products in china including explosions inside factories making ipads where four people were killed and 77 were injured an apple spokeswoman declined to comment friday daisey spokesman philip rinaldi said friday his client was not speaking to anyone about this right now the original this american life episode mr daisey and the apple factory has become the most popular podcast in the history of this american life with nearly 890 000 downloads daisey also claimed in an interview with ap late last year that he met chinese workers whose joints in their hands had disintegrated because they were doing the same motion hundreds of thousands of times i know that people in charge know about these things and chose not to address them and that s hard to swallow when you see the damage it does and you know how little it would take to ameliorate a high degree of human suffering he said then the times which published daisey s op ed piece following steve jobs death in early october removed a paragraph from the online version that discussed conditions at apple s factory in china the newspaper posted an editor s note warning readers that the section had been removed because questions have been raised about the truth the rest of the piece is his opinion as a performer and a thinker said eileen murphy a times spokeswoman if this were a news story it would be a different situation it s not it s an op ed in his original monologue daisey splices jobs career milestones and the transformation of apple from a david into a goliath with more personal stories about his own connection to the computer maker he has said that when he saw four photos posted online taken by workers at a chinese factory to test the iphone but mistakenly not erased he suddenly realized people not robots were putting the sleek devices together in interviews and on stage daisey has said he traveled to the chinese industrial zone of shenzhen and interviewed hundreds of workers from foxconn technology group the world s largest electronics contract manufacturer who suffered from their work it s like carpal tunnel on a scale we can scarcely imagine he said while performing the show in new york in october in this weekend s this american life daisey tells glass he felt conflicted about presenting things that he knew weren t true but he said he felt trapped and was afraid people would no longer care about the abuses at the factories if he didn t present things in a dramatic way i m not going to say that i didn t take a few shortcuts in my passion to be heard he tells glass daisey has performed the monologue for some 50 000 people from seattle to washington d c and it is at the public theater until sunday daisey was expected to take the show on tour but its future is now in doubt ap drama writer mark kennedy and associated press business writer ryan
