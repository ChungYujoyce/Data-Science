would do if president donald trump tried to fire or demote him powell offered the same terse reply he s given in the past when asked about trump s attacks on his leadership and the president s insistence that he has authority to remove the chairman powell said he intends to serve out his full four year term which ends in early 2022 the president has repeatedly accused powell and the fed of keeping credit too tight for too long and of thereby holding back the economy and the stock market most experts dispute trump s assertion that he has authority to either fire powell or demote him from the chairman s post and his attacks have raised alarms that he s undermining the fed s long recognized independence from political pressure powell s description wednesday of a more downbeat economic landscape led most economists to conclude that a quarter point rate cut is a virtual certainty at the fed s meeting in three weeks with many forecasting further rate cuts to come some characterized a

wednesday began two days of his testimony on capitol hill on thursday he will address the senate banking committee at the moment the u s economic landscape is a mixed one the job market appears resilient but economic growth is slowing many forecasters predict that growth has slowed to an annual rate of around 2 in the just completed april june quarter in his testimony powell said the economy has fared reasonably well over the first half of the year but he noted that crosscurrents such as trade tensions and concerns about global growth have been weighing on economic activity and the outlook he said that growth in business investment seems to have slowed notably possibly because of concerns over slowing global growth and the trade battle between the trump administration and china
