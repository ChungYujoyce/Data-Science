apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic tensions boiled over at the house judiciary committee s impeachment hearing monday when republican lawmakers accused the democratic majority of writing their own rules and then breaking them to choreograph a takedown of president trump the squabbles highlighted the deep partisan divide over impeachment as democrats prepare to put forward at least two articles of impeachment tuesday one for abuse of power and another for obstructing congress the associated press reported citing sources familiar with the discussions the fast track process tees up an impeachment vote possibly before christmas and helps kick the partisan showdown into high gear see also democrats poised to unveil 2 impeachment articles vs trump you weren t elected by anybody rep matt gaetz florida republican shouted at daniel goldman a house democratic counsel who was testifying about evidence supporting impeachment charges including abuse of power obstruction and inviting foreign interference in the 2020 election mr gaetz s sharp words were part of a series of confrontations over the unusual setup of the hearing before the judiciary committee congressional staff such as mr goldman acted as both witnesses and interrogators and the proceeding lacked any of the fact witnesses who testified before the house permanent select committee on intelligence which conducted an inquiry before sending the impeachment case to the judiciary committee republicans repeatedly objected to the proceedings but chairman jerrold nader new york democrat overruled them each time rep louie gohmert a texas republican who was speaking over mr nadler s calls that he was out of order objected to democratic counsel barry berke s dual roles of testifying from the witness panel and then asking questions from the dais i ve been a judge and i know that you don t get to be a witness and a judge in the same case that s my point of order he should not be up here mr gohmert said mr nadler said mr berke was not serving as a witness but more of a presenter when he explained the impeachment evidence to the committee republicans railed about being denied a minority hearing which is guaranteed under house rules they objected to the absence of rep adam b schiff california democrat and chairman of the intelligence committee mr schiff led the impeachment inquiry and oversaw the drafting of the 300 page report outlining the evidence against mr trump the report laid the groundwork for the articles of impeachment stemming from mr trump s request for ukraine to investigate a political rival former vice president joseph r biden it is extraordinary that the president s conduct was a trifecta checking all three boxes of impeachment offense in the constitution mr berke said the hearing focused on the schiff report but the congressman did not present the findings testifying would have exposed him to republican questions about his office s early contact with the whistleblower who launched the impeachment inquiry and whether he helped direct the whistleblower s actions where s adam demanded rep doug collins of georgia the ranking republican on the committee republicans also expressed outrage that the report included subpoenaed phone records for mr trump s personal attorney rudolph w giuliani white house officials a journalist and rep devin nunes of california the ranking republican on the intelligence committee democrats said the timing of the calls suggested coordination of a pressure campaign against ukraine to investigate mr biden which is the crux of the impeachment case the names of the targets were listed in the public report it was a drive by it was a gratuitous drive by said mr collins that was nothing more than a smear campaign it s beneath you and it s beneath this congress rep f james sensenbrenner jr wisconsin republican said the democrats were creating a surveillance state you ve made joe mccarthy look like a piker he said at the white house mr trump dismissed the hearing as a hoax it s a disgrace he told reporters during a meeting on school choice with students and educators high school student myles bowers of pennsylvania told the president that he wants to become a psychiatrist that s good i could use you mr trump said to laughter democrats said the complaints that the process was partisan and unfair which have been a mainstay of republican challenges to impeachment served as a smokescreen for mr trump s wrongdoing we surely agree that no public official including and especially the president of the united states should use his public office for private gain mr nadler said he said both sides should be able to agree on the fact of the case if republicans remove their blinders the impeachment case stems from a july 25 phone call in which mr trump asked ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky for a favor by investigating mr biden and his son hunter as well as purported ukrainian meddling in the 2016 u s election a whistleblower who is believed to be a cia official assigned to the white house accused the president of abusing his power for personal gain on the call including withholding 391 million in u s military aid from ukraine as leverage the whistleblower also is believed to have ties to the democratic party and mr biden michael atkinson the intelligence community s inspector general who received the complaint acknowledged that the whistleblower had possible political bias but that the bias did not make his complaint noncredible sparks flew again when mr sensenbrenner accused mr berke of badgering republican counsel stephen r castor who presented the republican rebuttal to the democratic report we have to have some decorum here you have your rules of decorum which aren t comporting with everybody else s rules mr sensenbrenner told the chairman mr nadler shot back sharp cross examination of a witness is not badgering the witness the sparing snowballed when republicans took over the questioning of witnesses mr collins scolded mr goldman for appearing to disparage gordon sondland ambassador to the european union for donating about 1 million to mr trump s inaugural committee before his appointment the implication being he either got his job because he bought it or the implication being he was loyal to the president and say anything about him mr collins said be very careful about how you throw around dollars and giving because you and mr berke are real heavy donors to the democratic party and i m not going to say it questions your motives or your position here today what are you trying to say what is the implication here mr goldman said by the way i didn t give anything close to a million dollars mr gaetz cut off mr goldman the implication is we want schiff in that chair not you he shouted the gentleman does not have the time and the gentleman has been warned before said mr nadler banging his gavel dave boye
