tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap trump administration bargainers offered a one year budget freeze and said democratic spending demands remained too high as talks with congressional leaders aimed at averting deep cuts in defense and domestic programs seemed no closer to resolution wednesday after white house chief of staff mick mulvaney took shots at house speaker nancy pelosi democrats said white house involvement in the negotiations was hindering progress and rejected the proposed freeze the exchange suggested the two sides were not near a handshake to avert automatic cuts and instead boost both defense and domestic programs perhaps for two years without some agreement overall spending would be slashed by 125 billion starting next year a roughly 10 reduction in agency budgets that both parties consider too draconian top stories trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender emerging from a bargaining session in pelosi s office that lasted over an hour treasury secretary steven mnuchin said that without an accord the white house was prepared to prevent the automatic cut but would force agencies to live with a far less severe one year extension of this year s budget mnuchin said the administration would also agree to extend the federal debt limit for a year the government is projected to deplete its legal ability to borrow money after summer which would prompt an unprecedented failure by the government to repay its debt that could rattle the world s economy the president has every intention of keeping the government open and keeping the soundness of the full faith and credit of the government mnuchin told reporters he said both sides agreed not to hold the debt limit hostage to spending in a joint statement after the meeting pelosi d calif and senate minority leader chuck schumer d n y bristled at white house involvement in the negotiations they said democrats are committed to working with congressional republicans to avert automatic spending cuts a budget freeze and a federal default if the house and senate could work their will without interference from the president we could come to a good agreement much more quickly the two democrats said schumer later told reporters that unfortunately the white house has joined the talks he said senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is just in obeisance to the white house and so that s where we re stuck right now mcconnell spokesman doug andres said the leader has made clear that any deal has to be bipartisan and that includes the president s signature schumer also said a one year freeze is bad policy it s bad politics and it s a fall back we should be negotiating a bill schumer and mcconnell are also monitoring sidebar senate talks between the chairman and top democrat of the powerful appropriations committee who have one of the few fully functional bipartisan working relationships in washington those talks are more promising congressional aides said those senators richard shelby r ala and patrick leahy d vt have a dim view of the negotiating skills of mulvaney a former tea party lawmaker from south carolina who doesn t disguise his disdain for the go along get along style of the committee democrats have been pushing for increased spending for domestic programs not a freeze as a tradeoff for the big pentagon increases trump and congressional republicans are demanding mulvaney exiting the negotiating session said democrats had actually increased their demand for domestic spending since the last bargaining session in may to 647 billion which he said is 8 billion above their previous offer so you tell me if things are moving in the right direction last time i checked that s not how you compromise mulvaney said democrats said mulvaney misunderstood pelosi s numbers but she doesn t appear to be in a hurry and made no new spending offer wednesday making it clear that the democratic house wants to first pass its spending bills at its preferred higher figure the first such bill passed wednesday a huge 1 trillion measure that amounts to an opening bid in the ongoing guns vs butter fight with the administration the house voted along party lines to pass the bill which blends the military spending that s a priority for republicans with democratic sought funding increases for health and education programs the house passed bill far exceeds trump s budget request for domestic programs attracting a white house veto threat and denies him his full pentagon budget increase it also contains policy riders related to abortion and other hot button issues that drove away potential gop supporters though democrats sidestepped a potentially divisive battle by preserving a longtime ban on taxpayer financed abortion the bill boosts the pentagon budget by about 16 billion over current levels about a 2 increase while giving health education and labor programs an almost 7 boost those numbers would have to balance out more to gain trump s signature action on the measure comes as democrats have been struggling to get their message out above the political din of trump s washington the bill wraps four of the 12 annual spending measures into one and democrats are boasting of gains for head start health research and fighting the op
