as democrat terry mcauliffe barely clung to victory on tuesday having spent three times more money than his rival and with the backing of his popular patrons bill and hillary clinton mcaulliffe was breezing to victory just three weeks ago but his once stout lead in the polls over republican attorney general ken cuccinelli nearly vanished as voter outrage over the crash landing of obamacare
