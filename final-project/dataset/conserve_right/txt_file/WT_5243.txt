mutual defense and engaged in a tense exchange with french president emmanuel macron who stirred controversy by suggesting the alliance was brain dead mr trump reminded the turkish president of his commitments to nato in a one on one meeting early wednesday before leaving mr trump feted eight nations that are spending at least 2 of their gross domestic product on defense the benchmark which the alliance set in 2014 under president obama is a calling card for mr trump who balks at spreading aid around the globe unless other nations do too mr trump said canada s failure to meet the goal

laughing in a private chat about how mr trump s lengthy comments made them late for other events he takes a 40 minute press conference off the top mr trudeau says in the clip captured by a videographer in the traveling press pool mr trump hit back well he s two faced mr trump said wednesday i find him to be a nice guy but the truth is i called him out on the fact that he s not paying 2

syria to attack u s allied kurdish militia which turkey considers to be terrorists or terrorist allies the assault caused a major firestorm in the u s because mr trump had withdrawn u s forces from
