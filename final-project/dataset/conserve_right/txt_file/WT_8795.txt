apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the commander of u s strategic command told congress recently that china is engaged in a troubling buildup of nuclear forces that could be used to wage regional conflict or to coerce nations in asia competitors such as china and russia are developing advanced capabilities to directly challenge our strengths across all domains adm charles a richard the commander said last week singling out beijing for its large scale nuclear force modernization china is advancing a comprehensive modernization program for the people s liberation army pla and is building a robust lethal force with capabilities spanning all domains the electromagnetic spectrum and the information environment he stated in prepared testimony to the senate armed services committee on feb 13 these initiatives increase china s ability to project power further from their mainland and support their aspirations to impose china s will throughout the indo pacific region top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed the goal of the force buildup is to establish regional hegemony deny u s power projection operations in the indo pacific and supplant the u s as the security partner of choice adm richard also questioned beijing s declared no first use nuclear policy the assertion that the pla will not be the first to use nuclear arms in a conflict chinese secrecy regarding its nuclear buildup and the expansion of the overall nuclear arsenal bring china s motives and intent into question he said the main question is why china is doubling the size of its relatively small nuclear arsenal by the end of the decade china adm richard said is building a range of nuclear forces missiles missile submarines and bombers designed to deny foreign regional forces access to conduct operations in the indo pacific region the pla s air force plaaf newly reassigned nuclear mission and a deployment of a strategic bomber would provide china with its first credible nuclear triad the four star admiral said in addition to a bomber dubbed the h 20 several new strategic systems were showcased in october at a major chinese military parade they include an upgraded h 6n bomber df 41 intercontinental ballistic missiles d 17 medium range ballistic missiles and improved submarine launched ballistic missiles collectively chinese improvements to its nuclear capabilities raise troubling concerns and underscore the need to press on with modernizing our nuclear forces including the supplemental capabilities outlined in the nuclear posture review adm richard said our nation and our allies and partners should not accept chinese policies or actions that threaten the international rules based order or undermine regional and global stability he added we must remain postured to counter chinese coercion and subversion assure our regional allies and partners and protect our national security interests as international law allows northcom on growing threat to homeland american adversaries have increased their ability to conduct attacks against the homeland the commander of u s northern command told the senate recently air force gen terrence j o shaughnessy who is also chief of the u s canadian north american aerospace defense command laid out the threats during a hearing before the senate armed services committee during an appearance alongside adm richard our adversaries capability to directly attack the homeland has leapt forward and they are engaged in overt concerted efforts to weaken our national technological economic and strategic advantage the threats include nuclear conventional and cyber weapons russia modernized five bear h bombers with communications and navigation gear that can now fire moscow s advanced as 23 cruise missiles six other bombers are being readied for the missiles gen o shaughnessy said the as 23 can be armed with either a nuclear or conventional warhead and has a range of 2 500 miles enough to hit targets throughout the united states from strike zones close to the country russia also expanded operations of cruise missile firing submarines from the north atlantic in the arctic moscow s military expanded bases and deployed a coastal defense cruise missile unit near the bering sea close to alaska when deployed to the russian northeast this system has the capability not only to control access to the arctic through the bering strait but also to strike land targets in parts of alaska with little to no warning gen o shaughnessy said the commander warned that american military dominance after the fall of the soviet union is now in question our power projection capabilities and technological overmatch allowed us to fight forward focusing our energy on the conduct of operations overseas he said in prepared testimony however our key adversaries watched and learned invested in capabilities to offset our strengths while exploiting our weaknesses and have demonstrated patterns of behavior that indicate they currently have the capability capacity and intent to hold our homeland at significant risk below the threshold of nuclear war the erosion of the u s military advantage is making it more difficult to detect threats defeat attacks and deter aggression against the nation the threats facing our nation are real and significant the four star general said the arctic is no longer a fortress wall and our oceans are no longer protective moats they are now avenues of approach for advanced conventional weapons and the platforms that carry them china the general said also is building long range conventional precision strike weapons that put portions of the u s homeland at risk in a future crisis china could use these weapons along with its world class offensive cyber capabilities to attack our logistics nodes in an attempt to frustrate our force flows across the pacific he said chinese military units also are moving into the arctic working in concert with russia in the past year we have observed signs of a nascent but growing strategic cooperation between china and russia including the combined bomber patrol last july and chinese participation in multiple russian exercises gen o shaughnessy said esper on china threat until recently secretary of state mike pompeo has taken the lead within the trump administration in warning about the growing threat from china the hard line policies outlined in a series of speeches have drawn opposition from officials within the u s government at the treasury and commerce departments who favor business as usual with beijing defense secretary mark esper however has joined mr pompeo in highlighting the danger of the communist party of china during a speech in munich last week mr esper said he regards china as the most significant challenge for the pentagon followed by russia iran north korea and terrorism the secretary spent most of his speech talking about the threat from china and noted that beijing s admission to the world trade organization 20 years ago was supposed to moderate china s communist system speed up its conversion into a market oriented system and ultimately spark political reform instead china used its access to obtain technology to build up its military and expand its authoritarian system he said in fact under president xi jinping s rule the chinese communist party is heading even faster and further in the wrong direction more internal repression more predatory economic practices more heavy handedness and most concerning for me a more aggressive military posture mr esper said it is essential that we as an international community wake up to the challenges presented by china s manipulation of the long standing international rules based order that has benefited all of us for many decades the united states does not seek a conflict with china but wants beijing to become a responsible member of the international community and that will require china to be more transparent and to respect the sovereignty freedom and rights of all nations mr esper argued unfortunately their current behavior leaves great cause for concern he said over time we have watched them seize and militarize islands in the south china sea and rapidly modernize their armed forces while seeking to use emerging technologies to alter the landscape of power and reshape the world in their favor often at the expense of others mr esper said china s communist party is developing artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies to conduct surveillance and repression of muslim minorities journalists and pro democracy demonstrators the chinese government also is exporting those tools to bolster other nondemocratic regimes the pentagon chief urged all western nations to avoid using gear made by huawei technologies the chinese state backed telecommunications company over concerns of the company s links to china s intelligence and military agencies mr esper said beijing is weaponizing outer space with directed energy weapons and killer satellites he noted that the pentagon is standing up its first new military service in over 70 years the united states space force to ensure freedom of use commerce and navigation in to and through space for all the remarks drew a sharp rebuke from chinese foreign minister wang yi who called mr esper s remarks lies contact bill g
