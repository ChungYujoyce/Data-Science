apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion special counsel robert mueller s two year 30 million 448 page report did not find collusion between donald trump and russia despite compiling private allegations of loud and obnoxious trump behavior mr mueller also concluded that there was not any actionable case of obstruction of justice by the president it would have been hard in any case to find that president trump obstructed mr mueller s investigation of an alleged crime one there was never a crime of collusion mr mueller early on in his endeavors must have realized that truth but he pressed ahead anyway it is almost impossible to prove obstruction of nothing top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens two mr trump cooperated with the investigation he waived executive privilege he turned over more than 1 million pages of administrative documents he allowed then white house counsel don mcgahn to submit to over 30 hours of questioning by mr mueller s lawyers three anyone targeted by a massive investigation who knows he is innocent of an alleged crime is bound to become frustrated over a seemingly never ending inquisition mr trump s reported periodic rages at the mueller investigation are regrettable but not unnatural given that mr mueller expended a huge amount of government resources to confirm what many knew at the outset that there was never any collusion with the russian government to warp the 2016 election yet mr mueller s team went down every blind alley relating to its investigation except where obama era officials were likely culpable for relevant unethical or illegal behavior the foreign intelligence surveillance act warrants were integral to mr mueller s investigations but there is no mention of how the fisa court was deceived by not being told that the chief evidence used to obtain the warrants was an unverified dossier paid for in part by the hillary clinton campaign and the democratic national committee dnc some of the collusion narrative mr mueller examined was based on fbi informants unverified stories yet strangely the mueller team did not investigate whether it was legal in the first place for the fbi possibly with cia help to use informants to spy on a presidential campaign former fbi director james comey figures into the mueller report but there is no curiosity about whether he broke the law in leaking what may well have been four classified memos of private presidential conversations to the press for the purpose of forcing an appointment of a special counsel the christopher steele dossier likewise makes an appearance in the mueller report but for a team investigating the alleged collusion of foreigners in a u s election there is silence about the salient fact that mr steele a foreign national enlisted other foreign nationals to dig up dirt on mr trump to weaken his election chances with part of the funding for this research provided by the clinton campaign and the dnc what bothers many americans about the collusion hoax is the accompanying sanctimony of the so called investigators the mueller team could have helped itself had it just noted that much of the evidence it looked at was a product of obama era officials unethical or illegal behavior mr comey wrote a memoir a higher loyalty its eponymous themes are mr comey s own ethics and principles but mr comey may well have misled the fisa court and possibly lied under oath to a house committee he was not candid with federal investigators and leaked confidential and classified government memos former fbi director andrew mccabe also wrote a memoir the threat its argument is that fbi kingpins such as mr mccabe protect america from dangers such as donald trump but mr mccabe himself is under criminal referral for lying to federal investigators his sworn congressional testimony cannot be reconciled with mr comey s mr mccabe also likely misled the fisa court and he apparently contemplated staging a near coup to remove an elected president through the deliberate misuse of the 25th amendment former cia director john brennan is a paid analyst for msnbc who often railed about mr trump s treason and predicted his indictment yet mr brennan himself has lied under oath to congress on two occasions he likely misled congress about his role in trafficking in the steele dossiers and mr brennan s cia may well have helped the fbi use informants abroad to entrap trump campaign aides in efforts to find dirt on mr trump former director of national intelligence james clapper is a cnn analyst who often predicted that a supposedly treasonous trump would be indicted mr clapper too has lied to congress under oath he once denied and then admitted to leaking confidential documents the problem with the mueller investigation and with former intelligence officials such as messrs brennan clapper comey and mccabe is pious hypocrisy those who have lectured america on mr trump s unproven crimes have written books and appeared on tv to publicize their own superior virtue yet they themselves have engaged in all sorts of unethical and illegal behavior the only mystery left is whether our elite investigators actually believe their own delusions or were they constantly broadcasting their virtue as a preventive defense against growing evidence of their own moral lapses victor davis hanson a
