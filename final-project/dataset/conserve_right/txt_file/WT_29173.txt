echoed trump and vice president mike pence in saying the u s is prepared to negotiate with iran without preconditions in a bid to ease tensions they know precisely how to find us pompeo said trump initially said iran had made a very big mistake and that it was hard to believe that shooting down the drone last thursday was not intentional but he also said over the weekend that he appreciated iran s decision to not shoot down a manned u s spy plane and he opined about eventually becoming iran s best friend if tehran ultimately agrees to abandon its drive to build nuclear weapons and he helps the country turn around its crippled economy iran has long said its nuclear program is for purely for peaceful energy purposes trump s national security adviser john bolton stepped in during a visit to jerusalem sunday with a blunt warning saying iran should not mistake u s prudence and discretion for weakness after trump called off the military strike trump said he backed away from the planned strikes after learning that about 150 people would be killed but he said the military option remained on the table a longtime iran hawk bolton emphasized that the u s reserved the right to attack at a later point no one has granted them a hunting license in the middle east as president trump said on friday our military is rebuilt new and ready to go bolton said during an appearance with

accommodating tone including a plea for negotiations iran has said it is not interested in a dialogue with trump his administration is aiming to cripple iran s economy and force policy changes by re
