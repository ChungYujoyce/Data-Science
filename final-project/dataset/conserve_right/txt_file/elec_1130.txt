gop national convention to let voters know a little more about romney the man not just romney the businessman or former governor he flashed his humorous side at one moment an emotional side as he told the story of his parents his children his wife and his early days in business and before the balloons and confetti rained down he drew the address back to the message that has driven his campaign obama has not lived up to the lofty promise of his 2008 run he said and does not have what it takes to fix the economy what is needed in our country today is not complicated or profound it doesn apos t take a special government commission to tell us what america needs romney said what america needs is jobs lots of jobs romney called on voters to put the disappointment and the divisiveness of the last four years behind them and turn the page with him this president can ask us to be patient this president can tell us it was someone else s fault but this president cannot tell us that you re better off today than when he took office romney said now is the time to restore the promise of america romney tried to cast himself as the more level headed and less lofty choice president obama

women in the audience and watching on tv highlighting the female officials who were speaking at the convention and who had served in his administration in massachusetts it was not lost on the crowd kansas delegate chad bettes said the importance of women particularly in the workforce was a huge theme bettes said romney s record has proven that he values women romney though returned to the dominant message that the excitement of obama s election has subsided replaced by doubt and uncertainty about the economy and the federal budget if you felt that excitement when you voted for barack obama you should feel that way now that he s president obama romney said you know there s something wrong with the kind of job he s done as president when the best feeling you ve had was the day you voted for him romney pointed to the president s resume as the problem he had almost no experience working in a business he said jobs to him are about government romney said he wished obama had succeeded because i want america to succeed but his promises gave way to disappointment and division this isn apos t something we have to accept now is the moment when we can do something and with your help we will do something romney said the delegates pouring out into the halls after the speech reacted with satisfaction mary ann riley an alternate delegate from south carolina used a term not often applied to the reserved candidate he had fire in the belly she said the address was to serve as republicans closing argument before democrats fire back with their rebuttal at the convention next week in charlotte n c one senior obama campaign official told fox news in response to the romney speech there was no big idea here adding that romney recycled widely debunked attacks the romney campaign s attention will immediately pivot to countering the message out of north carolina as the obama campaign has tried to draw attention away from republicans gala this week in tampa the lead up

and engaged in a wicked debate with an empty chair that was supposed to represent obama he concluded when somebody does not do the job we gotta let em go romney like many speakers at the convention was interrupted by cheers of usa the biggest breakout came when he criticized obama s foreign policy i will begin my presidency with a jobs tour president obama began his presidency with an apology tour america he said had dictated to other nations no mr president america has freed other nations from dictators he said before having to pause for the chant romney went on to give obama credit for the raid that killed usama bin laden but he said the country is less secure because the administration has failed to slow iran s nuclear threat the speech capped with confidence an unusual convention
