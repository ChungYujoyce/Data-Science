he was infected ten towns in lombardy received orders to suspend nonessential activities and services veneto regional president luca zaia said saturday that the contagion showed that the virus is transmitted like any flu and that trying to pinpoint a single source for the cases or to establish a link to china no longer were effective containment measures you can get it from anyone he told reporters we can expect to have cases of patients who had no contact with suspected carriers while the virus isn t particularly lethal it can be for the elderly or people with existing conditions he said the man who died in veneto for example did not meet the main risk factors for the virus when he was diagnosed with pneumonia two weeks ago he hadn t traveled to china or come into contact with anyone who did therefore the ill man wasn t originally tested for the virus he was only tested after he didn t respond to conventional pneumonia treatment and by then it was too late according to

cluster but officials were still stumped about where it originated the first person to fall ill had met with a man who returned from china on jan 21 but he testednegative for the virus and has been
