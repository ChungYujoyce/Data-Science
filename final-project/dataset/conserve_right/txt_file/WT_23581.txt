tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn democratic leaders secured a tentative agreement from president trump on tuesday to spend 2 trillion to rebuild the nation s crumbling roads and bridges then vowed to keep trying to wreck mr trump s presidency emerging from a rare meeting with the president at the white house house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader charles e schumer said their talks were productive in contrast with their stormy session together in january when the president walked out over funding for the border wall to resolve a partial government shutdown there was goodwill in this meeting and that was different than some of the other meetings that we ve had said mr schumer new york democrat top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots but the goodwill on infrastructure was apparently a one way street democrats said they won t back off six house committee investigations of the president and his business empire and many continued to push for mr trump s impeachment for purported obstruction of justice against special counsel robert mueller s russia investigation that probe found the trump campaign was not involved in moscow s meddling in the 2016 election in previous meetings the president has said if these investigations continue i can t work with you mr schumer said he didn t bring it up tuesday i believe we can do both at once the house and the senate can proceed in its oversight responsibilities the two are not mutually exclusive and we were glad he didn t make it that way mrs pelosi said of the investigations which the president considers harassment that our priority is to honor our responsibilities under the constitution of the united states the speaker told democratic lawmakers monday night that mr trump is making the case for obstruction by stonewalling their investigations but she also warned democrats that they need to deliver on their agenda including a major jobs bill although the democrats and mr trump agreed in principle to spend 2 trillion on infrastructure they didn t agree on the crucial question of how to pay for it they are scheduled to meet again in three weeks democrats said tuesday that they put the burden on mr trump to come up with ideas to raise the money congressional republicans have expressed opposition to such massive infrastructure spending no republicans were invited to the meeting which mrs pelosi requested the white house said the infrastructure initiative is consistent with mr trump s america first agenda the united states has not come even close to properly investing in infrastructure for many years foolishly prioritizing the interests of other countries over our own white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said we have to invest in this country s future and bring our infrastructure to a level better than it has ever been before but her statement didn t commit to 2 trillion in funding she said only that another meeting with the same lawmakers would examine specific proposals and financing methods the u s chamber of commerce and the afl cio this week called for raising the federal fuel tax currently 18 4 cents per gallon on gas and 24 4 cents on diesel to generate more revenue for the highway trust fund the chamber of commerce said increasing the federal fuel tax by 25 cents per gallon over five years would generate 394 billion in a decade that is less than one fifth of the overall 2 trillion price tag white house officials downplayed the suggestion that the president might agree to a tax increase to help pay for infrastructure this president has lowered taxes white house counselor kellyanne conway told reporters before the meeting this needs to be paid for no question there are many different ways to pay for it i know that the democrats want to raise your taxes mr schumer has suggested rolling back some of the 2017 corporate and individual tax cuts to help pay for infrastructure spending senate majority leader mitch mcconnell kentucky republican called that a nonstarter this tax bill of 2017 is what s generated this robust economy mr mcconnell said the last thing we want to do is step on all of this growth by stepping back and repealing in effect what has generated all of this prosperity and low unemployment house minority whip steve scalise louisiana republican also sounded opposed to the price tag of 2 trillion we ve heard speaker pelosi and schumer in the past talking about all kind of tax increases and that s not going to happen mr scalise told reporters so we haven t seen them come anywhere close to 2 trillion in moneys and other places that we can prioritize so how you pay for it is going to be a driving force in his proposed budget for fiscal 2020 mr trump called for spending 200 billion on infrastructure he said the plan would encourage another 1 trillion from states and private investment during the meeting with democrats mr trump encouraged lawmakers to approve his renegotiated trade deal with mexico and canada and discussed health care and immigration policy lawmakers said sen thomas r carper delaware democrat said the president suggested reviving legislation to amend obamacare to fund cost sharing subsidies for insurers payments that the administration stopped in 2017 sen lamar alexander tennessee republican said he and sen patty murray washington democrat worked with the president on the legislation for eight months but it fell apart at the last minute because democrats refused to vote for the traditional hyde amendment restricting federal funding for elective abortions i was extremely disappointed our legislation didn t become law mr alexander said if democrats are willing to modify their position on the hyde amendment and renew their interest in alexander murray i would welcome the opportunity to discuss it white house officials and congressional republicans also say they want environmental deregulation included in an infrastructure package to speed up approval of permits for projects anything we do on it has to include reforms to the permitting process because in many places that jacks the cost up by more than three times what they originally asked and it turns a two year project into a 10 year project mr scalise said democrats are opposed to streamlining permitting mrs pelosi said an infrastructure package must promote clean air clean water it s a public health issue she said it s a quality of life issue getting people out of their cars not being on the road so much house transportation and infrastructure committee chairman peter a defazio oregon democrat said the discussion at the white house never got specific on payment options he said the president even mentioned a bond issue at one point and that mr defazio suggested they all bring revenue raising ideas to the next meeting with no attribution it s up to all of us to figure out how to pay for it he said no one wants to jump over the cliff first gabriella mu o
