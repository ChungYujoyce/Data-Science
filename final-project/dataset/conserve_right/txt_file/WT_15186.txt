apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic new delhi how might the united states and india the world s largest democracies work more effectively together toward countering communist china s increasingly aggressive economic and military moves across asia that question loomed over a private in depth diplomatic conference this weekend on the future of u s indian relations the second annual u s india forum played out under strict off the record rules on reporting comments to foster what organizers said they hoped would be the most honest dialogue between high level current and former officials and others from both countries top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches but several in attendance spoke openly on the sidelines with the washington times about a china inspired urgency for increased u s indian military ties and a more robust democracy and capitalism driven development and foreign investment plan to counter beijing s surging regional influence the trump administration sent alice g wells principal deputy assistant secretary of state for south and central asia among others ms wells voiced concern about china s fast moving one belt one road initiative through which beijing pumps cash into infrastructure projects to buy access to resources around the region ms wells told the times that the initiative laden with billions of dollars worth of china funded projects in countries on every side of india from sri lanka to nepal to pakistan lacks transparency and sustainability and is saddling those nations with predatory debt but for all of our concerns about one belt one road we have to have a positive vision she said india and the united states and japan and australia and others have to stand for something and we have to be able to provide countries with alternatives options and sensible financing that meets the highest standards she said ms wells and others stressed that president trump and indian prime minister narendra modi see eye to eye on the matter but there are questions about how far new delhi is willing to go especially with regard to national security to address concerns that beijing may be plotting to achieve military hegemony several at this weekend s conference told the times that the u s and india need to get serious about expanding their military to military alliance to make clear who controls the indo pacific beijing has spent years building up bases in the disputed waters of the south china sea and has been sending submarines and warships to far flung china financed ports in sri lanka and pakistan china s activities create a large amount of impetus for a more focused and more action oriented india and u s navy to navy maritime to maritime country to country engagement former indian vice adm pradeep chauhan told the times the two nations should be working jointly on tracking chinese nuclear submarines he said to send a clear message to china that you know we are on to you nitin pai co founder of an indian think tank on international policy went further telling the times that there is no choice we ve got to be able to manage china s increasing influence in the indian ocean region including the military aspect of it in mr pai s mind a dangerous military strategy undergirds beijing s expanding investment in regional seaports though china presents the investment as purely economic and benevolent they start by saying this is all commercial but they re clearly keeping their military options open so that when they re ready they can use these ports militarily he said an effective response he said would be for the u s and india to move quickly to bolster their joint military capabilities it s happening to a degree right now but not nearly enough as it should be mr pai said he argued that india should more deeply engage in operations beyond the indian ocean more toward chinese claimed waters near east asia through joint exercises with the u s and others including japan australia south korea and vietnam india should be sending its naval forces east of singapore so that we play an active role in the balance of power in the western pacific he said in my view we have no choice but to do this the power of balance several at this weekend s forum which was run by india s nonprofit ananta aspen center raised questions about the true depth of new delhi s willingness to confront beijing economically or militarily india is engaged in large foreign trade relationships with both the u s and china and officials in the modi government are known to say things like the balance of power may not be so important as the power of balance that india s long term interests may be best served by working closely and perhaps even to equivalent degrees with washington and beijing despite uncertainty over how a u s chinese trade war might impact the balancing act most agree that indian chinese trade is headed nowhere but up india cannot afford to unfriend china said pradeep s mehta the head of an india based nonprofit on eliminating poverty the reason he told the times is that china is sitting near the top in terms of global influence and trade but mr mehta noted that indian perceptions of america as the true go to partner have been bolstered by the trump administration polls show mr trump with a nearly 70 percent approval rating in india where tensions often flare between the nation s majority hindu and minority muslim populations many say mr trump s popularity here stems from his recent halt on all nonessential u s aid to india s rival pakistan but mr mehta told the times that indians were excited about the u s president before he cut aid to pakistan he was already popular here when he won the election because of his anti muslim sentiments mr mehta said of mr trump that really reverberated here others stressed that it shouldn t matter who is in office in washington or new delhi we share like no other nations the values of democracy freedom and diversity said rajan navani who manages an organization pushing digital sector international trade for india it makes complete sense for india and the u s to align geopolitically when it comes to china questioning india s resolve james carafano the head of national security and foreign affairs research at the heritage foundation told the times that he has misgivings about india s ability to think as a global power can china s surge change that maybe india knows it can t live in a world where beijing is the new london and basically what beijing is doing right now is an attempt to re create the british empire in reverse mr carafano said the indians know they can t compete with china without technology that only the u s is likely to deliver and they know that s why they should work us as for why we should work with them look the u s has to be strong in europe the mideast and in asia simultaneously and we just can t do that without partners he said from a military strategic standpoint the biggest thing we get from partnering with india is geography it s control of the indian ocean which most of the world s stuff travels through we have a joint notion with india to keep it open to all while the chinese want to control it michael pillsbury the head of chinese strategy at the hudson institute said the indians just don t want to publicly acknowledge china as a threat but they re clearly aware of their military inferiority on the border with china mr pillsbury told the times he said new delhi realized the gravity of the situation last summer during a standoff between indian and chinese troops along a disputed himalayan border territory after beijing suddenly begun building a road through the area i predict more u s military sales to india very soon mr pillsbury said the way forward some at the forum said the u s and india should avoid veering toward a relationship centered too heavily on defense or on any single trade aspect as americans we should be looking at india not just as a place where the u s sells arms and at the same time indians i believe should be looking at the u s not just as a place where india sells technology said rep raja krishnamoorthi an illinois democrat who was among a bipartisan u s delegation at the forum the u s india relationship is very strong already but it needs to get stronger said mr krishnamoorthi one of four indian american members of congress with the indian american immigrant population rising to 2 4 million in recent years the bonds between the two nations are increasingly cultural as well as economic total u s indian trade continues to rise hitting nearly 120 billion last year and indians are by far the top recipients of h 1b visas which provide highly skilled educated indian labor to the u s tech sector at the same time economic expansion in india whose population of 1 3 billion is projected to soon eclipse china as the world s largest presents what many see as a vital growing market for u s companies it follows mr krishnamoorthi said that washington might better seize the opportunity of india as a key ally to promote shared values geopolitically in addition to pushing for india to be made a permanent member of the united nations security council the two should be working together in response to one belt one road the congressman told the times we need to provide an alternative framework in the indo pacific region for encouraging democracy freedom and responsible economic development mr krishnamoorthi said ms wells meanwhile stressed that the wider alliance known in diplomatic circles as the quad the u s india japan and australia is suited to grow such a framework but needs to think more creatively about how to increase private investment as democracies it can sometimes be harder to organize but what we re doing right now is organizing she told the times adding that the goal is to affirm the international standards for lending coordinated around assistance programs and make sure there are synergies addressing ways our money can come into the same sectors that are strategically important and provide the boost that receiving countries need how do we tap our private sectors which is a huge asset that we have said ms wells we must work with our private sectors through trade development authority and feasibility studies and provide the private sectors with the information they need to be able to tap into what is a huge demand for infrastructure in this region correction the original version of this article stated that china is well ahead of the u s as india s top foreign trading partner the article has been corrected to reflect that india has large trading relationships with both u s officials assert that in terms of total bilateral trade the u s india relationship is larger than
