apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic hong kong ap news of the arrests of prominent chinese dissidents like ai weiwei and liu xiaobo has dominated headlines and painted a picture of harsh oppression and censorship but two independent chinese documentary makers attending a hong kong festival say they enjoy a great deal of creative freedom the two filmmakers say they can tackle most subjects they are interested in in part thanks to the dissidents sacrifices on the surface people think that making documentaries in china is a very difficult task that we are doing something that the chinese communist party doesn t like that is not necessarily the case director zhou hao said during a public talk on the sidelines of the 2011 chinese documentary festival in hong kong late friday top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey i think we enjoy a significant amount of space he said zhou who used to work as a photographer for the state run xinhua news agency described the chinese documentary scene as a hundred flowers bloom using a chinese idiom there are all sorts of movies there are movies that examine different sides of different issues he said that people often ask him if he worried about the consequence of his work but my understanding is that you can basically film everything you want to film the key question is whether you want to shoot something if you want to shoot something you can definitely do it zhou said of course there are restrictions in the mainland but i think the tougher restrictions come from the heart of the filmmakers the fear comes from ourselves i think the other factors are irrelevant he said fellow director ma zhandong agreed if you like what you are doing you can overcome the hurdles he said zhou added that he felt he and his fellow filmmakers are the beneficiary of the sacrifices made by high profile dissidents like ai the avant garde artist and activist who was released last week after nearly three months in detention for alleged tax evasion critics view the case as political persecution there are many people taking the heat for us what should we be afraid of zhou said zhou cited the examples of two fellow filmmakers they include xu xin who interviewed disgruntled parents of a deadly december 1994 fire in a remote western town that killed more than 300 children staging a performance at a local theater for his six hour documentary karamay some parents believe that preferential escape for officials attending the performance led to the deaths thirteen local officials were sentenced to jail terms of up to seven years for negligence and the parents were paid compensation but many still think the government hasn t done enough another documentary maker zhao liang made the 2009 film petition which documents the plight of china s so called petitioners regular citizens who descend on beijing to seek justice for wrongdoing by local officials aren t they still alive zhou asked there is a caveat to zhou s and ma s comments filmmakers like the two of them can enjoy wide latitude thanks to the advent of affordable and small digital cameras the sheer vastness of the country also makes it impossible for chinese officials to police every independent director but underground filmmakers who operate outside the system officially sanctioned projects must have their scripts and final cuts approved by censors cannot secure commercial releases they are limited to small unofficial screenings and foreign film festivals or in hong kong the former british colony that returned to chinese rule in 1997 under a special semiautonomous status that promises freedom of speech both zhou and ma are also screening bold works at this year s chinese documentary festival which kicked off june 18 and

look at troubled chinese citizens a drunk repeatedly shows up at the station an alleged pickpocket is berated in front of his young daughter and other walk ins ask for handouts the transition period

got full access although avoided shooting guo s family life guo has seen the documentary minus the secretly taped section and didn t object zhou said but the director acknowledged he was lucky to come
