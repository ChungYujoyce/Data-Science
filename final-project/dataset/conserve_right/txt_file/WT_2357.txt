hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey mr yang who has posted impressive fundraising hauls but is well behind top tier contenders in public polling on the 2020 democratic presidential race is working to convince skeptics that his unorthodox campaign has staying power with only a few months to go until the iowa caucuses he told reporters after the event that people can bet on momentum picking up for his campaign we have made every debate stage comfortably and that will continue in the days to come he said anyone who wants to bet on our poll levels rising should make that bet right now because you will get your money back and then some mr yang has attracted attention for his universal basic income proposal or ubi that would have the government pay every american 1 000 per month he appeared at george mason on the eve of election day for statehouse elections in virginia and urged attendees to get out and vote for democratic candidates virginia s on the precipice he said virginia s going very very purple and with just a bit of a push i think virginia s going to go blue

signal to d c that you want lower taxes a strong military border 2nd amendment great healthcare and must take care of our vets supporters said mr yang offers fresh views in a democratic presidential field full of seasoned politicians the top tier candidates are kind of stale at this point and yang has been pretty fresh from the beginning and he continues to kind of generate some good ideas said david vickers 71 a retired educator from springfield i don t expect he s going to get the nomination but i expect his ideas to get some traction josh medlin a 23 year old filmmaker from fredericksburg was among the attendees sporting a math hat a yang acronym that stands for make america think harder and also plays off one of mr yang s self deprecating jokes that he s the opposite of mr trump an asian who likes math mr medlin also had a sign with one of mr yang s campaign themes not left not right forward i think ubi is definitely one of the big ones no one else has really brought it forward until he brought it up mr medlin said i like that he s trying to bring the country together at a time where we re so divided zoie larkins 18 an economics major at gmu from vermont said his ubi idea is revolutionary just the idea of a universal basic income being a running platform for a presidential candidate it s so different she said still she also said she was ride or die with ms warren who is her top choice among the 2020 democrats warren is my number one she said but also i think we need a female in office and yang is polling at 3 or less depending on the poll so it s really hard to be ride or die for him right now but if he was president i would be perfectly happy with that mr yang raised about 10 million in the most recent fundraising quarter and started october with about 6 4 million on hand but he s still well back of top contenders like mr biden ms warren and sen bernard sanders of vermont in public polling in one of the democratic debates he turned heads when he said it
