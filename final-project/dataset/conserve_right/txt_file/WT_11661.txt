apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic denver ap china has pulled off a tricky and uncommon feat in space flight maneuvering one of its satellites to within about 300 yards of another while they were orbiting earth space analysts say some analysts view the rendezvous as a potentially ominous sign of china s ability to carry out a hostile act or espionage against a rival satellite in space others say it could have been a test of docking skills china is not saying why it conducted the august maneuver but it comes as the nation is ambitiously expanding its space program including building a space station and conducting lunar missions it is expected to launch the first module of its space station next year followed by a manned spacecraft to dock with it top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore using unclassified tracking data from the u s military space watchers calculated that china maneuvered its sj 12 satellite close to its sj 06f satellite on about aug 19 the military releases estimates on the paths of about 1 000 active satellites and 20 000 pieces of debris in space to help commercial and civil satellite operators avoid collisions u s military officials confirmed the chinese satellite rendezvous occurred but released few details citing security concerns chinese space officials didn t respond to written questions submitted by the associated press in beijing the rendezvous marks a milestone for china s space skills said brian weeden of the secure world foundation a colorado think tank and advocacy group that focuses on the use of space maneuvering an unmanned orbiting vehicle from a control room on earth is extremely difficult because of the distance and because data on the location of the vehicle can be off by hundreds of yards he said it s not like driving a car weeden said only a few other countries have shown they can pull it off including the u s russia and sweden weeden said gregory kulacki who tracks developments in china for the union of concerned scientists called it a cutting edge skill and said it s a significant achievement for china it shows they are keeping up with developments in international space technology he said any time ground controllers can maneuver a satellite into close proximity with one that can t be maneuvered the exercise has potential anti satellite implications said kulacki while the sj 12 satellite changed course for the rendezvous the sj 06f has never previously shown it is maneuverable weeden said with no information from the chinese pinning down the reason for the maneuver is difficult analysts said china may have been practicing its docking skills as quietly as possible so that if it failed it wouldn t be a public embarrassment said charles vick of globalsecurity org which tracks military and homeland security news vick said the rendezvous might have been a dual purpose exercise to practice anti satellite skills as well as docking or inspection it certainly is very ominous in the sense that it is saying china is demonstrating a capability they could utilize in a not so positive way vick said china does really not have our best interests in mind vick added the satellite rendezvous could be viewed as a skill china could use under hostile circumstances he said weeden said it s unlikely the rendezvous was an anti satellite test because sj 12 approached the other satellite at a low relative speed changing course six times over several days if the goal had been to destroy the other satellite sj 12 would have closed in at faster speed he said china showed in 2007 that it could to that destroying one of its own satellites with a missile that prompted international criticism because it created thousands of pieces of orbiting debris although china didn t publicly confirm the rendezvous it was spotted quickly the first public report appears to have come on aug 22 just days after the closest approach by russian space observer igor lissov in the russian news agency interfax avn it has been discussed on numerous websites since then including by weeden on thespacereview com it reinforces the
