apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap man bites watchdog in firing one inspector general sidelining another and assailing a third president donald trump in recent days has put his aversion to agents of federal accountability on stark display in a country consumed by the coronavirus clearly displeased when inspectors general come to independent conclusions that don t fit the stories he tells trump employs a tactic to mar their credibility if public servants worked for the government in the obama era they are subject to being painted as obama loyalists out to get him top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century and they re not insulated if they worked for republican presidents too as the three targeted igs found out with concerns raised about the safety of voting in a pandemic including the november general election trump spread falsehoods about the extent of mail in voting fraud a look at the president s recent distortions on key elements of the pandemic response and a few other political subjects government watchdogs trump on his decision to remove glenn fine acting defense department inspector general who was tapped to lead a special oversight board of the 2 2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package well we have igs in from the obama era news briefing tuesday the facts fine is not a creature of the obama era he is a career government official who had served both republican and democratic administrations and was selected by his peers for the virus oversight board trump distorts that record to make fine and other public servants look like plants or holdovers from president barack obama fine has been acting pentagon inspector general for more than four years and before that was inspector general at the justice department for a decade including the entire duration of the george w bush administration he now reverts to the position of principal deputy inspector general at the pentagon though inspectors general are presidential appointees many serve presidents of both parties all are expected to be nonpartisan they operate as independent investigators in departments shedding light on deficiencies in their agencies trump on a report from the health and human services department s watchdog that found hospitals faced severe shortages of coronavirus test supplies did i hear the word inspector general really it s wrong could politics be entered into that news briefing april 6 trump referring to the hhs report another fake dossier tweet tuesday trump you didn t tell me also that this inspector general came out of the obama administration news briefing on april 6 the facts his claims are groundless there is no evidence that the report was wrong or politically motivated again he insinuates that a longtime civil servant is an obama loyalist out to get him the inspector general in charge of the report is a government employee whose tenure predates the obama administration the report was based on a survey of 323 hospitals around the country in late march and reported conditions they described it did not make any judgments about the federal health department or the trump administration with coronavirus cases rocketing toward their expected peak the inspector general s office reported that a shortage of tests and long waits for results were at the root of mounting problems faced by hospitals overseeing the report was christi a grimm who is acting as hhs inspector general she is a career government manager who took over the position early this year in an interim capacity grimm began her career with the agency in 1999 serving both republican and democratic administrations a week ago trump fired michael atkinson the intelligence community inspector general who forwarded to congress a whistleblower complaint that ultimately led to the president s impeachment in the house his career at the justice department dated back to the early bush administration and it was trump who nominated him as inspector general for intelligence voting fraud trump mail in ballots substantially increases the risk of crime and voter fraud tweet saturday trump mail ballots they cheat ok people cheat mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country because they re cheaters they go and collect them they re fraudulent in many cases briefing tuesday trump you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody s living room signing ballots all over the place i think if you vote you should go briefing tuesday the facts voting fraud is rare trump s push for in person voting in a pandemic such as in wisconsin last week also contradicts the guidance of the centers for disease control and prevention and his task force s social distancing guidelines which urge americans to maintain 6 feet 1 8 meters of separation and avoid crowds of over 10 people the cdc specifically recommends states encourage mail in methods of voting if allowed in the jurisdiction given the coronavirus threat late last week the wisconsin department of health services said it was monitoring the potential spread of the virus during tuesday s voting it s true that some election studies have shown a slightly higher incidence of mail in voting fraud compared with in person voting but the overall risk is extremely low the brennan center for justice said in 2017 the risk of voting fraud is 0 00004 to 0 0009 trump is simply wrong about mail in balloting raising a tremendous potential for fraud richard l hasen an elections expert at the university of california irvine school of law wrote in an op ed this week while certain pockets of the country have seen their share of absentee ballot scandals problems are extremely rare in the five states that rely primarily on vote by mail including the heavily republican state of utah trump cast an absentee ballot by mail in last month s florida republican primary when asked about that contradiction tuesday he told reporters that it was fine because i m allowed to vote by mail and that he didn t expect to get to florida a commission trump convened after the 2016 election to investigate potential voting fraud disbanded without producing any findings virus testing trump initially speaking the tests were old obsolete and not really prepared we have a brand new testing system that we developed very quickly and that s your result news briefing on april 6 trump this administration inherited a broken system a system that was obsolete a system that didn t work news briefing on march 30 the facts his assertion that he inherited a broken and obsolete covid 19 test from the obama administration is false the novel coronavirus did not exist until late last year so there was no test to inherit the centers for disease control and prevention instead struggled to develop its own test for the coronavirus in january later discovering problems in its kits sent to state and county public health labs in early february it took the cdc more than two weeks to come up with a fix to the test kits leading to delays in diagnoses through february a critical month when the virus took root in the u s not until feb 29 did the food and drug administration decide to allow labs to develop and use their own coronavirus diagnostic tests before the agency reviews them speeding up the supply previously the fda had only authorized use of a government test developed by the cdc meantime the u s bypassed a test that the world health organization quickly made available internationally trump has said that test was flawed it wasn t trump we are leading the world now in testing by far news briefing friday trump america continues to perform more tests than any other nation in the world now we re performing them at a level that nobody has ever seen before news briefing tuesday trump nobody has done more testing if other countries did the kind of testing proportionally that we are doing they d have many more cases than us briefing on april 6 the facts he s wrong to say the u s has done more tests proportionally than other countries more broadly his frequent boasts about testing mask what his own officials have called a failure of the system the u s has notably lagged on this vital front as for proportional testing south korea is just one of the countries with better testing rates it also has fewer known cases of covid 19 both in absolute terms and as a percentage of its population one test has been done for every 100 south koreans compared with one for every 150 americans according to figures in recent days altogether south korea has conducted nearly 500 000 tests the u s has conducted over 2 2 million but south korea s population is six times smaller the u s only recently surpassed south korea in the total number of tests even though both countries reported their first confirmed cases on the same day in january u s testing continues to be constrained by shortages of key supplies including sampling swabs and backlogs of unprocessed tests economic relief trump with his daughter ivanka in the roosevelt room of the white house she created over 15 million jobs speaking tuesday with bankers via video conference about virus aid for small businesses the facts that s a complete illusion before the coronavirus became widespread less than half that many jobs were added to the entire u s workforce during trump s presidency and his daughter was not responsible for them the president is referring to a white house initiative led by ivanka trump that garnered nonbinding commitments from companies to provide 14 million or so training opportunities in the years ahead training for a job is not working at a job for money there s no telling how many workers were already going to be trained absent the initiative in many cases the pledge simply confers a presidential seal of approval on what some companies were doing anyway by having companies sign the pledge the administration is relying on the private sector to take on more of the financial burden of training workers and now job gains under trump have been more than wiped out by the pandemic trump on a federal emergency lending program for small businesses i m hearing it s a very very successful rollout news briefing thursday trump as of today small business administration has processed more than 70 billion in guaranteed loans and will provide much needed relief for nearly a quarter of a million businesses already we re way ahead of schedule news briefing tuesday the facts he s glossing over reality there have been substantial delays with few loans issued the 349 billion emergency lending program just began operating april 3 but the rollout has been plagued by a host of problems small business owners have complained that they are unable to get through to the sba or the banks to apply for loans or that they are being rejected by banks that say they are accepting applications only from businesses that are already customers of the bank two of the nation s largest banks jpmorgan chase and citibank weren t initially set up to take applications the sba s loan processing system then stopped working early in the week making it impossible for loans to be approved and money distributed while confusion spread about the documents that lenders needed from customers to complete loan transactions that s according to a trade group for community bankers and the ceo of an online lending marketplace trump was actually citing the value of applications received at the time but yet to be fully administered treasury secretary steven mnuchin had predicted before the program started that loans could be turned around and money transferred to businesses bank accounts the same day as applications were received the virus threat trump referring to his past comparisons of the coronavirus to the flu you said i said it was just like a flu so the worst pandemic we ever had in this world was a flu it was in 1917 1918 and anywhere from 50 to 100 million people died that was a flu ok so you could say that i said it was a flu or you could say the flu is nothing to sneeze at briefing tuesday the facts he s revising history both his own and that of the century old pandemic trump never suggested the coronavirus was akin to the pandemic spanish flu which spread from early 1918 to late 1920 and killed over 50 million worldwide on the contrary he repeatedly dismissed covid 19 from january until mid march as being less of a danger than the common flu and something that would mysteriously disappear soon enough in february he asserted that coronavirus cases were going very substantially down not up and told fox business it will be fine because in april supposedly it dies with the hotter weather it s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for he told reporters on feb 26 and we ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner two days before the who declared the coronavirus a pandemic trump still presented a sunny outlook on covid 19 so last year 37 000 americans died from the common flu he tweeted march 9 it averages between 27 000 and 70 000 per year nothing is shut down life the economy go on at this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of coronavirus with 22 deaths think about that and in a fox news virtual town hall march 24 trump rejected likening the coronavirus to the 1918 pandemic you can t compare this to 1918 where close to 100 million people died that was a flu which a little different he said overstating the likely death toll of that pandemic trump asked about the wisdom of freezing funding to the who during a pandemic i m not saying i m going to do it but we re going to look at it told he had said minutes earlier he would freeze funding he said no i didn t i said we re going to look at it briefing tuesday the facts actually he said earlier in the briefing that he was going to freeze u s funding to the organization we re going to put a hold on money spent to the who he said we re going to put a very powerful hold on it he s unhappy with the organization s coronavirus recommendations the united states contributed nearly 900 million to its budget for 2018 19 according to information on the agency s website an amount that represented one fifth of the who s total budget for those years on friday trump said he ll make an announcement about who soon we re going to be talking about that subject next week he told reporters we ll have a lot to say about it we ll hold it malaria drug trump on the government s decision to stockpile millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine to make it available for patients with covid 19 you re not going to die from this pill i really think it s a great thing to try just based on what i know again i m not a doctor news briefing tuesday trump what do you have to lose i ll say it again what do you have to lose take it i really think they should take it but it s their choice and it s their doctor s choice or the doctors in the hospital but hydroxychloroquine try it if you d like news briefing on april 4 trump they say taking it before the fact is good it can help them but it s not going to hurt them news briefing on april 5 the facts he s making unverified claims about a drug that can have serious side effects and may not work the drug has not been approved as a treatment for covid 19 and trump s own health experts say more studies are needed to know whether it s safe and effective to use the president has been talking up hydroxychloroquine a drug long used to treat malaria rheumatoid arthritis and lupus after very small preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner doctors can already prescribe the malaria drug to patients with covid 19 a practice known as off label prescribing research studies are now beginning to test if the drugs truly help covid 19 patients and the fda has allowed the drugs into the national stockpile as an option for doctors to consider for patients who cannot get into one of the studies but the drug has major potential side effects especially for the heart and large studies are underway the fda says people should not take it without a prescription and emphasizes that the malaria drugs being explored are not fda approved for treatment of covid 19 the american medical association the american pharmacists association and the american society of health system pharmacists in a joint statement warned against prophylactically prescribing medications currently identified as potential treatments for covid 19 that means prescribing a medicine for the purpose of warding off a disease or preventing its spread travel restrictions trump explaining his hesitancy to suspend u s domestic flights to stem spread of the virus they re generally very very empty planes there s also testing done when people get onto those planes and also when people get off the planes news briefing on april 6 the facts false there s no evidence to support his suggestion that travelers at u s airports are being regularly tested let alone when they both get on and off the planes there are coronavirus screenings of some passengers arriving at 13 major u s airports on international flights which involve temperature checks and questioning by u s agents about possible symptoms some states are also screening passengers who are arriving from hard hit coronavirus areas in the u s and asking them to self isolate none of that is the same as getting a covid 19 test and there are plenty of gaps in containment the screenings for instance can miss people who don t yet show symptoms of covid 19 while symptoms often appear within five or six days of exposure the incubation period is 14 days the checks on international travelers are primarily conducted for american citizens legal permanent residents and their immediate families
