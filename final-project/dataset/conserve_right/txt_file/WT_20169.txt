are mounting around the world showing the limits of his self touted ability to make a deal and perhaps the difficulty of focusing primarily on domestic concerns for his america first administration they re also forcing him into some contorted positions for example backing regime change in venezuela without any displays of force and saying he s open to talks with iran while dispatching an aircraft carrier and bombers to the middle east top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning staring down high stakes diplomacy around the world trump says his efforts are working we ve made a decisive break from the failed foreign policy establishment that sacrificed our sovereignty surrendered our jobs and tied us down to endless foreign wars he told supporters at a rally in florida in everything we do we are now putting america first still trump has plenty of unfinished business since taking office he has specialized in publicly hectoring friendly partners embracing foes and resisting too much advice critics have labeled him an unreliable force while allies say he has followed through on a promise to disrupt foreign policy norms trump inherited some of his foreign policy problems such as north korea syria and afghanistan but has yet to solve them and his hands on approach to north korea holding the first meetings between a u s president and that country s leader has not yielded a deal to curtail north korea s nuclear missile program on other fronts trump has turned up the heat his trade clash with china remains unresolved as he brandishes additional tariff hikes with iran trump pulled the u s out of the nuclear deal that the obama administration had negotiated along with five other world powers and he recently increased the pressure designating iran s revolutionary guard corps a terrorist organization and deploying military forces to the persian gulf he said thursday that he would like to get a call from iran s leaders to negotiate cliff kupchan chairman of

talks with the taliban to end the 18 year war in afghanistan trump who ran on limiting u s engagement abroad has stressed his interest in domestic policymaking michael o hanlon a defense and foreign policy analyst at the brookings institution said a unifying theme of trump s approach to foreign policy is his unwillingness to commit to more wars i think so far we continue to see reluctance on the part of trump to get involved in new military operations which is mostly a good instinct but a willingness to brandish nonmilitary instruments of national power as well as assertive shows of military force with no serious intention of taking pre emptive military action o hanlon said in an email thursday every administration faces periods of intensified and often unforeseen foreign policy problems that can divert its attention resources and political capital away from domestic issues such as jobs and the economy that are more central to a president s re election hopes the 9 11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon happened in president george w bush s first year in office and his subsequent decisions to invade afghanistan in october 2001 and iraq in march 2003 consumed his administration for years trump also stressed that he was calling the shots asked if he lines up with hawkish national security adviser john bolton he said i m the one who tempers him which is ok and added ultimately i make the decision that lines up with a central emphasis of trump s foreign policy which is that he always has the final word his advisers have shifted during his term and he is now on his second secretary of state and third national security adviser on thursday the white house said trump will nominate patrick shanahan to succeed jim mattis as defense secretary ending an audition period for shanahan that began in january in a sign shanahan remains focused on trump s top security issue building a wall on the u s mexican border shanahan is scheduled to travel to the border on
