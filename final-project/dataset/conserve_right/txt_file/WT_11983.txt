ersecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic dams oil and gas pipelines factories and other computer controlled infrastructure are more vulnerable to cyber attacks in china than in other countries security specialists say the effectiveness of such an attack was demonstrated last year when the stuxnet computer worm slowed iran s nuclear program by taking control of and disabling hundreds of uranium enriching centrifuges a cyber attack on china s computer controlled infrastructure would imperil the world s second largest economy which likely would affect the economies of beijing s trading partners including the united states top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches china s vulnerability lies in its fledgling domestic software industry which beijing nurtures and promotes and in the lack of transparency in its computer defense organizations which makes hacking into its systems easier than gaining unauthorized access to western systems security specialists say coincidentally china is widely viewed as an aggressor in cyberspace the u s and other western nations have identified beijing as being behind cyber espionage attempts against their infrastructure computer systems factories dams utilities and other industrial operations rely on computers that use special software to run maintain and troubleshoot their machinery supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems malicious computer programs such as the stuxnet worm allow hackers to hijack scada controls china s premier domestic producer of scada software is beijing based wellintech inc which boasts on its website that its kingview scada package is the most widely used in china and has customers in the aerospace and national defense industries when a security researcher discovered a critical flaw in kingview and reported it to the company and chinese authorities last year he met a wall of denial that raises grave doubts about chinese cybersecurity procedures the vulnerability would enable a hacker to gain control of any industrial machinery operated by kingview scada software security researcher dillon beresford said exploiting this bug correctly would allow the attacker to gain remote control of the machine that the software was running he told the washington times mr beresford who looks for flaws in chinese software as a hobby alongside his day job for a u s computer security firm said he identified the vulnerability last year and immediately notified both the company and china s computer emergency response team cn cert neither ever acknowledged his communication nor moved to deal with the flaw for 3 months i never got any response at all until i put some proof of concept data on the internet and the computer security press picked it up he said by putting proof of concept data on the web mr beresford raised the stakes significantly he made the vulnerability public and in a way that would allow any programmer to use the code he had written to develop malicious software to attack kingview cn cert posted a fix for the vulnerability within a few days in an e mail to its american counterpart u s cert a few days later the center said mr beresford s e mail had been missed by the duty staff which deals with thousands of emails every day it s a big pity as well as a mistake that our duty staff did not notice such an important email cn cert concluded did it really slip through the cracks mr beresford said i think there was a bit of embarrassment and they were concerned about the implications mr beresford said it was not the first time he had found flaws in chinese software when it comes to vulnerabilities in software produced by domestic manufacturers they re not exactly transparent or open he said of cn cert and china s other official computer security organizations that lack of transparency is a problem because in order to patch a vulnerability effectively it must be done publicly so that everyone who owns the software knows they need to download and apply the patch china s infrastructure is just as vulnerable as anyone else s and probably more because of the lack of transparency mr beresford said the chinese are very vulnerable to being compromised but we haven t seen a lot of work on this by u s or other western researchers james a lewis a cybersecurity scholar at the center for strategic and international studies agreed saying there are other reasons why china s infrastructure is more vulnerable to cyber attack several surveys show that the great majority of computers used in china run pirated software he said so your software sector is stunted because no one can make any money selling a product that will be so quickly and easily pirated moreover if you use pirated software you have no idea where it comes from he said adding that much of china s has come from the russian mafia pirated software cannot be patched or updated and might have flaws or back doors deliberately inserted into it to allow easy unauthorized access if you use pirated software you re gonna be vulnerable mr lewis said the chinese don t have the same problems we do he said but they have their own and t
