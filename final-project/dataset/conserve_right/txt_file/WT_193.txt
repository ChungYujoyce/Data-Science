e indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump responded to the news that rep justin amash could enter the 2020 presidential race as if christmas had come early i like him even more than jill stein quipped mr trump referring to the 2016 green party nominee whom democrats viewed as a spoiler for hillary clinton the anti trump crowd is more bah humbug about mr amash running as a libertarian party candidate and griping that he could steal votes from trump skeptics who would have pulled the lever for presumed democratic presidential nominee joseph r biden top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens i do think this hurts biden with those republicans who have already decided that under no circumstance they would vote for donald trump and they would hold their nose and vote for joe biden not because they are ideologically aligned with him but because they hate trump so much said a republican consultant close to the trump campaign now they could have the option of voting for a semi serious third party candidate who is closer to them ideologically the consultant said mr amash who left the gop last year dismayed over the direction of the party under mr trump told the libertarian magazine reason that voters right now have only bad options in mr trump and mr biden i think most americans see the same thing i m seeing which is these two candidates aren t up to being president of the united states and we need an alternative he said wednesday and i m confident that i can be that alternative when mr amash started flirting with the idea last year the detroit news released a survey that showed he lured independent voters away from mr biden in michigan mr biden was up 12 points over mr trump in a head to head matchup but that lead was cut in half when mr amash was thrown into the mix mr amash who voted for the articles of impeachment against mr trump said he is exploring a third party bid because the nation is ready for a president that will restore respect for our constitution and bring people together the announcement came a day after former minnesota gov jesse ventura said he is testing the waters to run as a green party candidate justin amash presents an option for right wing skeptics of trump and libertarian skeptics of trump and civil libertarian skeptics of trump the republican consultant said whereas jesse ventura if he chooses to run provides an alternative for left wing skeptics of biden bernie voters and anti war voters democrats hoped to avoid a repeat of 2016 when ms stein was cast as the second coming of ralph nader by demnocrats after the number of votes cast for her surpassed mr trump s margin of victory in michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania her supporters said democrats were just seeking a scapegoat for hillary clinton s stunning loss mr amash dismissed the spoiler talk there are millions of people who want an alternative and that s important he told reason we shouldn t deny them an alternative deny them a chance to vote for someone who will be practical and have common sense former illinois rep joe walsh whose presidential primary bid against mr trump went nowhere urged mr amash to stay out of the race if amash gets the libertarian nomination and stays in until the end he could wind up going in the books as the guy who voted to impeach trump one year then tipped the election to him 11 months later mr walsh said in a washington post op ed the best and surest way to beat trump is to have only one alternative to him he said to give all the disaffected republicans conservatives and independents only one alternative to trump giving them a conservative alternative might be ideologically satisfying but it increases the likelihood that trump can pull off another narrow win george conway the husband of trump senior advisor kellyanne conway and advisor to the anti trump project lincoln political action committee also panned the idea admired how justinamash stood up for the rule of law in trump s impeachment and needless to say my views align more closely with amash s than biden s he wrote on twitter but the only real effect amash could have in this campaign is to enhance trump s chances nicholas sarwark chairman of the libertarian party ridiculed the conway response reluctant supporter of replacing one elderly not quite all there guy with a different elderly not quite all there guy opposed to the candidate he admired and whose views align more closely with his tweeted mr sarwark so much for serving
