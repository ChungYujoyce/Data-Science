found new york s famed museum of modern art in 1929 businessman solomon guggenheim is best remembered for the iconic new york museum his foundation set up in 1939 which was later named after him it s a complex issue said philip dodd organizer of the hong kong art fair s first private museum forum last year why did medici commission so much art why did the vatican commission michelangelo was it philanthropy or was it an exercise of power and display and spectacle i think all those things are involved in asia too said dodd some 40 private museum owners and collectors from australia japan indonesia and china are expected to attend this year s private museum forum at the fair which will be held may 17 20 tek acknowledged that vanity and ego played a role when he started building his art collection but now he has reverted to what he terms a modest lifestyle he says his only extravagance is flying first class and he doesn t wear fancy watches or clothes and avoids giving too many media interviews the action of opening the museum is an extension of love to society said tek who is president of sierad produce a 155 million company listed on the jakarta stock exchange when you see moma
