apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic honolulu ap on his final overseas trip as secretary of defense robert m gates will make the case to a gathering of asian defense chiefs in singapore that expected budget slashing in washington will not weaken america s commitment to asia en route to the meeting mr gates stopped in hawaii on tuesday for a brief visit to pearl harbor where he toured the battleship missouri memorial afterward a reporter asked what message he was taking to singapore even as we look at potential budget reductions there is no slackening of the u s commitment to our presence in asia he said we are a pacific nation we will remain a pacific nation we will remain engaged top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century later this week in singapore mr gates will attend the annual shangri la dialogue asia s most prominent security conference its agenda includes discussion about the challenge of afghanistan the implications of china s military buildup and the dangers of north korea s nuclear ambitions the backdrop to all of that is the contrasting financial condition of the two biggest regional powers china with its roaring economic engine feeding a major military expansion and the united states mired in mounting debt mr gates is scheduled to quit his pentagon post june 30 a little more than 4 years after he entered as the successor to donald h rumsfeld he started at a time of enormous public anxiety about iraq where the war was going badly many in congress were calling for an immediate troop withdrawal but there was relatively little worry about afghanistan he is finishing up his tenure with a far more stable but still not peaceful iraq and with congressional focus turned almost entirely on the war in afghanistan one that is costing much more in blood and treasure than when mr gates became pentagon chief there were 24 000 u s troops in afghanistan when he began his tenure just one quarter of today s total and the once defeated taliban was just beginning its comeback he will leave it to his designated successor leon e panetta to oversee what president obama has promised will be a drawdown of u s forces in afghanistan beginning in july decisions on the pace of that drawdown are expected shortly after mr gates returns from his round the world trip the last stop is in brussels for a nato meeting june 8 9 asia figures prominently in the pentagon s strategic planning given china s rise and its anger over u s support of taiwan and uncertainty about the impact of u s budget constraints on the military s ability to preserve its influence in the region in a series of speeches leading up to the singapore visit mr gates emphasized america s staying power in a commencement address at the university of notre dame on may 22 mr gates argued that whatever budget cutting is necessary to put the country s woeful finances in order it must not undermine the military s global reach beyond the current wars our military credibility commitment and presence are required to sustain alliances to protect trade routes and energy supplies and to deter would be adversaries from making the kind of miscalculations that so often lead to war he said all of these things happen mostly out of sight and out of mind to the average american and thus are taken for granted but they all depend on a properly armed trained and funded american military which cannot be taken for granted he added a few days later in an address at the american enterprise institute mr gates said the united states faces a budget predicament that could turn into a crisis of credit of confidence of our position in the world if not addressed soon in that speech he made clear that military modernization must focus on the kinds of weaponry and capability that will be needed to keep a long term edge on china a next generation fighter aircraft new aerial refueling planes to ensure long range strike capability and a replacement fleet of nuclear armed submarines to deter other nuclear powers such as china i know that after a decade of conflict the american people are tired of war mr gates said but there is no doubt in my mind that the continued strength and global reach of the american military will remain the greatest deterrent against aggression and the most effective means of preserving peace in the 21st century as it was in the 20th the pentagon is undertaking a review of how its forces are aligned in asia and how it can forge stronger partnerships with some asian and pacific nations for decades the u s military presence in asia has been centered on japan and south korea although the united states also has defense treaties with thailand and the philippines mr gates has advocated a strengthening of u s defense relations with southeast asian countries a subject likely to arise during his singapore visit at last year s shangri la conference north korea was a dominant topic two months after the sinking of a south korean warship that killed 46 south korean sailors at that conference mr gates joined south korea in trying to marshal world support for the conclusion that north korea was to blame and should be held to account an international investigation concluded that north korea blew up the warship cheonan with a torpedo an accusation the north denies and china refused to endorse as the north s largest patron china agrees with the u s and much of the rest of the world that pyongyang should not have nuclear weapons but it has been unable to compel the north to disarm north korean leader kim jong il visited
