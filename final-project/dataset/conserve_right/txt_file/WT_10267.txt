the general said the chinese construction and military activities in the port appear similar to what china did in djibouti strategically located near the chokepoint in the red sea called the bab el mandeb china s military initially said the facility at djibouti was a logistics base used for resupplying naval ships used in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions but close observers say djibouti is a hardened military facility on the red sea monitoring a heavily traveled oil shipping route if the gwadar base is a second major military base for china it would give beijing control over two

one of the most powerful figures in china wang qishan is expected to step down from his position as a member of the standing committee of the politburo the seven member collective dictatorship that rules china mr wang will retire from the all powerful standing committee because he has reached the mandatory retirement age 68 japan s nikkei asian review reported wednesday quoting party sources he has been leading a nationwide anti corruption drive widely viewed by observers outside china as part of a plan by president xi jinping to consolidate power by eliminating political rivals u s intelligence agencies that closely monitor the senior chinese leadership regard mr wang s tenure on the committee as a bellwether for the future of mr xi who is expected to be named to a second term as general secretary during the major communist party congress underway this week the question for many analysts is whether mr xi who took power in 2013 will break the rule for mandatory retirement age requirement and take a third term as president he is 64 and will reach the retirement age at the end of his second term during his time as leader mr xi has taken on more power than any leader since mao zedong michael collins deputy assistant cia director and head of the agency s east asia mission center told a security conference in colorado in july that he expect mr xi to emerge strengthened from the party congress and that he could hold on to power beyond two five year terms it looks like he s going to come out of this party congress all the more powerful he said regardless of what position he s in given the allegiances he established he s going to remain probably pretty influential the coveted opening on the standing committee created by mr wang s expected departure will be filled by li zhanshu a close xi ally who currently heads the communist party general office in addition to his role as the anti corruption czar mr wang is china s most powerful financial affairs official overseeing billions of dollars chinese dissident guo wengui a billionaire real estate developer recently exposed what he said were secrets from within the chinese government exposing

communist system mosul reveals is secrets u s and allied military forces backing the iraqi government forces that retook the northern city of mosul from the islamic state this summer learned new details of islamic state activities and operations after the city was liberated in july one interesting bit of intelligence was the terrorist group s use of quadcopter drones for both bombing and video surveillance the group operated their drones in a military style brigade structure and were sophisticated enough to have the drones electronically programmed to finish their missions after electronic signals from controllers were disrupted each of the drone used cost around 500 and were used to drop grenades in one case hitting a munitions carrying vehicle that resulted in a spectacular series of secondary explosions that were caught on video by another drone and later posted online for is propaganda also islamic state built an extensive and extremely sophisticated tunnel structure throughout mosul that was even equipped with wi fi used by the terrorists to communicate while underground the tunnel network included small diameter routes that were built with special boring machines and ranged in size to tunnels capable of handling trucks also during the excavation for the tunnels the islamic state accidentally uncovered the ruins of an ancient civilization in mosul is used facebook and twitter to their advantage while in mosul mostly to propagandize allied forces were able to track many of the terror group s activities simply by monitoring their postings on twitter u s and allied militaries were unable to use facebook to counter is activities in iraq because of rules prohibiting the use of american companies for information warfare operations is use of vehicle bombs in iraq was hampered by a lack of armored plating so the group switched to using kia suvs that were outfitted with bombs one kia car bomb was used to destroy an iraqi m 1a1 tank an attack that was recorded by an is drone contact bill g
