what if china grows secretary of state john f kerry called china s setting up of a large oil rig near the disputed paracel islands provocative according to a state department spokeswoman who recounted the exchange between mr kerry and chinese foreign minister wang yi the comment prompted chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying to shoot back it is the u s coming in and making a series of erroneous remarks about the issue in the waters encouraging certain countries threatening and provocative behavior earlier ms hua accused the u s of making irresponsible comments about maritime disputes and urged washington to speak and act cautiously chinese spokesmen and state run press outlets blamed the u s for heightened tensions that have included chinese patrol boats firing water cannons at vietnamese boats and threats against philippines for its arrest last week of 11 chinese fishermen on may 5 the navy s 7th fleet command ship uss blue ridge encountered two chinese warships near the disputed scarborough shoal claimed by both the philippines and china a fleet spokesman said a helicopter from the blue ridge photographed a chinese frigate and destroyer near the shoal ms hua bristled over a question about the encounter the chinese side has indisputable sovereignty over the various south china sea islands including scarborough shoal and their adjacent waters the spokeswoman said routine patrols by chinese naval vessels in relevant waters are justifiable lawful and absolutely normal there is no need to make a fuss about that the shoal encounter ended without incident unlike the dec 5 near collision between the guided missile cruiser uss cowpens and a chinese warship in the south china sea in that incident the cowpens was monitoring china s new aircraft carrier the liaoning near hainan island when a chinese amphibious ship sailed within 100 yards in front of the cruiser and stopped forcing the cowpens to veer sharply to avoid a collision an illegal carrier visit this week s visit by a chinese general to a u s aircraft carrier has renewed debate over whether the pentagon is complying with legal restrictions imposed by congress on military exchanges with china amid concerns that such visits boost the people liberation army pla war fighting capabilities the pentagon for more 15 years has ignored the carrier visit restriction in the fiscal 2000 national defense authorization act even though it was a compromise during one of three visits to a carrier in the 1990s that prompted congress to limit the exchanges during a carrier visit a chinese officer asked a navy officer to identify the ship s weakest point the officer naively told him it was underneath the carrier where ammunition is stored within a few years of the incident beijing purchased precision guided torpedoes from russia that could strike the vulnerable point china regards u s carriers as having the most significant power projection capabilities in response beijing has developed an array of high technology arms to defeat them including a unique df 21d anti ship ballistic missile this week s visit by gen fang fenghui chief of the general staff to the uss ronald reagan in san diego was 11th time the pla has visited a carrier since 1994 according to a congressional research service report on chinese military visits eight carrier visits have taken place since the law went into effect only once in 2006 were the chinese blocked from getting a close look at a carrier during a stop in hawaii according to published accounts the restrictions went into effect in october 1999 the law states that the secretary of defense cannot allow any chinese military visits that would produce inappropriate exposure that could assist pla war fighting in 12 prohibited areas force projection operations nuclear operations advanced combined arms and joint combat operations advanced logistical operations chemical and biological defense and other capabilities related to weapons of mass destruction surveillance and reconnaissance operations joint war fighting experiments and other activities related to transformations in warfare military space operations other advanced capabilities of the armed forces arms sales or military related technology transfers release of classified or restricted information access to a pentagon laboratory the pla frequently has denounced the restrictions as most chinese military visits are dual purpose for propaganda and intelligence gathering a joint staff spokesman did not respond to an email asking if the carrier visit was legal the pentagon previously has said that lawyers review all exchanges to ensure compliance with the restrictions whether or not it is a violation of the law it is simply a mistake to be giving gen fang and his delegation of intelligence experts the benefit of visiting the world s best aircraft carrier said rick fisher a china military affairs experts with the international assessment and strategy center china s trajectory is very clear it will be projecting military power globally against american interests by the early 2020s and we should be doing nothing to help them work for influence newly minted deputy defense secretary robert work issued a statement to the pentagon workforce wednesday that appears to play down the u s military s role in projecting power instead he urged pentagon workers to help project influence mr work who took office may 5 formerly served in the navy department and was one of the architects of the obama administration s pivot to asia policy which congressional critics say lacks substance defense officials said the policy was toned down by policymakers who feared upsetting beijing with the original muscular air sea battle concept which called for new weapons and renewed alliances aimed at defeating china in a future conflict the policy was transformed instead into a largely diplomatic and economic program lacking funding and other resources in his note mr work pledged to do everything possible to maintain america s military edge we are and will remain a global power whose position in the world is underpinned by our ability to project global influence in concert with other elements of national power and our allies and partners overseas he said in nuanced language reflective of the administration s policy of avoiding the use of military force we must also balance the need to maintain the day to day readiness of our forces in order to project military power whenever and wherever needed with our ability to prevail against future threats and challenges mr work said the challenge for mr work and defense secretary chuck hagel is maintaining the technological edge and readiness of u s military forces at a time of fiscal austerity under president obama the military has been forced to cut 465 billion in spending and faces another 500 billion or more in future cuts the cuts come amid the need for new military equipment and weapons for modernization and to replace worn out equipment from the wars in iraq and afghanistan con
