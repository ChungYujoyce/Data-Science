medicare for all the question keeps being asked partly because multiple estimates have found that the single payer plan which would eliminate virtually all private health insurance would require more than 30 trillion in additional government spending over a decade a historically unprecedented sum but it has also been a fixture because of the way it has caused candidates to stumble in revealing ways no primary candidate is more closely associated with medicare for all than the current front runner and likely nominee sen bernie sanders i vt at last night s debate sanders was once again asked how he would pay for the plan he responded by citing a study that just came out of yale university published in lancet magazine one of the prestigious medical journals in the world the study co written by a former unpaid sanders adviser purports to show that sanders medicare for all plan would save 450 billion a year and 68 000 lives a detailed article produced by kaiser health news and politifact however rates sanders claim mostly false the true part is that such a study exists the false rating comes from the story s conclusion that the lancet study s major findings are wildly disingenuous because they ignore or discount much of the evidence about what effects such a program would have on the health care system the lancet study assumes for example that the sanders plan could pay medicare rates across the board medicare rates are far lower than private insurance rates and the hospital lobby is a powerful political force that has successfully fought off payment reductions in multiple venues when washington state set up a government run health insurance plan state lawmakers ended up boosting rates to about 170 percent of what medicare pays the lancet study sanders cites also lowballs the likely increase in utilization that would come from eliminating copayments and other cost sharing mechanisms as sanders medicare for all plan calls for although it allows that the newly insured would use more care it assumes that the currently insured would not seek to use more health services as harvard health policy researcher adrianna mcintyre points out that s deeply unrealistic the implication here is that going from modest cost sharing to zero cost sharing will have no impact on utilization none this is not a tenable assumption the rand hie is dated but it s not obsolete it s backed up by a whole canon of health economics research now adrianna mcintyre onceupona february 25 2020 beyond the clear evidence from health policy research it is worth thinking about this claim if it were in reverse supporters of sanders medicare for all plan sometimes portray copayments premiums and other forms of cost sharing as obstacles to accessing health care services which is presumably why the sanders plan eliminates them if adding cost sharing to a health care system would reduce access and thus reduce utilization then removingcost sharing would produce the opposite effect in the form of increased utilization and thus increased spending there are other problems as well most notably thatthe studysimply doesn t account for about 4 trillion in expected long term care spending that would be part of the bill under sanders medicare for all plan the study claiming m4a would lower national health spending that 1 forgot to score the 4t long term care provisions 2 forgot to account for utilization increases from ending cost sharing 3 assumed it can root out waste while eviscerating the categories that police waste brian riedl brian riedl february 25 2020 and as mcintyre also points out the study handwaves away research suggesting that its headline lives saved figure is substantially overstated the authors pull a favorable number from a single 2009 study note the existence of some other research that would result in a much lower number of saved lives and then call their own number highly conservative one might argue that this is only one study and sanders made the case last night that there s a large body of evidence to support his contention that his plan would save money indeed he claimed that there is no dispute whatsoever about this conclusion what every study out there conservative or progressive says medicare for all will save money he said in this case sanders claim is not mostly false it is flatly untrue a study by the left leaning urban institute for example found that total health care spending in the u s would increase by 7 trillion over a decade under a medicare for all like single payer plan even making allowances for savings from lower prices and administrative costs philip klein of the washington examiner points to several other studies undercutting sanders claim as well the question of how to pay for medicare for all has come up quite frequently in the debates and the repetition may even be having a substantial impact on the race sen kamala harris d calif who initially endorsed medicaid for all getting the name wrong in 2017 struggled with the question throughout 2019 appearing to flip flop several times in response to pushback her stumbles probably contributed to her declining position in the race and she eventually left the field after being repeatedly pressed about why she had plans for everything except how to pay for medicare for all sen elizabeth warren d mass released a complex financing scheme this generated substantial criticism and helped demonstrate how she relies on a veneer of wonkiness to avoid tough questions eventually warren released a second plan that called for a delayed implementation of full fledged medicare for all which many understandably read as a sign that she wasn t serious about the idea and had only backed it in hopes of improving her appeal to sanders voters in the following weeks warren s poll numbers plunged and she has trailed in the race ever since in both cases we learned something essential about the candidates and how they respond to pressure harris didn t have a firm initial grasp of the policy mechanics and she flailed and flip flopped in search of a politically palatable answer warren bandwagoned with the most progressive candidate eventually releasing a dubious but detailed plan that suggested she wasn t serious then followed it with another one that undercut the first all while pretending it didn t the same is now true of sanders and his response it appears is to point to an obviously unsound study conducted by a sympathetic voice and then lie about the rest of the existing research the medicare for all financing question is not just a policy question it is a test of character and sanders failed it next senate hearing on national injunctions peter suderman isfeatures editoratreason show comments

stupid if there is a hitler wannabe it is this spit spraying marxist nut torture beating and murder of dissidents is fine with bernie because they had 96 literacy allowing the average cuban to read the castro propaganda posters before the great literacy campaign the literacy rate was estimated to be somewhere in the 60 76 range on par with democrat controlled cities like detroit that have a 40 functional illiteracy rate when ignorant people have nothing to say the spew the hitler tag thinking it makes them smart it doesn t black is white up is down left is right marxists are nazis an unknown scholar and sage circa 2020 nazis were are explicitly marxist hard to be a marxist when you vociferously reject the central tenets of marx s views state control of the means of production state deciding what everyone needs state slaughter of inconvenient people no i think the nazis were right in line don t forget the part where hitler literally plagiarized that whole jewish question thing straight from marx yeah so turns out there are more economic political structures than just statism and anarchy sarcasm dude i making fun of their post when he should be preparing the country to survive this terrifying pandemic doing what screaming in terror and running around with his hair on fire opening the white house to flu patients ironically stopping flu patients at the border getting the carts ready to collect the dead https m youtube com watch v jdf5exo6i68 i know i ve made the same joke three days in a row but i truly believe this is the level of concern we should have until evidence shows otherwise http www google com amp s nypost com 2020 02 26 cdc warns men about facial hair dangers as coronavirus spreads amp some day a people will look back upon this time and wonder when one among them will discover the answer too much soy in the diet that just came out of yale university published in lancet magazine one of the prestigious medical journals in the world i for one always look to prestigious medical journals for financial and economic analysis i m confused as to how the lancet is still considered prestigious personally the basic problem with all government run or controlled programs is government itself a notoriously inefficient and incompetent bureaucracy one has only to look at the dmv and post office for examples of extremely simple functions which government turns into the butt of all government jokes the reason is well known businesses are just as capable of bungling even the simplest of projects but then they go out of business and free up all those resources people money assets for other uses government never fails never shuts down incompetent bunglers never frees up bungled resources for other uses and these clowns just can t get that through their thick skulls only slightly ot just once i wish someone would ask these clowns why they think raising business taxes is a good idea they d sputter out businesses paying their fair share and you d ask back who they think pays business taxes it sure ain t businesses they pass all their costs on through to consumers labor assets inputs all are reflected in the retail price including taxes bunch of fucking morons the lot you re only looking at phase 1 comrade obviously those businesses passing their increased expenses along to the consumer can t be tolerated their greed continues to cause problems if the kulaks and wreckers insist on this behavior well the government would have no choice but to directly control prices so that fairness is achieved a pound or several of flesh people who think government programs can be better and more efficient than the private sector have either never worked for the government or they currently work for the government and want to preserve their cushy jobs or they expect to work for the government got to do something with that master s in art degree or something studies i think most of them are just too damned naive from being young and immature to understand that the dmv and post office are the best that government can do plus how much do most people deal with the dmv once to get the student license once to get the real one and hardly ever after again the post office they pick up mail some but don t depend on it and the expense and waste and cumbersome bureaucracy are invisible whereas roads are visible signs of government prowess and they don t think of traffic jams as anything unusual and avoidable they just have no contact or experience with government bureaucracy whereas roads are visible signs of government prowess and they don t think of traffic jams as anything unusual and avoidable they actually go further blaming traffic jams on automakers and oil companies and positing government run trains as the solution the reason is well known businesses are just as capable of bungling even the simplest of projects but then they go out of business and free up all those resources people money assets for other uses government never fails never shuts down incompetent bunglers never frees up bungled resources for other uses this has become dangerously fatalistic virtue signaling among self proclaimed libertarians r s too but their motives are more corrupt the notion that the market drives bunglers out of business by magic but that govt bungling can t be affected at all because of reasons we are simply a very different people now than the ones de toqueville described the political associations that exist in the united states form only a detail in the midst of the immense picture that the sum of associations presents there americans of all ages all conditions all minds constantly unite not only do they have commercial and industrial associations in which all take part but they also have a thousand other kinds religious moral grave futile very general and very particular immense and very small americans use associations to give f tes to found seminaries to build inns to raise churches to distribute books to send missionaries to the antipodes in this manner they create hospitals prisons schools finally if it is a question of bringing to light a truth or developing a sentiment with the support of a great example they associate in america i encountered sorts of associations of which i confess i had no idea and i often admired the infinite art with which the inhabitants of the united states managed to fix a common goal to the efforts of many men and to get them to advance to it freely we no longer do any of that we watch tv and surf via smartphone but not to actually connect in any real association we have created a mindset where only commercial industrial associations and political associations exist with lazy delusions about how either of those can expand to fill the vacuum left by the absence now of all the neither of the above associations in which we used to engage i too read putnam though i suspect a great amount of it boils down to generational wangsting that s certainly what he says i disagree and find it unfortunate that he used a triviality bowling to make his point i think the change that truly killed civic association was the elimination of individual school boards and consolidation into school districts over the 20th century schools were always the major focus for those associations an individually managed school was managed by a board of 10 or so volunteer parents neighbors they would hire the teacher set tax rates oversee construction etc at its height that required about 1 5 2 million board volunteers every year at a time when there were about 100 million peeps and there was never a shortage because serving on school board was one of those activities that defined who was respectable in the community by 1932 the first wave of consolidation consolidating one room schoolhouses into individual elementary middle high had pretty much happened but even then there were still 120 000 individually managed school governance entities requiring about a million adult volunteers again though no shortage after ww2 we eliminated about 90 of those entities so by 1965 we had about 15 000 school districts about the same today which were now too complex for volunteers parents to manage so it all became professionalized eliminating all of that volunteer requirement and reducing everyone s role to vote for someone else to do it and no accident imo that s also when education costs started skyrocketing and quality deteriorated you are an idiot you don t have a clue how markets or governments work markets aren t instantaneous but as slow as they are they are infinitely faster than a government which never discards failed agencies what government agencies do you know of which have been discarded you are comparing an ideal government against a real and crony filled market which still manages to reward competency better than government you are a damned fool i repeat markets don t hold bunglers accountable because magic they work because people decide to act to hold bunglers accountable likewise we choose to fail to act when we basically invest a max of 30 minutes every 2 4 years to hold the govt bunglers accountable in both cases that accountability rests completely on our decisions to act or not act it s not someone something else s fault it s the fault of the guy you look at in the mirror the reason the neither of the above associations worked from detoqueville s day and maybe up to the 1929 crash is because individuals in voluntary association zealously guarded that freedom to act in voluntary association they guarded that freedom from both commercial industrial intrusion anti monopoly stuff as well as government intrusion even aj nock understood that when he used the term social power to describe what he himself was far too antisocial for groucho marxist reasons to ever join you market fundamentalists however actually do believe that only commercial industrial associations need exist everyone else without the power to guide or receive the profit from those associations can just watch ads on tv internet and somehow that will make them powerful enough to act and you pretend that everyone who opposes that bs is just some commie who wants only govt to exist they work because people decide to act right so what would you call someone who knows damn well how wasteful and inefficient government is yet still spends time bemoaning tax cuts and whining about his her perception of what someone else s fair share should be a useful idiot an enabler haha you just pile on the ignorance markets work like they do because that is what markets do no magic necessary markets are crowds of people acting spontaneously to trade with each other and that is markets who the heck said anything about magic may as well claim that i said gravity works because magic markets are created by people but not designed by people you damned statists can t comprehend spontaneous anything you act as if government designs society then get all freaked out when someone says market and act like tehy don t exist because government didn t create them blow off markets don t hold bunglers accountable because magic i see you missed this earlier comment you are an idiot you don t have a clue how markets or governments work read it and internalize it it s true no one ever said it was magic that drove business bunglers out of business it s competition plain and simple and where competition doesn t work to eliminate bunglers you can be certain government is involved tilting the scales to keep those bunglers collecting rent we no longer do any of that we don t what is it you think you re doing right now because the structure of the associations has evolved it doesn t mean that they no longer exist i personally am a member of numerous associations political business related civic minded recreational we just helped throw a parade and celebration for mardi gras another group helps provide basic packs for schools pencils pens notebooks another engages in medieval and fantasy re enactment still another engages in sculpting and then there are the various political and social talking groups you are as the saying goes talking out your ass 4 more is looking better every day no even if you loathe the orange haired son of a bitch excuse me orange haired pussy grabbing son of a bitch just an fyi trump neither has orange hair it s his skin they re referring to nor ever said that he d grabbed a pussy he said that if you re rich they ll let you grab them by the pussy he later went on to say that he could kiss his co star s cheek because he d gotten permission from his wife so orange skinned pussy whipped son of a bitch works just a touch more accurately just watching people freak out again would be worth 4 more years the only thing better than watching people freak out over 4 more years of trump would be if warren or klobuchar managed to win and hillary clinton attended the inauguralation as a former first lady and had witness another woman taking the oath of office that she for her entire life thought she d be taking so sweet as much as i revile and loathe that broom bound creature it would not be worth having either of those other hags around the kettle being in charge that s like finding out you got an std but it s only hep c and not hiv i want neither and finding out i got the other doesn t make me feel better of all of them klobuchar is probably the most tolerable from a policy point of view not great but barely worse than bill clinton it will definitely be must see tv i ll take another trump term just for 2 or 3 more scotus appointments hell yes and a dozen or more appellate and hundred district court appointments constitutional republic the study simply doesn t account for about 4 trillion in expected long term care spending ok boomer am i doing this right math is racist and sexist you forgot to add that yep western cultural hegemony learned about it in my cultural studies class bernie sanders new favorite medicare for all study has major problems and of course reasons does not even touch on the libertarian rationale for opposing the program it is an authoritarian program based upon stater mandated associations as opposed to freedom of association not that reason gives a damn about actual principles don t forget about all the funding obtained at gunpoint but i guess that s only a problem when it s used to build a wall instead of a hospital look when your hung up on fighting for the rights of people who don t believe in rights you can t be bothered with the violation of the rights of people who do distractions like that are self defeating and make you unpopular welcome to reason since this is your first time here i suggest you use the search function to look up other articles they ve posted on the subject of medicare and medicare for all you ll see that they ve made many arguments against it including the one you stated this particular article is probably focused only on the study in question because it just came out and sanders just started citing it obviously they can t make every argument against medicare 4 all in every article about it that s would require a book peter your analyses of health care policy are without peer and keep me coming back here well that and nick g but what would really be great would be if you started a youtube channel with cocktail recipes and your cocktail experiments love the gems you share on twitter but we need more searched youtube today hoping for something along those lines and nothing once the health care rationing starts we re all going to need some good cocktails help us out solid parody the cost savings and funding are easy to see and implement a take all assets from all people with a net worth greater than sanders net worth b since all medical care will be single payer the nurses tecs doctors etc don t need to be paid they will be given food shelter and everything else they will ever own on a per need basis to be determined by a new ministry of health 3 care will be rationed in order of support for sanders the people that donated money will get medical treatment the ones that voted for him will be next the clingers that voted against him will be given poison the next time they go to the hospital and those that didn t vote will be denied medical service because not participating in the revolution is a sign that you are a clinging dissenter as always the clingers on this sight will complain but that s because you are all racist and are afraid of having your work betters cram what s best for you down your neck you joke but some in england already are proposing that their healthcare system be further rationed based on a social score they want to further punish people for wrong think it all progresses toward a logical outcome step or two at a time until all pretense is lost and then you get slammed in the head with a rifle butt or have a bag put over your head and all the while libertarians telling you how wonderful the glorious future will be after the revolution the glory is that everyone will be equal and share and share alike except for some other animals who have to do all the thinking and purging why base it off sanders he s a fucking hypocrite 3 houses millionaire his wife use to run a college ya bernie is just like the common man scraping by at least if you re gonna steal from people go full retard and take everything from everybody that s what com feminists are good at because bernie is a man of the people and as the only person who care about the prolitariate he is the maximum of what acceptable wealth is well you know with communism some people have to be rich when everyone else is destitute someone has to direct those breadlines ever read interesting times by sir terry pratchett i think it is a perfect analogy for the current democratic field of course they are doing it for the workers but the workers aren t educated enough so they can t be in charge but the elite of the revolution will have to be and what do the workers want a longer buffalo harness so they don t step in so much bullshit when working their fields i loved rincewind s observation about oriental cooking in that book basically broke starving people have to get really creative a ton of jokes taking the piss at communism there too god i am so sick of hearing about people s obsessions with their medical bills it s so boring get another hobby get another hobby winner go identify as trans or something and shut up about being poor and sick already and yet we all have to reluctantly accept this plan just we did obamacare because whatever republicans propose is infinitely worse hey at least bernie isn t going to get us into a war in syria like trump and can you believe that trump didn t commit troops to syria and abandoned our precious kurdish allies turkish delight infinitely worse so you are saying the current system is infinitely worse since i don t see a republican plan hummm ok an obl sock no primary candidate is more closely associated with medicare for all than the current front runner and likely nominee sen bernie sanders i vt can you please lay off the backhanded prognostication and narrative driving it s still very early in the game are we talking about the trump regime now i and i m just sitting here wondering how we got to the place wjere our only choices on fixing the incredibly screwed up healthcare system is sticking with the same screwed up system or a total government takeover seriously there is no other option there is but it doesn t involve free shit so it isn t considered viable not for the people making the decisions they want it this way agreed i wondered why everyone got so so hung up on repeal and replace just repeal most states will figure it out i ll admit mn had a decent program addressing low income and hard to insure people sudermen sigh you aren t given bernie enough credit biden said that since 2009 150 million american s have died because of guns bernie will make that true so that his costs are kept down feelthebern well do any of the studies take into account the number of ex employees in the health insurance energy finance and state government sectors i mean after bernie s first day in office there will be millions starving because they no longer have an industry let alone a job has anyone even considered all the job losses and investment losses and resulting reduction of tax revenue from the then unemployed insurance industry employees has anyone even considered all the job losses and investment losses and resulting reduction of tax revenue from the then unemployed insurance industry employees sen kamala harris d calif who initially endorsed medicaid for all getting the name wrong in 2017 struggled with the question throughout 2019 appearing to flip flop several times in response to pushback getting the name wrong or accidentally using a more accurate name medicaide is a more accurate description of sanders proposal but since it for poor people he decided not to use it it also has lower reimbursements than medicare bernie is proposing medicaid for all not medicare for all medicare allows for private supplemental plans that citizens enjoy medicaid isn t well liked and is much closer to what bernie sanders is proposing and into which everyone will be forced does anyone realize that germany and the uk allow private insurance why is bernie outlawing it if the new gumment system is so much better most people will use it as they do in germany and the uk 75 of canadians have some supplemental private insurance how many americans has given bernie a power of attorney to handle their healthcare for them again the arrogance of some of these politicians is just baffling bernie you go do what you want with your healthcare but don t pretend in you i m king fairy tale you have any say in mine freak en slavers to the max ah yes the classic i don t care what the studies say and how much every other first world country on earth pays it would bankrupt us if we did it here argument because obviously there s no way we d have any option besides pay as much or more for services despite every other system paying far far less we have lots of options we could eliminate the artificial doctor cap we could repeal certificate of need laws we could even work out some sort of doctor reciprocity deal where foreign doctors graduating from specific schools can skip residency however none of that aligns with the incentives of the people making the decisions so we ll be paying inflated prices for health care until the system collapses ya right psycho path in the early 1900 s it was medicare that would save us all and be cheap in 2009 it was the affordable care act obamacare in 2020 now it s medicare for all and guess what reality denier healthcare has just gotten more and more expensive over the years you ll be tooting your horn about affordability until absolutely no one can afford it we already have an excellent example and prototype of comrade bernie s plan its called the veterans administration and it is a disaster if this is how the usg treats those that fought for the empire imagine how it will treat the rest of us if the goal is low cost excellent health care get the government as far away from it as possible you know like back before lbj s great society when the our healthcare was the envy of the world fafalone february 26 2020 at 9 27 pm ah yes the classic i don t care what the studies say and how much every other first world country on earth pays it would bankrupt us if we did it here argument yeah don t let actual numbers get in the way of lefty fantasies fuck off slaver socialists slaughtered some 150 million souls in the last century and impoverished and displaced countless more with their economic central planning and social engineering schemes anyone who self identifies as a socialist explicitly endorses this legacy of genocide and economic and social catastrophe comrade bernie is a depraved barbarian getting paid easily

or near retirement age who decide to hang it up rather than deal with gov if m4a were to become a thing maybe its nothing maybe its something i d like to see them at least consider it doctors deal with the government all the time it s called licensing i bet no doctor wants to end this aspect of government control i more meant the doctors who decide that getting reimbursed 60 cents on the dollar isn t worthwhile just because they can save on two billers in their back office you are missing the point i was trying to make the supply of medical services is tightly controlled with severely limits competition and inflates prices sometimes 10x over other industrialized countries while doctors have the luxuries of choosing the prices the work for most patients meanwhile compete with 3rd world labor in other words there is very little free market in us healthcare it s socialism for medical providers and capitalism for patients makes 140 to 180 consistently online work and i got 16894 in one
