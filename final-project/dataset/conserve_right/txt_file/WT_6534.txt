apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic newsmaker interview president trump s new national security adviser said china must keep its promise to permit hong kong to keep its current system in the face of widespread unrest and strongly denied beijing s charges that the u s was secretly instigating the pro democracy demonstrations for the first time since the protests broke out months ago china last week began using some people s liberation army troops outside their garrison in the colony a sign that the troops could be preparing for a military crackdown hong kong police on monday were locked in a tense standoff with hundreds of demonstrators who were occupying a major university in the city top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk robert o brien the trump administration s former top hostage negotiator who was named national security adviser in september told the washington times in an interview that the violence in hong kong was testing china s frequent claims that it respected international agreements one of the claims the prc regularly makes is that they re scrupulous in abiding by their treaty commitments he said we call on the prc to abide by its treaty commitments to the united kingdom with respect to hong kong we re obviously monitoring the situation closely and hope for the best our hearts go out to the people of hong kong mr o brien said it s very difficult to watch the violence that s taking place in hong kong in the wide ranging interview late last week mr o brien said mr trump still hopes to sign a fair enforceable preliminary trade deal with china by the end of the year said the administration will keep the pressure on chinese companies such as huawei technologies which is seeking to corner the market for emerging 5g telecommunications technology he also revealed that the successful u s military raid that killed islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi last month produced valuable intelligence that resulted in additional u s strikes against the terrorist group including some that remain secret as the hong kong crisis intensified mr o brien forcefully rejected chinese government charges that the united states is secretly fomenting the protests pro democracy activists have been waving american flags and flags of other democratic nations during mass rallies and demonstrations the only role we have in all of these situations is serving as what ronald reagan called us the beacon of democracy the beacon of freedom the beacon of liberty he said it is no surprise that folks that are oppressed and who are out in the streets yearning for freedom look to the united states mr o brien said we are again as ronald reagan said the last great hope for democracy we are not involved in the protests we know that the people who are out protesting would like to live in a country that is governed the way the united states is mr o brien said china should honor its promise to hong kong to allow its british derived political and economic system to continue under an agreement with britain sea battle on another source of tension between washington and beijing mr o brien rejected frequent chinese claims to sovereign control of up to 90 of the strategic south china sea let s make one thing very clear the south china sea is not chinese territory he said they talk about the south china sea the way we talk about lake tahoe it s not lake tahoe it s a major swath of the pacific ocean it s international waters under any definition of what international waters are he added that there was no legal or historical basis to china s nine dash line the purported extent of china s control of the sea in the face of claims from the philippines vietnam and other regional powers beginning in april 2018 china began installing anti ship and anti aircraft missiles on some of the disputed islands in the sea which chinese president xi jinping had promised the united states would not happen several states in the region in addition to china have claims to the islands the idea that you just send in the chinese navy to take over other nations economic zones or territorial waters that is not right and it is not fair he said china is a very wealthy country it is a very powerful country it does not need to increase its wealth or power at the expense of its poorer and smaller neighbors u s forces engaged in stepped up warship and aircraft passages through the sea are prepared to defend themselves from the chinese missiles mr o brien said no 1 the chinese said that they would not militarize the islands he said they said that they were building up those islands for humanitarian disaster relief purposes and for maritime safety now there anti aircraft and anti surface vessel missiles and runways for fighter jets on those islands which is not helpful first it violates china s word and second it destabilizes the region regardless the united states is not going to be intimidated by the military installations on those islands mr o brien said we are more than capable of defending ourselves against whatever systems are on those islands he said the united states will sail in international waters and will not cede its rights under international maritime law the head of the snake mr o brien s short tenure has already been part of the trump administration s biggest intelligence and security successes the raids that killed al baghdadi and a top associate and dealt a major blow to isis the nsc chief said taking out terrorists leaders such as al baghdadi is like cutting the head off the snake of salafist terrorism we got baghdadi we followed up with a number of strikes some of them have been made public some have not so we are trying to degrade the network he said adding that there have been important operations that resulted from the exploitation of the site on chinese cyberattacks and intellectual property theft estimated by the trump administration to have cost american companies 250 billion to 600 billion annually mr o brien said he is hopeful china will halt the theft and begin to understand that all that does is bring shame on the chinese nation the chinese people are smart industrious and capable of inventing their own products and creating an innovation based society he said to build chinese success on the back of american entrepreneurs or european entrepreneurs is not fair mr o brien said it needs to stop the industrial espionage has had a serious economic impact on the united states and on our allies and even on folks that are not our allies china also has been illegally obtaining russian technology he said the president has made this a big issue we are hopeful that the chinese will change their ways on this front i think that the phase 1 trade negotiations which cover technology and intellectual property will improve the situation dramatically mr o brien said on chinese efforts to control 5g technology and the links between companies such as huawei and china s intelligence and security services mr o brien said at the white house we talk about 5g every day we re concerned about it he said we do not believe the united states or its allies should be relying on a state owned enterprise huawei that has close to ties to the chinese communist party for our telecommunications infrastructure an international 5g infrastructure built with huawei equipment would create unlimited opportunities for chinese espionage and intellectual property theft he said some european countries have resisted u s pressure and agreed to allow huawei to participate in their national 5g networks we are surprised that countries are willing to put their citizens data the most private personal data at risk of being exploited without limit by the chinese communist party so this is an issue that we raise with our allies at every opportunity he said a streamlined nsc mr o brien a lawyer by training has made streamlining the nsc bureaucracy a priority under president barack obama the nsc staff expanded dramatically critics have blamed damaging leaks of secret and confidential presidential meetings on obama holdovers working on the nsc staff the so called ukraine whistleblower who triggered the current impeachment proceedings in the house is believed to be an obama holdover on the nsc staff sent from the cia mr o brien said 40 to 45 nsc detailees have been sent back to their originating agencies under his reorganization plan the nsc staff was 12 policy professionals when president kennedy confronted the then soviet union over the cuban missile crisis he noted under president george w bush the nsc staff increased to around 100 people to handle multiple conflicts in iraq afghanistan and the war on terrorism under the obama administration the nsc staff ballooned to more than 200 people critics said the expansion was an attempt to create small versions of the state department and defense department within the white house the nsc is a coordinating body mr o brien said i am trying to get us back to a lean and efficient staff that can get the job done can coordinate with our interagency partners and make sure the president receives the best advice he needs to make the decisions necessary to keep the american people safe i just don t think that we need the numbers of people that it expanded to under the last administration to do this job right mr o brien has sought to promote people from within the nsc staff including his two deputies matt pottinger an asia specialist and victoria coates a middle east analyst several career foreign service and state department officials also have been brought into the nsc so we re trying to put together a very very professional solid management leadership team he said i call it a leadership more than a management team mr o brien said the nsc staff should not be a final destination for government officials most people who have returned home had been here for a year he said when they return to the department of state or defense or homeland security they will be better foreign service officers better military officers better homeland security officials because they spent time here at the white house we are all serving here for a relatively short period of time mr o brien said the nsc should not be a career position that is not how it was designed and that is not ho
