the casual observer might imagine there is a growing sense among many asia and china watchers that the u s is engaged in a historic contest with not one but two chinas on one hand u s officials are sparring with china s civilian government over economic issues currency manipulation balance of trade and market access on the other military and diplomatic officials are shadowboxing with china s

taiwan account for eight of china s top 10 investors in 2009 they contributed 25 billion in job generating investment the other two top 10 investors are hong kong and macau former western colonies that have reverted to china s control hong kong is the largest foreign investor by far at 54 billion experts agree that most of this money actually originates in taiwan and courses through hong kong
