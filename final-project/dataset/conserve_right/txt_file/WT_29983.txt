tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn president trump said friday that he is considering a plan to release illegal immigrants into sanctuary cities saying it is fitting punishment for democrat led communities that refuse to get tough on border security mr trump was confirming a report in the washington post that said the idea was being considered due to the fact that democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws we are indeed as reported giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only the president said on twitter see also pentagon prepares list of projects on ice to fund border wall hours later speaking to reporters at the white house mr trump said he would only be giving the sanctuaries what they say they want california certainly is always saying oh we want more people and they want more people in their sanctuary cities well we ll give them more people we ll give them a lot we can give them an unlimited supply he said let s see if they have open arms he added the president also said he will send more troops to the border sanctuary cities are communities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities shielding them from detection to varying degrees california for example has enacted laws that ended cooperation between local police and u s immigration and customs enforcement on a number of areas including anti gang efforts and translation assistance democrats bristled at mr trump s suggestion it is a notion that is unworthy of the presidency of the united states and disrespectful house speaker nancy pelosi told reporters thousands of illegal immigrant children and families are being nabbed at the border every day right now and because of lax u s laws most of them are quickly released that usually means being driven to a bus station in a city near the border and dropped off leaving the migrants to disperse on their own or with the help of nonprofit organizations that are rushing to help some of those communities have complained about being overwhelmed by the releases mr trump didn t say what exactly he s considering but one option would be to transport the illegal immigrants caught at the border to sanctuary jurisdictions elsewhere spreading the impact of the releases beyond the border court documents detailing illegal immigration show some migrants already gravitate toward sanctuary communities seeking out the more generous treatment such as ability to obtain government services and driver s licenses others will end up traveling to where they already have family or friends or the hope of a job and if they were released into sanctuary cities they would likely leave for
