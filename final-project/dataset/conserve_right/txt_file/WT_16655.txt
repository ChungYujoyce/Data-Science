that warfare campaign under an agreement with mexico the sale of any station in mexico that broadcasts into the united states must be approved by the fcc pentagon ramps up hypersonic missile work the pentagon s missile defense agency is joining efforts of the army navy and air force to develop hypersonic missiles ultra high speed weapons capable of maneuvering to avoid missile defenses mda is actively participating in a department wide common hypersonic glide body memorandum of agreement where we are participating in development efforts and leveraging investments in hypersonic technology across the department to advance our counter hypersonic activities air force lt gen samuel greaves the mda director said in a statement to inside the ring the common hypersonic glide body is the name being used by the military for a triad of high speed missile variants for the army navy and air force the three versions will be designed for firing from army ground based missiles from navy ship and submarine missile launch tubes and from air force bombers the inclusion of the mda in the hypersonic missile program was confirmed by gen greaves after aviation week first reported on the collaboration this week a defense official said the group effort will include pooling the research of weapons engineers for both missiles and missile defenses we re trying to come up with anti missile missiles we want to knock down things like that the official said mda is the lead pentagon unit for defenses against hypersonic missiles and will be involved in developing hypersonic missile defense interceptors and hypersonic target missiles hypersonic missiles currently are being developed rapidly by both china and russia as key asymmetric warfare capabilities designed to strike with both conventional and nuclear warheads through advanced missile defense systems so we re interested in how the missiles are made how they fly and of course we ll need targets to shoot at the official said congress directed the mda in 2016 to set up a program focused on hypersonic missile defense current efforts include setting up a space based network of sensors capable of detecting and tracking hypersonic maneuvering missiles the glide body is being developed from a three stage booster prototype built several years ago by sandia national laboratories the air force weapon is called the hypersonic conventional strike weapon and the army missile is called the long range hypersonic weapon both could be fielded by 2022 the navy conducted a test of its version of the hypersonic missile described only as intermediate range conventional prompt strike flight experiment 1 in october 2017 the test utilized what the navy said were hypersonic boost glide technologies the hypersonic missiles can be either gliders that maneuver at speeds of over 7 000 miles per hour after being launched atop another missile or high speed flight powered by engines using scramjet supersonic combustion ramjet technology contact bill g
