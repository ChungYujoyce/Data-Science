administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion for most of the last three years donald trump s critics have scoffed at supposed conspiracy theories that claimed a deep state of bureaucrats were aborting the trump presidency we have been told the word coup is hyperbole that reveals the paranoid minds of trump supporters yet oddly many people brag that they are proud members of a deep state and occasionally boast about the idea of a coup recently former acting cia chief john mclaughlin proclaimed in a public forum thank god for the deep state former cia director john brennan agreed and praised the deep state people for their opposition to mr trump top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time far from denying the danger of an unelected careerist bureaucracy that seeks to overturn presidential policies new york times columnists have praised its efforts to nullify the trump agenda on the first day of the impeachment inquiry house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff called his initial two witnesses career state department diplomats william taylor jr and george kent far from providing damning evidence of criminal presidential behavior mr taylor and mr kent mostly confined themselves to three topics their own sterling resumes their lack of any firsthand knowledge of incriminating trump action and their poorly hidden disgust with the manner and substance of president trump s foreign policy oddly both had little clue that their demeanor and thinly disguised self importance were a perfect example of why mr trump got elected to come up with new ideas antithetical to the conventional wisdom of unelected career bureaucrats mr taylor and mr kent announced that they are simply high minded civil servants who serve the presidential administrations of both parties without bias but by nature the huge federal bureaucracy counts on bigger government and more taxes to feed it so naturally the bureaucracy is usually more sympathetic to big government progressives than to small government conservatives mr taylor and mr kent cited their anguish with mr trump s foreign policy toward ukraine namely that it did not go through official channels and was too unsympathetic to ukraine and too friendly to russia if so one might have thought the anguished bureaucrats would have similarly gone public during the obama administration after all vice president joe biden took over the obama administration s ukrainian policy at a time when his son hunter was knee deep in ukrainian affairs as a consultant for a ukrainian natural gas company hunter biden made a reported 80 000 a month without expertise in either the energy business in particular or ukraine in general also mr trump s policies have been more anti russian and pro ukrainian than those of the obama administration mr trump armed the ukrainians mr obama did not mr trump imposed new sanctions against russia used force against russian mercenaries in syria beefed up nato defenses pulled the united states out of an asymmetrical missile treaty with russia and pumped more oil and gas to lower world prices much to the chagrin of oil exporting russia in contrast mr obama was the architect of reset with russia that reached its nadir in a hot mic exchange in which mr obama offered a quid pro quo vowing more flexibility on issues such as u s sponsored missile defense in eastern europe in exchange for russia giving mr obama space to concentrate on his re election mr trump s critics have also radically changed their spin on coups to them coup is no longer a dirty word trafficked in by right wing conspiracists instead it has been normalized as a possibly legitimate means of aborting the trump presidency mark zaid the attorney representing the ukraine whistleblower boasted in two recently discovered tweets of ongoing efforts to stage a coup to remove mr trump coup has started first of many steps rebellion impeachment will follow mr zaid tweeted in january 2017 later the same month he tweeted coup has started as one falls two more will take their place retired adm william h mcraven recently wrote an op ed for the new york times all but calling for mr trump s ouster the sooner the better no sooner had mr trump been elected than rosa brooks a former defense department official during the obama administration wrote an essay for foreign policy magazine discussing theoretical ways to remove mr trump before the 2020 election among them a scenario involving a military coup in september 2018 the new york times published an op ed from an anonymous white house official who boasted of supposedly widescale efforts inside the trump administration to nullify its operations and subvert presidential directives such efforts to oppose mr trump are often self described as the resistance a reference to the underground french fighters resisting the nazis in world war ii mr trump s opponents often have praised the deep state precisely because unelected career officials are seen as the most effective way to sabotage and stymie his agenda a coup is no longer proof of right wing paranoia but increasingly a part of the general progressive discourse of resistance to mr trump in these upside down times patriotism is being redefined as removing a president
