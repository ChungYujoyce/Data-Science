apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the contrast is stark while president trump is working daily to improve the economy create good paying jobs and solve pressing problems facing americans the biggest issue right now for democrats running for president in 2020 is helping illegal aliens get into the united states to get services paid for by u s taxpayers some candidates are literally going to mexico to literally help foreigners literally cross the border top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender sen cory a booker new jersey democrat last week went into mexico to help escort five female foreigners into the united states according to fox news he crossed the el paso texas port of entry into ciudad juarez with several immigrant rights attorneys to help the women get admitted into the u s after they had been sent back to mexico it s becoming a popular political stunt in his first international trip as a candidate for the democratic presidential nomination former rep robert beto o rourke of texas also traveled to ciudad juarez to meet what his campaign called individuals and families directly impacted by donald trump s cruel and inhumane policies the associated press reported and blaming mr trump for the crisis at the border is also becoming de rigueur he blames those being forced to wait on the trump administration s unlawful remain in mexico program which has allowed the united states to return thousands of central americans to mexican border cities as they wait to hear about their asylum claims the ap wrote under the current absurd system foreigners can enter claim asylum then stay in the u s for years as their cases wend their ways through the legal process but then mr o rourke wants to remove all barriers along the border so anyone can just walk in at any time and like beto the other two dozen democrats vying for the nomination to a man and woman think the most urgent problem facing america is foreigners having a difficult time entering the u s during the second night of the 2020 democratic presidential debate late last month moderator jose diaz balart asked the group to raise their hands if they thought illegally entering the u s should be classified as a civil offense instead of a crime all but sen michael bennet of colorado and former colorado gov john hickenlooper shot their hands into the air sen bernard sanders of vermont one of the front runners went so far as to say he d use executive orders to rescind almost every immigration policy enacted by the trump administration sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts another front runner wants illegal border crossing to be treated as a misdemeanor with the offending individual being issued a citation like a speeding ticket and then being allowed to stay in the country we should not be criminalizing mamas and babies she said possibly with a tear in her eye other democrats not running for president are also cashing in on the issue rep alexandria ocasio cortez who lives for the spotlight ignored her constituents in the bronx and queens to jet into texas and take a chauffeur driven mercedes to the border to push the idea that illegal aliens are forced to drink out of toilets the mainstream media lapped it up but here s what mr trump should do address homelessness these are americans who need help and if you ve been to los angeles or san francisco the latter being the home district of democratic house speaker nancy pelosi you know the problem is out of hand a federal count shows the number of homeless people increased by double digit percentages in three san francisco bay area counties over two years as the region struggled to tackle the growing problem including 17 in san francisco and 43 in the county that includes oakland the ap reported dr drew pinksy said last month that bubonic plague also known as the black death a pandemic that killed off millions in the 14th century is likely already present in los angeles typhus which broke out in the city last year will likely return he said this is unbelievable i can t believe i live in a city where this is not third world this is medieval dr pinsky said third world countries are insulted if they are accused of being like this no city on earth tolerates this the entire population is at risk mr trump should also push jobs programs for the poor in appalachia where progress has always lagged behind the rest of america and address hunger some 40 million americans struggle with hunger each year if mr trump were to unleash the massive power of the federal government to address homelessness poverty and hunger in america he d be working hard to solve the problems of americans while the democrats are striving to aid illegal aliens he d also have
