campaign s momentum to convince voters that she has what it takes to defeat trump as the sole top tier candidate on stage wednesday she could have the most to lose the massachusetts senator and former harvard professor is known for her many policy plans and a mastery of classical orderly debate but presidential showdowns can be more gladiator style than the high minded great debaters this is no time for a wonky multipoint case for medicare for all student debt relief or the green new deal so one challenge for warren 70 is stylistic look for her to try to champion her progressive ideas and fend off attacks from lesser known candidates with gravitas warmth and the brevity required by the format preparing for the debates is trying to learn to speak in 60 seconds or less she said in miami ahead of a visit she live streamed to a migrant detention center in homestead florida another obstacle is to do so without alienating the moderate voters any democrat would need in a general election to beat trump being the front runner on stage conveys a possible advantage if the others pile on warren she gets more time to speak because the candidates are allowed 30 extra seconds for responses who s that there may be some familiar faces across the rest of the stage such as new jersey sen cory booker 50 or former texas congressman beto o rourke 46 but a few names probably won t ring any

evenly replied i think women all over this country heard very clearly what mr trump said for candidates such as o rourke a breakthrough moment on wednesday is critical to revitalizing a campaign that

biden 76 and vermont sen bernie sanders 77 headline thursday s debate and are certain to take up much of the spotlight breaking out badly an oops moment can be politically crippling to any presidential campaign just ask energy secretary rick perry the former texas governor who in a 2011 debate blanked on the third agency of government he had said would be gone if he became president commerce education and the uh what s the third one there perry said epa fellow republican ron paul offered yep perry said the environmental protection agency oops he finished perry s campaign already struggling never recovered what issues there s simply no time for an in depth discussion of issues but the migrant crisis would be an apt topic even in shorthand dominating the news in the hours
