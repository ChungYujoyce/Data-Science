dicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion november s election made it quite clear that the people of the united states do not want to radically change our society in the name of global warming pretty much every close house race went to the republicans while the democrats won all the senate squeakers the difference the house on june 26 2009 passed a bill limiting carbon dioxide emissions and getting into just about every aspect of our lives the senate did nothing of the sort the nation s most prominent publicly funded climatologist is officially angry about this blaming democracy and citing the chinese government as the best hope to save the world from global warming he also wants an economic boycott of the u s sufficient to bend us to china s will nasa laboratory head james hansen s anti democracy rants were published while he was on a november junket in china but they didn t get much attention until recently on jan 12 the hyperprolific blogger marc morano put them on his climate depot site and within hours the post went viral in a former life mr morano was chief global warming researcher for sen james m inhofe oklahoma republican top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time according to mr hansen compared to china we are the barbarians with a fossil money democracy that now rules the roost making it impossible to legislate effectively on climate change unlike us the chinese are enlightened unfettered by pesky elections here s what he blogged on nov 24 i have the impression that chinese leadership takes a long view perhaps because of the long history of their culture in contrast to the west with its short election cycles at the same time china has the capacity to implement policy decisions rapidly the leaders seem to seek the best technical information and do not brand as a hoax that which is inconvenient has this guy ever heard of the gang of four or the cultural revolution which killed those who were inconvenient or the great leap forward which used the best technical information to determine that a steel mill in every backyard was a good idea mr hansen has another idea to circumvent our democracy because congress is not likely to pass any legislation making carbon based energy prohibitively expensive he proposed in the south china morning post that china lead a boycott of our economy after agreement with other nations e g the european union china and these nations could impose rising internal carbon fees existing rules of the world trade organization would allow collection of a rising border duty on products from all nations that do not have an equivalent internal carbon fee or tax the united states then would be forced to make a choice it could either address its fossil fuel addiction or accept continual descent into second rate and third rate economic well being the wto in fact has not ruled that it can impose environmental tariffs of any kind much less those of such magnitude that they would destroy the world s largest economy mr hansen is just dreaming here but that s not surprising he has been very creative over the years in 1988 he reportedly told bob reiss author of yet another apocalyptic screed the coming storm that in the next 20 years the west side highway in manhattan will be under water and there will be more police cars in new york because well you know what happens to crime when the heat goes up well there are more cops and less crime and the west side is high and dry one out of three isn t bad for baseball but it is horrendous for science in 1988 he testified in front of congress showing the temperature forecast for coming decades he had three emission scenarios one was labeled a which he called business as usual it actually underestimated the growth in greenhouse gas emissions since then even with that error which should have enhanced global warming more than he predicted observed temperatures fell far short he predicted 0 7 degrees celsius 1 3 degrees fahrenheit of warming this was an overestimate of more than 40 of what was observed between then and now how about his scenario b which assumes decreasing trace gas growth rates that one overestimates warming by a bit less than 40 percent 37 percent to be artificially exact scenario c is irrelevant as it assumed massive cuts in emissions beginning in 1988 his forecasts of climatic change for nearly the last quarter century are fantasy as is his notion that dictators are better than democracy and that our country should be bullied into submission patrick j michaels is senior fellow in environmental studies at the cato institute and author of climate of extremes global warming science they don t want you to know cato insti
