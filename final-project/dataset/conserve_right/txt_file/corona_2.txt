the northeast and the west coast announced monday that they are crafting joint plans for reopening schools and businesses in their states putting them on a collision course with president trump who said he has the ultimate authority on when to reopen states after the coronavirus crisis eases when somebody is president of the united states the authority is total mr trump said in a move led by new york gov andrew cuomo that blindsided white house officials the democratic governors of new jersey pennsylvania connecticut delaware and rhode island banded together to form a northeast regional task force to immediately begin designing a plan for reopening top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots new mexico governor blocks plans to reopen drive in theater ann coulter turns on trump most disloyal actual retard that has ever set foot in the oval office you need the best public health plan and the best economic reactivation plan mr cuomo said it has to be both to the extent we can do that together that is the best course there s no doubt about that he said they would be guided by experts and data and science and not in a political way later on monday the northeast coalition said massachusetts gov charlie baker a republican was joining the group in the west govs gavin newsom of california kate brown of oregon and jay inslee of washington announced their own partnership they said they have an agreement on a shared vision when the time comes to reopen their respective states economies covid 19 doesn t follow state or national boundaries the three democratic governors said it will take every level of government working together and a full picture of what s happening on the ground mr newsom said he plans to offer more details on california s reopening plan tuesday california has more than 23 500 confirmed cases of covid 19 and nearly 700 deaths but the number of hospitalizations has stabilized in recent days the 10 states have a combined population of about 106 million nearly one third of the u s total none of the six governors in the northeast mentioned a goal of reopening by may 1 which is the president s soft target for getting at least portions of the country back in business the governors made their announcements hours after the president said he had the authority to decide when states should reopen for business for the purpose of creating conflict and confusion some in the fake news media are saying that it is the governors decision to open up the states not that of the president of the united states the federal government mr trump said in a series of tweets let it be fully understood that this is incorrect it is the decision of the president and for many good reasons he said the administration is working closely with the governors and this will continue a decision by me in conjunction with the governors and input from others will be made shortly the president said jonathan turley a constitutional law professor at george washington university said mr trump is constitutionally wrong with his declaration about his authority to reopen states for business the president has persuasive not command authority mr turley tweeted it remains a state decision under our system of federalism the president insisted later during his daily televised coronavirus briefing that he will be calling the shots i have the ultimate authority mr trump said we re very close to completing a plan to open our country hopefully even ahead of schedule we will soon finalize new and very important guidelines to give governors the information they need to start safely reopening their states mr cuomo said he will listen to what the president wants to do but added that mr trump has generally left decisions up to the states during the crisis i just want clarity mr cuomo said it is an interesting construct that it wasn t the federal responsibility to close the economy but it is the federal government s responsibility to open the economy if it s your authority to open why wasn t it your authority to close delaware gov john carney thanked mr cuomo for his leadership in new york and across the country during the crisis pennsylvania gov tom wolf also rejected the president s claim of authority on decisions when to reopen seeing as how we had the responsibility for closing the state down we probably have the primary responsibility for opening it up he said rhode island gov gina raimondo said their move won t change the states relationship with the administration throughout the crisis the governors are the ones who have been showing great leadership and taking action to keep our residents safe she said and so i think it s only appropriate that we do the same thing now by coming together and showing regional leadership to reopen the economy connecticut gov ned lamont said he doesn t want actions to be taken prematurely there s nothing worse than a false start he said that would be so demoralizing for our economy mr trump is introducing a task force tuesday to make recommendations to him about how and when to get the country back to work and school he has mentioned the option of reopening in phases starting with regions that haven t been hit as hard by the virus as the northeast the president s task force will include treasury secretary steven t mnuchin commerce secretary wilbur ross white house economic adviser larry kudlow u s trade representative robert lighthizer and white house chief of staff mark meadows the president said last week that the group would be bipartisan and would include outsiders such as governors business leaders and health care specialists treasury secretary steven t mnuchin said that by wednesday about 80 million americans will receive direct payments of up to 1 200 this week plus 500 per child to help with the economic shutdown from the pandemic mr trump has had a mixed relationship with governors during the crisis he has alternated between basking in their praise and bristling when they complain about a slow or confused federal response on delivering medical supplies at a low point the president acknowledged that he had urged vice president mike pence head of the white house coronavirus task force not to talk to democratic govs gretchen whitmer of michigan calling her that woman and mr inslee referring to him as a snake during the white house briefing mr trump showed a sizzle reel of video clips of various governors including mr newsom mr cuomo and new jersey gov phil murphy praising the president for quick action on their requests it was produced monday by white house staffers we could give you hundreds of clips like that mr trump said they governors can t find anything to complain about and honestly many of them didn t do their jobs we help some of the ones that don t know what they re doing each of the northeast governors will name a health and economic official for their states plus each governor s chiefs of staff to form a working group to design a reopening plan mr murphy whose state s cases of covid 19 are still rising spoke of reopening whenever it is we do know this an economic recovery only occurs on the back of a complete health care recovery mr murphy said this is the fight of our lives reopening ourselves back up will be equally challenging the debate over how and when to reopen businesses restaurants and schools has grown increasingly urgent nearly 17 million americans have filed for unemployment benefits in the past three weeks and a 350 billion fund for small businesses to retain their workers is expected to run dry this week no visible progress was made monday on a 250 billion administration request to replenish the fund senate democrats blocked quick action on the proposal last week house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat and senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat dug in on the list of demands democrats want to see in the next round of coronavirus legislation including money for national rapid testing and protective equipment we have real problems facing this country and it s time for the republicans to quit the political posturing by proposing bills they know will not pass either chamber and get serious and work with us towards a solution they said in a joint statement the paycheck protection program was part of the 2 2 trillion economic rescue package that recently cleared congress but it is in danger of running out of money because of the overwhelming demand republican gov larry hogan of maryland chair of the national governors association led another teleconference monday with vice president mike pence and white house officials in which he asked for 500 billion more for states without sufficient federal relief states will have to confront the prospect of significant reductions to essential services which will in turn devastate the economic recovery and our efforts to get people back to work mr hogan said he said he also spoke to congressional leaders in both parties this is not a time for politics mr hogan said we have asked the administration to weigh in so that we can break this logjam in the senate and get this done for the american people tom howell jr contributed to this report copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to
