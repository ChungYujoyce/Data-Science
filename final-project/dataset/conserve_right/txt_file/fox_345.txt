coronavirus however threatens to change this growth forecasts have been slashed as stock markets endure their largest falls since the crash major economies including the uk stand on the edge of recession the ftse 100 has fallen 20 per cent since mid february trading at levels last seen after the brexit vote even before the coronavirus the uk economy was fragile gdp failed to grow in the final quarter of last year and annual growth was just 1 4 per cent though the financial sector is better regulated than in 2008 the uk is in most respects worse prepared than last time large interest
