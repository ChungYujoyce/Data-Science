slams israel in pro palestine op ed mr silverman is thrilled with the turnout of 2 200 demonstrators at the capitol but he is worried about the democratic party s increasingly cold shoulder toward israel frankly it kind of staggers me that this could be a partisan issue but it s becoming that way mr silverman a former denver prosecutor said on his knus am talk show support for israel among democrats has gone way down among republicans it s still solid and i think that s a damn shame and i call on democratic leaders to turn that around the denver rally wasn t an outlier president obama s
