tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap president donald trump s first veto was more than a milestone it signals a new era of ever perilous relations between the executive and legislative branches of government trump s agenda was stymied even before his party lost unified control of washington at the start of the year and he has grown increasingly frustrated by his dealings with congress believing little of substance will get done by the end of his first term and feeling just as pessimistic about the second according to white house aides campaign staffers and outside allies republicans in congress are demonstrating new willingness to part ways with the president on the senate vote thursday rejecting the president s national emergency declaration to get border wall funding 12 republicans joined democrats in voting against trump top stories n y gov andrew cuomo s careless cruelty shows in coronavirus nursing home policy trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick the 59 41 vote against trump s declaration was just the latest blow as tensions flare on multiple fronts trump tweeted one word after the vote veto and he eagerly flexed that muscle on friday for the first time hoping to demonstrate resolve on fulfilling his 2016 campaign pledge gop senators had repeatedly agitated for compromise deals that would give them political cover to support trump despite their concerns that he was improperly circumventing congress but the president was never convinced that any of the proposals ensured the resolution would be defeated said a white house official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking a last ditch trip to the white house by a group of senators wednesday night only irritated trump who felt they were offering little in the way of new solutions as the vote neared trump repeatedly made clear that it was about party fealty and border security and suggested that voting against him could be perilous it s going to be a great election issue he predicted looking past the veto trump s plans for future collaboration with congress appear limited with the exception of pushing for approval of his trade deal with mexico and canada the president and his allies see little benefit for investing more political capital on capitol hill trump ran against washington in 2016 and he is fully expected to do so again trump once declared that i alone can fix it but that was before getting hamstrung in washington and he is now exploring opportunities to pursue executive action to work around lawmakers as he did with his emergency declaration on the border wall he is

assessed that democrats would rather investigate him than cooperate on policy basically they ve started the campaign so the campaign begins his dealings with congress were inconsistent even when republicans controlled both chambers and he has made few overtures to democrats since they won control of the house trump initially predicted he could work across the aisle but that sentiment cooled after the bitter government shutdown fight and in the face of mounting investigations his frustrations are evidence of the difficulty that the washington neophyte and former business executive has had with the process of lawmaking and the challenges yet to come the white house argues there are still opportunities for collaboration listing ratification of the canada mexico trade pact as a priority but passage is anything but assured trump s ire has been directed at both parties for some time aides said he was upset with the republicans performance during the recent congressional hearing featuring his former lawyer michael cohen telling allies that he was not impressed with their questioning trump s budget proposal this past week was viewed as a shot at democrats with its proposals to increase money for the border wall and cut to social safety net programs the plan which had little in the way of new or bipartisan ideas was declared dead on arrival by democratic house leaders

trump s criticism of the trans atlantic alliance the invitation was backed by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky and followed votes earlier this year in which republicans voiced opposition to
