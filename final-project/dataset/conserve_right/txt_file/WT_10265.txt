apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic pyeongchang south korea ap wanted a city to host the 2026 winter olympics getting bidders for the olympics used to be easy but no longer and particularly for the winter games six european cities pulled out of official bids or possible bids when the ioc sought candidates a few years ago for the 2022 winter olympics cities balked over soaring costs political unrest or a lack of public support as expressed in referendums special coverage pyeongchang 2018 olympics that left the ioc with only two proposals both from authoritarian governments that backed cities devoid of winter sports traditions almaty kazakhstan and beijing china beijing narrowly won but that set off alarms at ioc headquarters in lausanne switzerland the 2022 bidding certainly highlighted the problems we were facing in attracting cities particularly winter cities ioc member and former vice president john coates said we had to do something to address the cost of the games increased costs have forced our hand quiz are you a winter olympics expert coates said the international olympic committee is doing a total rethink over the way the games are presented to potential bidders and how they re sold to the public the switzerland based olympic body is trying to rebrand billing itself as user friendly and at the service of host cities and not the other way around officials are talking up flexibility and cost cutting trying to change the ioc s image of pressuring cities to build new sports venues that quickly become unused white elephants four cities have shown preliminary interest for 2026 stockholm sweden calgary canada sion switzerland and sapporo japan calgary and sapporo have hosted previous winter olympics and stockholm held the summer olympics in 1912 sweden has never held the winter olympics we are saying come around and dialogue with us said christophe dubi executive director of the olympics dubi said norway austria and the united states had also shown some interest if not for 2026 then for 2030 u s olympic officials say the nation won t bid for the 2026 games with los angeles hosting the summer olympics in 2028 salt lake city denver and reno nevada are expected to consider 2030 bids richard brisius the ceo of stockholm s exploratory committee told the associated press he believes the ioc s changes are real not a cosmetic makeover they ioc are taking big steps to change for the future brisius said that means for a small democratic country like sweden we feel now we have a good chance at this european and north american candidates probably have an edge for 2026 sapporo held great olympics in 1972 but putting the games in japan would come just after tokyo s 2020 olympics and after two winter games in asia pyeongchang and beijing coates joked that letting cities talking informally before bidding formally with the ioc eliminated the schmoozing and back scratching that has gone on driving up costs for cities that eventually win the bid and even for losing cities that don t chicago the losing bidder for the 2016 summer olympics is reported to have spent 100 million on paperwork and consultants and got nothing from it winning bidders have wound up with even larger tabs rio de janeiro spent about 13 billion in private and public money to host the 2016 games though some put the cost at 20 billion sochi famously spent 51 billion to prepare for the 2014 winter olympics a price tag that scared off many bidders particularly cities in europe and north america last year the ioc awarded two summer olympics simultaneously to paris and los angeles 2024 and 2028 in one bid process dubi said it was too early to speculate if it might do the same for the 2026 and 2030 winter olympics simon chadwick who specializes in olympics research at the university of salford in manchester england says the ioc has a sales job on its hands at best the scientific evidence suggests that the economic benefits associated with bidding for and hosting the games are marginal chadwick said in an email to the ap as such the case for hosting is open to debate hence there has been an increasing trend for european countries to put bidding decisions to a popular vote via a referendum voters in at least two european cities munich germany and st moritz switzerland turned down referendums to pursue bids for 2022 the munich vote was embarrassing for ioc president thomas bach who is from germany the costs are not just financial chadwick wrote people often perceive that there are social legal and environmental costs too he also added opportunity cost meaning money spent on the olympics could have been spent elsewhere china spent at least 40 billion on the 2008 beijing olympics the chinese are spending big again on the winter games bach has cautioned china to rein in spending and stick to the reforms but he also lauded organizers for raising so much money the ioc generated almost 6 billion in revenue in the last olympic cycle 2013 2016 but uses just a fraction of that to help host cities we have already discussed with the beijing organizing committee about different venues about the location for venues about the scale of venues in order to reduce costs bach said days before the pyeongchang olympics opened on the other hand we have to say we are real
