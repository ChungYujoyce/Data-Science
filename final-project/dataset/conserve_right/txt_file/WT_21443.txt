apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the robert mueller report is not just a tale of trump russia links but also a depiction of how political operatives try to cash in on a presidential campaign the special counsel s laborious dissection of various russian contacts turned out to be trump principals leveraging their status to try to arrange lucrative consulting contracts trump associates complain that the mueller report dedicates verbiage to innocent networking that was never tied to the investigation s main purpose election conspiracy the justice department s mandate to mr mueller was to investigate any links between trump and russia top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey mr mueller portrays carter page a onetime campaign volunteer who runs an investment firm as a businessman seeking new energy deals in russia during and after the election mr page like other mueller critics says the prosecuting team that wrote the report was stocked with biased hillary clinton supporters the desperate democrat liars on the mueller witch hunt team rank high among the most hypocritical long term washingtonians in the swamp and that s really saying something mr page told the washington times i have never sought to make one cent from my involvement in the trump movement yet they themselves supported one of the worst and most dangerous criminal cabals in history a multimillion dollar operation mr page describes the cabal as an alliance of the fbi democrats and the news media paul manafort worked as campaign chairman sans salary his long term hope was to rekindle a steady flow of cash as a consultant to ukrainian politicians george papadopoulos whose maneuverings in london sparked the trump russia investigation injected himself into the storyline by accepting a 3 000 research assignment from stefan halper the mueller report said papadopoulos eventually wanted to meet rich russians mr halper an oxford professor tied to the british intelligence community turned out to be an fbi informant mr halper who also ingratiated himself to mr page has maintained a low profile for months what he reported back to his handlers remains secret in another report anecdote rick gerson director of the hedge fund falcon edge capital and best friends with jared kushner the president s son in law and adviser met postelection with kirill dmitriev the english speaking mr dmitriev runs russia s sovereign wealth fund he maintains a direct line of communication to russian president vladimir putin whom he calls the boss mr dmitriev is also mr putin s connection to all things persian gulf the russian and new york fund managers came together in late november 2016 via the national security adviser for the united arab emirates during the transition mr gerson worked with mr dmitriev on a blueprint for better u s russia relations they also talked business a possible joint investment venture but talks ended in march 2017 the mueller report says michael cohen mr trump s attorney turned accuser immediately hung a shingle in 2016 as the man who could provide for a price deep insights into the new white house in the end none of these businessmen was charged with any election crimes mr mueller said his 22 month investigation failed to establish a trump conspiracy with moscow to interfere in the 2016 election to arrive at that end mr mueller investigated russian contacts relying on testimony texts emails memos phone calls and train and plane schedules the information gathering produced a mueller narrative that is heavy on networking and light on election colluding the real purpose of the mueller dossier was to help democrats impeach the president in the absence of any evidence of collusion said rep devin nunes of california senior republican on the house permanent select committee on intelligence thus the report includes a long litany of ordinary contacts between trump associates and russians as if a certain number of contacts indicate a conspiracy even if no conversations actually created or even discussed a conspiracy mr nunes said here are some significant trump players whom the media portrayed as the key to finding collusion but who were basically looking to make money paul manafort mr mueller depicts manafort as a seasoned wheeler dealer determined to capitalize on his trump association to rebuild a political consulting business the prosecutor s main source is rick gates manafort s former partner who made a deal to rat on his boss in exchange for leniency the chronicle begins with manafort visiting candidate trump at his mar a lago estate in palm beach florida and winning a campaign job on the spot manafort had no meaningful income at this point in time but resuscitating his domestic political campaign career could be financially beneficial in the future mr mueller writes gates reported that manafort intended if trump won the presidency to remain outside the administration and monetize his relationship with the administration one tactic was to trade polling data for future considerations the report said manafort an old republican hand who became trump campaign manager from march to august shared polling with his ukrainian aide konstantin kilimnik manafort did not see a downside to sharing campaign information and told gates that his role in the campaign would be good for business and potentially a way to be made whole for work he previously completed in the ukraine the mueller report said his new status might persuade ukrainian officials to pay up on 2 million in debts he also wanted to mend fences with a former lucrative client russian industrialist oleg deripaska manafort emailed mr kilimnik to make sure his kiev friends were aware he was now on the trump team mr kilimnik responded that yesterday i ve been sending everything to a deripaska deputy as to deripaska the mueller report said manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with him deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a disagreement a reference to one or more outstanding lawsuits manafort earned millions of dollars from mr deripaska in the mid 2000s working for his pro russia candidates manafort created an investment company funded solely by the oligarch the fund tanked triggering estrangement and litigation between manafort and mr deripaska after the nov 8 election manafort went right to work manafort instead preferred to stay on the outside and monetize his campaign position to generate business given his familiarity and relationship with trump and the incoming administration the mueller report said manafort appeared to follow that plan as he traveled to the middle east cuba south korea japan and china and was paid to explain what a trump presidency would entail nowhere in mr mueller s retelling does the relationship touch on election interference carter page mr page ranks among the most conspicuous trump russia figures a pro russia energy investor who worked in moscow as a merrill lynch banker mr page is the only known target of an fbi wiretap the bureau interviewed him seven times in 2017 democratic party financed dossier writer christoper steele in his opposition research wrongly accused him of various election conspiracies mr page s big mistake appears to be his decision to travel to moscow in early july to deliver the commencement address at the new economic school the mueller report depicts mr page as a one man investment shop looking for russian business on his personal moscow trip mr page met with an old friend an investor relations executive at gazprom the huge russian energy firm page also met with individuals from tatneft a russian energy company to discuss possible business deals including having page work as a consultant the mueller report said after his russia visit stirred negative press stories the campaign distanced itself from mr page who subsequently failed to land an administration job he traveled again to moscow in december in an attempt to pursue business opportunities the mueller report said mr kilimnik entered the picture as an indirect mueller source he wrote an email to manafort that said carter page is in moscow today sending messages he is authorized to talk to russia on behalf of dt on a range of issues of mutual interest including ukraine mr page had dinner with new economic school employees stopping by was deputy russian prime minister arkady dvorkovich he asked mr page to facilitate links to the presidential transition the report narration ends there after undergoing months of intense fbi scrutiny including a year s worth of wiretaps that allowed agents to pry into all types of communications retroactive to his campaign tenure mr page faced no charges the investigation did not establish that page coordinated with the russian government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election the mueller report said mr page told the washington times the dnc fbi obama administration s shared end objective of political sabotage proved highly successful and risked the lives of volunteer u s intelligence community informants like me in the process george papadopoulos the mueller report suggests papadopoulos an energy consultant always had his eye on business opportunities with rich russians mr mueller spends pages describing the trump volunteer networking among london s think tank circles to try to arrange a candidate meeting with the kremlin it was papadopoulos alleged comment to australian ambassador alexander downer that moscow owned dirt on mrs clinton that prompted the fbi to open the investigation on july 31 2016 russia had hacked democratic party computers and began leaking them through wikileaks on july 22 the report also delves into papadopoulos short term contact with another trump russia celebrity sergei millian mr millian is a belarusian american who promoted business deals at the fringe of the trump real estate empire his celebrity came from being named in press reports as a secondhand source for information in the infamous and discredited steele dossier mr millian has denied he was a source for any information the mueller report said he resides outside the u s investigators contacted him numerous times but he refused to make himself available for an interview mr millian first reached out to papadopoulos in july 2016 and soon they were chatting about future business deals on november 9 2016 shortly after the election said the mueller report papadopoulos arranged to meet millian in chicago to discuss business opportunities including potential work with russian billionaires who are not under sanctions the report was quoting a millian facebook message to papadopoulos the report continues the meeting took place on november 14 2016 at the trump hotel and tower in chicago according to papadopoulos the two men discussed partnering on business deals but papadopoulos perceived that millian s attitude toward him changed when papadopoulos stated that he was only pursuing private sector opportunities and was not interested in a job in the administration the two remained in contact however and had extended online discussions about possible business opportunities in russia the two also arranged to meet at a washington d c bar when both attended trump s inauguration in late january 2017 there the millian papadopoulos account ends papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to fbi agents about the timing and extent of his meetings in london once seen as the key to unlocking russian collusion he was never charged with any conspiracies michael cohen cohen overtly tried to cash in on his long association with mr trump the mueller report makes brief mention of essential consultants llc the shell company cohen set up in october 2016 it was the vehicle for paying 130 000 in hush money to stormy daniels a porn actress who claims a one night fling with mr trump years ago cohen became a cooperating witness for mr mueller who sent the daniels payoff investigation to the u s attorney in manhattan cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws as well as tax fraud and lying to congress he is serving a three year sentence at a minimum security prison in otisville new york after mr trump won the presidency cohen turned essential consultants into a place to collect millions of dollars from well heeled corporate heads wanting advice on how to deal with the white house the justice department authorized mr mueller to investigate the llc because one corporation had ties to a russian oligarch the mueller report contains no evidence that cohen or essential consultants was linked to el
