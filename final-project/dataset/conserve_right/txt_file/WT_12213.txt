apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the state department is stepping up efforts to block china from acquiring american technology in a large scale high technology military buildup christopher ford assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation said the efforts are aimed at countering beijing s strategy of military civilian fusion being directed by chinese president xi jinping the fusion process moves technology acquired abroad ostensibly for civilian purposes to the people s liberation army pla mr ford said in a speech to the u s naval academy last week mr ford said his bureau at the state department has joined with los alamos national laboratory since july in a program aimed at putting up barriers to the proliferation of sensitive technologies to the people s republic of china technologies which beijing has been using to build up its military capabilities in support of its ambitious china dream of national rejuvenation to regain china s position as a world leader in a range of fields including military might top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots china s drive for foreign technology is based on mr xi s china dream ideology of making beijing a global power along with a parallel strong military dream he said china is becoming a communist party run state with a sociopolitical operating system that combines state capitalism with a leninist party organization the goal is to replace democratic capitalism around the world chinese strategic writings make clear that the objective of the chinese communist party strategy is not merely to acquire power and influence for china on the world stage but in fact to displace u s power and influence so as to reclaim the central geopolitical status and role of which china believes it was robbed by western imperialism mr ford said to achieve that goal foreign technology acquisition has been a main feature of the military modernization since the 1980s in preparing to defeat the united states in a military conflict china engaged in a massive science and technology development effort focused upon getting the high technology weapons that it was assumed would shape the nature of warfare in the 21st century mr ford said that s where the fusing of military and civilian technology comes in for china s industrial complexes china s military is seeking high technology for the informationization of warfare centered on advanced communications and computing capabilities what mr ford called an ability to win wars without putting any boots on the ground at all a key element will be the integration of artificial intelligence into military systems to win the wars of the future since last year the chinese military began to prepare for war using military based artificial intelligence weapons and war fighting concepts in doing so the chinese are seeking to match a similar u s military strategy of employing advanced war fighting concepts called the third offset also known as the most recent iteration of the revolution in military affairs or rma simply put china aims to lead the next rma and to reap the geopolitical benefits accordingly by exploiting cutting edge civilian technology mr ford said this is the ccp s blueprint for china s global return to military pre eminence the civilian military fusion plan is not simply to boost chinese economic competitiveness but to assist in achieving global military supremacy other targets of chinese technology acquisition include nuclear technology aerospace and aviation know how semiconductors cloud computing robotics and big data processing technology semiconductors cloud computing and big data are needed for the artificial intelligence weapons while ai will be applied to the other areas china is also pursuing advanced capabilities to control the seas and defeat the u s navy as it seeks access to resources around the world china also is considering building floating nuclear power plants in the south china sea where u s and chinese naval forces have been confronting each other over disputed islands mr ford said china s state run nuclear corporation is working to develop nuclear ships and submarines for the chinese military any foreign cooperation with the company is tantamount to cooperation with the pla navy and its nuclear propulsion programs he said china s military technology program might not succeed what is clear however is that china is today engaged in a state led industrial policy based whole of nation competitive strategy that revolves in crucial ways around the acquisition of sensitive foreign technologies by any and every possible means mr ford said the u s government recently halted nuclear cooperation with china on advanced modular reactors and other designs that could boost china s military repression in western china a forthcoming report by the congressional u s china economic and security review commission contains details on how beijing is turning its western xinjiang province into a repressive police state china has ordered the mass incarceration of some 1 million ethnic uighurs as part of a crackdown that the commission says appears linked to the 1 trillion belt and road initiative bri designed to expand chinese influence using infrastructure investments in the developing world xinjiang is the site of an extensive campaign of repression by the chinese communist party government targeting the region s majority islamic uighur population and other ethnic minorities many of whom do not culturally or politically identify with china according to a late draft of the commission report due to be made public in the next two weeks xinjiang is the a hub for three of china s six proposed economic development corridors under the initiative that will extend trade routes from china to south asia the middle east and europe china is seeking to pacify the restive region as part of its initiative but the repression of the uighurs has sparked a backlash from other countries in the region including pakistan india bangladesh and kazakhstan growing backlash over china s uighur policy could make some states unwilling to cooperate with beijing on bri projects the report said the estimated 1 million uighurs held in the xinjiang camps represent 8 percent of the province s total ethnic minority population a total of 23 6 million people live in xinjiang the state department has said china has continued to extract unpaid labor conduct indoctrination sessions and closely monitor and restrict the movements of uighurs to counteract what it considered religious extremism in xinjiang china is using advanced technology in the repression campaign including compulsory mass collection of biometric data such as voice samples and dna and is using artificial intelligence and big data to identify profile and track every resident in xinjiang the report said arrests of uighurs in xinjiang have been used by the chinese to intimidate and blackmail relatives overseas in a bid to suppress dissent outside china the report said china doubled spending on the tools of repression in xinjiang from 2016 to 2017 when domestic security budgets increased from 4 6 billion to 8 8 billion russian hypersonic missile to deploy in 2019 a state run russian news outlet reported this week that moscow will deploy its first hypersonic maneuvering missiles in 2019 the tass news agency reported monday that the first regiment of avangard hypersonic missiles will become operational by the end of next year the avangard or advance guard is a boost glide vehicle launched atop an ss 19 intercontinental ballistic missile the missile is capable of traveling at speeds of up to mach 20 or 15 345 miles per hour it was among the high
