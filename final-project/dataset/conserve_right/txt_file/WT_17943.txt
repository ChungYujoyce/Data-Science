apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis opinion many people think the best way to deal with china is to make it a stakeholder in the international system the idea is that if china were part of the system it would play by the system s accepted rules this is a good idea with respect to international trade and finance china has a huge stake not only in the global trading system even if it doesn t always play by the rules and of course they have a stake in america s economy as well because it holds so much of our debt top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century but this idea has a serious flaw with respect to international law the chinese do not look at international law the same way we do they don t accept the idea that international law is intended to codify norms and rules that are acceptable to everyone instead as recent writings of some specialists on china s people s liberation army show they cynically see international law as a realm of conflict in which china seeks unilateral advantage the chinese call this strategy lawfare or legal warfare my colleague at the heritage foundation research fellow and china specialist dean cheng argues that the chinese see lawfare as an instrument of conflict no different in principle than the use of armed force the objective is the same to force adversaries to acquiesce to china s demands mr cheng explains in a forthcoming paper how people working for the chinese army have devised specific strategies to use international treaties and other legal claims not to advance international peace and stability but rather to weaken the ability of an opponent to resist this strategy is already apparent in china s use of the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos to contest u s naval operations chinese military leaders invoke unclos when they complain that u s ships must turn off their radar or restrict themselves in other ways when they pass through china s 200 mile exclusive economic zone the u s and other nations challenge this interpretation of unclos but others including india share china s view the u s has not ratified unclos but if it were to do so china surely would misuse unclos in an attempt to force its views on the u s another example of chinese lawfare in action is beijing s anti secession law adopted at the 10th national people s congress in march 2005 this law is intended to give china the legal justification for any military nonpeaceful move against taiwan should the latter exert its independence the implication of the law is that taiwan is part of china and thus subject to beijing s laws the anti secession law would be used to counter any claims made by taiwan or the u s that a chinese attack on taiwan is violating international law the chinese watched closely how countries used international law to challenge the u s during the iraq war they saw how the u s and some american officials became the targets of international lawsuits they saw how critics cited international law to wage a campaign against the detention center at guantanamo bay cuba although china is ambivalent about eroding its own sovereignty by empowering international courts it is all too happy to support others who use treaties to undermine the legal legitimacy of u s actions at bottom china views international law as an instrument of warfare that means there will be winners and losers and beijing means to use international law so that it wins and the rest of us lose kim r holmes a former assistant secretary of state is a vice president at the heritage foundation www heritage org follow h
