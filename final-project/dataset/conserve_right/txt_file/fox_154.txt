stoltenberg secretary general of the north atlantic treaty organization all right now on fox news sunday end videotape roberts and hello again from washington the clock is reset in the battle over the border wall that led to the longest shutdown in u s history federal workers will soon be returning to the job but their paychecks could be in jeopardy once again if congress cannot strike a deal by february the 15th when the stopgap spending measure runs out if congress comes back with a plan that does not include the 5 7 billion president trump wants for his proposed wall or at least some percentage of that he has threatened to let the government shut down again or declare a national emergency to bypass congress joining me not to talk more about this is the president aposs acting chief of staff mick mulvaney mick welcome back to fox news sunday thanks for taking the time i know you got back to south carolina to see your family for the first time since new year aposs mick mulvaney acting white house chief of staff john good morning thanks so much for having me as always roberts so did the president cave to democrats i think a lot of democrats think that he capitulated here because he really came away from 35 days of a government shutdown with nothing more than he could aposve had at least two weeks ago when senator graham propose the same thing and maybe even back to before this whole thing started mulvaney no i think what you aposve seen here is the president seeing an opportunity what he did why he did what he did was because many democrats have come to us some of them privately many of them spoke out publicly that they are actually starting to agree with him on the necessity for a barrier on the southern border and they had come to us and said look we agree with you you aposre winning the battle on the importance of a barrier on the southern border but we simply cannot work with you while the government is open that aposs a marked different excuse me while the government was closed roberts yes mulvaney that aposs a marked difference from where the democrat leadership was where they said they wouldn apost talk to us about border security ever nancy pelosi famously said that even if we open the government she wouldn apost give us a single dollar for the wall so i think the president saw a chance here to try to take the democrats at their word some of the rank and file also some of the leadership dick durbin said some decent things about border barrier jim clyburn my former colleague from south carolina said that the experts thought we really needed a barrier he could vote for it so let aposs give a chance for the democrats to prove whether or not they really do believe in border security and are willing to go against nancy pelosi or whether or not they are so beholden to their leadership that they are never going to vote for a barrier on the southern border roberts now the president is under no illusions mick that this is going to be a difficult task ahead he tweeted out yesterday 21 days goes very quickly negotiations with democrats will start immediately it will not be easy to make a deal both parties very dug in nancy pelosi is on record several times and you pointed out as saying no money for a wall how do you get democrats to move her off of that position i mean she seems to have the solidarity of the democratic party behind her mulvaney i laugh at times she says there aposs no money for the wall she actually just voted for almost a quarter billion dollars for a barrier on the southern border with this deal that just got approved last week but i think what we simply do is go to the democrats and say look are you telling the people the truth when you look at your constituents back home and say you agree with the president that we have to do something about security at the southern border are you telling the truth or are just doing something that aposs politically expedient this is a chance for them to let their actions speak louder than words keep in mind the last time the democrats sort of follow nancy pelosi blindly down a path on policy we ended up with obamacare and bailouts and cap and trade they lost control of the house so the question is is nancy really leading the democratic party or is she just being led by the hard left wing of her party and will the rest of the democrats follow her so this is just the next step in the negotiation we thought it was the exact right thing for the president to do at the time and i think ultimately he aposll be judged by the end of by what happens at the end of this process not by what happen this week roberts there is some money in the continuing resolution for border security but that aposs to upgrade existing fencing and that aposs not for construction of new mileage of border wall which is what you want if you can stipulate that the request mulvaney absolutely absolutely correct but let me jump in very quickly when you go from a 2 foot high barrier to a 30 foot high wall roberts it makes a difference mulvaney that counts that counts as new security roberts all right so the president was asking for 5 7 billion the vice president took the congress day after christmas and offer i think it was 2 4 billion are you stuck on the 5 7 or will you take less than that mulvaney i think the president wants his 5 7 billion keep in mind why is that number it aposs not a number that aposs made up it aposs what the experts have told him he aposs listened to dhs i have been on the meetings he aposs listened to cbp he aposs listened to ice we have identified the top 17 highest priorities in terms of where we can put up barriers to discourage people from crossing the border illegally it aposs about 243 miles that aposs what driving this discussion it aposs not a made a magical number of 5 7 billion it aposs the wall where we need it the most and where we need it the quickest that aposs what driving this so this not something where the president is married to a number he is married to border security which is the right thing for the president of the united states to do roberts it aposs not lost on me that you shrewdly ducked my question will he take less than 5 7 in a negotiation mulvaney oh i wasn apost ducking your question laughter mulvaney just i wasn apost negotiating with you on tv you know i never do that roberts but will is he prepared to take less than the 5 7 i mean you were willing to take 2 6 going into christmas there was the offer of 2 4 i mean clearly he is not hard and fast on that number mulvaney again if i don apost answer your question i don apost mean to dodge look let aposs look at this way the president has all ready gone to the democrats and said look it aposs not a 2 000 mile sea to shining sea wall it aposs not a giant 30 foot concrete barrier that so many democrats seem to have difficulty with he even put daca and tps on the table at some point during this process and they refused to even engage so i think the better question is what are the democrats willing to do the president from the very beginning here actually has been the one willing to negotiate he was the one staying in washington d c when nancy went to hawaii he aposs the one who stayed in d c when democrats all went down to puerto rico he was in d c which he tried to leave to go to europe and the middle east last week he wants to negotiate on the deal the democrat leadership simply refused to take him up on that roberts it is fortuitous that we have west virginia senator joe manchin coming up mick because we will be able to ask a question about what democrats plan to do would you recommend another shut down to the president if there aposs no deal by february the 15th mulvaney look we look at it going backwards what do we need to protect the country and we need border security and that includes a barrier keep in mind lost in all this other request that we made for things like more technology and improving ports of entry all of the things that go into the roberts but would you recommend he shut down the government again mulvaney no one wants the government shutdown john it aposs not a desired end but when the president vetoes a bill that is put in front of him on a spending package sometimes that has the effect of shutting the government down we don apost go into this trying to shut the government down roberts he also threatened an emergency declaration and use money that aposs already appropriated to build the wall omb which you used to head and still officially do has been looking around for pots of money how much money did you find to build a wall mulvaney more than 5 7 billion the president told us several months ago to try to find money in every nook and cranny he told every member of the cabinet to do the exact same omb has been working on this for several months now and there aposs a lot more than a 5 7 billion it aposs better john to get it through legislation that aposs the right way to do it but at the end of the day the president is going to secure the border one way or another roberts so when the president comes to you and says mick should i declare an emergency if you don apost money for a wall and you don apost want to shut down the government would you recommend he aposd do that because it would certainly almost immediately be adjoined by the courts and most likely a court in the jurisdiction of the 9th circuit of appeals and that could be playing his last card mulvaney we are just as aware of all of those contingencies as you just laid out as everybody else aposs so there is ways we can try to mitigate those risks we certainly will there were some pots of money that are easier to get to than to others so again this is not something we are shooting off at the hip we aposve been working on this for months we have been hoping for months to do it through legislation with democrats because that aposs the right way for the government to function but the end of the day the president aposs commitment is to defend the nation and he will do it either with or without congress roberts the 5 7 billion you want to build about 170 miles of border wall through texas one thing i find curious that nobody aposs talking about here is that in most places along the rio grande you can apost build a fence in the floodplain of the rio grande so you have to build it in land anywhere from a couple of hundred yards to in some places a mile which might help you in interdicting drugs and human trafficking the people who don apost want to get caught but for all of those migrants honduras el salvador nicaragua guatemala the northern triangle countries they can still even with a border barrier get feet on u s soil and their goal is to be apprehended by the border patrol and get in the system so how would building a barrier in texas affect this problem of illegal immigration of the president talks about each and every day mulvaney that goes back to the larger discussion about border security yes there is a barrier yes there aposs technology and a part that sometimes gets forgotten about and something the president has talked about many many times which is to change our laws because you aposre absolutely right if the border if the wall if the barrier is back one foot from the border and someone can get one foot on our soil depending on what country they aposre from they can claim asylum and stay here almost indefinitely it aposs why some of the other things we aposve done that deal was negotiating with mexico to allow folks who are claiming asylum here to have to go back to mexico to wait while their asylum is being adjudicated that aposs been a major improvement that i don apost think has gotten the attention it deserves but it does raise your point does raise the larger picture that we need to change the laws that aposs part and parcel of this comprehensive border security concept it is not just about a barrier it is not just about technology it aposs about changing the laws that right now act as this giant poll we encourage people to come here from other countries to enter the country illegally because of the way our laws are structured and those need to be fixed as well as part of the larger national security package roberts we should also point out though that this remain in mexico policy right now only applies to people who are entering from a port of entry not people who cross the border illegally i got to ask you quickly before we go because time is running short venezuela is the u s ruling out military action if maduro refuses to cede leadership mulvaney i don apost think any president of any party who is doing his or her job would be doing the job properly if they took anything off the table so i think the president of the united states is looking at this extraordinarily closely i can tell you without giving away anything that shouldn apost that we are in constant communication with the secretary of state constant communication with the other parts of the federal government to find out what aposs going on on the ground down there making sure that our people and our property is safe down there and also to make sure that we can do everything we can to encourage the maduro government which we consider to be illegitimate to leave and to back the new national assembly leadership that declared this week so it aposs a very serious situation the president takes it very seriously and i think it aposs fair to say that no options are off the table roberts we aposll keep watching that mick thanks for taking time away from your family this weekend to be with us really appreciate it mulvaney thanks john roberts up next can congress strike a deal on border security and avoid to return to where all this began with a government shutdown two key lawmakers from both sides of the aisle join us next commercial break roberts the clock is ticking on what could be three weeks of intense negotiations over border security before the stopgap spending measure the president signed into law expires joining us here in washington republican senator roy blunt who is part of the bipartisan conference committee to try to hammer out a deal in next three weeks and joe manchin of west virginia the only democratic senator to consistently vote and support for a funding to build a wall senators welcome back to fox news sunday sen roy blunt r mo good to be with you sen joe manchin d w v thank you roberts senator manchin let aposs start with you mick mulvaney posted a question in our last segment what are democrats willing to do here what are democrats willing manchin i think democrats want to look at basically the holistic approach immigration reform pathways forward for some people basically i aposve always said people came two ways they came the wrong way for the right reason wrong way for the wrong reason the people came for the wrong reason we want to make sure they go out and stay out you need border security for that but i think that people that came for the right reason have been productive ought to have a pathway forward some that would change the whole complexion of this the whole dialogue would change if that could be done as far as the 5 7 billion if that aposs the number we are figuring how do you split that up and let the professionals we have proven it aposs hard for us because with the president and white house and the legislature we have locked horns on this thing no wall all wall halfway in between let the professionals tell us what it takes to keep us safe drugs is a big problem in my state roberts absolutely manchin drugs are coming in how do we stop the drugs people the basically the terrorists and everything that aposs been reported i don apost know i would talk to will hurd and ask will if you aposre having that problem in texas so we need to talk to people that understand on the front lines and also professionals that can kind of be a dealmaker if you will help us find the right path roberts so senator blunt are you going to be in on all of these negotiations do you think that a compromise is possible here knowing that nancy pelosi has said time and time again no money for a border barrier blunt i think compromise is the essence of what we do and i think the american people are tired of watching the government where people get locked down for no reason except maybe political reasons i mean clearly the president showed shown real flexibility here for a guy who aposs not always that flexible i mean he has changed his view of this as he aposs gotten more information about how you secure the border about ways to do that we have consistently said that barriers were part of that the president went from talking about a wall along the entire southern border at one point during the campaign as part of the campaign discussion to let aposs have barriers where they work and let aposs have something else where barriers wouldn apost work as well four presidents have build barriers joe and i have both supported that when we aposve been in the congress and i think there aposs certainly a way forward here but part of the way forward is to look at the other issues that are out there too that need to be dealt with and deal with those the spending issues that are going to be right in front of us as soon as we get this done one of the things we learned this year was if you do this the right way you can you can have 100 percent of the government funded by the beginning of the fiscal year at this time we got 75 percent of the government funded that should be one of the lessons we learn here what do we need to get on the table right now so that we get 100 percent of the government funded and how do we deal with the border as an issue i aposve always thought securing the border first made the most sense and then i think the other problems related to immigration are much easier to solve and people think the government has done its fundamental job and you know nobody will ever had more credibility on this than president trump if he says the border is secure at the level that the american people should expect then the other discussions about what are the legitimate workforce needs of the country what do you do with people who came or stayed illegally about half the people not illegally here came legally and then decided gee we aposre in the united states of america this is a great place to be let aposs just not go back roberts sounds like you aposve got a lot to talk about in the next 19 days crosstalk blunt we do we do but i think these are not new issues is the other point john roberts yes blunt these are not new issues that members of congress don apost know a lot about there is nothing we aposre going to learn frankly in the next three weeks we don apost know right now so let aposs get started let aposs find solutions let aposs not continue to disappoint the people we work for by not showing the ability to work together roberts and ronald reagan learned back in the 1980s the dangers of cutting a deal on one part of immigration before you get security crosstalk manchin in 2013 we passed a major immigration reform bipartisan bill which took everything it was a holistic approach it was security 44 billion for security roberts yes manchin it was a pathway forward it was a cue number that you basically got in the back of the line we did everything humanly possible to look at the whole immigration problem so on top of that nobody if they went through ten years of doing everything they were supposed to do earn learn english basically get a job pay taxes get in the back of the line when your time came you still couldn apost be a citizen until we had the total border secured roberts sure manchin but if we are going to have this fight back and forth if we aposre not going to fix one and we would think one takes care of the other so security only without some pathway forward roberts but i think the president has indicated that he aposs willing to negotiate a bigger package on immigration but here aposs the question i have for you senator manchin you have voted as we pointed out at the top of this consistently for a border barrier many of your democratic colleagues nancy pelosi in particular don apost want anything to do with that what do you know that they don apost see about a border barrier manchin the only thing i know is i had 800 000 people that were furloughed or not getting paid i had 12 000 in west virginia people were hurting crosstalk roberts but why is a border barrier acceptable to you but it aposs not acceptable to so many of your democrats why do you see value in a border manchin i can apost speak i can apost speak roberts what do you see value in a border barrier manchin i see value in a border because i have talked custom and border patrol people and these are the professionals that i rely on they showed me and told me what needs to be done there needs to be some we already have 600 plus miles of some type of roberts so why is that lost on all of your colleagues manchin well i think it aposs lost because now it seems like the borders going to protect us within 700 miles or so of wall or a fencing or whatever i aposll call a secured structure is going to be the catch all do well that aposs not the case there aposs an awful lot more if we can stop most of our ports of entries is were all of our drugs are coming through can apost we have the screening the new sensors things of that sort ports of entry where big container ships roberts but isn apost that what the president is proposing like a package that he puts ph all of that blunt you know senator manchin we are good friends he has been consistent on this i frankly think and this is his position has been consistent many of the democrats in the last few months have looked at the president making this a big issue in his campaign and they have decided well we can apost be for that anymore 2013 virtually every democrat who is still in the senate voted for 700 miles of barriers and a whole lot more money than anybody is talking about right now speaker pelosi has been for barriers in the past you know the whole idea that somehow 650 or 700 miles of barriers are appropriate but 702 miles are immoral that is an incredibly interesting place to draw your line about what aposs moral and what aposs not moral i think this debate got way too political i do think let me say again i think the president has shown more room willingness to move so far than others have but we need to solve this we need to solve it in three months it may look like right now that speaker pelosi got what she wanted open the government and we aposll talk the we aposll talk part of that now is where we really are going to see the speaker either step up and talk along with senator schumer or find out that we aposll talk really didn apost mean anything it just meant give us what we want and then you aposre not going to get what you want roberts you talked to the president a lot in december heading into the christmas holiday just before the shut down what were you telling him then manchin well basically we talked i didn apost think this would ever happen i said for the first time mr president you aposve got six bills ready to go totally unanimous consent and we all voted on mitch mcconnell put it forward the breakdown came basically the fiscal year 2019 budget for the homeland security was 1 6 billion that was appropriated then it went to the house and the house has bumped it up to 5 billion and it became in contention so they were going to put that one on the 30 day or let aposs say to february the 8th and put that one at 1 3 continuing resolution and then fight that one out i thought that aposs exactly where the president would go he got pushed from the base he jumped up and said we are not going to never before have i ever seen when we all agreed unanimously on six bills that we aposve kept 90 percent of the government open 96 percent of all money flowing for the government to operate and hold that hostage and so much harm was done i don apost know if anyone realized in the white house or the president how that would react and i think they saw the push back we can apost go down this road again we need to crosstalk blunt well on 1 6 billion which is frankly what the administration asked for this time last year 1 6 billion that clearly included walls or barriers or whatever i think surely we can deal with the semantics of this and then the house stepped in with a much bigger number the president like that number better roberts yes 5 7 that sounds better than 1 6 blunt exactly and lots of democrats john in the last week 5 7 out there as a number they were willing to do they just wanted to be a little more specific about how you do this you know under president george w bush we had a major move going toward a virtual wall roberts yes blunt for the parts of the border that the president now says needs something like a virtual wall rather than an actual wall roberts well he says he uses the word smart wall blunt exactly roberts look the clock is running so time is running out blunt time is running that aposs right roberts but senator blunt the president has threatened either another government shutdown or an emergency declaration at the end of this if he doesn apost get what he aposs looking for you have said quote shutdowns are bad politics and even worse government and on an emergency declaration that precedent could create real problems in the future on other issues blunt right roberts so i mean are we looking at another shutdown crosstalk blunt that after 35 days of this the president also thinks shutdowns are not such great politics and bad government i think i just heard mick mulvaney say the same thing we would all prefer to see this negotiated the way it should be negotiated i happen to agree with the president on barriers at the border and border security as an important first step but there might be a future president that i don apost agree with that thinks something else is an emergency i think it aposs a bad precedent i hope the president doesn apost have to go there if we aposll do our job he won apost even have to consider going there three weeks from now because we aposll have reached the right crosstalk manchin the only we can ever stop this i have thought everything about how you ever stop this from happening the shutdown is it within three weeks the one thing we can do to help the american society and the american economy and the american people is to make sure if a shutdown ever occurs by our own making our pay stops immediately the day of the shutdown trust me there will not be a shutdown everything else we can talk about all the policies you stop the paycheck the same as everyone else got hurt the only people i caught her with all the people working for the government congress didn apost get hurt nobody felt the pain roberts predict success or failure in this negotiation blunt i aposm reasonably optimistic i think we aposve all seen everybody step out into the new world realm republican senate democrat house new speaker republican president the initial touch of the gloves was not producing the kind of result that we need to produce here so i am optimistic we need to work hard to see that we find how we can solve this in a way that the president gets what he needs but the american people fundamentally get the government that they deserve roberts we will see i mean the very fact that we got you two on together this morning is maybe a good start crosstalk manchin we all want the same thing we want our borders to be safe and secure we want to stop the flow of drugs we want to keep the people who basically are coming for the wrong reasons and preying on our economy keep them out i mean take them out make sure they don apost come back all these things are said but there aposs people that need a pathway forward that have been very productive and there should be some compassion towards that roberts we will see where this goes senator blunt senator manchin good to have you on this morning thank you up next we will bring in our sunday group to discuss this week aposs winners and losers in the ongoing battle over the border commercial break roberts coming up the government is back open but the sticking point is the same begin video clip trump it aposs just common sense walls work rep nancy pelosi d calif speaker of the house have i not been clear on the wall no i have been very clear on the wall end video clip roberts we aposll ask our sunday panel which side is going to blink first next on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip trump after 36 days of spirited debate and dialogue i have seen and heard from enough democrats and republicans that they are willing to put partisanship aside i think sen chuck schumer d n y minority leader that bodes well for finding an eventual agreement the fact that we have so many areas where we can agree end video clip roberts president trump and senate minority leader chuck schumer finding common ground on ending the longest government shutdown in history but for how long and at what expense it aposs time now for our sunday group jason riley from the wall street journal is with us along with columnist for the hill juan williams julie pace the washington bureau chief of the associated press and fox news correspondent gillian turner i love that declarative statement by the president they aposre willing to put aside partisanship i think winners and losers here jason who won who lost jason riley contributor well it aposs it aposs hard to see how this could have turned out any other way the president said if we shut down the government i aposll take the blame the government shut down and he got blamed i think nancy pelosi is obviously the big winner here you know a month ago people were questioning whether she should even be speaker again i think she aposs put that to rest but they feel like they aposre on a roll here they picked up the house majority 40 seats or so and the president aposs approval rating has declined significantly during the shutdown so clearly they aposre the winner now the onus is now on pelosi and the democrats to negotiate like they said they would in good faith if the government is reopened and we aposll see if they do that one thing that strikes me about this the real losers here are the dreamers i think those dreamer immigrants have just been treated like pawns particularly by pelosi and the democrats roberts and i think as senator manchin was saying they aposre looking for a bigger deal here riley but but roberts not not just protection but a path to inaudible riley but remember dreamer but the dreamers were told you know nancy pelosi keeps saying i aposm i aposm i aposm negotiating on your behalf i am putting you first no she aposs putting keeping funding for the wall away from trump first and i don apost know that there are a lot of dreamers who agree with that priority roberts right but she certainly did seem to win julie on that front in terms of keeping the money away from the president julie pace the associated press she absolutely did i i share jason aposs winner in this situation it is definitely nancy pelosi not only on the shutdown itself and how she negotiated with the white house she comes out of this with her caucus more united than they were when they were sworn in as the new democratic majority just a few weeks ago she aposs got those freshmen who were emboldened coming out of their elections who are now firmly behind her because they see that she is willing to hold a tough line against the president and for the president i think one of the things that that we really learned through this last few weeks is that he really does not have a strategy for dealing with a democratic house majority not just on the shutdown but more broadly this is the first time in his presidency that he has an opponent that has real power roberts yes he pace and he does not seem to know how to deal with that right now roberts he certainly doesn apost seem to have a strategy for dealing with nancy pelosi gillian turner correspondent well so one of the losers i wanted to mention that people are not spending enough time on this week is u s cybersecurity defenses i aposve had sources federal government sources ringing alarm bells all week every day for the last two weeks one source even went so far as to say this particular week the u s federal government before the shutdown ended was more venerable to foreign cyberattacks phishing spearing attacks and terrorism online than in any point in history and it aposs also going to take the government the federal government now months to recoup the losses to get back to where they were 35 days ago roberts i think a mutual friend of ours was saying if you were going to attack the united states if you were a terrorist during the shutdown would be the time turner now is a great time roberts yes so chuck schumer goes into the negotiations really kind of saying i told you so juan let aposs listen to what he said and then get your reaction begin video clip schumer no one should ever underestimate the speaker as donald trump has learned the unity of our two caucuses really worked because i believed the president himself believed and was told by a couple of his advisers you aposve written about them that oh just hold out and we aposll get the democrats to crack and join us he was unable to do that end video clip roberts all right so we aposve got 19 days of negotiations can the president get the democrats to crack at all on funding for a border barrier juan williams political analyst i don apost see it right now john i mean what we know from the polling and we aposve had some recent polls indicating very clearly now i think it aposs 54 percent of the american people don apost favor the wall so that the wall itself which is a huge political symbol for this president does not seem to have the political power that he thought we aposve seen his numbers drop the ap poll julie is here now now him at 34 percent approval so that aposs a drop for him i aposm particularly in touch with the idea that independents who i think are key as we look towards 2020 and the president and his team are increasingly focused on his re election prospects you look at the independents and what they aposre saying is disapproval of ten points now to 63 percent and so overall even just a general discussion of the topic of border security republicans historically hold the advantage what we see now is that the two sides are equal that 42 percent trust pelosi and the democrats to 40 percent trusting trump and the republicans but let me just add one quick point here it aposs one thing to hear from people who you know are pretty critical of trump about who won and who lost but why don apost you go ask the base and then you hear from people like ann coulter of the talk radio crowd and they think trump lost roberts oh yes they think he lost big time ok so people are staking out positions the president tweeting quote only fools or people with a political agenda don apost want a wall or steel barrier to protect our country from crime drugs and human trafficking it will happen it always does but listen to what nancy pelosi said on friday begin video clip pelosi have i not been clear on a wall ok no i have been very clear on the wall end video clip roberts so mick mulvaney jason believes that pressure will arise from democrats who say you know maybe like senator manchin maybe we do need some sort of border barrier but it doesn apost sound like she aposs willing to give in and can she hold her coalition together riley well the democratic opposition to a wall is clearly situational not principled we know that because so many in the past have voted for a wall i i think some might might come around to that i don apost know that that that that trump will get all of the money he wants but i think he will get get something at the very least and i think there will be pressure coming from from democrats on nancy pelosi to do that the thing here for the president though he clearly believes that the that the border security was his ticket in 2016 and that it will be his ticket to re election the question is whether there are diminishing returns here for the president on this issue williams i don apost think there aposs going to be a wall there aposs not going to be any well and what you hear from democrats is talk about now john of a smart wall more sensors more drones more border security agents more immigration judges they will take those steps and when it comes to the dreamers to jason aposs point remember it was president trump who created the crisis by undoing what president obama had done roberts so is this going to give him real trouble in 2020 because he was claiming that aposs what this was all about was 2020 pace i well and i think a lot of it is all about 2020 for him at this point i mean trump is politically is in a situation where he has had for the last two years a solid base that has been behind him no matter what happens but john you were at these rallies in 2016 as i was and i was constantly struck by the fact that a lot of trump supporters when he had the chance about build the wall who will pay for it that wasn apost just a political talking point for a lot of these people roberts no pace they actually wanted the policy to be implemented roberts exactly pace this was not just rhetoric and so i think he knows that that base that has been so loyal this is one issue where they could crumble roberts gillian really quick answer if i could does this losses as many people have put it to nancy pelosi have coattails with his negotiations with xi and with kim and his approach to putin are they going to look at him and say wow we aposve just got to wait him out and we aposll beat him turner i think that that is a calculation foreign leaders across the globe from the middle east and latin america are making this week they aposre looking at this and they aposre saying you know what it turns out that the democrats winning the house in the midterms actually did matter for the president aposs foreign policy agenda everybody was saying regardless what happens the prerogative remains with him he fell the president fell on his sword on the wall issue he sort of had to but it aposs had some real world consequences in terms of the u s foreign policy around the world roberts we aposll bring you back to talk to us about some other pressing issues roger stone venezuela but when we come back the house sends a message to president trump stay in nato but is the president right does the u s pay more than its share of the military burden we aposll ask the head of the alliance jens stoltenberg coming up next commercial break begin video clip trump we aposre going to be with nato 100 percent but as i told the countries you have to step up rep jimmy panetta d calif we have to realize is that nato is not just a transactional relationship our sole focus can apost just be on who pays what and who gets what end video clip roberts democratic congressman jimmy panetta sponsor of the house bill reiterating strong congressional support of nato after reports the president discussed pulling out of the military alliance over allies failing to pay their fair share joining me now is jens stoltenberg he aposs the secretary general of nato mr secretary general thanks for being with us today jens stoltenberg nato secretary general thank you for having me robert i want to talk about nato and spending and all of that but first of all another pressing issue venezuela and it aposs one that a lot of nato members are involved in france spain germany the u k pressuring maduro to hold elections in seven days or they will recognize juan guaido as the legitimate leader of venezuela maduro sort of laughing at the idea the situation in venezuela how tenuous you think it is and could it devolve into civil war stoltenberg it is a very serious situation and many nato allies are trying to help to find a solution but i think that most important thing now is to avoid a civil war avoid violence is has is going to be used and therefore nato ally support also for trying to find a negotiated solution roberts recently here in washington d c the house voted overwhelmingly on a measure that would require congressional approval for the president to pull out of nato because the president has threatened that he will pull out of nato if other nato nations don apost live up to their financial commitment he has since said i aposm 100 percent behind nato do you really have any concerns that president trump would pull the united states out of the alliance stoltenberg so president trump has been very clear he is committed to nato he aposs stated this clearly just a few days ago and it is also at the nato summit in in july but at the same time he has clearly stated that nato allies need to invest more and therefore at the summit in july last year we agreed to do more to step up and now we see the results by the end of next year nato allies will add 100 100 billion extra u s dollars for defense so we see some real money and some real results and we see that the clear message from president trump is having an impact nato allies have heard the president loud and clear and now nato allies are stepping up so this is good news meaning that we actually see more fair burden sharing roberts so that aposs interesting that you say that the nato allies have heard the message and it and it aposs a good thing because president trump gets loudly criticized here in the united states and abroad for being hostile to nato for putting too much pressure on them to live up to their financial commitments so from from your perspective what he aposs saying good thing or bad thing stoltenberg there is no doubt that his very clear message is having an impact the message on the summit last summer was very clear with all the leaders sitting around the table and the message was was that the u s president trump he aposs committed to nato but we need fair burden sharing roberts right so are you happy with what he aposs saying i mean did did nato nations did nato as an organization need a kick in the pants stoltenberg i aposm happy with the fact that he has helped us to now move the question of burden sharing within the alliance and this is important for european allies for a strong nato it aposs good for europe but it aposs also good for united states we have to remember that the only time we have invoked article v of our collective defense clause was after an attack on the united states and hundreds of thousands of canadian european soldiers have fought shoulder to shoulder with u s soldiers in afghanistan we have worked together with u s in defeating daesh isis in iraq and syria so it aposs a great advantage for the united states to have 28 allies russia doesn apost have that china doesn apost have that but the u s has allies and friends roberts you mentioned russia and one of the knocks on president trump is what he says about president putin and his criticisms of nato is giving putin a way to try to create divisions within nato listen to what congressman eliot engel of new york said last week begin video clip rep eliot engel d n y today nato plays a critical role in keeping an increasingly aggressive russia in check and that aposs one of the reasons splintering the nato alliance is one of vladimir putin aposs top goals and that aposs why it aposs so disturbing so troubling to see the united states sending mixed signals about our commitment to the alliance or treating it as a burden end video clip roberts nancy pelosi the new speaker of the house went so far as to tweet on friday night why has the trump administration continued to discuss pulling the u s out of nato which would be a massive victory for putin that could be connected to other issues regarding the president and putin but what president trump is saying about nato and the way he is saying it is he giving an advantage to putin here stoltenberg what he aposs doing is to is to help us adapt the alliance which we need because we live in a more unpredictable world with more assert ph to russia using violence or force against a neighbor ukraine and therefore nato has to adapt partly ph by increase in the readiness ph of our forces we are doing that partly by stepping up our fight against terrorism we are doing that we had a new training mission in iraq but also partly by investing more and you have to remember that the increase we now see in defense spending by european and nato allies comes after years of decline so before they were cutting billions now they aposre actually adding billions roberts so so you aposre not concerned that he aposs helping putin splinter nato like so many of his critics are stoltenberg what is see is that actually nato is united because we are able to adapt to deliver north america and europe are doing more together now than before we have more u s troops in europe and more exercises so we welcome that but we also welcome the fact that european allies are stepping up and this is a clear message to russia and i think they see that roberts and in your mind mr secretary general what is what is the greater threat to nato is it that russia may move into the baltic states or is it what aposs happening in the black sea in the balkan area stoltenberg the challenge for nato is that we are faced with many different threats at the same time russia using violence against neighbors but also daesh isil in the south and in inaudible on nuclear weapons so therefore we are now in the midst of the biggest reinforcement of nato since the end of the cold war roberts there is real concerns in some circles that vladimir putin may make a play on a little part of estonia called narva if he were to do that estonia aposs a nato member would that invoke article v stoltenberg first of all we don apost see any imminent threat against any nato ally and that includes also estonia and second the main reason why we have nato is to prevent the conflict is to prevent war because as long as all nato allies make it clear that an attack on one ally would trigger a response from the whole alliance then no adversary would try to be aggressive against nato because they know that we are by far the strongest alliance in the world half of the world aposs economic might and half of the world aposs economic military might is within nato so as long as we stand together we prevent conflict roberts mr secretary general thanks for being with us we aposll see you next december in brussels stoltenberg yes roberts all right had a good meeting by the way with the defense minister next month up next longtime trump advisor roger stone maintains his innocence as he faces arraignment next week and the mueller investigation we aposll ask our sunday panel about his arrest the charges and what it tells us about the state of the probe commercial break begin video clip roger stone former adviser to donald trump i intend to fight because this indictment is is is fabricated this indictment is thin as as can be my attorneys are highly confident that they can win an acquittal end video clip roberts longtime trump confidant roger stone talking to tucker carlson hours after his arrest by fbi agents on charges of lying obstruction and witness tampering in robert mueller aposs ongoing investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election and we are back now with the panel the president tweeting about the saying cbs reports that in the roger stone indictment data was released during the 2016 election to damage hillary clinton oh really what about the fake and unverified dossier totally phony conjob that was paid for by crooked hillary to damage me and the trump campaign roger stone didn apost even work for me anywhere near the election so this indictment connects somebody close to the president with wikileaks but doesn apost make the connection all the way to russia julie pace no it doesn apost and that aposs certainly what the president and his allies are leaning on here that the charges against stone relate to lying and that aposs actually what we aposve seen with most of the people who mueller has indicted through this process it hasn apost gotten to the core of of russian interference in the election or any kind of conspiracy that being said you know one thing we know about robert mueller is that we don apost know everything that he has right now roberts yes pace and there is there is definitely a whole avenue in terms of the relationship between people around trump and around stone and wikileaks that haven apost been touched yet so i think it aposs an open question on whether the charges that we aposve seen filed against stone thus far are the extent of those charges roberts jason is this williams just to pick up on that just very quickly roberts ok williams why are all these people lying why did they feel they need to perjure themselves what i mean it aposs like you think oh there aposs a lot of smoke here i don apost inaudible the fire roberts yes everybody keeps talking about this being process crimes with no underlying crimes riley they are i mean roger stone is a gadfly he aposs a clown figure we roberts but a process crime is still a serious crime riley but to the to the president aposs tweet the president aposs right digging up dirt on a political opponent is called opposition research it is not collusion i mean it may be sleazy politics but it is not criminal activity here roberts but if you aposre working with an organization that aposs working with russia pace but to john aposs point there i mean the the issue here isn apost that they were just trying to dig up opposition research it aposs that they were trying to see what roger stone knew about wikileaks having information that they obtained via russia that aposs that aposs the hard press ph riley i think roger stone was trying to dig up dirt to impress the trump campaign and then he lied to congress about it pace but you ultimately you aposre trying to ultimately if you aposre trying to work with a foreign government to do that that aposs the problem turner i think it aposs roberts go ahead gillian turner despite that both sides i think are to blame here republicans and democrats both fell short on messaging the democrats had a real opportunity to go in for the kill here but they stuck you know nancy pelosi specifically stuck with this well you know you can tell a lot about a person by their friends and president trump doesn apost have good friends when it aposs incumbent upon them as you said john to make the connection of collusion between russia between wikileaks and between roger stone the republicans by contrast failed by saying you know the president they stuck to the tired line of no collusion which everybody has heard a million times and didn apost go any further roberts let me connect a couple of dots here all right so this is a quote process crime and roger stone says he aposs broke listen here begin video clip stone no matter how much pressure they put on me no matter what they say i will not bear false witness against donald trump i will not do what michael cohen has done and make up lies to ease the pressure on myself end video clip roberts that that that that that was actually the wrong sound let aposs play the right sound begin video clip stone this has been financially devastating the leaks from the general from the special counsel aposs office have devastated my private consulting business i am this close i mean in all honesty i struggled to pay my lawyers first and foremost pay my rent pay my taxes it is not a fun existence end video clip roberts he aposs in exactly the position that robert mueller wants him in i aposm broke i can apost pay my taxes i might have to sell my dog so oh well why don apost we cut a deal and you tell me everything you know about president trump riley roger stone is in this position because of the action of roger stone and i don apost think people are going to be shedding a lot of crocodile tears for his situation i will overall though john roberts but he aposs in the perfect position for mueller to squeeze him riley he is he is in a position for mueller to squeeze him that aposs true and what this also tells us is that mueller isn apost done yet he aposs still out there searching for scalps ph and this is something this is going to be a cloud over the administration for the foreseeable future and that is the the long term consequences of this these may be small fry figures but it aposs going to keep this story in the press going forward and off of the president aposs agenda to the extent that he has one roberts we aposve got limited time left let me just swing to another topic venezuela here aposs what the secretary of state said after a u n security council emergency meeting yesterday begin video clip mike pompeo secretary of state now it aposs time for every other nation to pick a side no more delays no more games either you stand with the forces of freedom or you aposre in a league with maduro and his mayhem end video clip roberts all right so we are between an irresistible force and an immovable object gillian maduro says you know what you all i aposm not going anywhere turner you aposre either with us or you aposre against us more sort of axis of evil talk i spoke to the national security council just as morning john and they told me they aposre putting a lot of stock this weekend in the fact that venezuela aposs defense attache here in washington yesterday publicly switch sides he aposs now thrown his support away from maduro they aposre saying that you know armed the possibility of armed conflict as mick mulvaney said earlier is alive and well this thing could go either way over the over the course of the next month ph roberts fifteen seconds juan make your point williams well i mean we don apost want to see american intervention but i am a little put off by russia telling us given their experience with ukraine what we can apost
