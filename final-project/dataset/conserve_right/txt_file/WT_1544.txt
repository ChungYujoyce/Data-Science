apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the daily white house press briefing is also a daily tour de force aired live from the white house featuring president trump and the nation s leading health experts cabinet members military brass and response strategists this unprecedented cast is plainspoken and candid their updates of much value to the public the news media does not agree with this however some members of the press still insist that networks should stop airing the briefings decorum has faded journalists repeat the same accusatory questions they interrupt or offer scathing commentary in the aftermath mr trump remains unfazed by this phenomenon which would have been unheard of in previous administrations at a time when uneasy americans seek straightforward information gallup reveals that the public is paying far more attention to the news during the pandemic only 34 have a favorable review of the press however the pollster also found that americans heartily approve of the coronavirus response from mr trump vice president mike pence and six national institutions but not the press top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century only the news media gets a more negative than positive review gallup said the media is mystified as america rallies behind president trump during the coronavirus crisis much of the media can t let go of their pre crisis agenda including their hatred of the president which persists unabated blatantly on display in press briefings even amid this national emergency noted a recent new york post editorial but not to worry there is no republican in existence who handles media malfeasance as well as trump it is obvious that the media objective is to turn the handling of the coronavirus pandemic into trump s katrina trump doing press conferences is a major frustration in their ability to do that that s why the media are trying to pressure him to stop doing them writes mollie hemingway a senior editor at the federalist for the average american it is difficult to navigate the news politics and policy in an environment where so very many in the media are actively framing every event and data point through the lens of how it can be used to hurt trump far too many in the news media are not focused on conveying information that is true or factual and certainly not whether it is good for america or for its citizens the simple calculus is to push the envelope as far as they think they can get away with in their goal to ensure trump does not win re election ms hemingway notes bypassing the media so who needs the news media president trump s campaign has launched an aggressive round the clock virtual campaign that includes online broadcasts and volunteer training digital advertising and much messaging organizers now say the new outreach has already yielded 276 000 new volunteers and reached 17 million people it is a way to fight through the fake news filter and get president trump s message directly to the people organizers advise it also harmonizes with the current crisis the trump campaign has made a seamless transition to virtual campaigning in accordance with coronavirus safety protocols says brad parscale trump 2020 campaign manager language of revolution it is not an easy path for the presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden has a big problem he can t get elected without the support of far left bernie sanders supporters but to do that he has to propose radical policies that will cost him the votes of almost everyone else writes pj media editor rick moran his answer so far has been to propose elements of the sanders agenda without falling off a cliff and out of sight of the mainstream he has embraced sen elizabeth warren s radical bankruptcy reform ideas and has now proposed expanding medicare coverage for those 60 and over as well as forgiving the college loan debt of millions says mr moran it s a far cry from medicare for all and the total elimination of student debt and sanders supporters aren t rising to take the bait biden doesn t speak the language of revolution nor does he have the fire of commitment that so many sanders
