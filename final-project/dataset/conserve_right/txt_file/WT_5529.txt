threatened upon learning that president donald trump had promised ukraine s leader she was going to go through some things trump was unwilling to stay silent during yovanovitch s testimony focusing even greater national attention on the house hearing by becoming a participant he tweeted fresh criticism of her saying that things turned bad everywhere she served before he fired her a comment that quickly was displayed on a video screen in the hearing room rather than distract from the career diplomat s testimony trump s interference could provide more evidence against him in the probe democrat adam schiff chairman of the house intelligence committee said trump s attacks were intimidation part of a pattern to obstruct justice others said they could be part of an article of impeachment top

director of having role in deep state the former ambassador was testifying on the second day of public impeachment hearings just the fourth time in american history that the house of representatives has launched such proceedings the investigation centers on whether trump s push for ukrainian officials to investigate his political rivals amounted to an abuse of power a charge he and republicans vigorously deny yovanovitch asked about the potential effect of a presidential threat on other officials or witnesses replied well it s very intimidating when she saw in print what the president had said about her she said a friend told her all the color drained from her face she was shocked appalled devastated at what was happening after a distinguished 30 year career in the u s foreign service unabashed trump said when asked about it later i have the right to speak i have freedom of speech but not all republicans thought it was wise rep liz cheney of wyoming said trump s live tweeting at the ambassador was wrong she said i don t think the president should have done that more hearings are coming with back to back sessions next week and lawmakers interviewing new witnesses behind closed doors yovanovitch a career diplomat who served for decades under both republican and democratic presidents and was first appointed by ronald reagan was pushed from her post in kyiv earlier this year amid intense criticism from trump allies during a long day of testimony she relayed her striking story of being kneecapped recalled from kyiv by trump in a swiftly developing series of events that sounded alarms about a white house shadow foreign policy she described a smear campaign against her by trump s personal lawyer rudy giuliani and others including the president s son donald trump jr before her firing the daughter of immigrants who fled the former soviet union and nazi germany her career included three tours as an ambassador to some of the world s tougher postings before arriving in ukraine in 2016 she was forced out last may in particular yovanovitch described giuliani trump s lawyer as leading what william taylor now the top diplomat in ukraine who testified earlier in the inquiry called an irregular channel outside the diplomatic mainstream of u s ukraine relations these events should concern everyone in this room yovanovitch testified in opening remarks she said her sudden removal had played into the hands of shady interests the world over with dangerous intentions toward the united states they have learned she said how little it takes to remove an american ambassador who does not give them what they want after trump s tweets pulled attention away from her schiff read the president s comments aloud said that as we sit here testifying the president is attacking you on twitter and asked if that was a tactic to intimidate i can t speak to what the president is trying to do but i think the effect is to be intimidated she said said schiff well i want to let you know ambassador that some of us here take witness intimidation very very seriously in a closed door session later friday the panel heard from david holmes a state department official in kyiv who overheard trump asking about investigations into his political rivals the day after trump s july 25 phone conversation with new ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy holmes was at lunch in kyiv with gordon sondland the ambassador to the european union when sondland called trump the conversation was loud enough to be overheard rep ted lieu d calif said two other people heard the call as well and there were four people at the lunch the associated press has already identified one of the other people who heard the call as suriya jayanti a foreign service officer based in kyiv in trump s phone call with zelenskiy the previous day he asked for a favor according to an account provided by the white house he wanted an investigation of democrats and 2020 rival joe biden later it was revealed that the administration was withholding military aid from ukraine at the time democrats are relying on the testimony of officials close to the ukraine matter to make their case as they consider whether the president s behavior was impeachable yovanovitch provides a key element schiff said as someone whom trump and giuliani wanted out of the way to make room for others more favorable to their interests in ukraine an energy rich country that has long struggled with corruption it became clear he said president trump wanted her gone the top republican on the panel rep devin nunes of california bemoaned the hearings as a daylong tv spectacle republicans complained that the ambassador like other witnesses can offer only hearsay testimony and only knows of trump s actions secondhand they note that yovanovitch had left her position before the july phone call nunes also pressed to hear from the still anonymous government whistleblower who first alerted officials about trump s phone call with ukraine that is in question these hearings should not be occurring at all he said just as the hearing was opening the white house released its rough transcript of a still earlier trump call with zelenskiy that was largely congratulatory nunes read that transcript aloud in it trump mentioned his experience with the miss universe pageant in ukraine and invited zelenskiy to the white house he closed with see you very soon under questioning from republicans yovanovitch acknowledged that joe biden s son hunter serving on the board of a gas company in ukraine could have created the appearance of a conflict of interest but she testified the former vice president acted in accordance with official u s policy she denied allegations against her including that she favored democrat hillary clinton over trump in the 2016 election and she rejected the notion that ukraine tried to interfere in the election as trump has claimed counter to mainstream u s intelligence findings that it was russia the white house has instructed officials not to comply with the probe and most have been issued subpoenas to appear an administration budget official will meet privately with the panel privately saturday part of the impeachment inquiry concerns the contention that military aid for ukraine which borders a hostile russia was being withheld through the white house budget office pending
