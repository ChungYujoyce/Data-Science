there is victory and then there is justice in america s long war versus those who commit terror the pursuit of these two noble aims isn t synonymous victory against a shape shifting enemy defined by ideology is elusive yet justice is measurable as the united states seeks to root out and punish the murderous leaders of al qaida and its offshoots including islamic state president donald trump announced sunday morning that u s special operations forces overnight had swooped into a syrian compound and chased islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi to his death when the raiding americans arrived by helicopter al baghdadi fled into a dead end tunnel with three of his children and detonated a suicide vest trump said add al baghdadi to the list of terror group masterminds and field level commanders who evaded the united states military and justice for only so long in may 2011 the u s tracked osama bin laden to pakistan where the black ops specialists of navy seal team six cornered and killed him many others have been eliminated yet the terrorist threat remains al baghdadi was formidable arguably the most wanted man on earth evil and shrewdly calculating he built islamic state from the remnant of al qaida in iraq into a terrorist army and super cell that both conquered territory and exported its violent beliefs islamic state adherents killed 131 people in paris in november 2015 in a series of attacks two people inspired by islamic state killed 14 people in san bernardino california in 2015 in syria and iraq islamic state s sudden rise caught the u s off guard and stunned the poorly trained iraqi army president barack obama had dismissed islamic state as the junior varsity before belatedly reversing course by 2014 al baghdadi controlled swaths of territory across syria and iraq and declared himself leader of a transnational islamist caliphate the group used brutality as a calling card torturing and executing individuals among the many victims american journalist james foley the u s and an international coalition eventually crushed islamic state on the battlefield eliminating the would be caliphate though not its full membership or identity much of the credit in syria for islamic state s defeat goes to the syrian kurdish led militia who acted as boots on the ground for the u s those syrian kurds are now under attack by turkey and it s notable and alarming that as the syrian kurds pulled from the border region with turkey there were reports of islamic state militants and family members escaping from kurdish held prisons in syria on sunday trump thanked the kurds as well as the russian and turkish governments for cooperation in the al baghdadi operation the significance is that in the chaotic middle east as in afghanistan villainy lurks and may reappear in unwatched corners al qaida gave rise to islamic state what comes next we said recently that trump s pronouncement that the u s would abandon the syrian kurds was a grave mistake vigilance is required the scourge of terrorism is not going to disappear soon as for terrorist leaders different story their lifespans are quantifiable as short as possible al baghdadi operated in the shadows as a survival strategy it worked until it didn t in its relentless pursuit the u s has two justifications first going after an enemy leader is a force disrupter terrorism masterminds can t function as effectively when they re on the run and second the pursuit of justice whether apprehended or killed in action al baghdadi deserved punishment he was dangerous he was evil he earned his fate online https bit ly 2px1pew maine overall election spending is the real scandal kennebec journal nov 1 a political action committee controlled by speaker of the house sara gideon will have to pay a 500 penalty for a cash transfer during the 2016 election cycle that violated state laws gideon admitted to the conduct which she said resulted from bad advice she made no attempt to conceal her conduct and the fine she faces is just 10 percent of the maximum available to the state ethics commission reflecting that although she violated the letter of the law it was a minor infraction but it s big news because gideon is an announced candidate in the 2020 democratic primary to challenge sen susan collins for her seat in the u s senate republican operatives are jumping on the the ruling hoping to tag gideon with a scandal that would hurt her if she were to become the nominee there is a scandal here but it s not the one the republicans are promoting as in so many campaign finances cases the conduct that was determined to be out of bounds is mild compared to the flood of corporate and private wealth into elections that has transformed our politics big money gives big donors outsize influence and drowns out the interests of regular people but it s all perfectly legal with election day more than a year away collins and gideon are close to beating the record fundraising total set by collins and challenger u s rep tom allen in the 2008 cycle the most expensive race in maine history and that s just counting direct contributions to candidates it doesn t take into account the perfectly legal unlimited spending by outside groups or their funding by the perfectly legal super pacs that receive unlimited donations from corporations unions or individual mega donors this kind of spending has eclipsed direct spending by campaigns and has flooded the airwaves with negative messages for which candidates don t have to take responsibility it s the direct result of a line of supreme court decisions the most famous being citizens united v the fec which asserted that corporate persons have 1st amendment free speech rights so their spending cannot be limited by law since that decision in 2010 every maine election has been the most expensive in history and the trend is sure to continue with partisan control of the u s senate in the balance expect to see unprecedented spending levels in maine fueled by corporations national groups and wealthy individuals who don t really care about the people of maine or our concerns reservoirs of cash are already being filled ready to flood that kind of free speech into whichever state has what looks like a close race drowning out the the voices of the people who live there in 2016 gideon used her personal credit card to make two 250 donations on behalf of her pac to two other pacs later reimbursing herself she now knows that she should have made the donations directly from her pac but who is going to be fined for the millions and millions of dollars that will flood the state next year why isn t that a scandal online https bit ly 2wanz0h massachusetts on election day make voices heard for the future of local

ly 2qgmwnk new hampshire inmate health bill warrants easy passage concord mirror oct 27 congress whose approval rating hasn t topped 30 in more than a decade has been offered a chance to prove it can accomplish something despite the chaos that is the trump presidency new hampshire rep annie kuster has teamed up with new jersey senator and presidential candidate cory booker to sponsor a bill that would right a historic wrong provide a measure of property tax relief combat the opioid epidemic improve health care for the 2 3 million people behind bars in the united states and slow the revolving door that sees most of them return once released the bill is called the humane correctional health care act it deserves the support of every member of congress whether democrat republican or independent the bill would end the federal medicaid inmate exclusion policy which since the founding of the low income health care program in 1965 bans inmates from participating and kicks out those already covered by the program if they wind up behind bars the exclusion is unfair and disproportionately hurts the poor nearly two thirds of all jail inmates at any given time are awaiting trial and presumed innocent but because they are behind bars they automatically lose access to health care covered by medicaid arrestees who can make bail or are freed on personal recognizance do not lose coverage the exclusion punishes local taxpayers county jails and other correctional facilities by law must provide health care to inmates because of the exclusion the cost of that care is paid by local taxpayers not by state and federal government which split the bill 50 50 for medicaid recipients the exclusion is counterproductive nationally more than two thirds of jail and prison inmates have a substance abuse or addiction problem and 80 suffer from mental illness substance abuse or both patients already in treatment usually in states like new hampshire that expanded medicaid eligibility under the affordable care act lose access to it once incarcerated and grow sicker they also become more likely to re offend once released that means more robberies break ins and crime victims when introducing the act rep kuster said if you were to design a system to fail americans including taxpayers families communities and those with substance use and mental health issues this is the system you would design new hampshire has approximately 2 600 inmates in state prison and another 2 000 or so in its county jails health availability varies by county a lack of resources means that many inmates receive minimal treatment for mental illness or addiction problems that contributes to a three year recidivism rate of 47 or so percent prison intake staff see many familiar faces kuster s bill would expand on programs like the one introduced by merrimack county department of corrections superintendent ross cunningham a pioneer in intelligent approaches to incarceration and its alternatives the program including one underway in the county jail in boscawen allows inmates to continue drug and mental health treatment that includes treatment with drugs like methadone and suboxone used to wean people off opioids if kuster s bill passes the cost of that treatment would be borne by federal rather than local taxpayers and be widely available as we said earlier eliminating the inmate exclusion deserves bipartisan support we believe it will get it but just to be sure that the president signs it the bill s sponsors should rename it it should be called the trump to the rescue correctional health care act online https bit ly 2nqvusy rhode island the lure of the low digit providence journal oct 20 one of the oddities of rhode island up there with its affection for coffee milk and the propensity of locals to give directions using landmarks that no longer exist is the feverish passion of its residents for low number license plates journal staff writer tom mooney explored this interest in his entertaining tale about the long and winding road of rhode island license plate 7 unlucky number 7 news oct 18 carmine carcieri who ran a middletown car dealership paid 25 000 for the license plate number only to see the state department of transportation step in and cancel the transfer of the plate he pursued the case all the way to the state supreme court which denied him his precious object on the grounds he had failed to establish any property interest in the number six years later gov bruce sundlun returned the plate to the road by giving it to his wife marjorie remarkably mr carcieri got the plate back with marjorie sundlun s blessing after the press got hold of the story in 2017 he sought to transfer the plate to premier land development of providence a move approved by gov gina raimondo the president of that company david corsetti is a campaign contributor to ms raimondo and other democrats and the plate is now affixed to his ford platinum explorer indeed the passion for plates intersects with political power in rhode island as many things do requests for low license plate numbers one two or three digits go to the governor s office which either approves or rejects them if the governor approves a transfer an order goes to the division of motor vehicles to issue the plate to that person says dmv spokesman paul grimaldi we receive requests from members of the legislature and many other rhode islanders and we do our best to accommodate each request said raimondo spokesman josh block it s not hard to imagine this process becoming a way to reward political supporters rhode islanders passion for distinction through low plate numbers was striking enough to be the subject of a 2005 washington post story in rhode island and a few other states plates with four numbers or fewer have a mysterious allure making them so desirable that drivers bequeath them to relatives pay large sums of money for them and jump at every opportunity to get them the post reported low digit devotees say the plates are a status symbol owners are either important enough to get a plate from politicians or they come from an important family that got a low plate number years ago the story quoted john raiche of coventry a great number of people want to have them i guess it s like anything else when you want something and you can t have it you want it more last year the wall street journal reported a retired dentist in delaware bid nearly 420 000 for a 2003 mercedes station wagon 6 800 for the car 410 000 for the license plate reading

herald nov 1 thursday s vote was a defining moment for every member of the divided u s house of representatives the approved legislation formally authorizes and articulates guidelines for the next phase of the house s impeachment inquiry against president trump history was watching especially taking note of the votes cast by republican members of congress the 232 196 vote which hewed closely to party lines was likely to fuel the partisan fighting that has accompanied every stage of the impeachment inquiry and much of the trump presidency nearly all democrats backed the resolution and house republicans who spent weeks clamoring for such a vote unanimously opposed it two democrats reps collin peterson of minnesota and jeff van drew of new jersey who represent republican leaning districts opposed the resolution rep joe cunningham of south carolina one of the few trump district democrats who has been reluctant about backing an impeachment inquiry voted yes but this vote signaled that democrats are on course to bring charges against the president later this year at issue is whether trump abused the power of his office to pressure a foreign leader to investigate his domestic political rivals house speaker nancy pelosi of california described the impeachment inquiry as a solemn and prayerful process not cause for any glee or comfort at the same time in a floor speech pelosi asserted i don t know why republicans are afraid of the truth every member should support the american people hearing the facts for themselves that is what this vote is about it s about the truth and what is at stake in all of this is nothing less than our democracy she is not wrong republicans seem intent on casting a vote for party over a vote for their country yesterday marked the first time that many members were placed on the record putting them on the right or wrong side of history regardless of where you come down on the issue some would argue that to cast a vote to stop the impeachment inquiry and ignore the testimony and evidence amassed already would be to condone the abuse of power by president trump house minority leader kevin mccarthy of california called the impeachment inquiry an attempt to undo the last election and an attempt to influence the next one as well at the same time as the impeachment inquiry house investigators heard testimony from timothy morrison the top russia and europe adviser on the national security council who was expected to corroborate testimony from a senior u s diplomat who gave the most detailed account of the alleged quid pro quo the house s resolution allows the president and his counsel to request and query witnesses and participate in impeachment proceedings once they reach the judiciary committee which is tasked with writing any articles of impeachment that will be voted on by the house it also authorizes the house intelligence committee to release transcripts of its closed door depositions to the public and it directs the committee to write and then release a report on that investigation in the same fashion the resolution gives the republican minority on both the intelligence and judiciary committees a chance to subpoena documents and testimony provided that either the democratic chairman or a majority of the committee agrees and it establishes special procedures under which the chairman and top republican on the panel can take up to 90 minutes to make their cases or defer to a staff lawyer to do so before the roll call partisan tensions were visible on the floor of the house as democrats called attention to mounting evidence against trump while republicans decried the process as secretive and unfair yesterday s vote gives us heart that democracy is still at work it prepares the way for every member of this congress to ultimately go on record as to whether it is acceptable for an american president to seek help from a foreign government to win an election the choice is transparent now house members face a choice to take a stand upholding the integrity of our elections against abuses of presidential power or enter history as apologists for this president s unconscionable behavior this moment calls for more than politics said house rules committee chairman jim mcgovern of massachusetts if we don t hold this president accountable we will be ceding our ability to hold any president accoun
