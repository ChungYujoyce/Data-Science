liberal immigration policies while exhorting the world to act against iran s bloodlust his speech and subsequent meetings had to compete with news from washington that the house is moving forward with an impeachment inquiry in his address trump took aim at china venezuela and what he called a growing cottage industry of radical activists intent on pushing for open borders that harm national security and sovereignty in a later meeting with british prime minister boris johnson he fended off fresh questions from reporters about his attempts to press ukraine s president to investigate the family of political rival joe biden as he spoke to the general assembly trump lambasted the world trade organization for giving china preferential treatment that he said was undeserved he slammed socialism for bringing ruin to venezuela but he reserved much of his ire for iran which he called one of the greatest threats to the planet top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly

freeze nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine a few days before a phone call in which he pressured the eastern european nation s leader to investigate biden s family trump facing reporters questions about ukraine during his meeting with johnson said there was nothing inappropriate in his contacts with ukraine s president which he said were aimed at fighting corruption he later tweeted that the government on wednesday would release a transcript of his talk with the ukrainian president showing it was a totally appropriate call it was a remarkable split screen dynamic trump using the global spotlight to push his america first go it alone foreign policy approach even as democrats debated his political future later in the day when trump was secluded at trump tower speaker nancy pelosi

blamed iran for an attack on saudi oil facilities earlier this month and said the time had come to negotiate a new deal with tehran to replace the landmark 2015 nuclear accord from which trump withdrew last year u s officials said they hope the new european stance would galvanize opposition to iran and boost the maximum pressure campaign that the administration has pursued by increasing sanctions on the islamic republic there had been speculation fueled by trump himself that he might meet in new york with iranian president hassan rouhani but officials said that prospect was increasingly unlikely particularly after the joint statement from britain france and germany the president met separately with france s emmauel macron and germany s angela merkel both of whom have been urging trump to meet with rouhani while the two are in the same city if he rouhani leaves the country without meeting with president trump this is a lost opportunity macron told reporters as he and rouhani met with johnson rouhani for his part said he d consider meeting at any level to explore what the trump administration seeks in a nuclear deal but not until sanctions against his country are lifted he downplayed any imminent diplomatic breakthrough but added no one knows what america will do tomorrow trump however did raise the possibility of a breakthrough in comments while meeting with iraq s prime minister they would like to negotiate he said we haven t really worked that out they re here we re here but we have not agreed to that yet he said both french president emmanuel

assembly globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders causing them to ignore their own national interests those days are over trump s speech was greeted with tepid applause from the world leaders a sharp contrast to his fiery rally speeches trump on tuesday adopted a more somber demeanor he grasped the podium throughout his address his voice at times so soft it would have been hard to hear without microphones for an extended stretch commerce secretary wilbur ross sat in the audience with his eyes closed appearing asleep though denouncing iran s aggression trump did not explicitly blame tehran for recent strikes against oil facilities in saudi arabia iran has denied orchestrating the attack which secretary of state mike pompeo has deemed an act of war britain france and germany
