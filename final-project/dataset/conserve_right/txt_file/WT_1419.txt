hunter in ukraine need scrutiny i just think the media is so in the tank over this issue he said on cbs s face the nation it makes me sick to my stomach the former vice president monday repeated that his son did nothing wrong and labeled mr giuliani president trump s lawyer a thug besides social media mr giuliani has appeared on one america news ona alongside a cast of witnesses who he says bolsters his ukraine investigation over the weekend he made two appearances on fox news laura ingraham host of fox s the ingraham angle has touted one of mr giuliani s witnesses andrii telizhenko to talk about a jan 19 2016 meeting at the obama white house among national security council staffers and ukrainian embassy staff and prosecutors mr telizhenko then a member of the ukrainian embassy staff is listed in the official visitors log he says the bidens names were brought up by nsc staff in discussing burisma holdings a ukrainian natural gas firm owned by mykola zlochevsky a month before the white house ukraine meeting the elder biden as the obama administration s point man on ukraine had traveled to the country and demanded the regime fire top prosecutor viktor shokin mr biden later bragged that he told ukrainian officials either fire mr shokin or lose 1 billion in u s aid here lies the rub mr biden said he made the demand as part of an overall anti corruption campaign in a country bedeviled by bribes kickbacks and money laundering mr giuliani says mr biden laid down the edict to protect his son and he cites mr shokin as his witness shortly after the obama white house named mr biden as overseer of ukraine policy hunter biden landed a lucrative spot on burisma s board in april 2014 in the ensuring years burisma transferred more than 3 million into hunter biden s investment firm according to court records reviewed by author peter schweizer mr giuliani brands the hunter biden financial arrangement as corrupt he claims a document he displayed on fox shows burisma was laundering money from kyiv to latvia to cyprus mr telizhenko now a political consultant told ms ingraham that the jan 19 2016 white house meeting involved people from biden s team he said he was told by embassy staff to cooperate with the democratic national committee to find dirt on the trump campaign which he says he refused one of mr telizhenko s first media appearances as a pro trump whistleblower occurred in january 2017 in a politico article that exposed ukraine s pro hillary clinton bent the headline ukrainian efforts to sabotage trump backfire conservatives point to the article as proof of ukrainian interference they say that once the former vice president announced he was running for president last year liberal media interest in the story waned questions need to be asked the politico story said ukrainian government officials tried to help hillary clinton and undermine trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office they also disseminated documents implicating a top trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter only to back away after the election and they helped clinton s allies research damaging information on trump and his advisers a politico investigation found republicans contend that one product of a ukraine anti trump campaign was the so called black ledger in an august 2016 new york times story the ledger actually one page from a purported ledger was handled at some point by a member of ukraine s parliament it supposedly shows secret cash transactions from the pro russia party of regions to paul manafort a political consultant who became trump campaign manager the news story forced manafort s ouster manafort claims the ledger is fake and there is evidence to back him up the fbi showed what was supposed to be manafort s signature to his associates they said the signature was forged special counsel robert mueller never verified the document as for mr shokin he filed an affidavit on behalf of dmytro firtash a ukrainian businessman living in austria and facing extradition on federal criminal charges in chicago mr shokin provided his version of his firing by then president petro poroshenko poroshenko asked me to resign due to pressure from the u s presidential administration in particular from joe biden who was the u s vice president mr shokin s said in his affidavit which was posted online by investigative reporter john solomon the truth is that i was forced out because i was leading a wide ranging corruption probe into burisma holdings a natural gas firm active in ukraine and joe biden s son hunter biden was a member of the board of directors the probe into burisma ended in 2016 according to house testimony in the trump impeachment inquiry on face the nation mr graham the senate judiciary committee chairman made several new disclosures once committed to investigating the bidens he now says the matter is better suited to the senate select committee on intelligence and chairman richard burr north carolina republican mr graham said he didn t want to end up like mr steele spreading russia disinformation he said he also spoke sunday with attorney general william barr who agreed that the justice department would review mr giuliani s evidence they told me take very cautiously anything coming out of the ukraine against anybody mr graham said rudy says he s got the goods all i can tell rudy and anybody else if you got some information connected to the ukraine against anybody go to the intel committee not me if rudy giuliani has any information coming out of the ukraine he needs to turn over the department of justice because it could be russian propaganda he said a genuine issue is how did hunter biden win a spot on the burisma board just as his father was appointed ukraine envoy i think questions about the conflict of interest regarding hunter biden in the ukraine need to be asked mr graham said the state department had warnings and they ignored the conflict of interest and we re to make sure that hunter biden s conflict of interest is explored because it s legitimate how could joe biden really fight corruption when his son is sitting on the burisma board mr graham also said there is no question ukraine interfered in the election there are people in the ukraine that were pulling against trump because they hated manafort he said to suggest there was no political interference coming out of the ukraine directed toward the president i think would not withstand scrutiny the former vice president has steadfastly defended his son saying he did nothing wrong and the two didn t discuss burisma business i don t think our sons are fair game at all mr biden told cbs news on monday no one has said he s done anything wrong
