house director of legislative affairs breaks down the president s priorities in 2018 on fox news sunday this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday december 24 2017 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace anchor i aposm chris wallace congress avoids a government shutdown pushing key fights into 2018 and president trump signed historic tax cuts into law begin videotape president donald trump this is the bill right here and we aposre very proud of it it aposs going to be a tremendous thing for the american people wallace but showdowns loom on immigration health care and national security sen john thune r s d you don apost get very long around here to enjoy something when you get an accomplishment like this we aposve got to shift our focus now to the other challenges that we have in front of us wallace we aposll discuss the agenda for 2018 with marc short the white house director of legislative affairs then the u n defies the president aposs decision recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel u s ambassador to the united nations nikki haley we aposll put our embassy in jerusalem no vote in the united nations will make any difference on that wallace we aposll talk about the potential fallout with ben cardin the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee plus senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky this has been a year of substantial substantial accomplishment wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel how the president did in his first year in office and what to look for in 2018 all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace hello again and merry christmas eve from fox news in washington president trump is spending the holidays with the winter white house resting up after a frenetic first year in office and preparing for what promises to be an even tougher 2018 republicans will return to washington with just a 51 49 majority in the senate after that big upset in alabama and democrats are expecting big gains in next year aposs midterm elections we begin our look today at what aposs next with marc short the white house director of legislative affairs and marc welcome back in this christmas eve to fox news sunday marc short white house legislative affairs director chris thanks for having me merry christmas wallace before we get to all that we aposve got some breaking news we have to deal with first of all president trump is on a tear this weekend sending out repeated tweets attacking the deputy director of the fbi there was one tweet this morning fbi aposs andrew mccabe in addition to his wife getting all of this money from m clinton puppet for scoring at home that aposs virginia governor terry mcauliffe who gave campaign contributions to mrs mccabe who is running for office he mccabe was using allegedly his fbi email account to promote her campaign you obviously cannot do this these are the people who were investigating hillary clinton question is that helpful for the president to repeatedly attack top officials of the fbi short chris i think the president believes that the american people have a right to know what happened with that investigation as you mentioned in that tweet i think people need to remember this terry mcauliffe the governor of virginia is perhaps the clinton aposs closest political friend he gives 700 000 contribution to mccabe aposs wife when she was running for office at the same time they were launching investigation in hillary clinton the american people have the right to know that mccabe is announcing it looks to move forward and move on and we wish him well wallace he says he will retire when he gets a full pension in march short yes but i think it aposs also important to segregate that and separate it from the special counsel because the white house is cooperating every single way with that investigation and after millions and millions of dollars no collusion has been proven so the president is saying we need to have we need to know that our civil servants are doing the honorable thing and it aposs important the american people know what happened in that investigation wallace i want to be clear though because he has attacked in various tweets not just mccabe but also james baker the general counsel of the fbi peter strzok the lead investigator lisa page is he saying that there are some bad apples at the fbi or is he saying that there aposs a fundamental structural problem with political bias short i think he aposs very pleased to have christopher wray now running the fbi he is very pleased with the changes that are taking place but at the same time we put all of our faith and confidence in the department of justice and the fbi knowing that there should be no bias there he aposs making a point that we need to make sure there aposs no bias i think there are serious concerns about whether or not there was or not during the hillary clinton wallace so is he telling the fbi director chris wray is his appointee is he telling them to clean house there short i think that he has full confidence in christopher wray chris wallace ok that aposs just one breaking news story there aposs also a story on today aposs front page of the new york times that reports that in an oval office meeting last summer about immigrants flooding into the u s president trump said about people from haiti quote they all have aids and immigrants from nigeria would never go back to their huts what aposs your response to that and also to a federal judge in seattle this weekend partially lifting again the president aposs travel ban short so a couple of issues there i was not in that meeting but the people in the meeting say that those comments never happened and so i have no belief that that actually transpired but let aposs talk about the temporary protected status for a second because it aposs an important case the people from haiti with the earthquake that happened roughly two years ago under temporary protected status we have tens of thousands of people from honduras and from nicaragua from a hurricane that happened in 1999 tens of thousands of people under temporary protected status the president has again and again made the case that our immigration laws congress needs to change these laws as opposed to continue six month extension of people that are here from 10 or 20 years ago chris wallace all right let aposs get to your day job even though you had a big success this last week there aposs no rest for the weary what aposs your legislative agenda for 2018 and what comes first short well in 2017 chris let aposs look all first that the president accomplish the first president to get a supreme court justice confirmed in the first 100 days the first president to get 12 circuit court judges confirmed in his first year the first one to deliver on significant tax form since 1986 the first one to rollback regulations with 15 times signing legislation in the congressional review act only once before in our history that a president used congressional review act to roll back so it aposs been an exciting 2017 but we have a lot to do in 2018 i think you aposll see the president roll out infrastructure plan in january and the president has already invited leader mcconnell and speaker ryan to camp david in the first weekend of january to make sure we are all on the same page for what our priorities are for 2018 wallace let aposs talk about infrastructure because he signed the tax bill friday the president indicated he might begin with infrastructure here he is begin video clip trump i really do believe we are going to have a lot of bipartisan work done and maybe we start with infrastructure because i really believe if the structure can be bipartisan end video clip wallace but while both parties want a trillion dollar program over the next decade there aposs a big difference the white house talks about 200 million in federal money with the rest coming from state and local governments and private investment democrats want the whole 100 trillion ph in federal funds but you say that you aposve already given that money away to corporations for your tax bill so given those huge differences where is the basis for compromise short there is no doubt chris there aposs a pathway for them ph both democrats and republicans say that infrastructure is crumbling and we need to fix it but the big question remains will democrats but politics aside and actually work with us they need to meet us halfway so far when you talk about confirmations and our appointees to serve in the administration in all since george h w bush there were 32 filibusters on nominees we had 64 in our first year twice as many of 20 years combined we aposve got twice as many in one year democrats have looked to obstruct this administration every chance they can get the question for them is will they actually partner with us to try to do things for the american people wallace all right on infrastructure they want all federal money you want only 200 billion with the rest coming from state local and private they say the private would be a corporate giveaway so where aposs the deal short i think that i aposm not going to get in front of the president his plan inaudible in january chris but i aposm very confident we aposve had conversations with democrats i think there aposs a willingness on the policy to get there the question remains will politics prevent it wallace ok let aposs talk about another area with politics because i think it aposs fair to say there aposs a deal to be made on immigration the democrats want the dreamers the young people who came into this country as children as illegal immigrants to get some permanent legal status in return what are you asking for in terms of border enforcement and does there have to be at least some funding for the president aposs border wall short chris the president put forward to congress when he said that the deferred action for childhood arrivals was not constitutional he put forward to congress the principles he wanted which included border security it included interior enforcement and included a couple additions to ending chain migration those were things we asked for we put that forward to congress months ago we are waiting for congress to provide to us a proposal and get it done but you aposre right the president very much wants a deal here he wants to solve this problem wallace one other thing you did not just mention just now is the border wall short well i did in border security we very much consider a physical barrier part of the border security wallace is that nonnegotiable a border funding for the border wall short it aposs absolutely something the president has promised and it aposs not that it aposs nonnegotiable it aposs what america needs it aposs in our national security interest to prevent drug cartels to prevent ms 13 to secure our border wallace you got a lot of busy stuff in 2017 there aposs health care reform here aposs what the president said about the repeal of the individual mandate that was part of the tax bill this week begin video clip trump obamacare has been repealed in this bill we didn apost want to bring it up i told people specifically required with the fake news media because i don apost want them talking too much about it end video clip wallace but in fact much of obamacare remains subsidies to help buy coverage medicaid expansion and gives coverage to more than 10 million americans protection for pre existing conditions the fact is this a week we learned that almost 9 million people enrolled in the federal obamacare exchange so isn apost the president just flat wrong when he says that obamacare has been repealed short no i think the president is right in saying the heart has been repealed and that was individual mandate that aposs what most americans found most offensive for the government to dictate to you to say we are going to require you to buy something whether you wanted or not there aposs a certain element of freedom that we still believe and cherish in this country and that was the root of obamacare wallace but we aposre still going to have millions more than 10 million people who are going to get their health care coverage through obamacare through the expanded medicaid still going to get paid by the subsidies still going to get the protections of pre existing conditions obamacare is still here sir short obamacare continues to collapse the estimates where there would be 20 million more today than there so yes there are 9 million have signed up but it aposs way short of the estimate it continues to fall apart it continues to collapse what the administration is looking to do is to shore up the markets through administrative actions that we can take such as you saw the president signed executive order allowing associated health plans that more people can pool their resources together to help lower premiums we will continue to see us take administrative action on obamacare wallace finally i want to ask about a couple of foreign affairs issues president trump issued a threat this week to countries of the u n not to oppose his decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel here he is begin video clip trump they take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us well we are watching those votes let them vote against us we aposll save a lot we don apost care end video clip wallace in the end 128 countries ignore the president aposs threat and voted against his new policy but the fact is the only country besides israel that gets as much as a billion dollars in foreign aid that he aposs talking about perhaps doing away with our two allies egypt and jordan so was he really mean what he says about cutting aid either to countries like egypt and jordan or to the u n itself short there are a couple very important things that happened in the united nations this week and you are covering one of them and that is recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel keep in mind in 1995 congress voted overwhelmingly that aposs what the american position would be and vote again 90 0 with 10 abstentions last year it is a policy that is represented by many americans the president followed through on a campaign promise also last week there was about 15 0 will put additional sanctions on north korea that is something that aposs been underreported the president aposs leadership with ambassador haley in bringing the united nations together and isolating north korea that is far more important to what our national security objectives are wallace but respectfully to answer my question will the president go ahead and ask congress to cut funding either to countries that voted against the new u s policy in jerusalem or to cut funding to the u n itself short i aposm not going to get ahead of the president but i think the countries that continue to thwart the will of us ph and refuse to partner with us they should be cognizant of the president aposs delivering on his promise that he aposs made before wallace finally special counsel robert mueller is continuing his investigation into possible collusion with the russians and to possible obstruction of justice white house lawyers have been saying for weeks that they expect the special counsel to exonerate the president by early in 2018 did the white house lawyers meet as had been reported they were scheduled to with a special counsel aposs office this week and on what basis do they believe that this investigation at least as it involves the president is going to be wrapped up early next year short well chris thankfully that is handled separately and i aposm not in the middle of those conversations but i think the reality is that we said before the american taxpayers spent millions and millions of dollars on investigation so far but has proven no evidence whatsoever of collusion with russia we are anxious to see this resolved moved and allow the country to move forward wallace do believe as they say that this investigation in terms of the special counsel exonerating the president is going to be cleared up early in 2018 short there aposs no way for me to know what the timing of that is chris we continue to cooperate fully and everything they aposve asked for we are anxious for it to be resolved then wallace i got to say marc i had a lot of things to ask you and we got them all in thank you thank you especially for coming in on christmas eve merry christmas to you and your family short merry christmas sir wallace up next what are the chances for bipartisan compromise in congress and the new year democratic senator ben cardin weighs in on that and what grade he gives donald trump aposs year one when fox news sunday comes right back commercial break wallace for all the focus on domestic policy president trump also had an ambitious foreign policy agenda this year joining me now the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee ben cardin happy holidays and welcome back to fox news sunday senator sen ben cardin d md thanks chris happy holidays to you wallace you just heard marc short the white house legislative director do you see any areas of compromise between republicans and democrats in the new congress or is it going to be all politics all the time cardin i think we aposll very early january 19th is the deadline for getting the budget done we are already three months into this fiscal year and we don apost have a budget the way the budget is handled i think will be an indicator of whether we can have bipartisan cooperation it aposs not just the budget for the year we have disaster relief for the people of texas and florida california and puerto rico we have the immigration issues that need to be dealt with now and i think the manner in which that is handled can set the stage for congress democrats and republicans working together or if they can apost if the president won apost work with us on that it aposs going to be a tough year wallace well let me ask you about a couple specifics a few specifics that i just raised with marc short there aposs infrastructure there aposs immigration there aposs welfare reform and those specific areas do you see the outlines of a compromise with the president cardin well there aposs been negotiations between democrats and republicans on immigration we aposre hoping that we can get the dreamer bill done we also have people as pointed out on temporary protected status we have to deal with that issue marc is right we should pass legislation in these areas the president has made it more difficult but we need to get together and we have democrats and republicans working together on infrastructure absolutely we want to get an infrastructure bill done it aposs more challenging because of the tax bill and the revenues that have been taken off the table but we can work together and get something done on that wallace in terms of immigration as i was talking about there aposs an obvious deal to be made there on the one hand you and some republicans want to give protection to the dreamers on the other hand republicans and especially this president want to offer border enforcement including funding for the wall would you be willing to compromise there cardin we need to get the dreamer issue done it should not be connected to anything else in regards to border security wallace wait a minute senator that aposs not i mean that aposs not a compromise because you have something you want in immigration they have something they want why not put them together cardin well of course the president but the deadline when he gave six months last year earlier this year so we have a deadline on the dreamers we should do better border security we are for border security but let aposs make it sensible border security let aposs deal with technologies on the border let aposs deal with the real problems there the wall is not going to make us safer wallace all right let aposs turn to your area of expertise which is foreign policy you heard my discussion just now with marc short about the trump administration issuing a threat to the u n and to its member nations about not voting against his decision to move the u s embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem here at the u n was our ambassador nikki haley begin video clip haley no vote in the united nations will make any difference on that but this vote will make a difference on how the americans look at the u n and on how we look at countries who disrespect us in the u n and this vote will be remembered end video clip wallace senator what do you make of the president issuing that threat and what happens in congress if the president tries to make good on the threat and to cut funding either to some of the countries that opposed us or to the u n itself cardin well first as it aposs been pointed out the united states recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel the congress did that in 1995 the country has a right to determine its own capital i don apost think it was a controversial move but the manner in which he handled it without using diplomacy without trying to advance the peace process using this to put other issues on the table so he could get the palestinians and israelis talking together that i think was the mistake so the reaction the united nations i think was expected i don apost know whether it aposs useful to make threats we do watch how the countries in the united nations vote on our resolutions we always do that but i think the manner in which the president handled this is not in our best national security interests wallace all right let aposs turn to another subject the u s pushed a resolution through the u n security council on friday imposing new sanctions against north korea including sharp new limits on petroleum shipments to north korea and the vote got the support of both china and russia it was 15 0 on the security council doesn apost that indicate that the trump administration diplomacy to try and build up international support against north korea is working cardin that was a good move that was a major accomplishment i give our team a lot of credit for getting that done they aposre pretty strong additional sanctions to be imposed against north korea because of their continued testing of ballistic missiles so that absolutely was a strong move forward and it was great to see china and russia join us in that it now needs to be followed up with diplomacy where we get china and the united states working with the same strategy with north korea to find a way that we can ease the tension and get north korea to change directions it aposs a good first step wallace another trouble spot ukraine the president has agreed to settle lethal weapons to ukraine including antitank missiles to fight the pro russian separatist forces there this is a move that president obama consistently for years refused to make will you support that or will you try to block the sale in congress cardin i talked to secretary tillerson earlier this week i support the administration aposs decision to provide these types of defensive weapons for the ukrainians it aposs a clear message to russia that we will not allow them to continue to compromise the sovereignty of ukraine russia will continue to push as far as they can it was important for the united states to tell russia that we will support ukraine aposs ability to defend itself so i support the decision wallace overall how do you think the administration has done this first year in foreign policy and are you troubled that we have a secretary of state rex tillerson who almost everybody in washington thinks is going to be gone within a year has he lost his credibility as he traveled the world representing this country cardin in many respects our foreign policy is inconsistent we aposll have a policy coming out of the state department or coming out from people that are representing the white house and then have the president come out with a tweet that totally undermines that we saw that in north korea when secretary tillerson was pursuing diplomacy and then the president undercut his ability with a tweet i think we found from the president he doesn apost always support his team and therefore we have an inconsistent message we have distant america we say america first it looks like america in isolation america has lost its leadership on many key issues that aposs certainly true in climate change where we were not as present as we should have been on talks china came in and took a lot of the leadership that should have been with the united states we see the united states being excluded from a lot of the discussions globally and that aposs not helpful to our national security wallace senator i want to put up some numbers for you that i think are fairly striking we now have growth of 3 percent unemployment just over 4 percent the dow jones average is up almost 25 percent since the trump inauguration isis has lost 97 percent of the land it once controlled in iraq and syria for all the controversies for all the questions about this administration when you look back on all of that hasn apost president trump had a pretty good year cardin i think it reflects the fact that america is the strongest nation in the world that what we can do as this country really is indispensable to the global community and that there were seeds planted by both democratic and republican administrations that have caused us to continue to grow but as we do that there aposs a lot of americans who have been left behind i think that aposs the key challenge we have a shrinking middle class we got to focus on a growing middle class and i think there was a missed opportunity on this tax bill where it helped basically large corporations and high income people if we could have focused on middle income we could have i think grown or helped grow the middle class which would have been good for our future things are good they could be better let aposs concentrate on middle income families wallace ok i got less than a minute left i want to ask you about one last area congress has been investigating this the whole russia issue for about a year the justice department has been investigating possible ties between the trump campaign and russia for a year and a half really two questions first of all do you feel any urgency to wrap this up to remove the cloud over our president if it can be removed and secondly what do you think of the tweets and it aposs continued this week on the attacks against the fbi cardin i think it aposs critically important that we respect the independence of the department of justice and the fbi no one is above the law let mr mueller to his investigation without interference from the president in regards to this investigation i hope it is completed early i think the american people need to understand exactly what russia was doing here in the united states and the involvement with the trump campaign it would be helpful for this country to have as much of that information made available as quickly as possible wallace senator cardin thank you thanks for your time and happy holidays to you and your family sir cardin thanks chris same to you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to look back at 2017 plus what would you like to ask the panel about the president aposs first year in office go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up president trump signs the gop aposs new tax bill into law the first big legislative one of his presidency begin video clip trump you aposll see something february 1st when you open up the paycheck that aposs when you aposre going to start to see it end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel what that means for you in 2018 next on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clips senate minority leader chuck schumer d n y help the rich hurt the middle class the whole year can be summed up in that one sentence trump but unfortunately the democrats don apost like to see tax cutting they like to see tax increases and they like to complain but they don apost get it done unfortunately but they complain a lot end video clips wallace president trump and senate democratic leader chuck schumer wrapping up 2017 with two very different takes on congress passing the republican tax bill and it aposs time now for our sunday group former national security council staffer and now a fox news correspondent gillian turner columnist for the hill juan williams bob woodward from the washington post and fox news politics editor chris stirewalt merry christmas eve to all of you and thank you for coming in unidentified male merry christmas gillian turner fox news merry christmas wallace gillian there were certainly times this year when it appeared that the trump presidency was headed off the tracks but when you look back at the numbers that i just the economic numbers i just showed senator cardin the success with isis now the passage of this signature tax cut bill has 2017 turned out to be a pretty good year for president trump turner it aposs definitely ending on a high note is the way that i would describe it specifically with the stock market booming on the foreign policy side of things isis has been really the sweet spot for the administration this year they aposve the united states military has decimated their strongholds in iraq and syria essentially denying them any claims to legitimate caliphate the challenge on this and many other issues is that the world at the risk of sounding trite the world is a complex place today and the nature of all the threats we face as a nation are changing they aposre evolving very quickly so if we take isis an example as an example we have had great success militarily the new front in the war on terror next year and beyond is really going to be in cyberspace so the question is how quickly can the administration adapt how can they take these policy successes and translate them in the future wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook from christopher fauver who writes is trump going to be another reagan thought to be a lightweight but gets conservative agenda put in action juan how do you answer christopher juan williams fox news well i think if you look at the past year picking up on what gillian was saying you aposd have to say that in terms of putting conservative judges on the court aposs in terms of things like the dismantling of regulations and regulatory state trump has had some success or i would say actually paul ryan and mitch mcconnell have had success while using trump almost as a distraction to me when you think about ronald reagan it was the ability to negotiate in times across the aisle i don apost think trump has that i aposm not sure i can point to one republican who would say he voted for the tax bill because of trump i think the deals were struck by for example in the senate mcconnell anwar drilling for lisa murkowski you know something of a promise on health care going to susan collins of maine something promised about immigration reform to jeff flake that aposs the so called swamp that trump once promised to drain actually mcconnell i think has poured some water and muck into that swamp wallace one of the president aposs complaints is that he doesn apost get a shake for a fair shake from the mainstream media mr williams a perfect example of that here was the president on friday as he signed the tax bill begin video clip trump legislative approval for which i aposm given no credit in the mainstream media if we have i believe it aposs 88 which is number one in the history of our country end video clip wallace chris is this presidency the hot mess it aposs often portrayed as being or does president trump have a point chris stirewalt fox news well i thank he very much has a point i think he has a point that much of the coverage about him has been withering and unfairly so but then again much of the coverage has also been fairly harsh because as we aposve already alluded to the opening stanzas of this presidency the first eight months ten months were very very off kilter and he had a hard run getting started so much of the coverage that was harsh was unfair and he also benefits by the way from a lot of very favorable coverage and talking points from his boosters out there so if i don apost think we can just say that he is he is a victim wallace bob your i want to continue on this theme you aposre writing a book about donald trump that aposs going to come out next year bob woodward the washington post an undetermined date wallace you aposre having problems making the deadline with your editor woodward no no there aposs so much in getting your arms around it is difficult it aposs hard wallace ah turner not trying to rush the process wallace what are you finding is is part of the story how much he has changed as president or how little he has changed as president woodward well i can apost really answer that what aposs interesting there aposs a discussion going on about whether there is within the trump presidency a crisis of legitimacy and i think as you look back on it there is not actually he was elected ben cardin democrat was saying gee i agree with this i agree with that much disagreement on the tax cut but we aposre going to see as we know in tax cuts it depends on outcomes the condition of the economy is good now supposedly we will see so that can apost be measured so at the same time there aposs been a lot of turmoil in the trump presidency one of the people i talked to called it a chaos furnace and there aposs a lot of truth in that and that aposs trump style and a lot of that is done intentionally with his tweets in the morning if you talk to anyone on the staff and there is no clearing house for his tweets he aposs going to do it all on his own wallace and and woodward and that aposs defined a lot wallace do you agree with i aposm surprised is a consensus it seems to be on this panel that the president has ended the year much stronger than he started woodward well the tax cut aposs important and look at foreign affairs there aposs been lots of anxiety rightfully so that maybe there aposs going to be a war with north korea i think that aposs been turned down isis is a plus may but you know we aposll have to see i mean you aposre exactly right it is a dangerous world but the fuse of instability is lit in so many countries and the crisis can come from a place we least expect it i aposm looking at this and there are dozens of places that can go off and wind up defining the presidency and so you know that aposs why i aposm waiting to finish the book wallace gillian how does this president compare both in substance and style points to the two presidents that you worked for on the national security council bush 43 and obama turner i think it aposs fair to say that president trump is different in every way imaginable both and they are very different from one another president obama and president bush president trump is temperamentally different i think his worldview is different from any president we aposve potentially seen before and i think what he is you know the end of the year always offers this opportunity to sort of talk about lessons learned and i think one of the one of the things the administration has done well is that they aposve learned to adapt some fairly outlandish policy ideas to suit the swamp and to suit the congress and they aposve become like there aposs no better example than the travel ban the president aposs believed travel ban if you look at the first version it was fairly outrageous everything from what it said on paper to how it was rolled out we go from there to the second and then the third version has sort of passed without much controversy and what they aposre doing their is trying to i think you know they aposre coming to terms with the fact that the president doesn apost have all the prerogative in the world and if he wants to get these fairly controversial things through he aposs going to have to learn to adapt williams can i can i just turner he aposs adapting to the swamp in essence rather than change ph williams can i just throw in there when you were saying that there aposs a consensus on the panel i think my part to contribute contribution to this consensus would be that the right wing agenda in america has been advanced by a republican congress mcconnell and ryan but if you look at the tax bill remember trump promised to cut tax increase taxes on the rich get rid of carried interest for the hedge fund people the exact opposite has come through because of the agenda mcconnell ryan in terms of cutting taxes on the upper income and in terms of beginning a tax on the social safety net that i anticipate to come on medicare social security and the like because they aposll say the revenue aposs not there stirewalt i think you can rest easy mr williams i i do not think that that that that is in the offing at any time soon williams you don apost think mcconnell ryan ph has promised that stirewalt outright no well i aposm sure they promised part of it wallace folks you have another panel and i don apost want you to steal time from yourselves on the other side of the break do we aposre going to take a break here when we come back we aposll look ahead to president trump aposs prospects for a year or two his policy agenda the political challenges and yes the continuing russia investigation commercial break begin video clip trump it aposs always a lot of fun when you win if you work hard and lose that aposs not acceptable end video clip wallace president trump celebrating with congressional republicans the passage of his first major legislative win that big tax cut and promising more victories in 2018 and we aposre back now with the panel well chris you heard the president aposs legislative director mark shot laying out a pretty ambitious agenda for 2018 how much of that will actually get done given the fact that they don apost apos have reconciliation they aposve got to pass it with nine democratic votes in the senate and that you aposve got the midterms coming up in november stirewalt well look even before they begin negotiating with democrats and it is of course the kind of pivot that we had anticipated from the president really from the beginning reach out to democrats infrastructure find ways to build this new populist almost centrist in some ways domestic policies agenda but they have a big rhubarb to settle among republicans before they figure out what they aposre going to do there because they made a lot of promises to ideologically desperate republicans in order to get the tax bill passed that bill is coming due really in january through march as they have to deal with daca illegal immigrants who are brought to the united states as minors they have to deal with questions of fixing obamacare or patching obamacare for the year different promises to different people and then on top of that you want to talk about changing entitlement reform rand paul closes the year in the senate saying we aposre coming back we aposre cutting spending we aposre coming back we aposre cutting welfare and tell me how you make that all fit wallace juan one thing that struck me about the president aposs event on the south lawn this week after he signed the tax cut bill was how much and this picks up on what gillian aposs said he aposs adapted to washington he was calling out not just the leaders because it seemed when he came he knew about four names of people in congress he was calling out committee chairman he was calling out subcommittee chairman has he gotten better and in fact is has he begun to master the art of the legislative deal williams well i think what you said is true and by the way what a show of sycophancy i mean it aposs unbelievable that that exhibit at the white house i couldn apost believe it i mean i thought it was kind of like some authoritarian leader from some other country in front of his you know self selected leaders oh dear leader we love you mr trump good god anyway i think that what you have seen is that he has more familiarity with congress and understands that he has to make deals through congress but wallace well of course he aposs got to make deals through congress williams right but wallace i mean ronald reagan had to make deals though congress bill clinton did williams yes wallace my point is and williams but i aposm not sure he recognized that when he started wallace i understand but would you agree that he now does understand that williams no because no even in the tax bill he it aposs not that he put forward with marc short aposs help some legislative agenda or structure that allowed them to act it was that they came up with their own prescriptions to their conservative agenda wallace you aposre not going to give him any credit williams no no i think he knows now some members of congress and understands he aposs got to work with congress but look for example marc short said to you we want to do something on infrastructure and what you hear from the democrats in the senate as we heard this morning is yes we want to do something on infrastructure but where aposs the revenue you just passed a tax bill that took away the money wallace no that aposs true that was a trillion dollars that they wanted to get williams right wallace that they were going to put into infrastructure now you aposve got to you aposve got to sell ph me another trillion dollar tax cut plan williams i understand ph wallace it aposs over ten years anyway casting a shadow over everything is the continuing investigation of russia senate democratic leader chuck schumer put the president on notice this week begin video clip schumer if the president were to fire special counsel mueller our country would face a constitutional crisis end video clip wallace bob as a veteran of covering watergate of covering iran contra of covering the monica lewinsky where are we headed in 2018 you hear white house lawyer saying that this is going to be wrapped up quickly that the president at least as far as the president aposs concern maybe not paul manafort that he aposs going to be exonerated early in 2018 and you hear some democrats saying they aposre just getting started woodward my analysis and information is that we reporters and the public only know a sliver of what aposs going on in that investigation and we also only know a sliver of what really happened mueller is the special counsel here has extraordinary power in law supreme court decisions in the nixon case saying you as the investigator have the power to get the evidence in the case of nixon it was the tapes so mueller presumably can get all evidence and testimony on this so we don apost know where it aposs going to go i think one of the big problems here is our business the media you see the declarations about oh we know this is going to lead to impeachment or the declarations that it aposs going to be over it aposs going to go away i suspect if we had mueller here on sodium pentothal the truth serum he wallace i would i would love that woodward let me tell you wallace well try i think when we ph come in with a hypodermic it aposs going to be a problem woodward sometimes you have to roll the dice donald trump knows that and i think he likely would say i don apost know this is a process he aposs very exhaustive he and that aposs exactly the way it should be but given that wallace but let me ask you but let me ask you because congress has been investigating this question for a year the justice department has been investigating this question of possible collusion for a year and a half since the summer of 2016 wouldn apost why don apost we have any sense at all if there is any of any collusion between the russians and the trump campaign woodward a fair question and you know maybe we won apost maybe the trail will become cold we don apost know but these things take time mueller started in may that aposs the really serious investigation but i think in the discussion about and what is somebody who aposs done this for god 47 years there is in the media this polarization of and people attacking trump and the kind of self satisfaction and smugness and ridicule which i think does not work at all and on the other side oh trump is totally right this is innocent this is some sort of jihad against him and i think we need to turn that down and listen to facts there are facts out there and be a little inaudible in wallace i couldn apost agree more but good luck to you in trying to get that done gillian i want to get you into this on the foreign policy front north korea russia china middle east what are you looking for in 2018 turner so i think just quickly on north korea the big variable is whether or not we end up at war with the north korean regime i i aposm not refuting bob i wouldn apost dare do that but i don apost think the question of whether or not we aposre going to war with the north is it all settled at this time i hope you aposre right and i aposm wrong on russia the investigation aside i think the u s russia bilateral relationship has taken a nosedive that is evidenced by the fact that the announcement this week that we aposre now providing them with this major defensive capability in the form of lethal weapons president wallace the ukraine turner excuse me to ukraine wallace right turner president trump is learning what all his predecessors have learned which is that vladimir putin cannot be trusted and cannot be worked with even on the issues where they share common national security interests and i think that has been a particularly difficult lesson for him because he started with high hopes of turning turning the tide in favor of working with putin so i think that aposs going to be that aposs going to die a very quick death and wallace and in about 40 seconds the middle east turner and the middle east the middle east at large i think some major humanitarian concerns for the administration in 2018 we aposve got yemen on the brink of one of the worst famines the world has ever seen potentially thanks to the saudi blockade the trump administration is trying to really exert a special relationship to try and get them to back down that will be a huge test for the region generally i think wallace and isis turner and isis apos online caliphate is flourishing so the big test for the trump administration is can we fight them online as well as we have fought them on the battlefield wallace well it aposs going to be a fascinating year and we will all be here to cover it fairly and in a smog free zone stirewalt hear hear woodward well said wallace thank you panel see you next sunday have a merry christmas up next our power player of the week honoring america aposs veterans this holiday season plus another visit from the wallace grandkids commercial break wallace it aposs a christmas tradition here to share the story about one family has found a way to express the meaning of the holiday season it aposs a moving example of love for our country and personal generosity once again here is our power player of the week begin videotape morrill worcester founder wreaths across america we wouldn apost have the opportunities if it wasn apost for the people that fought for us and gave their lives for us wallace voice over it aposs that plainspoken wisdom that has driven morrill worcester for years on a mission that has touched america aposs heart each december worcester places wreathes at arlington national cemetery and thousands of volunteers are there to help him worcester i think a lot of people think like i do and they just want to you know they appreciate the veterans and they want to show it wallace this story begins back in 1962 when worcester then a 12 year old paperboy from maine won a trip to washington what impressed him most was arlington it aposs beauty and dignity and those rows and rows of graves worcester every one represents a life and a family and a story they aposre not just tombstones i mean those are all people wallace thirty years later in 1992 worcester was running his own wreath company in harrington maine but as christmas approached he had a bunch left over worcester these wreaths are real fresh right just made and i just didn apost want to throw them away wallace he thought of arlington and all those graves when the cemetery approved he and a dozen volunteers drove the wreaths down and laid them on the headstones and so it continued for years until a few christmases back when an air force sergeant took this picture which ended up on the internet worcester it kind of struck a nerve and people emailed it to each other and it really went around the world wallace we were there the next year as he and his workers at the worcester wreath company loaded up 5 265 wreaths then they embarked on what worcester calls the world aposs longest veterans parade a 750 mile journey that at some points attracted more than 100 vehicles and when they got to arlington so many people wanted to participate unidentified male the ceremony you are about to witness is an army wreath laying ceremony to be conducted for the worcester wreath company wallace for years worcester paid for all of this out of his own pocket and he started wreaths across america sending hundreds to cemeteries and war memorials around the country but he will need help to reach his new goal worcester i think around 2 7 million graves and that aposs a tall order to decorate 2 7 million graves so wallace on camera but you aposd like to do it wouldn apost you worcester i really would yes sometime i don apost know how but hey you know wallace how long are you going to keep doing this worcester i aposm going to keep doing it for as long as i work and then i know my family is going to continue so it will be here for a long time end videotape wallace this is the 26th year morrill worcester has taken on his christmas wreath project this month volunteers placed more than one and a half million wreaths on veterans graves in over 1 400 locations in
