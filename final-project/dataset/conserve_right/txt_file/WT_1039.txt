managed to fare better than lead house democratic impeachment manager rep adam b schiff in the end after a two year siege on the presidency two inspector general reports and a 32 million special counsel investigation turns out rudy was spot on mrs raskin said seems to me if we re keeping score on who got it right on allegations of fisa abuse egregious misconduct at the highest level of the fbi of alleged collusion between the trump campaign and russia and supposed obstruction of justice in connection with the special counsel investigation the score is mayor giuliani four mr schiff zero

presentation turned heads in the senate where mr trump s defense team was putting on its first full day of arguments after a brief opening statement saturday but those who know mrs raskin were not surprised jane raskin is tops very strong said veteran washington defense lawyer john dowd who worked with mrs raskin on mr trump s legal team fighting special counsel robert mueller s russia probe she launched her legal career in boston on a justice department strike force against organized crime her years prosecuting white collar crime culminated in her serving as the first assistant u s attorney in massachusetts she and her husband martin raskin were sought after defense lawyers in florida before they joined the trump defense team in april 2018 about the same time as mr giuliani mrs raskin was part of the deep bench on mr trump s team that presented the case for acquittal monday some of the team s other lawyers taking the podium included former florida attorney general pam bondi former special counsel kenneth w starr and former senior justice department lawyer patrick philbin ms bondi made the case for the legitimacy of investigating former vice president joseph r biden and his son hunter biden who landed a high paying job at burisma holdings a ukrainian energy company while his father led obama administration policy in that graft riddled country house democrats impeached mr trump after accusing him of requesting the investigation to benefit his reelection bid because the former vice president is a top contender for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination during her tenure as florida attorney general from 2011 to 2019 ms bondi became a lightning rod for liberal fury in part because she led state lawsuits against the affordable care act ms bondi and the

distract you house impeachment managers have cited mr giuliani s role as a private go between for the president in ukraine seeking to start an investigation of the bidens however ms raskin noted that the former mayor s work in ukraine began in late 2018 six months before mr biden announced his candidacy he was doing what good defense attorneys do she said of mr giuliani he was gathering evidence regarding ukrainian election interference to defend his client against the false allegations of russian collusion being investigated by special counsel mueller but the house managers didn t even allude to that possibility instead they just repeated their mantra that giuliani s motive was purely political and that speaks volumes about the bias with which they have approached their mission mr giuliani was working with two former associates who are now indicted on campaign finance violations something mrs raskin didn t mention testimony from several impeachment witnesses indicated that he played a role in seeking the ouster of former u s ambassador to ukraine marie yovanovitch who he believed was impeding his investigation there u s intelligence agencies long ago concluded that russia not ukraine interfered in the 2016 u s presidential election mrs raskin said mr giuliani s actions have been vindicated compared with allegations mr schiff made against the president as chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence the bottom line is mr giuliani defended president trump vigorously relentlessly and publicly throughout the mueller investigation she told senators
