originally appeared in the hill newspaper and on the hill com for more clickhere i m not one to gossip but there is a flood of early talk in political circles about who will get the vice presidential nods fromdonald trumpandhillary clinton the strategy for picking a running mate this year is wildly different from anything seen before the textbook on picking a vp calls for a heavy focus on adding swing state support for the top of the ticket the book also advises finding a running mate seen by voters as plausibly able to take over as president well throw out the textbook no one believes that any running mate is going to tip this year s electoral map and no strong silent type fits the bill at a moment when voters want to shake up the system when sen elizabeth warren d mass paid a visit to clinton just days after she claimed the nomination speculation kicked into overdrive and phone lines got hot when former speaker newt gingrich r ga and sen jeff sessions r ala were overheard in a tv green room telling each other that the other one is the best choice to run with trump the dynamics that frame the selection of a vp this year were evident in a washington post abc poll released last week it found that nearly 70 percent of americans have an unfavorable of view of trump a 10 point increase since he entered the race last summer according to the same poll clinton also reached a new personal high in her unfavorable rating at 55 percent clinton s trouble is dwarfed by trump s trouble he is viewed negatively by 94 percent of blacks 89 percent of latinos and 77 percent of women picking a dazzling candidate as his running mate is one move that has the potential to change the way the world sees him the last attempt to dazzle and distract with a vice presidential pick was in 2008 gop nominee sen john mccain r ariz got off to a good start with his surprise pick of little known alaska governor sarah palin she is beautiful high energy and that year she had the potential to attract women disappointed that the democrats had selected a black man over a woman as their nominee but the sparkle wore off quickly when palin began to look uninformed and inept questions were raised about mccain s judgment palin s family life also became a staple of the gossip columns palin s selection looked especially bad in contrast with democratbarack obama s pick of sen joe biden d del biden was experienced and known to be a good guy while his selection took the edge off the risk of putting a first term senator in the oval office this time trump and clinton need running mates combining the qualities of palin and biden the trump campaign went nuts last month when ben carson said that trump s shortlist included palin sens marco rubio fla andted cruz texas and two governors chris christie of new jersey and john kasich of ohio were purportedly also on the list palin s downside is obvious a desperate looking christie won t do either and trump can t afford to extend an offer to rubio cruz or kasich because he can t risk being turned down that problem is getting worse by the minute as trump lags farther and farther behind clinton in the polls any dazzling vice presidential pick has to think about his or her own political future what will happen to them if trump suffers a barry goldwater style blowout loss in november gingrich remains a serious contender to be trump s number two he is a well known personality and an ace with a tv soundbite who is also accustomed to dealing with controversy over his personal life but gingrich sharply criticized trump for his attacks on new mexico governor susana martinez and federal judge gonzalo curiel trump then did an impromptu poll on possible running mates he asked the audience at a rally in tampa to pick from gingrich sessions or former secretary of state condoleezza rice rice got the biggest applause from the crowd rice is a dazzler but the odds that she is willing to sign on are low to non existent meanwhile on the democratic side clinton needs a star to bring young energetic supporters of her primary rival vermont sen bernie sanders back into the fold that means clinton can t bring on a centrist pick moderate democrats with close ties to corporate america like sens joe manchinof west virginia ormark warnerof virginia or former sen evan bayh of indiana would anger the liberal base of the party she is left to choose among warren and other left of center democrats such as sens sherrod brown ohio andtim kaine va warren however has powerful detractors critics say she lacks foreign policy experience and note that she has never run a city state cabinet agency or business i think she will not pick somebody that she feels in her heart isn t ready to bepresidentor commander in chief former pennsylvania governor and dnc chairman ed rendell recently told a philadelphia radio station i think elizabeth warren is a wonderful bright passionate person but with no experience in foreign affairs and not in any way shape or form ready to be commander in chief clinton could find dazzle by naming the first latino vice presidential candidate but no one doubts she will win latino voters energized by trump apos s insults regardless if she still wants that option then housing and urban development secretary julian castro is the leading candidate labor secretary tom perez and california congressmanxavier becerrahave come on strong in the last few weeks when all the talk ends trump has few options his best bet to dazzle is gingrich clinton has a wider range led by kaine castro and
