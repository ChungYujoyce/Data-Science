refused to give her an explanation ai is the most prominent target so far in china s massive crackdown against dozens of lawyers writers and activists following online calls for protests here similar to those in the middle east and north africa no protests have emerged here ai has had past run ins with authorities in particular for his advocacy for victims of the devastating 2008 sichuan earthquake but his wife said the current situation is worse though he has run risks with his activism in the past it appears that he has crossed a line in china s latest crackdown against critics this is very serious so many people searching the house and it s been more than 48 hours since i ve heard from him i m very worried about his situation especially his health said lu who added that the 53 year old ai suffers from multiple illnesses for which he takes medication lu said the two had discussed the possibility of something happening to him but she never dreamed the reality would mean electricity being cut from their home and bank accounts being frozen we have spoken about this in the past but i never imagined it would be like this that they would come to our house search through our private things with 40 to 50 policemen coming in and out she said a state newspaper editorial wednesday was unusually critical of ai while not confirming whether he had been detained china rarely comments on detained dissidents before they are formally charged but the decision underscored ai s high profile and suggested china is building a criminal case against him for his social activism the editorial in the global times newspaper published by the ruling communist party s flagship people s daily said ai engaged in legally ambiguous activities and that chinese law won t bend to mavericks it didn t specify what laws ai was suspected of breaking amid growing concern over ai s fate u s ambassador jon huntsman mentioned the artist among other activists who challenge the chinese government to serve the public in all cases and at all times the united states will never stop supporting human rights because we believe in the fundamental struggle for human dignity and justice wherever it may occur mr huntsman who leaves his post later this month said in a speech in the commercial hub of shanghai in germany foreign minister guido westerwelle said ai must be released he must be able to continue pursuing his artistic work the incident shows how important it is that we must not let up in our efforts for more openness and for free rights in china said westerwelle who visited china last

someone tell me whether he has been detained arrested and why where is the evidence of his crime i don t understand why no one has contacted us and why no one has explained anything to us ai s late father al qing was one of china s most famous modern poets and that stature led many to believe he was more protected from serious attack or formal arrest he had been courted by the government as a cultural ambassador before his advocacy on behalf of social activists apparently made him a target of chinese authorities growing up in a family that was targeted and discriminated against in the 1950s and 1960s for his father s alleged political crimes made ai weiwei particularly sensitive to injustice his mother said issues like human rights equality democracy have been seeded in him since he was very very young gao said ai s disappearance has sent a chill through the activist community and prompted many to rally for his release online by posting supportive twitter messages or blog postings zhao lianhai a beijing writer jailed last year for protesting a massive tainted milk scandal released a video on youtube saying how the crackdown on activists had left him in a very agonized state of mind in particular a few days ago we found out that ai weiwei our old ai has also been made to disappear and so far there has been no clear declaration from the authorities about it
