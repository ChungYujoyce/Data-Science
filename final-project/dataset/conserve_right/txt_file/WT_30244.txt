tuesday that president trump once again won t be welcome to speak in the hallowed legislative chamber during his state visit next month telling an audience in washington he hasn t changed his low opinion of the u s president british house of commons speaker john bercow whose bellowing voice and strongly expressed rulings have brought him international prominence presiding over heated brexit negotiations in parliament on tuesday stood by his stance that mr trump s political views run counter to british values and did not deserve a hearing in westminster mr bercow s visit comes at a time of particular turbulence in london with the country divided over brexit and a fierce leadership battle underway to succeed resigning conservative prime minister theresa may top stories trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director gop vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender but despite the massive spirited street protests that greeted mr trump s visit to britain last summer mr bercow s pointed comments may be out of step with the british people as new polling data show a clear plurality of brits support the idea of the american president stopping by for a visit mr bercow denied mr trump the opportunity to speak before parliament on his first working visit to london last year despite having granted the same honor to former president obama mr bercow argued that inviting mr trump would run contrary to parliament s longstanding opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary since then nothing has happened to reverse his judgment mr bercow said i have nothing to add to or subtract from what i said in february 2017 he said tuesday nothing has happened since then to cause me to change my mind mr bercow said that the white house has not formally requested an opportunity for mr trump to address parliament when he visits london next week though it s clear he would deny such a request if it were made while mr bercow s opinion hasn t changed it seems the british people on balance support mr trump s trip a yougov poll released this week found that 46 of brits believe mr trump s visit to london should go forward compared to 40 who want it to be called off forty one percent said they think

comes at a crucial moment for britain as it struggles to find a political consensus on exiting the european union later this year the deepening divide over brexit led mrs may to announce her resignation last week after repeated failed attempts to broker a compromise former foreign secretary boris johnson a longtime may rival and strong supporter of brexit leads a pack of contenders lining up to run for her job she is set to officially resign just days after mr trump leaves and over the weekend traditional centrist parties in britain took a beating in the weekend s european parliament elections while the nation s brexit party led by hard liner nigel farage an early leader in the push to leave the eu captured the largest share of the vote the brexit party won 29 seats making it one of the most powerful forces inside the eu and surpassing the bloc of mrs may s conservatives mrs may said tuesday the results underscore the need for parliament to accept a brexit compromise that avoids a headlong chaotic departure with an incalculable impact on the election of course the european election results were deeply disappointing for the party she told reporters in britain what it shows is the importance of actually delivering brexit i think the best way of doing that is with a deal but it will be for my successor and for parliament to find a way forward to get a consensus and i hope that those election results will focus parliament on the need to deliver brexit as the nation barrels toward its oct 31 exit from the eu mr bercow suggested in remarks tuesday in washington to the brookings institution that the brexit fight may just be getting started a conservative mp since 1997 and speaker for the past decade mr bercow said parliament will be emboldened over the coming
