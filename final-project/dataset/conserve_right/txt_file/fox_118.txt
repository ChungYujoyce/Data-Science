may be talking about something more than that wallace america begins reopening but it aposs not business as usual the crippling economic effect of the pandemic hitting major retailers the meat industry farmers and small businesses while congress remains in gridlock sen mitch mcconnell r ky senate majority leader we can apost keep throwing endless amounts of borrowed money at the problem and hope to fix it rep nancy pelosi d ca speaker of the house in addition to putting money in people aposs pockets we really also need to put food on the table wallace we aposll ask treasury secretary steven mnuchin about the economy and trillions more in government relief it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive then as more states relax restrictions despite not meeting federal guidelines for reopening we aposll discuss the challenges in flattening the curve with dr tom inglesby director of the center for health security at johns hopkins university and we aposre joined by governor mike dewine to talk about how he aposs reopening ohio plus former national security advisor michael flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi so why is the government dropping its case against him we aposll ask our sunday panel about the justice department aposs abrupt about face and our power players of the week a shout out to all the moms all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace hello again and happy mother aposs day from fox news in washington for two months now we aposve seen the devastating effect of the coronavirus on this country with more than 1 3 million cases and more than 78 000 deaths but on friday we got our best sense yet of the economic damage with official word the u s now faces the highest level of unemployment since the great depression in a moment we aposll speak with the secretary of the treasury steven mnuchin but first let aposs bring in david spunt with the fallout from the worst jobs report in the nation aposs history david david spunt fox news correspondent chris good morning even president trump is having a hard time finding a silver lining saying this week that he aposs not surprised by these numbers but the big question chris can president trump and the democrats come together for the good of those in need begin videotape spunt the numbers are grim almost 21 million americans lost their jobs in april pushing the unemployment rate to 14 7 percent unidentified male it sounds like a terror movie all these movies that we see on tv but it aposs a reality unidentified male we need food my son in law is laid off my daughter in law is laid off and i aposm handicap spunt speaker democrats and republicans are at a standstill on a phase four stimulus bill to boost the economy trump one thing we could do is a payroll tax cut that seems to bother the democrats sen chuck grassley d ny senate minority leader people like mcconnell and mccarthy and even trump who say let aposs wait and do nothing well they remind me of the old herbert hoovers we had the great depression we need franklin rooseveltian type action spunt forty three governors have partially reopened their states while others remain cautious as the virus continues to spread trump it can happen anywhere it aposs a very elusive enemy spunt including the white house where vice president mike pence aposs press secretary katie miller tested positive for the virus as did a personal valet to the president first daughter ivanka trump aposs personal assistant also tested positive fda commissioner dr stephen hahn cdc director dr robert redfield and dr anthony fauci are all under quarantine after being exposed at the white house end videotape spunt the three doctors chris are expected to testify in front of the senate on tuesday in just a few days doctors hahn and redfield will testify remotely fauci is expected to show up in person likely wearing a mask meanwhile all white house employees are told to telework when possible chris wallace david spunt reporting from the white house david thank you and joining us now treasury secretary steven mnuchin mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday steven mnuchin united states secretary of the treasury chris great to be back with you wallace the official unemployment rate as we just reported for april is 14 7 percent but that does not include the 7 million jobs lost since april 18th or the millions of workers not looking for jobs or what are called the underemployed so mr secretary what is the real unemployment rate in the united states as we talk today mnuchin chris the real issue and the president and i understand this is the economic issues that american workers and american business are facing as a result of this virus and the decision to close the economy and that aposs the reason why the president wants to work with the states to safely reopen the economy so we can safely get people back to work so these are very very large numbers these are not large numbers because of the economy wasn apost doing well these are large numbers because we aposve shutdown the economy and i would just highlight the biggest component of this was in travel and retail and leisure and not a surprise we aposve closed down major parts of the economy wallace i aposm going to get into that with you in a moment but i think it aposs important that we face what the real numbers are the bureau of labor statistics says what they call the real unemployment number for april which again includes people who are not looking for work or underemployed is 22 8 percent but again that does not include because the unemployment numbers for april stopped in mid april does not include the 7 million people who have lost their jobs since then so aren apost we talking close to 25 percent at this point which is great depression neighborhood mnuchin chris we could be but let me just emphasize unlike the great depression where you had economic issues that led to this we closed down the economy so it aposs it wouldn apost be a surprise if you closed down the economy that and ph half of the workforce is half the people didn apost work and that aposs why we aposre very focused on rebuilding this economy and getting it back to where it was this is no fault of american business this is not fault of american workers this is a result of a virus and that aposs why the president and i were determined to put together the largest economic program ever to help american workers get through this so you are correct the reported numbers are probably going to get worse before they get better but that aposs why we aposre focused on rebuilding this economy we aposll have a better third quarter we aposll have a better fourth quarter and next year is going to be a great year wallace well let aposs talk about that because you and the president both say the economy is going to come roaring back but i got to tell you and i want to ask you about a number of signs which indicate that the recovery is going to be much slower than that sir job losses are not just in the hospitality industry airlines restaurants as you would expect but they aposre more widespread the white collar and government sector 3 million jobs lost major retailers like neiman marcus and j crew declaring bankruptcy and the nonpartisan congressional budget office says unemployment at the end not of this year but of 2021 will still be 9 5 percent question are your rosy predictions based on economic reality or the november election mnuchin chris let me just emphasize first of all these numbers impact real people and i want to emphasize we understand what this is how this is impacting real people so they aposre not just numbers it aposs impacting real people my numbers aren apost rosy what i aposve said is you aposre going to have a very very bad second quarter and then i think you aposre going to see a bounce back from a low standpoint none of the economic models have ever worked in predicting what happens when you close down due to medical reasons so my predictions are based upon what i see is the rate of reopening in a careful way it aposs also based upon my views and i aposve personally heard from many of the doctors that have vaccines and virals in trials and their expectations of being able to get a vaccine by the end of this year and having real viral treatments the advent of testing all these things are going to help give american business and american workers the confidence to reopen in a careful and a deliberate way wallace and what about the food supply chain that farmers and processors say is broken because they can apost get their meat and they can apost get their produce from the field to market mnuchin well chris those are real issues but again let me emphasize i see the glass as half full and not half empty if you had told the american public we would virtually shutdown the entire supply chains and still be able to feed america and get drugs to america and continue to do critical work i couldn apost be more pleased how americans are pulling together to get through this so yes there are issues we aposre working through those issues the task force is focusing on those issues when we see them we aposre figuring out how it affects them wallace now the president is calling for states to reopen and a number of governors are around the country but this week the president talked about the possible cost of that take a look begin clip donald trump president of the united states of america will some people be affected yes will some people be affected badly yes but we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon end clip wallace but patrick harker head of the philadelphia federal reserve says if the economy opens too soon and the virus spikes again quote not only would this be a health catastrophe but it would reverse the recovery as well if that happens he predicts quote a painful economic contraction of gdp in 2021 as shutdowns are reintroduced do you agree that there is a considerable risk not to say you shouldn apost do it but there is a considerable risk to reopening both from a public health and an economic standpoint mnuchin chris if we do this carefully working with the governors i don apost think there aposs a considerable risk matter of fact i think there aposs a considerable risk of not reopening you aposre talking about what would be permanent economic damage to the american public and we aposre going to reopen in a very thoughtful way that gets people back to work safely that has them social distanced ph one of the things we aposve seen chris is a lot of businesses can do telework not everybody has to come back into the office at the same time but people will be able to go into stores some of them will have reservations when they go in but businesses will be able to reopen and i think as you know certain parts of the country had very devastating impacts like new york and certain parts of the country didn apost and this is all being monitored very very carefully wallace let aposs turn to the question of what the if there aposs going to be another response from washington and if so what it aposs going to be house speaker nancy pelosi says she may introduce a phase 4 relief bill this week but larry kudlow the white house economic adviser said this week that the administration wants to wait until late may or early june to decide where to go next and here aposs the president on that subject this week begin clip trump we aposre in a rush we aposre in a rush the democrats crosstalk trump the democrats have to do what they have to do but i would say we aposre not looking we want to see what they have but i can apost ph say that we aposre in a rush we were in a rush to get the money out to people we have gotten the money out end clip wallace question with 33 million people unemployed with the paycheck protection program money running out by the end of this month with state budgets cratering this administration is in no rush mnuchin well chris the president and i have been very clear on this and we aposre in 100 percent agreement first let me just say we appreciate the enormous bipartisan support that both parties in the house and the senate work together to get an unprecedented response you aposre talking of over 3 trillion into the economy you aposre talking about another 2 5 to 5 trillion working with the federal reserve this has never been done before and i just want to emphasize and thank the bipartisan support what the president and i are now saying is we spent a lot of money a lot of this money is not even into the economy yet let aposs take the next few weeks i aposm having discussions with both the republicans and the democrats to understand these issues the president and i are having conversations with outside people with business we just want to make sure that before we jump back in and spend another few trillion of tax payers apos money that we do it carefully we had an emergency process it went ph quickly we aposre there to help the american people we aposre going to be considerate and if we need to help the american people in every aspect of this as i aposve said before we aposre willing to spend whatever it takes but whatever it takes needs to be done carefully wallace i got about a minute left and i got a want to squeeze this in the president says that he won apost sign another relief bill without a payroll tax cut in it but both democrats and a lot of top ph republicans are expressing grave concerns about that because they say a payroll tax cut doesn apost help if somebody aposs unemployed and they aposre not on a payroll and here aposs what the senate republican leader mitch mcconnell had to say about that begin clip mitch mcconnell r ky senate majority leader i think i can safely say for our team here the republican senate and majority ph if there aposs any redline it aposs on litigation end clip wallace litigation of course means liability protection that if somebody goes back to work or goes into a restaurant that they wouldn apost be able to sue to say that they got the virus from that place so given the hesitancy from the republicans and democrats on capitol hill will the president will you insist that a payroll tax cut be part of the next relief bill mnuchin well we aposre absolutely pushing for the payroll tax cut it aposs an incentive to get people back to work it aposs delivering money to the american public and to business in a very effective way and that will be one of the components you aposve heard mitch mcconnell talk about liability we agree with that completely the democrats have been asking for more money for states we aposve been very clear that we aposre not going to do things just to bail out states that were poorly managed but we aposre going to look at all these issues and chris let me just emphasize all these bills have had enormous bipartisan support when we need to go back and work and get help the american public we aposll do this in a bipartisan way and make sure we get all these things included wallace secretary mnuchin thank you thanks for your time today always good to talk with you sir mnuchin thank you wallace coming up we aposll ask one of the nation aposs top help look health experts why coronavirus cases have not dropped more across the country and the risk of reopening the economy too soon commercial break wallace the u s is still trying to come off the top of the coronavirus curve even as states across the country ease safety restrictions joining us once again from baltimore dr tom inglesby director of the center for health security at johns hopkins university doctor when we last spoke two weeks ago you said we are near the end of the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic two weeks later as we talk today where are we now dr tom inglesby johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health well i think we are still in the early stages of the pandemic i we have a ways to go before we could possibly get a vaccine we still are now about five weeks into the a national plateau and the national averages kind of they don apost necessarily tell the whole story i think you need to get down to the state level to really understand what aposs going on around the country and even as we see places like new york and new jersey falling in cases really improving compared to their peaks many other states are still experiencing a rise in daily cases so it aposs a mix around the country but overall a national plateau wallace i want to put up a graph that demonstrates in fact what you just said it aposs pretty dramatic let aposs put it up in new york city which is the graph on the left as you can see they have been the curve of new cases considerably but in the graph on the right the rest of the country new cases have not started dropping in fact they aposre still going up given those trends dr inglesby how concerned are you as the president and governors now in 43 states have started to reopen those states inglesby well bottom line is that we aposre not diagnosing enough cases and we are not tracing their contacts we don apost know how this disease is spreading in many places we still don apost understand who aposs at highest risk why are we having so many cases now this many weeks into a into a plateau we aposre into various cases having experiencing rising daily daily numbers so i am concerned i think there are some places in the country which are doing a lot better which have low overall numbers and have had a two week decline in cases or more and have been doing a lot of testing but there are other places which are really experiencing the opposite rising cases too little testing too little tracing wallace and what is the danger if you reopen in one of those states where the number of cases is still rising and you don apost have enough testing you don apost have enough tracing what what aposs the danger then inglesby well the danger is that with increased social interaction in businesses or churches or in activities going to restaurants et cetera that with increased social interaction we will again see increased transmission and rising number of cases and in states where they aposre already on the rise that i could put a lot of pressure on their health care system that could lead to new hot spots and we just to remember two months ago in this country we had 750 cases and now we have well more than a million so this disease moves quickly and it doesn apost respect city borders state borders so as states are reopening we have to remember we aposre not we aposre in a new normal this isn apost the way it was in february or march this is a really nasty virus which remains the same so we have to do all that we can as individuals even as businesses are reopening we have to do all we can to maintain space wear cloth masks avoid gatherings the virus hasn apost changed those things are all still really important wallace let let aposs talk about the nature of this virus you say it aposs a nasty one here aposs what president trump said this week about the pandemic inglesby uh huh begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i feel about vaccines like i feel about tests this is going to go away without a vaccine it aposs going to go away and it aposs we aposre not going to sit again hopefully after a period of time end video clip wallace dr inglesby will the virus as the president said just go away inglesby no this virus isn apost going to go away hopefully over time we aposll learn to live with it and we aposll be able to reduce the risk of transmission but it aposs going to stay as a background problem in the country and around the world until we have a vaccine hopefully as we develop medicines maybe more quickly than a vaccine that will help us in ways to diminish the impact of the virus but this virus we aposre mostly around the world almost all of us are susceptible to it as far as we know at this point so this virus has a long way to run we don apost think that more than a small percent of the country at this point has been infected so most of us are still susceptible to this virus wallace what about the argument you hear from some people look the people who are dying from this virus are seniors people over 60 or people with underlying conditions so just quarantine them or you know have them isolated and let the rest of the people go back to work would that would that work inglesby so if you add up the number of the people in the country over 65 with all those who have underlying conditions that would put them at higher risk that aposs about 90 million adults or a third of the adults in this country and there really isn apost any clear way to separate that third of adults with the rest of the country so it aposs it would be pretty challenging and right now the country is already trying to do its best to prevent infections in nursing homes with stay at home orders around the country and even with that about half of the nursing homes in the country have a case or an outbreak and so i think we need a kind of a strategy that works for everyone i don apost think there can be a strategy that works for only half the country and with an attempt to keep the other half or the other third of the country in some kind of large isolation i don apost think it will work logistically or practically wallace on the other hand as i just discussed with the secretary of the treasury mnuchin and as i aposm sure you aposve seen 30 more than 30 million americans have lost their jobs is there a way to find a balance between on the one hand waving people aposs lives and on the other hand saving our economy inglesby we absolutely have to find that balance i completely agree with you the economic losses in this country are shocking and our team at our center wrote one of the first reports on reopening the economy we believe strongly that that needs to be a near term goal we just have to do it in a way that is as safe as possible i completely agree with that principle articulated by secretary mnuchin we have to do it safely and i think that means trying to have very very substantial diagnostic testing capability in place around the country the ability to trace the contacts of patients that aposs how other countries in the world have gotten control of their epidemics the way that they aposve restored their economies really is to give people a sense of confidence i think that the disease is under control or relatively good control and i think that should be our goal here we have to show people that this disease is under good control and people will then have confidence in going out and re engaging the economy so we need to build contact tracing capability around the country in every state we need to expand diagnostic capacity in every state wallace right inglesby and that aposs the way i think we aposre going to get control wallace dr inglesby thank you thanks for coming in again to discuss the hard scientific data with us thank you sir up next states balance bringing back their economies while trying to keep people safe we aposll talk with ohio governor mike dewine about what he says is a gamble reopening his state in the midst of a pandemic commercial break wallace coming up ohio governor mike dewine moves forward with plans to reopen businesses but urges caution begin video clip governor mike dewine r ohio as we open up the economy let me just state the obvious and not shy away from it the risk is up end video clip wallace we aposll ask the governor about the pushback he aposs facing from republicans next commercial break chris wallace fox anchor ohio took early action against the coronavirus including being the first state in the nation to close its schools but now a phased reopening is underway even as the number of covid cases there continues to rise joining us now ohio governor mike dewine governor as we say you were one of the first governors in the country to move against the virus you were the very first one to close schools in mid march you also ordered a stay at home order but by the end of this week you will have reopened 90 percent of ohio aposs economy why do you think you can do that safely sir gov mike dewine r oh well it aposs really a risk no matter what we do it aposs a risk if we don apost do anything it aposs a risk if we if we do this what we have done is come up with the best practices for businesses to reopen we put business people together with health people had them come up with these best practices and chris the you know the economy aposs not going to open no matter what we do whatever we order unless people have confidence and we aposre trying to give them confidence but at the same time we aposre telling them look the virus is still out there it aposs still very very dangerous we have to keep the distancing people should wear wear masks wash your hands i mean these are basic things that we have to do we can apost let up wallace let aposs look at the path of the virus in your state because a week ago since a week ago friday the number of new cases in ohio has gone down and then back up and two days ago last friday you had the highest number of new cases since april 20th so i guess the question governor is i mean that would seem to be a red flag right there you aposre not meeting the white house gating guideline of a steady downward trajectory in cases for two weeks why is that not a red light dewine well i don apost know if anybody aposs meeting or not very many states are meeting it what we do now have chris is is great capacity in regard to testing we did not have that two weeks ago we are standing up a big force of people to do to go talk to people try to run that virus down isolate people so those are two things we did not have before that it aposs a work in progress we are getting that if you look at i look at kind of a 21 day rule we are really at a plateau with hospitalizations we are at a plateau with deaths we are at a plateau in regard to new cases so they do go up and down we wish we were going down we aposre not we have been hit in ohio just like other states have been hit economically so we aposve got to try to do two things at once and it aposs you know no one is underestimating how difficult this is but it aposs something that that we have to do wallace let aposs talk about that other side of the equation which we aposve been discussing throughout this hour how badly has your state of ohio been hit in terms of jobs in terms of the economy beginning to shrink dewine well we aposve been hit very hard i mean we aposve had over over a million people who have applied for unemployment so we aposre no different than most other states i mean we aposve been hit exceedingly hard and again it aposs as we look to come back carefully it aposs not so much about at this point orders that i issue or my health director issues it aposs really about what what people do and i emphasize that time and time again we aposve got to be very careful as we do this because if we aposre not careful we aposre going to roll backwards we aposre going to have to shut things down and that is not what anyone wants to see wallace you aposre like a lot of governors governor dewine in the sense that you aposre taking hits from both sides on the one hand you aposre you aposre getting criticism that you aposre reopening too fast there aposs a hot spot in marion ohio where the the cases per capita is actually higher than new york city the mayor of dayton is pushing back saying they don apost have the testing and the contact tracing so you aposre taking a hit on that side but you aposre also taking a hit from conservatives frankly a lot of people in your own party that you aposre moving too slowly there have been a number of protests in the streets against you you and your your stay at home order saying let aposs move faster and the state house of representatives in ohio in columbus just voted to take away your ability your authority to issue a stay at home order that exceeds two weeks so you aposre getting it from both sides aren apost you dewine yes we are and i aposve made it clear to the legislature that if that reached us and i don apost think it it will but i would i would veto that look i understand chris that people are anxious to get back that aposs that aposs that is people are hurting i mean we can apost underestimate the businesses that are suffering we can apost underestimate the workers who don apost have jobs and so that aposs why we have to move forward but we have to move forward very very carefully and and my message to my fellow ohioans has always been we can do two things at once but we can only do them if we aposre very very careful about it and so our future our ability to open up ohio is going to depend with whether people continue to do the social distancing literally do they continue do they will they wear masks when they go out in public i mean we now have for example every business that opens unless there aposs some reason that they cannot do that their employees have to wear masks so we have some very tough standards as we are opening but it aposs going to come down really to the average citizen when they go out and and they go buy plants to to to to put out you know are they careful do they in fact wear that mask do they not make extra trips out when they go out do they go out do what they have to do and then and then come back so we can apost stop doing that as as we move forward we would love to see the numbers go down we think we aposre at about a 1 1 one person infecting one person we would love to get those numbers down below that but what we don apost want to see is it dramatically go up from from where it is and we know it aposs a risk as we start the economy back open but it aposs a risk if you don apost too as far as all the all the consequences that we have with with you know not being able to come back economically wallace i aposve got about a minute left so i aposd like to get you out on this this question as you begin to reopen there is of course the danger in a spike in cases how will you judge whether that spike is serious and you have to shut down the government again and do you really think you could pull that off how tough would that be to say you know what we aposre going to reinstitute the stay at home order and we aposre going to have to tell businesses that we aposve just opened you aposve got to close if that aposs what happens dewine well the spikes that we have seen you talked about marion that was a prison in marion a great great tragedy with our prisons and our nursing homes you know that aposs happening across the country and we aposre working very very hard in regard to that but what i look at every day is at the daily hospitalization rates they aposre pretty flat we aposre going to continue to monitor those icu monitor the new the new cases and at the same time though we aposre dramatically pushing new testing we aposre doing that with the tracing the testing and tracing is an integral part of what we aposre doing wallace right dewine and we aposre aggressive even in doing that wallace governor dewine thank you dewine thanks chris wallace thanks for taking time out of your weekend to talk with us and to share your thinking here thank you sir up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the justice department aposs decision to drop the michael flynn case and joe biden aposs accuser speaks out commercial break begin video clip preset he was targeted by the obama administration and he was targeted in order to try and take down a president unidentified female he admitted lying to the fbi does the fact remains that he lied william barr attorney general well you know people sometimes plead to things that turn out not to be crimes rep adam schiff d ca here you know bill barr once again doing the political dirty work for the president end video clip wallace attorney general william barr defending his decision to drop the government aposs case against michael flynn and reaction to that move from president trump and house intel committee chair adam schiff and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz fox news correspondent gillian turner and charles lane from the washington post congressman chaffetz michael flynn pleaded guilty twice to lying to the fbi and now the justice department suddenly drops his case are you comfortable with that jason chaffetz fox news contributor well i think what aposs been exposed chris is the lack of the underlying predicate to even go forward and do the types of interviews the ambush if you will that they did on on general flynn i do applaud the president for firing michael flynn at the time if you recall he did lie to the vice president he did like to reince priebus that is a separate issue but the attorney general makes a very good point and i would also point out that you had andrew mccabe who the inspector general said lied to federal authorities and they decided not to prosecute that case as well wallace president obama was talking to members of his administration an obama alumni association on friday it was an audio hookup supposedly it was off the record but it was leaked apparently he was talking to several thousand people so it aposs not surprising and he talked about the fact that flynn got off obama aposs words scot free here he is begin video clip barack obama former u s president you begin to get worried that basic not just institutional norms but our basic understanding of of rule of law is at risk end video clip wallace gillian is the miscarriage of justice in this case that the as as the president president obama seems to indicate that the department of justice is dropping the case against flynn or is the miscarriage of justice that they brought a case against him in the first place gillian turner fox news correspondent well president obama says the general flynn got off scot free and that aposs simply not true we cannot forget the fact that he is one of the only top senior former administration officials to ever have been fired by two consecutive bipartisan presidents that aposs not getting off scot free you know he may not be end up he may not end up going to jail in this instance but it aposs pretty you know it aposs not a great benchmark to have on your resume i will also say you know the attorney general bill barr was already a lightning rod for politicians here in washington with this decision he aposs become virtually electric stems from his time handling the mueller investigation he did say that the reason that he had the doj drop these criminal charges against flynn is because he wants to restore a sense of faith in the justice system that aposs a noble cause it aposs no secret that a lot of republicans have lost that faith in both the justice system and the intelligence community in recent years to come back finally to your to your first question chris all of this doesn apost make general michael flynn a hero the fact that he aposs not going to end up serving hard time in prison for lies that he perpetrated to the fbi and to two sitting american presidents all of this doesn apost mean he aposs getting off scot free he aposs lose he aposs leaving with a reputation in tatters and i think that that aposs justice wallace chuck let aposs pick up on what gillian said bill barr you aposll have republicans who were saying that he is cleaning up from the mess of the james comey fbi you have others that saying that he aposs doing as adam schiff said he aposs doing donald trump aposs dirty work i aposd like you to to react to that and also how do you expect the judge in this case emmett sullivan who aposs going to have to hear the decision to drop the case and has been very tough on michael flynn has talked about him selling his country out how do you expect him to react when he hears this case and the decision to drop it charles lane fox news contributor well first on bill barr it aposs abundantly clear that two things are true about bill barr he things the mueller investigation was wrongheaded a fiasco and he aposs going to try and clean that up in his view no matter what and secondly he doesn apost particularly care about the heat he might get from democrats and there aposs a there aposs a basic underlying fact here that aposs crucial to understanding what aposs going on and that is that the flynn predicament has turned into sort of a cause on the republican right president trump is kindling to that and president trump one way or the other i think wants michael flynn set loose and by doing it this way barr in effect liberates the president from ever having to issue a pardon which many of us thought would have been inevitable otherwise the fly in the ointment might be judge emmett sullivan who as you say has been both critical of the justice department aposs excesses in the past and of general flynn in this case and he does i think have it within his power to refuse this justice department motion to dismiss and in effect force the president to deal with it himself you know the question is really where the buck is going to stop in terms of this case right now it has stopped in in with bill barr who aposs then passed it to the judge and if the judge passes it back i think it will end up stopping with president trump wallace all right let aposs turn to joe biden and allegations from former staffer tara reade that he sexually assaulted her in 1993 the big addition to the story this week is that she spoke out to megyn kelly here aposs a clip from that begin video clip megyn kelly you want him to withdraw tara reade biden accuser i wish he would but he won apost but i wish you would end video clip wallace gillian how badly do you think particularly now that we aposve seen and heard her tara reade aposs account hurts joe biden and do you think it jeopardizes his prospects for winning for actually securing the democratic nomination in august turner i don apost know yet chris if it jeopardizes his chances but it aposs undoubtedly the case that this hurts him this is precisely the kind of speculation that any democrat president presidential candidate does not want to have chasing them along the campaign trail i don apost need to remind you that this is the same type of accusation that dogged president trump while he was running for office back in 2016 it was a cudgel that you know democrats used back then to hammer him with over and over again that said i think we always have to reframe these discussions about sexual assault sexual abuse harassment and rape reframe them outside of politics because i think what we aposre seeing happen again in this case the same thing happened to to the accusers and justice brett kavanaugh aposs cases is that four women who were sexually abused sexually assaulted and raped politics is not forefront on the agenda i think when we talk about this for example this week democrats everybody from nancy pelosi to the dnc to biden himself have been trying to dismiss tara reade aposs claims based on technicalities right this happened a long time ago statute of limitations she didn apost file the right paperwork at the time she didn apost file the right paperwork now parsing her words in every single interview the problem with all of this is that it victimizes these women twice and i think this is something that politicians are doing a disservice to women on when they insist on going down this road so there aposs the political angle on all of this and then there aposs also this woman what she may have suffered and what she went through i think it aposs just important to distinguish wallace congressman chaffetz i think you have to note though that despite allegations whether they were true or not donald trump in the 2016 campaign brett kavanaugh in his confirmation hearing for the supreme court both weathered the allegations against them and one went on to be elected president one ended up being confirmed to the supreme court so what do you think is going to happen here in the biden case will it block him from the democratic nomination chaffetz i think democrats have cause to be concerned because i think they know and have seen joe biden over the last 50 years just roll the tape since he was the vice president and the creepy things that he aposs doing to people on camera but what it really really highlights particularly to conservatives who are very sensitive to this but it should be to everybody is the hypocrisy of the national media the double standard in which they cover this story and certainly the me too movement who aposve made this big effort to say every woman should be believed and then all of a sudden somebody comes in accuses a democrat and they aposre nowhere to be found that double standard is not lost on the american people and i think has political ramifications as well wallace chuck you know what makes this particularly interesting in the case of biden is one of the main things he aposs running on is character and what he aposs claiming is a big distinction between his character and that of donald trump if you now have a woman and again we don apost know whether her allegation is true or not it may end up being like a lot of these a he said she said but when you aposve got this allegation against him and his character is that especially damaging to biden lane i think it doesn apost help and we aposve seen his momentum in this sort of weird basement of your own home campaign his momentum has really been stalled and obviously this is not what he would want to have facing him at this point and i think obviously equally obviously it aposs why republicans are making such a big issue out of it but really in the end chris voters i think are going to focus on two things in the big picture here one is like all re elections this is a referendum on the incumbent and by the time november rolls around we aposre going to be in the middle of a horrific economic problem with a pandemic of people are going to vote based on getting out of that wallace and you think that unless there is another woman or that there aposs another big allegation that this goes away lane i don apost think it goes away i just don apost think it aposs not the factor that aposs going to decide very much wallace thank you panel see you next sunday up
