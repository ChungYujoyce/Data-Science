source ap photo mary altaffer nikki haley should already be running away with the 2024 gop nomination as the fresh face of post trump conservatism but instead it looks like she s falling for the same sucker siren song of the establishment that over the last few decades has made failures out of so many promising republicans as well as out of jeb if she keeps going the way she s been going she s going to lose this race before it even starts sure the establishment digs her but can she turn it around and earn the support of actual gop voters yes if she ditches the gope hacks and gets woke i don t know if she can do it but i hope she can i want to back her she s got incredible promise on paper she s great she was a successful governor her personal story of immigrant success and military family service is compelling she was fantastic as un ambassador though you could see by the way she carefully distanced herself from some of the president s more lib alarming moves that she was not all in on the populist revolt that has won over the base there s something establishment curious about her she seems caught up in the for now favorable media she seems willing to buy into the gope world view on issues like immigration and trade she seems unwilling or unable to engage or enlist the base instead when we hear about her it s in tone deaf contexts like a smiley post panel photo with john freakin brennan that s lying cia to cnn creep john brennan who helped manufacture the soft coup that s been hamstringing conservative progress for the last two years he s not a friend he s not even an opponent he s an enemy and when you take a giggly picture with him we in the base see it as a gesture of the same kind of ruling class solidarity that has led to our consistent betrayal by putative members of our own party over the last three decades nikki and i had a twitter exchange over it on february 17 2019 i was distinctly unimpressed which bummed me out because i want to support her she tweeted great policy discussion on the future of our country with condoleezzarice johnbrennan and gen martin dempsey at the nba all stars nbaallstar newsmakers breakfast thank you commissioner adam silver for all of the good work the nba continues to do seeing her grinning next to that monster who has been trying to toss out the president we elected since the moment felonia milhous von pantsuit lost i tweeted really nikkihaley really she responded i can t control who i sit on a panel with i can control how i communicate america s strengths and our path forward that is what i did ugh let s leave aside the nonsense about the alleged inability to control one s own panels her substantive response is just dc pablum communicate america s strengths and our path forward who talks like that stop it stop it the hacks around you will insist it s just a photo it s not it s a message what message are you sending the base chillin with perjury boy hi base i m going to pal around with the people trying to shaft you this is a poor message for a gop contender read the comments to your tweet the people whose votes you need hated it your minions will tell you way to go your minions are wrong here s a test if the fredocons tell you something is a good idea do the opposite you can be pals with the likes of brennan or with us not both choose but here s something to think about we might vote for you if you earn it the brennans of the world their fake smiles and phony hugs at your fancy gatherings aside absolutely will slide a stiletto into your back the second that you become a threat to their power so choose it s us or them remember how on march 11th the left tried to take down our guy tucker carlson want to know what nikki s only tweet was on march 11 congrats to south carolina s own wofford terriers for winning the southern conference scpride goterriers look i m sure everyone loves the wofford terriers but who the hell cares the fight that day was to defend a vital conservative voice who was under attack by the liberal media with help from the ahoy division collaborators and you nikki haley were awol hey nikki let me offer some advice your lame consultants won t don t do things that make your base believe that you care more about being a member of the dc cool kids clique than about us we ve seen that happen over and over again and if that s the impression you set you will lose our votes in the primaries and then you will lose the nomination in fact a lot of the base is already deeply suspicious of you as yet another establishment squish who will sell us out on guns endless wars open borders and the climate change scam maybe they are wrong maybe they have a mistaken understanding of your intentions maybe you are a hardcore conservative in disguise and maybe taking pictures with leftwing treason mongers is not the best way to reassure them you need to get woke to the reality that there is an existential struggle underway the other side seeks not merely its turn back in temporary power but domination over normal americans forever look at what the base you need is experiencing illegal immigration is killing us literally and changing our society into something we never voted for look at the towns ravaged by opioids another consequence of open borders our culture and values are under constant attack by a media elite that hates us and tech monopolies that seek to silence us the democrats are talking about taking our cars and cheeseburgers what the hell do you intend to do about that you can go along and get along and get rolled like that sad sack loser jeb or you can fight like donald trump has but watch out because the establishment is going to seek to seduce you to embrace the low energy vibe telling you americans really want a return to bipartisan hugging where republicans protest a little before signing on to whatever the progressives demand that s a lie we want a fighter we don t want another mitt or mccain offering the promise of efficiently managed defeat and decline we want to win our country back from these jew hating gun grabbing climate scamming anti christian socialist freaks who want to venezuelaize us once and for all but why listen to me after all you are surrounded by the best and the brightest minds of the gop establishment and if anyone knows about winning it s that pack of geniuses us folks in the base we just don t get it we don t see the big picture frankly we re a little dumb and we need the guidance of our betters the mandarins in the dc ruling class with the understanding of what us peasants really need that s what jeb thought and now he s a punchline you however could be president but you have got to get woke step one is ditching the establishment at least for a while yeah it s got to be fun to be fussed over and feted and seated on prestigious panels but it s a grift a con designed to co opt you from the common sense that led you to connect with real people in a real state like south carolina understand that we are interviewing to hire someone to carry on the fight after trump is gone we are not looking for a trump clone there will never be another trump but someone who similarly instinctively understands the nature of our enemies and who has a burning desire to defeat them you need to nail down the base and then you can start cavorting with the establishment again this time not as their prot g but as their master you must break them to your will not let them break you and you need people around you to tell you when you have screwed up many pols don t they have plenty of sycophants but no command sergeant major your husband was military another cool thing about you he can explain the role of the csm to shut the door and tell you that you are wrong and need to get squared away no trump probably has no one in that role but he s the exception do you think mccain or mitt did either they got crushed you ll get crushed if you don t have people holding you accountable you could be president the base could still support you but you have got to show us something that you have so far failed to show us that you know what time it is that you understand what is going on and that you get that this is not business as usual politics but an ideological cultural conflict where our opposites seek our complete subjugation this is serious stuff the next republican president better understand the stakes i write about an america split apart into red and blue in my novels people s republic indian country and wildfire and if we let the libs or a weakheart republican into the white house we ll be lucky if that s the worst that happens if we lose we stop being free citizens and become neutered serfs if you don t see that don t bother running we ll find someone woke who s willing to fight for us alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative
