apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump praised house republicans thursday for getting tough with democrats closed door impeachment inquiry while the president s conservative allies took to the airwaves in democratic districts and some urged the white house to turn the proceedings into a showcase corruption trial of former vice president joseph r biden and his son hunter a day after dozens of house republicans stormed into the secure room where democrats are hearing testimony to demand a more open process senate republican leaders stirred from what the white house considered a dangerous slumber on impeachment senate majority leader mitch mcconnell kentucky republican and judiciary committee chairman lindsey graham south carolina republican introduced a resolution condemning house democrats secretive tactics in the probe the house democrats impeachment inquiry is breaking critical precedents denying the administration important rights that were

most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state mr graham said the resolution is aimed at democrats secret and illegitimate process not at allegations against the president i m not here to tell you that donald trump s done nothing wrong he said he keeps telling me he did nothing wrong he would like the process to be exposed for being basically unfair after lunch with the president at the white house on thursday mr graham said mr trump was in a good mood but felt persecuted by democrats and lacking in republican defenders he feels like it never ends and that when it comes to donald trump nobody really cares whether he has a fair day in court other than a handful of republicans mr graham said every time he turns around there s another reason that his family his friends he s got to pay legal bills he feels like he doesn t have a real fair chance of being president of the united states the president thanked on twitter the house republicans who crashed the impeachment inquiry at the capitol for being tough smart and understanding in detail the greatest witch hunt in american history the move delayed a witness testimony for several hours and attracted significant media coverage to the democrats weekslong tactic of private questioning the leaders of the impeachment inquiry plan to conduct more closed door interviews saturday in their effort to prove that mr trump withheld military aid to ukraine in an attempt to force its president to investigate mr biden the democratic presidential front runner and his son hunter who was on the board of directors of a ukrainian energy company there were signs on several fronts that the white house and allied republicans plan to get tougher with democrats the associated press reported late thursday that the trump administration s justice department has shifted its review of the russia probe to a criminal investigation a move that gives prosecutors the ability to issue subpoenas potentially impanel a grand jury and compel witnesses to give testimony and bring federal criminal charges it also raises the possibility that as congress investigates the president the executive branch will be investigating those behind the basis of the congressional inquiry to show support for the president the republican national committee s impeachment task force is buying ads in 30 democratic house districts that mr trump won in 2016 the rnc earlier targeted 60 vulnerable democrats with ads the conservative club for growth announced this week that it will air digital ads in several congressional districts held by moderate freshman democrats including in california illinois new mexico and virginia the ads target lawmakers in those districts for following house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat in lockstep on impeachment instead of working on legislation former white house senior strategist steve bannon started a daily radio show and podcast this week called war room impeachment his guest thursday was rep mark meadows north carolina republican a vocal trump ally who said the party plans to issue a minority report to defend the president when the house judiciary committee considers articles of impeachment i fully expect that another report needs to be told so that is just not a one sided partisan hit job coming out from adam schiff and his team said mr meadows referring to the california democrat who chairs the house permanent select committee on intelligence and is leading the inquiry but some republicans are criticizing the white house for failing to lay out a clear game plan for combating impeachment asked by a reporter why the white house seems to have changed course several times on its impeachment messaging mr graham replied you ve noticed he also said he had spoken with acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney and believed they re working on getting a messaging team together but about an hour later mr graham said he didn t mean to imply that the white house needed to hire a new team to handle impeachment my interactions with the white house were in regards to a more coordinated strategy dealing with impeachment mr graham tweeted what is in development at the white house is the emphasis on a strategy not personnel mr trump approved of a plan this week for daily calls between white house aides and certain republican lawmakers to coordinate messaging and legal strategies on impeachment the wall street journal reported white house press secretary stephanie grisham said it s difficult for the president s team to respond to what it can t see it s hard to message anything that s going on behind closed doors and in secret ms grisham said on fox friends it s like you re fighting a ghost you re fighting against the air so we re doing the best we can american conservative union chairman matt schlapp said the white house can do a ton to fight back this is going to be a daily battle mr schlapp said the trump administration has a lot of cards it can play he said the president and his team should call witnesses in an impeachment proceeding and turn it into a trial about hunter biden s lucrative overseas deals while his father was vice president i d release anything on ukraine that was embarrassing to joe biden mr schlapp said i d release all the manifests for air force two every white house counsel s office has to approve all those manifests how many times was hunter biden on a flight the theme of it should be transparency why is hunter biden in hiding why is joe biden saying he s not going to talk about any of this he said many questions haven t been answered about the fbi s counterintelligence surveillance of the trump campaign in 2016 i would start releasing a lot more material about the 2016 election he said mr schlapp said the white house and its allies need to remain focused on highlighting the unfairness of the impeachment process compared with the impeachments of presidents richard m nixon in 1974 and bill clinton in 1998 if you look at what we did with clinton and what we did with nixon as a country it all started with a bipartisan vote on the floor he said it starts off a process by which the accused s counsel can be present and play a role it contemplates how you would move forward and eventually have public hearings and public testimony this is why nancy pelosi is screwing this up so dramatically pelosi is doing nothing by the book they re interested in finding any justification to impeach the president that s the wrong way to approach impeachment eventually it s going to fall to the american people whether or not they see a crime no 1 and do they think the president s getting a fair process senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat said republicans will rue the day they demanded transparency in the impeachment inquiry mr schumer said house republicans storming of the secure room where the house has been conducting the impeachment probe was a fit of staged political theater and that their tactics were intentional diversions from democrats fact finding mission all the facts must come out and those who are attempting to obstruct this fact finding inquiry may regret the day when they said all they want to do is open up the process mr schumer said on the senate floor our republican friends may get what they wished for all the facts coming out they will regret it because at least from reports the facts are very very troubling mr graham offered the white house advice similar to that of former house speaker newt gingrich that mr trump should learn from the example of mr clinton during his impeachment i know this sounds weird but clinton look what he did mr graham said he had a team that was organized had legal minds that could understand what was being said versus that legal proceedings and in question and they were on message every day president clinton defended himself but he never stopped being president and i think that is one of the reasons that he survived i m hoping that will become the model here mr graham said some republican senators have been reluctant to come out strongly in the president s defense because they would become jurors sitting in judgment of mr trump in a senate trial ryan lovelac
