millennials have replaced seniors as the most coveted voting block in america for any candidate particularly presidential candidates candidates simply cannot win without a majority of these precocious and finicky individuals since 2004 democrats have capitalized on the support they have received from millennials primarily based on their over zealous social agenda although the many catastrophic millennial economic and social statistics solidified by the failures of the obama administration has caused the democrat s capital on this generation to erode unfortunately the social agenda democrats aim at millennials is dwindling the supreme court has all but started a tittle wave of legalizing same sex marriage in many states the legalization of medicinal marijuana is gaining acceptance and climate change ranks low on the priority list 8 percent ap photo the wilmington star news mike spencer file therefore for the first time in over a decade republicans have an opening in the once impenetrable democrat millennial shield googletag cmd push function googletag display div gpt ad in content 300x250 102 the key strategy the republican party needs to employ is what i call the 1 4 10 this campaign strategy focuses solely on the first fourth and 10th amendments and the issues surrounding these amendments these are the issues that truly matter to millennials in this post social issue political climate the obama administration and it s democratic cohorts have all abandoned these precious rights that are so important to millennials next to the economy and reform of entitlement programs the first amendment is one of the most important to millennials today with social media every millennial has a voice and they want it to be heard millennials tweet publish facebook posts and shoot youtube videos to express their opinion and they do not like how president barack obama has courted these companies in closed meetings in hopes of regulating and spying on their every first amendment action millennials have also seen how the obama administration has repeatedly taken the catholic church to court over it s regulations in obamacare on abortion and contraception to try and force this instituion to provide these services furthermore the democrat controlled senate is set to return to washington d c and spend the remainder of the year trying to pass a proposal that all but erases the first amendment by allowing incumbent candidates the power to decide who can speak and who cannot jim murray marches in the rain to protest national security agency surveillance of americans saturday july 6 2013 in chattanooga tenn murray along with members of the occupy chattanooga movement and independent protesters involved in the restore the fourth event marched from miller park to the tennessee aquarium in chattanooga tenn restore the fourth refers to the fourth amendment to the u s constitution photo credit shawn paik ap the fourth amendment has become very popular since edward snowden leaked the activities of the national security agency the gross infringement of every american s fourth amendment rights by the nsa s operations has caused millennials to reevaluate the effects of a large big brother type government and has decimated their trust in the nsa 24 percent and the federal government 20 percent millennials do everything online you name it they do it from mobile banking to texting to dating and the idea that some random guy in an office somewhere is watching them is unsettling the awareness that the federal government can track a u s citizen via their cell phone turn on their microphone and camera and read their texts without a legal warrant is upsetting on every level although millennials are very social they also enjoy the anonymity and privacy of the digital age both of which the federal government is violating millennials want as much of the protection of the fourth amendment they can have in post terrorism america and at least some regulation of the nsa finally the 2014 and 2016 elections will be all about the 10th amendment state rights have become the winning platform for any potential candidate millennials have seen how overreaching the federal government has become under democratic leadership and their uninhibited intervention and intimidation of states has not gone unnoticed millennials want a country where their individual state has the right to legalize or prohibit medicinal marijuana same sex marriage and set abortion limits without the federal government stepping in sen rand paul r ky ap photo molly riley file millennials to be clear are not libertarian or running to the republican party but they do want a libertarian esque candidate like sen rand paul r ky a candidate does not need to personally support every issue important to millennials they just need to keep the federal government from intervening in them the less is more approach without millennials democrats cannot win a presidential election they have alienated their blue collar and religious base s and now they must rely on immigrants the non working poor and millennials this explains their lack of effort in securing the southern border without their 80 million millennials they need a tidal wave of illegal aliens made legal by executive order to ensure their continued power currently millennials are set to vote for hilary clinton in 2016 solely based off name recognition and default due to the fact that she is well known and the republican candidate is yet to be named so at this point in the game it is a one woman race although it would be incredibly premature to announce her victory within the millennials constituency democrats praising her ability to be unbeatable have forgotten that millennials abandoned her in the 2008 primaries against then sen barack obama clinton simply brings nothing new to the table and millennials cannot afford to live through a barack obama 2 0 presidency there is in no way going to be a tidal wave of millennial support for republicans and there will always be a group of millennials who will support a liberal agenda therefore republicans need to focus on 1 4 10 campaign strategy to gain as much ground as possible with common sense and fed up millennials to offset the large electoral millennial edge democrats currently enjoy follow salvatorv and
