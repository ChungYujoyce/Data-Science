birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches actress and liberal activist alyssa milano called the maga hat the new white hood when kentucky s covington catholic high school students were wrongly accused of inciting a confrontation with an american indian activist on the national mall in washington matthew a sears a professor of classics and ancient history at the university of new brunswick also compared the hat to a ku klux klan hood or robe in a washington post column he said wearing a maga hat constitutes a deliberate political act and a deliberate provocation the same newspaper s fashion critic robin givhan wrote to wear a maga hat is to wrap oneself in a confederate flag the look may be more modern and the fit more precise but it s just as woeful and ugly according to chicago prosecutors former empire cast member jussie smollett arranged for his cohorts to wear red baseball hats resembling maga hats in his alleged attack hoax the logic of mr smollett s alleged plot of course is that a maga hat is the preferred headgear of racists and homophobic attackers the wursthall restaurant and bierhaus in san mateo california briefly banned maga hats if you come to my restaurant wearing a maga cap you aren t getting served same as if you come in wearing a swastika white hood or any other symbol of intolerance and hate tweeted chef and co owner j kenji lopez alt he later lifted the ban saying he should have first consulted his partners and staff after having seen the red hat displayed so prominently in so many moments of anger hate and violence to me and many others the hat began to symbolize exactly that anger hate and violence mr lopez alt said this was the context
