a administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion now that the fbi investigation of president trump has been exposed as baseless the american people are asking how the bureau could have started it in the first place the answer is that according to his book the threat and his 60 minutes interview andrew mccabe as acting fbi director opened the investigation into mr trump and urged deputy attorney general rod rosenstein to appoint a special counsel to investigate him based almost entirely on mr trump s comment to nbc s lester holt that he thought about this russia thing when he decided to fire jim comey as fbi director mr trump told mr holt and in fact when i decided to just do it fire comey i said to myself i said you know this russia thing with trump and russia is a made up story it s an excuse by the democrats for having lost an election that they should have won top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey while that statement sounds as if mr trump in his usual truncated fashion was saying he fired mr comey because the fbi director was pursuing the russia investigation and he wanted to stop it mr trump made it clear to aides afterward that he meant the opposite that he was aware that firing mr comey could prolong the russia investigation his comments to mr holt immediately following his reference to this russia thing confirm mr trump s claim and expose mr mccabe s rationale for opening an investigation of mr trump as bogus mr trump went on to say in the interview that he supported a full investigation into russian interference in the election he said he never tried to pressure mr comey into dropping the fbi probe of the trump campaign and insisted i want to find out if there was a problem in the election having to do with russia then as noted in my book the trump white house mr trump went on in the nbc interview to say as far as i m concerned i want that thing to be absolutely done properly maybe i ll expand that you know lengthen the time of the russia probe because it should be over with in my opinion should have been over with a long time ago cause all it is is an excuse but i said to myself i might even lengthen out the investigation but i have to do the right thing for the american people in other words in confusing fashion mr trump was saying that rather than trying to end the fbi s russia investigation he recognized that by firing mr comey in may 2017 he may have been lengthening the investigation the media largely ignored that statement nor in all the endless stories about the russia investigation did the media point out that mr trump never asked anyone to stop the investigation that he was not a target of an fbi investigation when he fired mr comey and that he did not corruptly cover up destroy evidence or make false statements to mislead investigators as happened during watergate when president nixon clearly obstructed justice in his book mr mccabe deliberately and dishonestly omitted the rest of what mr trump said to mr holt about his action firing mr comey probably lengthening the investigation indeed in a second reference to why mr trump s comment in the interview justified an fbi investigation mr mccabe said in his book that there was no need to look further into evidence of mr trump s motivations for firing comey since the president already had publicly made the connection between comey s firing and this russia thing in addition in embarrassing fashion mr mccabe parenthetically cited the fact that in a demeaning and dismissive way mr trump had called the ongoing legitimate fbi investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election which included the possibility of collusion by the campaign a witch hunt as if voicing his opinion as president and defending himself had anything to do with a criminal act that could help justify opening an fbi investigation so quite the opposite of obstructing the investigation mr trump made it clear in the lester holt interview that by firing mr comey as he had the right to do as president he realized that he was probably prolonging the investigation yet the entire basis for starting the fbi s obstruction and collusion investigation specifically targeting mr trump was outrageously based on a phony predicate that dishonestly ignored the rest of what mr trump said in the nbc interview not since j edgar hoover as fbi director opened fbi investigations into anyone who criticized the government and blackmailed presidents and members of congress has the fbi been so tarnished ronald kessler a former washington post and wall street journal investigative reporter is the author of the trump white house changing the rules of the game and the secrets o
