going to be able to get them to open fairly quickly and then others will follow the federal government will be watching them very closely and we ll be there to help some critics said mr trump was merely granting states the authority they already have i am hereby authorizing everyone to do things that they were already authorized to do sen brian schatz hawaii democrat said in a wry tweet while he was conducting his briefing house speaker nancy pelosi fired a shot across his bow in a letter to house democrats that warned americans to ignore the lies on the next steps there are important decisions ahead the california democrat wrote but if we are not working from the truth more lives will be lost economic hardship and suffering will be extended unnecessarily she accused the president of an incompetent reaction that ignored early warnings and took insufficient action she said that caused unnecessary death and led to the economy s becoming a disaster for his part mr trump rattled off an incredibly long list of high powered ceos who will help in the decision making noting a few are friends of his he also name checked a few chefs at the tony restaurants in his old hometown in new york city my friend jean georges and daniel you know them mr trump said presumably meaning daniel boulud he said former secretary of state condoleezza rice is involved as are religious leaders and major sports leagues i m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old but i haven t had much time to watch mr trump said he s also talking to his former food and drug commission scott gottlieb who s been vocal about the right way to respond to the virus the president also said he s receiving input from jamie dimon ceo of jpmorganchase zippy duvall presidentof the american farm bureau federation james p hoffa president of the international brotherhood of teamsters richard trumka president of the afl cio stephen schwarzman chairman of the blackstone group economist art laffer apple ceo tim cook and facebook founder mark zuckerberg among others earlier on tuesday the president had chided new york gov andrew m cuomo who is leading a faction of seven governors in the northeast all but one being democrats saying mr cuomo came begging him for help but now seems to want independence that won t happen the president tweeted mr cuomo who earlier had accused mr trump of behaving like a king said tuesday that he won t escalate a political fight with the president the president is clearly spoiling for a fight on this issue mr cuomo said he has no fight here i won t let it happen unless he suggested that we do something that would be reckless and endanger the health or welfare of the people of the state then i would have no choice but mr cuomo said he felt compelled to challenge mr trump s earlier claim that the president has total authority over states california gov gavin newsom who is developing a plan on loosening stay at home restrictions with govs kate brown of oregon and jay inslee of washington said california needs to increase testing and expand hospital capacity before the state can begin to return to normal from the stay at home restrictions he imposed a month ago mr newsom didn t offer a timetable but said he would have a better idea in two weeks if the state continues to see a decline in hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions ask me the question then and we will be in a very different place where we could be more prescriptive he said there s no light switch here i would argue it s more like a dimmer mr newsom said the changes would likely entail modifications to places like schools and restaurants to accommodate social distancing measures the other benchmarks are successfully tracking covid 19 cases through testing and contact tracing protecting at risk populations from infection preparing hospitals for a potential surge making progress on therapeutics and determining a mechanism to reinstitute the restrictions if things start to worsen again we have a state vision but it will be realized at a local level mr newsom said he urged residents to continue to hold the line on our stay at home orders today california has more than 24 000 coronavirus cases and more than 700 deaths out of a population of close to 40 million people though hospitalization rates have stabilized recently the governor said it s unlikely that he would allow large gatherings before september i know you want the timeline but we can t get ahead of ourselves he said i don t want to make a political decision that puts people s lives at risk and puts the economy at even more risk that s the sober reality i want you to know it will not be a permanent state mr newsom told californians he is mindful that the consequences of the stay at home orders have a profound impact on the economy your personal household budget your personal prospects around your future more than 2 3 million californians applied for unemployment benefits in the last month in michigan thousand of conservatives are expected to descend on the state capitol in lansing in their cars and trucks on wednesday for a gridlock rally to protest ms whitmer s decision to extend stay at home restrictions through the end of april the michigan conservative coalition organized the event through a facebook ad the governor who is being touted in the media as a possible running mate for presumptive democratic presidential nominee joseph r biden blamed education secretary betsy devos for the protest i think it is this group is funded in large part by the devos family and i think it s really inappropriate for a sitting member of the united states president s cabinet to be waging political attacks on any governor but obviously on me here at home ms whitmer said this week i think that they should disavow it and encourage people to stay home and be safe the protesters plan to stay in their vehicles during the rally to observe social distancing guidelines the michigan freedom fund which advocates for conservative policies has ties to the devos family but the group s executive director said this week that the fund only contributed 250 for the facebook ad devos family spokesman nick wasmiller said the family hasn t provided any funds or organizing for the protest but understands the frustrations of michiganders as elements of the governor s top down approach appear to go beyond public safety michigan deserves competent governance not baseless attacks he said in a statement ms whitmer who faces a recall movement changed her approach somewhat tuesday by offering praise for amway for helping the state to stock up on medical supplies mrs devos husband dick serves on the amway board of directors amway has really stepped up to help keep kent county families and health care workers safe during this time the governor said i m eager to work with them and every other business that wants to contribute their time and machinery to helping us fight this virus on the who funding mr trump said the u s contributes more than 400 million while superpowers like china where the outbreak began contribute closer to 40 million the president cited the who s lack of pushback to beijing s foggy reporting on the virus in the early going saying it cost the rest of the world valuable time he also cited who s opposition to bans on travel related to the outbreak accusing it of putting political correctness above life saving measures countless more lives would have been saved instead look at the rest of the world he said citing the rampant spread of the virus in europe he said u s funding wasn t put to good use and the who failed to vet and share information in a timely fashion the president also accused the who of failing to contain samples of the virus from china and getting a team into the source country though who ultimately did get a team in with cooperation from beijing mr trump s decision to cut off funding to the public health arm of the u n in the middle of a pandemic is sure to raise eyebrows though the president may resume funding after sending powerful letters to the organization and discussing it with other nations sen patrick leahy of vermont the top democrat on the appropriations committee said mr trump shouldn t be punishing the who for what he called the u s administration s bungling of the public health crisis including the president downplaying the coronavirus early on as no worse than the common cold withholding funds for who in the midst of the worst pandemic in a century makes as much sense as cutting off ammunition to an ally as the enemy closes in he said not wanting to take responsibility as the deaths continue to mount he blames others who could have been stricter with china and called for travel restrictions sooner but it is performing an essential function
