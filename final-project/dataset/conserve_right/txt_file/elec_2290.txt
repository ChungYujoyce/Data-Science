national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge horrifying that s how democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton described gop standard bearer donald j trump s statement in the final october 19 presidential debate fox news channel s chris wallace asked trump whether even facing defeat he would absolutely accept the result of this election trump answered i will look at it at the time he added we ll find out on november 8th i ll keep you in suspense maybe trump wanted room to address a potential bush v gore style virtual tie perhaps involving today s equivalent of hanging chads that is not the way our democracy works clinton snapped moments later we ve been around for 240 years we ve had free and fair elections we ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage in a general election on wednesday night donald trump did something no other presidential nominee has ever done he refused to say he would respect the results of this election clinton told voters in cleveland two days hence now make no mistake by doing that he is threatening our democracy she continued we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship clinton s bodyguards in the liberal media echoed her sentiments cnn s jeremy diamond called trump s remarks a caveat that threatens to cast unprecedented doubt on the legitimacy of the electoral process diamond added trump kept alive a worrying conspiracy theory that his underdog candidacy could be defeated by below board behavior the candidate s reckless closing message that nothing is on the level not democrats not the press not the polls not republican leaders not even the integrity of the voting process has left many of his supporters prepared to declare the election results illegitimate the washington post s dana milbank lectured in an article headlined donald trump s astonishing damaging refusal to accept the fundamental premise of american elections the washington post s phillip bump scolded he s willing to cast a shadow over the process that undergirds the most prosperous stable nation in world history of course within three weeks the shoo in democrat lost to the hopeless republican while trump won only 46 percent of the popular vote to 48 percent for clinton the new york real estate magnate took the tally that mattered with an upset 74 vote margin in the electoral college 306 votes to 232 losing the electoral college but winning the presidential popular vote is an interesting but inconsequential consolation prize much like a baseball team with fewer runs than its opponents but more base hits trump s 57 percent to 43 percent electoral college triumph remains one of the most stunning finishes in american history as members of the electoral college cast their ballots in state capitals across america today it is instructive to recall how holistically hillary clinton her supporters and othertrumpophobes have abandoned the way our democracy works as clinton put it nearly six weeks after the polls closed leftists refuse to accept trump s victory they too often resemble venezuelan street mobs their despicable actions are altogether un american as members of the electoral college cast their ballots across america today it is instructive to recall how holistically clinton and her supporters have abandoned the way our democracy works consider just a few of the countless ways large and small that hordes of hillary s fans and donald s foes bull headedly have rejected the outcome of november 8 s free fair and decisive presidential election not just for a few days but for weeks clinton s supporters marched through the streets and sometimes prevented regular citizens from going about their business many of these protesters bore signs that read not my president and we don t accept the president elect liberals demonstrated that love trumps hate by blocking freeways in los angeles smashing store windows and police car windshields in portland ore setting trashcans ablaze in oakland and otherwise proving that in reality left hates trump a muslim woman named yasmin sewied claimed that three drunks confronted her on a manhattan subway train on december 1 called her a terrorist told her go back to your country tried to grab her headscarf and shouted trump trump sewied now faces criminal charges she lied to the police about this incident which she totally invented sewied had been out drinking with friends and concocted an imaginary hate crime to gain sympathy with her devoutly islamic parents they already were upset that she dated a catholic so as the new york post reported sewied tarred trump fans with lies in a genuine subway assault corey cataldo a 24 year old white man wearing a make america great again hat was attacked on a number 5 train in the bronx on november 12 according to police a 6 foot tall 190 pound black man saw the hat and asked cataldo are you a trump supporter after cataldo said yes the attacker replied great another white trump supporter he then tried to strangle cataldo with his bare hands before fleeing the subway train at 149th street in yet another outburst of political violence david wilcox a white driver in chicago emerged from his pontiac bonneville after a black sedan scraped it on the day after the election i got out of the car wilcox later told the chicago tribune one of the guys an african american at the bus stop said yeah that s one of those white boy trump supporters and i said what s that got to do with this accident i just want to exchange insurance and then next thing i know the guy said don t worry about it we re going to beat his ass wilcox soon was brutalized in broad daylight by blackthugs and repeatedly beaten shoved to the ground kicked on the asphalt and punched in his head one witness to this mayhem which is on video gleefully yelled you voted trump you voted trump daaaaaaaamn others reportedly shouted don t vote trump and you gonna pay for that shit a black man stole wilcox s car and dragged him along its side as wilcox hung on for his life through an open window he finally let go and rolled five to seven times along roosevelt road before stopping in an oncoming traffic lane he was treated for his injuries at mount sinai hospital and released wilcox in fact voted for trump although the racist onlookers to the attack only assumed as much because of his complexion what s happening to america a badly bruised wilcoxaskedthe chicago tribune the next day you re supposed to be able to vote in peace it s supposed to be part of our democracy and what happened is i vote for somebody and i get beaten robbed and my car stolen and i have no way of getting my wife to and from work safe anymore chicago police on november 18 arrested julian christian 26 dejuan collins 20 rajane lewis 21 and an unidentified 17 year old female each faces one felony count of vehicular hijacking police say these four pounded wilcox monisha rajesh a train columnist with the telegraph of london said this via twitter on election night it s about time for a presidential assassination after green party nominee jill stein launched recount efforts in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania hillary clinton s campaign stepped in to support her efforts thoroughly contradicting every consonant that clinton had uttered about the sanctity of losers accepting election results while judges eventually halted the re tabulations in michigan and pennsylvania wisconsin s was completed rather than help stein or clinton the badger state recount revealed 131 additional votes for trump the left has sunk post electoral intransigence to a spectacular and unprecedented new low tampering with the electoral college itself calling themselves americans take action actors including martin sheen and noah wyle appeared in a tv ad supported by a 500 000 media buy they urged gop electoral college members to dump trump the will of their states voters be damned even worse pro trump electors have faced heretofore unseen intimidation by clinton s supporters some of whom placed those electors personal details online the lucky ones have coped only with hostile e mails letters and phone calls often in the thousands it is total harassment said robert graham an arizona elector and state gop chairman as the arizona republic reported on november 18 graham added it started about a week ago now bam it s hardcore an elector told the arizona republic that he has received hundreds of phone calls in an outright political maneuver arizona s sharon geise said that she has received some 50 000 e mails since the election pushing her to ditch trump they just keep coming and coming she told the new york post they re overpowering my ipad others have endured far uglier bullying bruce ash an elector and one of arizona s three republican national committee members told the republic that he has received hundreds of phone calls in an outright political maneuver ash said they demonize me they call me a homophobic an isolationist a bigot a misogynist and an anti semite which is interesting because i m jewish texas elector rex teter received a letter that read may your tombstone and life be a laughing fallacy if you let this evil in the gate i have been inundated with death threats death wishes generally angry messages trying to get me to change my vote to hillary clinton or another person michigan gop elector michael banerian told cnn i ve had people talk about putting a bullet in the back of my mouth i ve had death wishes or people just saying i hope you die or do society a favor throw yourself in front of a bus these people not only called for the burning of myself but my family in pennsylvania according to today s edition of the telegraph the situation has become so serious that some 20 electors have reportedly been assigned plainclothes state police troopers for protection one of them ash khare is an indian immigrant and longtime republican he confirms being guarded by state law enforcement and said that he has received nasty phone calls as late as 1 00 a m i m a big boy khare told the philadelphia inquirer but this is stupid nobody is standing up and telling these people enough knock it off now imagine if hillary clinton had won this election and trump s supporters behaved like leftists democrats how would you like that of course this is an absurd hypothetical republicans and conservatives grumble and grind their molars when their standard bearers lose what they don t do is destroy personal property blockade highways commit arson and terrorize members of the electoral college the right was saddened to see obama beat mitt romney and john mccain nonetheless obama s allies freely backed him in the electoral college without suffering through tv ads and even highly felonious death threats demanding that they vote him down meanwhile when will the fbi and the justice department s voting rights and civil rights divisions start probing and prosecuting these death threats if attorney general loretta lynch refuses to lift a finger incoming attorney general jeff sessions must make this a high priority and a teaching moment for these anti american criminals as low as the left has fallen their rejectionism is far from finished radical cineaste michael moore wants enraged democrats and other election deniers to flood washington next january 20 and disrupt the inauguration this suggests that the last six weeks of leftist fury were just the beginning american liberals never will accept that donald j trump won the november 8 election fair and square all they are saying is they won t give trump a chance get our
