28 april as vladimir putin delivered his latest address to the nation amid the coronavirus crisis the mood was grim we have not passed the peak he warned we are now facing probably the most difficult stage of our struggle with this pandemic after an illusory few weeks in which russia seemed to have avoided the disasters unfolding elsewhere covid 19 had finally begun to hit home by early may russia
