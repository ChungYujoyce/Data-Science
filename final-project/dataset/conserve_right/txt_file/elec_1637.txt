like a nail biter tooting his own horn poll 2014 looks worse for dems than 2010 it s never been worse for president obama in the washington post abc news poll which finds him at a 41 percent job approval rating about 13 points below his standing in the poll at this time in 2010 the year when his party got creamed in midterm elections we ve talked about the tsunami alert for democrats this fall but the sirens are getting too loud even for partisans and wishful thinkers on the left to ignore there is no common measure so predictive of a party s performance in congressional races than the job approval rating of a president of the same party and obama is looking increasingly like a toxic asset for democrats desperate to cling to a senate majority matters foreign and domestic wapo just 42 percent approve of president obama s handling of the economy 37 percent approve of how he is handling the implementation of obamacare and 34 percent approve of his handling of the situation involving ukraine and russia out of pocket the washington post abc news poll was heralded by democrats last month when it showed opposition to obamacare softening and the nation evenly divided on the law that has evaporated support for the law dropped 5 points while opposition remained firm why fifty eight percent of respondents said obamacare is causing overall health costs in the country costs to rise but a worse harbinger for democrats this fall 47 percent of respondents said the law will increase their own health costs while just 8 percent said they would pay less because of the law the post has it right in describing last month s results that finding was more positive for the administration than most other polls at the time democrats saw it as a possible leading indicator of a shift in public opinion but that has not materialized any questions reuters sylvia mathews burwell president barack obama apos s nominee for u s health secretary will appear before the senate health education labor and pension committee on may 8 for the first of two confirmation hearings a committee official said on monday killer stat even as the poll shows voters agreeing with democrats on key issues like increasing the minimum wage and even the overall subject of health care one statistic explains why the majority party may be in even worse trouble than 2010 and it s all about obama registered voters by 53 39 say they d rather see the republicans in control of congress as a counterbalance to obama s policies than a democratic led congress to help support him the main aim of voters would appear to be to block the president s agenda which is kind of the gop s whole jam these days not working as planned in a new poll from the pro obamacare kaiser family foundation 43 percent of respondents were able to correctly identify when prompted that about 8 million people signed up for obamacare but when asked how the implementation of the law 57 percent of voters said it s clear the law is not working as planned while 38 percent said now the law is basically working as intended predictive elements polls like this matter because they may be predictive but are also just as important for how they can sap political parties of the ability to raise money and organize if democrats believe that the senate is a lost cause it would be much more appealing to focus on moving hillary clinton farther left ahead of 2016 or even funding a liberal mayor s campaign than it would be to shove money at a red state democrat whose race may be a lost cause or consider this from the harvard institute of politics survey of millennial voters out this morning less than one in four 23 young americans say they will definitely be voting in november a sharp drop of 11 percentage points from five months ago 34 among the most likely voters the poll also finds traditional republican constituencies showing more enthusiasm than democratic ones for participating in the upcoming midterms with 44 percent of 2012 mitt romney voters saying they will definitely be voting a statistically significant difference compared to the 35 percent of 2012 barack obama voters saying the same baier tracks pressure s on this far out from an election there is a tendency to over read the importance of one poll or another in the grand political mosaic that we all try to decipher every week but a recent spate of polls culminating with the washington post abc news poll out this morning suggests democrats have a lot to fear in six months as president obama apos s approval hits a new low for the poll 53 percent of the registered voters polled thought it would be a good thing if republicans controlled all of congress to counterbalance the administration only 37 percent approved of his handling of the health law and even fewer 34 percent approve of his handle of the ukraine crisis as more polls show similar bad news for democrats we may soon see what fox news first has been telegraphing for

about boeing apos s decision to make a charitable donation to the clinton foundation in the same year that then secretary of state hillary clinton had advocated on behalf of the company apos s sales in russia the question came from david almasi a boeing shareholder and a representative of the national center for public policy research a conservative think tank whose members attend shareholder meetings to challenge corporate executives assuming that building schools in haiti was a key goal of this company apos s philanthropic programs in 2010 why was it so important to support this work specifically through the clinton foundation and not one of the many other reputable independent charities then working in haiti almasi said he asked he called the boeing donation a clear conflict of interest that seemed reckless and unnecessary boeing contributed 900 000 to the clinton family foundation to rebuild schools in haiti in 2010 just months after clinton had traveled to russia where she made what she called a shameless pitch for a state owned company to buy boeing passenger jets boeing won the 3 7 billion russian contract in june 2010 fashion icon oscar de la renta says my beloved

now a word from charles what the secretary of state of the united states has succeeded in doing in what he thought was a private comment is to echo and therefore to legitimize the worst of the libelous claims against the jewish state if there is one minority in the middle east that enjoys the rule of law and protection and democracy it is arabs in israel one out of every five israelis is a palestinian overwhelming they are muslim there are arabs in the government in the supreme court in all walks of life in the universities there apos s actually affirmative action if you are a palestinian in the universities and to compare that in any way with the systematic discrimination against black africans in south africa is truly appalling and hurtful charles krauthammer on special
