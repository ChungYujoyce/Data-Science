apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis opinion campaign 2012 s most fateful decision could be made shortly not by sarah palin or jeb bush or any other republican a listers contemplating a run but by thaddeus mccotter unless donald trump resurfaces politically the fifth term republican congressman from michigan looks like the last reasonable chance that u s trade policy will be challenged or seriously mentioned during the new but rapidly intensifying presidential cycle trade and broader strategies for the global economy aren t indisputably america s biggest policy disasters plenty of competition for that title has been generated by the nation s recession plagued debt strapped domestically polarized and militarily overextended condition still these economic globalization policies deserve special emphasis top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey first although they represent some of the best opportunities for achieving debt free growth and job creation signs of failure keep mounting despite a weakened dollar deficits that actually keep slowing recovery and boosting the national debt are rebounding despite many free trade agreements foreign trade barriers are on the rise too according to two leading international organizations and an all carrots china policy has by all accounts produced a people s republic of china prc that s increasingly closed economically and truculent geopolitically second these globalization policies keep enabling investors businesses and consumers to nullify the effects of even the worthiest recovery proposals whether on the tax spending or regulatory fronts the worldwide pick and choose opportunities deliberately created by trade and investment liberalization enable too many of the benefits of stimulus measures to leak overseas no wonder the loosest monetary policies and the biggest budget deficits in modern peacetime american history have yielded such feeble growth and so few jobs third and worst of all washington s bipartisan determination to stay the trade policy course and even push new deals that repeat old mistakes is helping to recreate the same kinds of global imbalances that collapsed into crisis and recession just four years ago unless mr mccotter or someone similar declares however count on these failures and dangers to be ignored by the 2012 presidential contenders certainly president obama won t raise them the avowed scourge of the north american free trade agreement in 2008 has turned into the strongest white house supporter of the trade policy status quo since george w bush meanwhile liberal democrats disenchanted with these and other obama positions have all but ruled out a primary challenge to the president the other republican contenders and fence sitters periodically complain about growing u s indebtedness to china in particular and chide beijing for regional muscle flexing but they oppose measures that could plausibly staunch the flow of wealth technology and therefore military industrial potential to the prc more broadly they strongly support jumpstarting a trade liberalization strategy that has created far more national debt than exports one partial exception texas rep ron paul a longtime critic of certain trade agreements for undercutting american sovereignty mr mccotter unquestionably would offer a choice not an echo the best evidence is not his trade related legislative record which features votes for and against the several recent prominent free trade deals it s his keen appreciation of the big picture challenge presented by current globalization policies representing a suburban detroit district mr mccotter of course knows firsthand the lasting economic and industrial costs of trade policy blunders but he also recognizes the collateral social damage of gutted communities and broken families and he intuitively understands how mismanaging america s international economic relations can threaten national security whether by weakening defense related manufacturing indiscriminately permitting foreign ownership of critical infrastructure or recklessly enriching china and speeding its technological modernization as a result despite long odds a mccotter like candidacy could improve not only america s safety and well being but its political health it could connect with a vast burgeoning currently voiceless national constituency capable of dropping out of participatory politics even faster than it s dropping out of the middle class and it could again inspire at least some confidence that this
