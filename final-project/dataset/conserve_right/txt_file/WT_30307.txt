tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap an eye toward his 2020 campaign president donald trump is turning to a familiar playbook of exaggerated boasts about economic performance and overdrawn complaints about a race tilted against him he insisted the electoral college gives democrats a big advantage in u s presidential elections making it difficult for republicans like himself to win that s wrong though in 2016 he often described the election as rigged against him trump in fact wouldn t have won the presidency without the electoral college system in which the votes of smaller rural states that tend to vote republican are weighted more heavily than big democratic leaning states like new york and california trump also claimed over the weekend that he s presided over one of the best u s economies ever he s wrong about that too top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens n y gov andrew cuomo s careless cruelty shows in coronavirus nursing home policy gop vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid the misleading rhetoric over the past week came as the

the estate tax has been lifted off the backs of farmers the remains of u s soldiers from north korea are coming home and china is opening its wallet to the u s treasury for the first time in history these claims range from flatly false to mostly so here s a look electoral college trump in part addressing polls finding him lagging some of the 2020 democratic candidates it s always tougher for the republican because you know i don t know people people never cover this but the electoral college is very much steered to the democrats it s a big advantage for the democrats it s very much harder for the republicans to win fox news interview friday the facts actually the electoral college s unique system of electing presidents is a big reason why trump won the presidency four candidates in history including al gore in 2000 have won a majority of the popular vote only to be denied the presidency by the electoral college all were democrats in the 2016 election democrat hillary clinton received nearly 2 9 million more votes than trump after racking up more lopsided victories in big states such as new york and california according to election data compiled by the associated press but she lost the presidency due to trump s winning margin in the electoral college which came after he narrowly won less populous midwestern states such as michigan and wisconsin unlike the popular vote electoral college votes are set equal to the number of u s representatives in each state plus its two senators that means more weight is given to a single vote in a small state than the vote of someone in a large state economy and taxes trump no president has done what i have in the first 2 1 2 years of his presidency including the fact that we have one of the best economies in the history of our country tweets saturday the facts this is one of trump s most frequent falsehoods the economy is solid but it s not one of the best in the country s history trump is also claiming full credit for an economic expansion that began under president barack obama in mid 2009 the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 2 percent in the first quarter of this year that growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under trump growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 while the economy has shown strength it grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 and simply hasn t hit historically high growth rates trump wages are growing and they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past year and 3 8 for hotel and restaurant employees manufacturing workers the blue collars have seen pay rise just 2 2 and construction workers 3 2 trump and to keep your family farms and ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report he said no collusion the report said no collusion abc news interview aired sunday trump the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in his interview with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening republican sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier trump what kind of a rigged deal is this and then on top of it after two years and after being the most transparent in history abc news interview aired sunday trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter iran trump speaking about iranians screaming death to america when barack obama was in the white house they haven t screamed death to america lately fox news interview friday the facts yes they have the death to america chant is heard routinely the chant marg bar amreeka in farsi dates back even before iran s 1979 islamic revolution once used by communists it was popularized by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the revolution s figurehead and iran s first supreme leader after the u s embassy takeover by militants it remains a staple of hard line demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main friday prayer services in tehran and across the country some masters of ceremonies ask audiences to tone it down but it was heard for example from the crowd this month when khamenei exhorted thousands to stand up against u s bullying in one variation a demonstrator at tehran s quds rally last month held a sign with three versions of the slogan death to america in farsi death to america in arabic down with u s a in english north korea trump i think we re going to do very well with north korea over a period of time i m in no rush our remains are coming back you saw the beautiful ceremony in hawaii with mike pence we re getting the remains back joint news conference wednesday with poland s president the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea border wall trump the wall is going up it s going up rapidly we re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year and we just won the lawsuit on the wall fox news interview friday trump by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 400 to 500 miles 800 km but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles 330 km next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china remarks on june 10 with indianapolis 500 champions trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product remarks tuesday in council bluffs the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible cnbc interview on june 10 the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services such as banking tourism and education in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview on june 10 the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics automakers trump all of the car companies you know long before i got here we lost 32 percent of our car industry our automobile manufacturing business to mexico fox news interview friday trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 trump if i put tariffs on as an example mexico you know what would happen 25 all the car companies would move back to the united states because they don t want to pay the 25 fox news interview friday trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated associated press writers christopher rugaber eric tucker martin crutsinger and paul wiseman in washington elliot spagat in san diego tom krisher in detroit
