are being destroyed bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk at the white house trump said the u s has no business in the region and not to worry about the kurdish fighters they know how to fight he said and by the way they re no angels after the house condemnation vote the congressional leaders of both parties went to the white house for a briefing which grew contentious with trump and pelosi trading jabs the democrats said they walked out when the meeting devolved into an insult fest what we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown pelosi told reporters saying trump appeared visibly shaken up over the house vote we couldn t continue in the meeting because he was just not relating to the reality of it she said senate democratic leader chuck schumer criticized trump for not having an adequate plan to deal with is fighters who have been held by the kurds he said the meeting was not a dialogue this was sort of a diatribe a nasty diatribe not focused on the facts republicans pushed back saying it was pelosi who d been the problem she storms out of another meeting trying to make it unproductive said house gop leader kevin mccarthy white house spokeswoman stephanie grisham called pelosi s action baffling but not surprising she said the speaker had no intention of listening or contributing to an important meeting on national security issues trump himself has stalked out of his white house meetings with congressional leaders in may saying he would no longer work with democrats unless they dropped all russia investigations and last january during the partial government shutdown separately on wednesday a letter was disclosed in which he both cajoled and threatened turkish president recep tayyip erdogan last week urging him to act only in the right and humane way in syria he started on a positive note suggesting they work out a good deal but then talked about crippling economic sanctions and concluded that the world will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don t happen don t be a tough guy don t be a fool in public appearances wednesday trump said he was fulfilling a campaign promise to bring u s troops home from endless wars in the middle east casting aside criticism that a sudden u s withdrawal from syria betrays the kurdish fighters stains u s credibility around the world and opens an important region to russia which is moving in we have a situation where turkey is taking land from syria syria s not happy about it let them work it out trump said they have a problem at a border it s not our border we shouldn t be losing lives over it trump said he was sending vice president mike pence and secretary of state mike pompeo to ankara to urge the turks to halt their weeklong offensive into northeastern syria but his remarks first to reporters in the oval office and later at a news conference with his italian counterpart suggested he sees little at stake for america syria may have some help with russia and that s fine he said they ve got a lot of sand over there so there s a lot of sand that they can play with let them fight their own wars more than once trump suggested the united states has little concern in the middle east because it is geographically distant a notion shared by some prior to sept 11 2001 when al qaida militants used afghanistan as a base from which to attack the u s that attack set off a series of armed conflicts including in iraq that trump considers a waste of american lives and treasure the current withdrawal is the worst decision of trump s presidency said south carolina sen lindsey graham who meets often with the president and is one of his strongest and most important supporters in congress to those who think the mideast doesn t matter to america remember 9 11 we had that same attitude on 9 10 2001 senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky said he strongly disagreed with trump and had told the president so but he asked what tools do we have to back up that disagreement turkish troops and turkish backed syrian fighters launched their offensive against kurdish forces in northern syria a week ago two days after trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing the u s from the area turkey s erdogan has said he wants to create a 30 kilometer 20 mile deep safe zone in syria ankara has long argued the kurdish fighters are nothing more than an extension of the kurdistan workers party or pkk which has waged a guerrilla campaign inside turkey since the 1980s and which turkey as well as the u s and european union designate as a terrorist organization trump mischaracterized the progress made thus far by the u s military in carrying out his instructions to withdraw all 1 000 troops in northeastern syria he referred to the approximately two dozen soldiers who evacuated from turkey s initial attack zone last week but cast that as meaning the u s has largely completed its pullout a u s official familiar with planning for the withdrawal of the 1 000 said that they are consolidating onto two main bases but have not yet begun flying out of syria in significant numbers military equipment is being gathered and flown out the official said speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the withdrawal which poses big security risks trump downplayed the crisis that followed his decision to pull out of syria which critics say amounted to giving turkey a green light to invade against the kurdish fighters it s not between turkey and the united states like a lot of stupid people would like you to believe trump said our soldiers are not in harm s way as they shouldn t be trump did impose new sanctions on turkey this week in an attempt to force erdogan to end his assault but he said wednesday it s time for us to come home even as trump defended his removal of u s troops from northeastern syria he praised his decision to send more troops and military equipment to saudi arabia to help the kingdom defend against iran trump said the u s is sending missiles and great power to the saudis and they re paying for that ap writers alan fram darlene supervi
