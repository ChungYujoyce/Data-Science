frontrunner status is in jeopardy all right now on fox news sunday end videotape perino and hello again from fox news in washington there are signs of calm after a turbulent week president trump

wednesday but recovered some losses right now the president is in bedminster new jersey in a moment we aposll speak live with white house economic adviser larry kudlow about reports the white house is trying to reassure key players that the economy is on firm footing but first kevin corke is live with is now with the latest kevin kevin corke correspondent dana thanks to an inverted yield curve fears of the dreaded r word recession are sweeping from wall street to main street but the white house is doubling down on its economic policies completely convinced the u s economy is not just the best in the world it aposs the best bet for american voters in 2020 begin videotape corke if the week that was on wall street earned a letter grade it would get a v for volatility with the dow imitating a roller coaster sliding 1 5 percent a reaction say experts to a number of factors including the u s china trade dispute ongoing unrest in hong kong and the inverted yield curve with longer notes like the 10 year offering less than shorter treasuries like the two year period even as a 30 year yield fell to an all time record low and while they aposre all to are signs of optimism for example retail sales have jumped 3 4 percent from a year ago consumer confidence has fallen 6 4 percent from july trump i will never ever let you down that i can tell you cheers corke undaunted president trump took his message of economic evangelism on the road to new hampshire this week a key 2020 target for the gop where unemployment is low and democratic promises of an economic overhaul have been met with skepticism trump you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401 k s down the tubes everything is going to be down the tubes so whether you love me or hate me you aposve got to vote for me end videotape corke on friday the chairman of the federal reserve jerome powell will make comments on the economy of course he is a frequent target of the president aposs ire they aposll give us a chance to measure the impact on the markets and obviously gauge white house reaction as well dana perino all right kevin corke is reporting live kevin thank you so much and joining me now white house economic adviser larry kudlow welcome to fox news sunday larry larry kudlow white house economic adviser thank you dana appreciate it perino so larry there aposs been a mixed bag of economic numbers this week we were talking just about it kevin showed that the dow dropped then it bounced back retail sales are up job growth continues manufacturing is slowing down is the administration considering any new legislative policies or executive action to stave off what some are saying could be a possible coming recession kudlow well first of all i don apost see a recession at all second of all the trump pro growth program which i believe has been succeeding lower tax rates bid rollback of regulations energy opening trade reform we aposre going to stay with that we believe that aposs the heart of the free enterprise we want an incentive oriented supply side economy providing opportunities for everybody across the board and as your report mentioned look we have blowout retail sales let me just pause there consumers first of all they aposre working the employment numbers are terrific second of all they are working at much higher wages third of all they aposre spending and fourth of all interestingly they are saving even while their spending that aposs about as good as it gets and i notice at the end of the week a lot of the wall street firms have been marking up their economic growth forecasts i think we aposre in pretty good shape and i want to just say you know we should not be afraid of optimism i don apost know what it is everybody wants to talk about pessimism recession crosstalk perino is that why the president kudlow there aposs no recession on the horizon what aposs wrong with a little optimism dana perino i oh you know me i aposm an optimist but i wonder is that why the president called some of the banks on that day on wednesday when it went down is your message from the white house now there is no recession coming and we aposre just calling to assure you that we think the economy is on firm footing and no additional measures are needed kudlow i don apost think additional measures are needed now hang on i want to talk about the ongoing china negotiations we aposll get to that in a moment perhaps we are looking at the usmca nafta 2 0 trade deal that would be very important and would add a half a point of gdp and 180 000 new jobs per year if we get that through again on the trade front a good beef deal with the european union and finally making great progress on japan with respect to agriculture and various telecommunications so those those are new initiatives perino yes let me crosstalk kudlow trade initiatives and we may be doing much better on china is a tough one but we aposll get to that crosstalk perino we will get to china kudlow but i aposm just saying that aposs that aposs the add on the add ons are these potentially pro growth trade deals with china with japan and the eu and north america perino and when you talk about beef and a trade deal with beef you know me i aposm from wyoming i love talking about those kind of a deal deals but i do wonder about an idea that president trump mentioned late last year that would certainly help a lot of people this is what he said in 2018 watch begin video clip donald trump president we aposre going to be putting in a 10 percent tax cut for middle income families it aposs going to be put in next year end video clip perino is that still on the table kudlow well we aposre looking at it tax cuts 2 0 we are looking at all that by the way senator rick scott of florida very smart guy made an interesting idea a proposal on another network last week he said look why don apost we take the tariffs from the china trade and turn those back to the taxpayers in the form of tax cuts that aposs an idea perino that aposs an idea but right now isn apost all that money going to shore up our farmers kudlow well we aposve got room to do that as well i mean look let aposs have let aposs let people keep more of what they earn perino i aposm for that kudlow let aposs let them keep more of what they invest that aposs the supply side of laffer curve we believe in that i can apost say definitively this morning all i aposm saying is there aposs a lot of good ideas to create more incentives to work save and invest look president trump is transforming and rebuilding this economy we aposve done very well in our first two years just short of 3 percent which is kind of a miracle dana because we face severe monetary restraint from the fed seven rate hikes i think they are reversing that now but that was tough going but no i want an open economic freedom and opportunity economy for entrepreneurs large businesses small businesses and as i said again look at the consumer consumers are working the wages are rising they are spending and they aposre saving a lot of wall street firms looked at the numbers last week and they raised their forecast perino so you kudlow so no there is no recession in sight perino you said you wanted to talk about the trade war with china i do too it aposs giving some investors i would say heartburn but china is also taking a hit recording its slowest gdp in 27 years since 1992 here aposs what white house trade advisor peter navarro said this week about that begin video clip peter navarro white house trade advisor the end game is clear to have china stop engaging in these acts of economic aggression that cost us over 70 000 factories end video clip perino but china aposs threshold for pain seems to be pretty high and even president trump acknowledged this week that tariffs could impact consumers and delay that announcement of additional trade tariffs how do you think that this ends and can you assure us that any deal with china makes it possible for companies to believe that their intellectual and proprietary property won apost be taken by them kudlow well that aposs a key point right there that aposs a very very key point we aposre in a kind of a technological war with china and we cannot let them steal our family jewels which is the heart of the american economic growth miracle we aposre the only economy growing in the rest of the world look on china the tariffs have hurt them enormously and as i think you mentioned you got a bunch of the numbers stats coming out of china last week all of them down i think the production number was the worst in 17 years business investment is falling retail sales china is in some economic trouble president trump is using tariffs in order to put more pressure on the chinese economy i think his strategy is in fact working what we did we gave some relief to big american consumer companies for christmas because they had already locked in their orders in dollar terms and prices so we aposre going to give them some relief and exclude them but on december 15th the 10 percent tariff is likely and the rest of 300 billion to take place one other point on china look kudlow axiom better to talk then not talk perino yes kudlow all right that aposs usually the case so so so we had successful teleconference call secretary mnuchin and ambassador lighthizer point number one point number two in that conference call they agreed with the chinese team that their deputies will be meeting by teleconference in the next week or ten days point bullet three if those deputies meetings pan out as we hope they will and we can have a substantive renewal of negotiations then we are planning to have china come to the usa and meet with our principals to continue the negotiations and the talks president trump has said he aposs willing to negotiate he aposs willing to make a deal it aposs got to be the right deal to protect american interests i aposve said a million times the president aposs goal here dana is very simple he wants to defend the american economy and china which has been stealing intellectual property and forcing technology transfers and cyber hacking china has got to play by the rules perino yes kudlow china has got to have lower barriers across the board no more unlawful practices now this can be done over a period of time if they are willing to do it we are willing to talk perino can i ask you kudlow as i said the phone calls last week actually produced a lot more positive news than has been reported in the media and i aposm hopeful crosstalk perino right kudlow in the next week perino a lot of those calls are in private but let me kudlow i beg your pardon perino well a lot of those calls are in private so i take your word that they go better kudlow right right perino of course we aposre not there listening but there are a series of ongoing issues on parallel tracks during this trade war so the administration aposs reportedly going to grant another temporary reprieve for huawei and the president has walked a very careful line about the protests in hong kong there aposs a peaceful one you know that took place yesterday and the united states is poised to sell taiwan 8 billion in fighter jets so that surely is going to rankle china either further and whereas we might be able to separate all of those issues out do the chinese kudlow well yes the chinese are very smart they know quite well look we have to defend the american interests not only our economic interests but our security interests that aposs very very important with respect to hong kong you had another weekend hundreds of thousands of people protesting for freedom perino yes kudlow for voting rights against arbitrary extradition we are on the side of freedom and democracy that aposs president trump aposs view that aposs what america does that aposs part of our idea we want to help hong kong the president has said he aposd like talk to president xi about a peaceful and humane solution to the hong kong story might hong kong interfere with the trade deal well i don apost really want to get there at this point all i aposll say is we don apost want violence in the united states we want a humane ending and if that can happen of course that might bolster the trade deal so i aposll leave that there perino uh huh kudlow but the chinese know full well that trade security hong kong these things are all part of the general landscape and by the by we are protecting our consumer companies you know they got stuck they made their deals with china suppliers months ago perino uh huh kudlow their supply chains their prices so we aposve decided to give our companies this is just for the united states our companies some extra time so they won apost have to jack up prices our goal here is very simple we want to minimize any impact on the american consumers so far it aposs been virtually zero perino yes kudlow i just saw a forecast professor niall ferguson of harvard and now inaudible he resigned he said you know perino yes one of my favorites kudlow china is paying for these tariffs by a ratio of about 4 1 that aposs what we expect to happen perino larry i aposve enjoyed having you i have one last question if you get asked to go do a site survey about purchasing greenland can i go with you laughter kudlow well maybe i aposll run the central bank look it aposs an interesting story it aposs developing we aposre looking at it we don apost know years ago harry truman wanted to buy greenland denmark owns greenland denmark is an ally greenland is a strategic place up there and they aposve got a lot of valuable minerals i don apost want to predict it now i aposm just saying the president who knows a thing or two about buying real estate wants to take a look at a potential greenland purchase crosstalk perino and all i aposm saying is that if you get asked all i aposm saying is if you get asked to go and do a site survey i aposd love to accompany you on the trip and do an interview out there larry kudlow thank you for joining us happy sunday kudlow you know i could make that happen perino ok thank you kudlow i could make that happen thank you dana appreciate it perino bye bye and up next we aposll bring in our center group to discuss how shaky markets and the trade impact republican plans to run on the economy commercial break begin video clip trump we aposre doing this for the christmas season just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on u s customers the tariffs have really bitten into china they haven apost bitten into us at all end video clip perino president trump this week on his handling of the u s china trade war and it aposs time now for our sunday degree jason chaffetz former republican congressman juan williams fox news political analyst anne gearan of the washington post and senator mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff josh holmes anne let aposs go to you how you heard larry kudlow just now he doesn apost think there aposs a recession coming is that the general view of people inside the white house anne gearan the washington post well there aposs a division of opinion within the white house on the economic signs that really have been coming for a couple of months but crystallized over the last couple of weeks the inverted yield curve which we all now know a term i think none of us probably crosstalk perino four more times of someone expanding it to me i heard inverted yield curve and i kept thinking of credit default swaps of apos08 but gearan right exactly we all learned what that was back then and we aposre learning what this is i mean basically it aposs just an indicator in the bond markets which are often an early sign perino we also know that other countries are not going as well china is not doing as well gearan exactly exactly perino and the point is that our economy is ok but are they considering doing anything i mean i brought up that middle class tax cut is that on the table gearan right i mean you invited him to say what the additional steps might be and he responded with a series of existing proposals for trade deals and trade initiatives and said they are considering a tax cut but clearly if they wanted to do that they could have moved on it already there aposs that aposs still under consideration he aposs right our sources tell us that the white house is looking at other ways they can juice the economy a little bit after the stimulus but the trump is running out of options to do that he aposs really already used most of the things that are within his immediate executive inaudible perino so jason what do republicans want the president to do in the economy they wanted him to talk about it a lot leading into 2018 the economy is good in america unemployment is down wages are rising especially for the lower level so what would republicans want him to do now if anything jason chaffetz contributor well i think the republicans in the heartland are actually going after nancy pelosi and the democrats for not passing out perino the deal chaffetz the usmca the deal with mexico and canada is moving it is squarely in nancy pelosi aposs camp and i do think republicans need to turn up the heat o her and say look this deal is here it aposs ready to go farmers want it business interests want it and it aposs really in her camp not donald trump aposs camp he aposs done everything he can to reduce regulation cut taxes perino can they do anything more to put their you know does the president need to put a shoulder behind his deal even more and say we got to get this done chaffetz oh yes yes they need to ratchet it up i mean i aposve been watching what joni ernst and kim reynolds in iowa have been doing they aposve been doing it on the ground grassley is going around iowa doing that but perino but we all know what has to happen from the white house chaffetz but presidential candidates also need to be asked the question and somehow the media doesn apost even ask them that question perino juan the president larry kudlow really wanted to talk about china and the president aposs position is to be tough on china and the democrats position for a long time has been to be tough on china so can they draw a contrast between what the president is doing and what they would dutifully or should even try or just get behind him williams no i mean look i think most americans including democrats want to confront china on their trade policies clearly what they aposve done in terms of stealing intellectual property the uneven playing field for our goods going into china there aposs a need for this but i think trump aposs brutish approach is the problem i mean it aposs not just democrats who say hey this guy is inartful the wall street journal has said that he aposs attack the wall street journal at a rally this week but i think that what you see here is that trump aposs unpredictability dana then risk global recession and you can do that i mean clearly unpredictability is something that really scares wall street because it depresses the likelihood of capital investment which is necessary for stock growth perino so josh is unpredictably an asset or a liability for the president and also for the democrats you know we recover this pretty closely what is there compelling economic message as a contrast to that that president trump is providing josh holmes former chief of staff to senator mitch mcconnell yes well i will start with that piece i don apost think they have one as long as the economy is good everything that democrats in the 2020 stage are talking about are fundamentally opposed to where the american people are i mean you don apost want to restructure an economy that aposs working for most people on the first piece unpredictability i think the answer is both it is extremely good for negotiation purposes and they aposve got china basically confused about how they get out of this because of course their economy needs a solution to this as much as ours does but on the market side of things if not great right you can see markets react to the sort of ongoing lack of clarity about where the off ramp is to china so i think they aposve got to do that the other thing to jason aposs point earlier they have a multifaceted approach to what we are doing nancy pelosi is not going to pass tax cuts for the american people period but she might under enough pressure past something like usmca which will have a huge impact on american consumers williams but i think the trade war aspect to this what i was getting at is not helping we are not winning because look the president has had to delay even the tariffs he firstly says we aposre not paying for the tariffs china is paying well now he says i aposm delaying the tariffs perino but i think they point williams because guess what it aposs going to drive up consumer costs going into the holiday season that aposs not good for americans economy holmes well juan your premise to your initial comments were that everybody agrees that we got to confront china confronting china is not just a clean and easy thing to do you aposve got to do it multifaceted williams i agree crosstalk perino and there aposs also something else so i wanted to ask jason and anne on thoughts on this i what i heard larry kudlow subtly saying to the chinese is that we don apost want to see violence in hong kong we like this would we need this to be a peaceful resolution the president said he aposs willing to sit down i feel like the united states has been sending a message to china for the protesters saying don apost do anything rash chaffetz no the president is in a tight i think he aposs picked the perfect path so far but that is not going away easily that is not just going to suddenly everybody dispersed that is a very tough thing you couple that with selling 8 billion worth of weaponry to taiwan yes that gets under the skin of the chinese leadership but again donald trump is i think he aposs doing the right thing i think most people in the country think all right we aposre finally holding our own and taking it to the chinese and putting pressure on them and i think that aposs a winning position in a political we aposre in right now perino what about just inside baseball a little bit so i think when you read stories about divisions within the white house or different opinions it can sound exaggerated or a little bit overwritten as having worked in one i kind of remember that but how real is it and is it a problem or does it not matter because the president takes all these different points of view and make his own decision gearan i actually think that china and hong kong example is a good one on that because i heard larry kudlow say something there but the president has not and it aposs not so much that it aposs a division of opinions kudlow said we are on the side of freedom and democracy president trump has actually not said the state department has anonymous administration spokespeople have said it perino yes why does that have to be on background gearan thank you it shouldn apost have to be on background but the president actually hasn apost and he views saying much in support of the demonstrators as potentially weakening his hand in the china negotiations and a number of people who work for him disagree with that but they aposre not going to make a big federal case out of it but i think that aposs the level of perino that aposs the level of concern on the hill about that like human rights and democracy holmes well i mean i think there aposs almost universal support for what aposs happening with the protesters and hong kong but i think people have differentiated this administration aposs approach to china with our support for human rights i think we aposve been very clear about that but the issue that we are dealing with on the economic front is incredibly complicated and i there aposs a whole lot of these pieces to this negotiation that we frankly we don apost know perino last quick question for you will senator mcconnell do a big push on the usmca and try to get that trade deal done holmes i think all republicans look i don apost speak for them but i think all republicans should including the president i think everybody at this point really put their shoulder to the wheel perino do you think the democrats will vote for it juan williams yes i mean look the problem is it aposs not that big a difference i you know from what previously existed but just to quickly say her i think that when it comes to the idea of protection is him and nationalism on both the economic sign and terms of reaching out and spreading democratic ideals i don apost think it works very well and i think that we are seeing the consequences that kind of protectionism and the threat this week on the global economy global recession perino all right we aposll give you the last word on that last word for juan we have to take a break we aposll be right back when we come back montana governor and 2020 candidate steve bullock joins me for an exclusive interview after this his week taking on the dnc and a billionaire rival candidate and we don apost mean president trump commercial break perino coming up a 2020 democratic presidential candidate slams dnc debate qualifications saying the party risks letting wealthier candidates buy their way onto the debate stage begin video clip gov steve bullock d mont presidential candidate we aposre getting to the point where we are spending money online as opposed to actually talking to voters end video clip perino montana governor steve bullock joins to discuss right after the break commercial break perino he aposs the only democrat presidential candidate who won statewide office in a trump state in 2016 but that selling point still hasn apost launched montana governor steve bullock into the top tier of the democratic field and bullock is starting to question the dnc approach to this primary and i have him here with me governor bullock thank you so much for being here bullock it aposs great to be with you dana perino you have this you have this lane all to yourself where you are the only one running that won statewide in 2016 and now since governor hickenlooper decided to get out of the presidential race you aposre the only western governor there but even with those distinctions you aposre having a difficult time breaking through what do you think is going on bullock yes i mean i think we aposre still about six months from voters first perino twenty four weeks bullock right twenty four weeks perino yes bullock yes and and really i did get in a little bit later than everyone but what i aposve seen both on the debate stage and out in the field just got back from new hampshire was in iowa before is people want to make sure that we can win back places we lost the michigans the wisconsins the pennsylvanians it also governs with the majority republican legislature they want government to actually get stuff done so some run from outside of the city like i can apost just give plans for press releases or just speeches so someone that has to get things done off of the coasts i think that i will break through perino so some describe you as sort of the biden understudy more of the moderate that and if and there is speculative what if biden doesn apost go the distance is that then a lane that you can move into bullock well and i think that certainly that aposs the case i also think you know i often say that the word progressive at the core of that is progress i aposve actually been able to make progress on health care affordable college investing in education kicking dark money out of our elections so i view myself as kind of in the actual get stuff done that actually matters to people aposs lives lane and i think that aposs what we as democrats need to be focused on perino so the rcp average has you i think at like 0 5 percent but and then there aposs this question about what aposs going on with the dnc and the process you aposve been critical of tom steyer he aposs the billionaire he aposs thrown his had in the ring he aposs on the cusp of making that september debate he aposs spent a lot of money in order to make that happen are you frustrated by that bullock well i am you know there aposs this week two different poles came out that had me at 2 percent still a long way to go but the thought that you could spend 10 million to get on a debate stage i don apost think that that aposs really good for democracy i think well intentioned the democratic rules were to say we need to show that we have small donor you know and small 1 donors perino support bullock but what actually happened then as more and more money gets shifted to facebook ads google so anybody that says spending 10 million to get 130 000 donors demonstrates real grass roots support perino but that aposs not dark money bullock oh no perino like you are concerned about dark money bullock no it aposs disclosed money but we should be actually talking to voters not spending money just trying to get individual donors perino does it matter to you if you make it to that debate bullock you know i aposd love to be on it all of your viewers go to stevebullock com i will but either way as you said 24 weeks and it aposs always the early states that start taking big fields a lot smaller i have something to offer this field that no one else is in and i think that we aposve got to focus on both beating donald trump but also make this economy and things work for everyone perino let aposs move on to the issues this week two congresswoman found themselves in the middle of a lot of controversy over their planned visit to israel and one of your competitors senator bernie sanders tweeted this about this whole controversy if israel doesn apost want members of the united states congress to visit their country maybe they can respectfully decline the billions of dollars we give to israel and then democratic strategist aaron kayak said this the only person who won and got what they wanted was trump no one else was happy about it he goes over the top in attacking them and israel goes over the top in responding and then you force even hawkish democrats to jump to their defense are you frustrated as a democrat that finds themselves having to constantly respond of questions of taking something that has been a long time bipartisan issue bullock yes perino support of israel and now the democrats are on the defense bullock well i think a unfortunate part is and israel is a trusted ally and has been a good friend but i think that president trump politicized this more by tweeting and saying there should be any elected member of congress should have the ability to go to israel and israel should welcome that perino you know those two congresswomen they could have gone on the trip the week before fifty one members of congress went i think it was 30 republicans 20 democrat they didn apost want to go on that trip bullock and either way at the end of the day israel ought to be saying that we welcome members of congress to come to their countries i mean this is look i don apost agree with the things some of those members of congress have said about israel i don apost agree with the approach but that aposs also you know as a trusted ally we should israel should be allowed to have that sort of dissension in the country perino let me move to immigration the trump administration made some news this week although everything the news cycles are so fast bullock because there aposs a lot of news perino it felt it was just last week regarding a new rule addressing legal immigrants and welfare benefits watch ken cuccinelli at the white house in one of your competitors julian castro i aposll get your reaction begin video clip ken cuccinelli acting uscis director through the public charge rule president trump aposs administration is reinforcing the ideals of self sufficiency and personal responsibility julian castro d presidential candidate these are not undocumented these are legal immigrants that have a visa basically scaring them from taking part in any kind of government program even though they aposre legal and they aposre paying taxes end video clip perino already the state of california has sued the trump administration over the public it aposs called the public charge rule and that comes after california had already moved to allow people who are either illegal to get health care benefits what kind of danger do democrats face trying to win national elections by taking these positions bullock well i think there aposs two different things one of which and i even served with ken cuccinelli when he was attorney general like putting him in charge of immigration would be like putting putin in charge of election security right this is not the best inaudible perino so you so you do you disagree with this public charge rule bullock what i disagree with is we aposre using immigration to essentially divide this country no we need to like as a democrat i am for border security i aposm for figuring out competence of immigration reform but i do think that this presidency on ph immigration to not only rip families apart but this country apart perino but this particular rule on legal immigrants and trying to bring people here to this country but not having them be dependent on welfare benefits bullock yes the idea i think behind it is to turn around and say that everyone that comes to this country with documentation wants to make sure that they can succeed and live that american dream so i think this perino that would probably poll at around 80 percent in the country bullock what living the american dream perino yes yes i think bullock yes perino well hopefully 100 percent bullock you sure hope at this point perino but we have some we hope so we have some skeptical i want to talk about the economy president trump has a unique way of recognizing that not everyone loves him he aposs at 53 percent approval on the economy you can see that there that aposs in the gallup poll his overall approval rating is a little bit lower listen to the case he made to voters this week begin video clip trump you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401 k down the tubes everything aposs going to be down the tubes so whether you love me or hate me you aposve got to vote for me end video clip perino i mean i sort of he aposs up there he aposs in new hampshire he only lost that state by 2 700 votes he wants to win it this time around what is the compelling democratic argument bullock sure perino that they can keep the economy better growing better than he has bullock fewer manufacturing jobs created in michigan in his first two years then obama aposs last two perino so how would you change that bullock farmers have lost 200 million in profits how would i change it how i would change what he aposs doing with this economy is really it aposs america first has become america alone when a farmer in inaudible says to me every time the president tweets we lose hundreds of thousands of dollars look we need to be tough on china especially when it comes to tech but what he aposs doing is on the back of perino do you think he aposs not made those farmers whole with you know the payments bullock absolutely not absolutely and i know that farmers in montana aren apost made hole but they also the payments won apost matter if ultimately we do leave lose market share i mean for the president to say japan doesn apost even want to buy our wheat well in montana we grow that wheat that goes to japan what farmers want is to make sure that they have a market they want trade they don apost want aid perino but what about the possibility of for you and we aposve talked about this a little bit before senator schumer really wants to take back the united states senate if you get to a point we aposre 24 weeks out to iowa that it looks like this is not going to be possible for you would you consider running and trying to help the democrats win back the senate bullock you know i will do everything i can to get who we nominate for montana elected it won apost be me i also think as we are having this discussion you know we talk about colorado and texas we should also be talking about states like north dakota and indiana and missouri places that we lost last time so if we really want to make sure that we can be competitive in red states it might help to have somebody that aposs actually won in a red or purple state at the top of the ballot and that aposs me perino you listen to the interview that we had with larry kudlow the white house economic advisor i asked if i could go on the site survey with him to go see if they aposre going to purchase greenland i mean is it that wild an idea bullock well i aposm guessing not since the louisiana purchase that bought the west it is a wild idea and for him to say yes we aposre exploring it i actually put up a website isgreenlandforsale com folks can look at it and find out no you aposre not you aposre perino and you know that it aposs not bullock you aposre not going to be purchasing greenland perino you know as governor you didn apost try to purchase anything in canada bullock no and it aposs another one of these things like where did this come from perino well i well harry truman that aposs where he came from he had the original idea all right governor steve bullock thanks so much for being here we appreciate it bullock thanks for having me perino all right up next the new york times is reporting former president obama told 2020 presidential hopeful joe biden quote you don apost have to do this our panel aposs reaction next commercial break begin video clip trump sleepy joe may be able to limp across the finish line you aposve got pocahontas is rising i did the pocahontas thing i hit her really hard and it looked like she was down and out but that was too long ago i should have waited but don apost worry we will revive it end video clip perino president from keeping up attacks on democratic frontrunner joe biden and elizabeth warren who is climbing in the polls and we aposre back now with the panel jason take a look at this or everybody take a look this is the fox news poll showing where the races is right now for democrats right biden still at the top at 31 i learned a new phrase this week i had never heard before that democratic strategists who talk to voters who are only concerned about electability as in who can beat donald trump they call those pundit voters and electability has never really been a thing that has driven people to like passionately get out there to the polls but has president trump change that calculation for democrats going into 2020 jason chaffetz contributor well i remember during the obama years that was the main theme for republicans who can actually beat barack obama so i don apost think if anything necessarily new what aposs interesting is biden even in just the last 48 hours has kind of reached his hand out again to republicans but you know you aposre trying to get these very progressive left wing voters to vote for you but i tell you that center of the road hey i can get along with everybody in part i think their strategy is to have a clash of personalities one that is more a little bit more calm cool and collective versus you know what donald trump represents but i tell you people like the fight they like the energy in donald trump it aposs contagious perino i know when you watch the rally you can see it chaffetz yes perino and like their once he gets into campaign mode he aposs that aposs like a different level of energy juan weigh in here we talk about biden and being in that electability lane but this week that new york times story that said that president obama has said gosh joe you know he said you don apost have to do this you really don apost are the obama folks thinking that joe biden doesn apost have what it takes to take on president trump juan williams political analyst well i think that aposs a little bit date ph i mean clearly everybody aposs had doubts about his age about failed prior attempts to run for president you know going back to apos16 president obama clearly made it obvious he liked hillary clinton to run for the nomination you know biden aposs son beau had just died and the like but what we aposve seen recently is that the president has met with biden campaign aides and offered them advice especially about social media and the like he just had lunch with joe biden last month so i think a lot of this boils down to sort of leaks gossip you know news stuff but it aposs predicated on something that aposs interesting to me dana biden is consistent as the frontrunner because of the black vote and that aposs predicated on the idea of his ties and service with barack obama the first black president so now you get all these stories coming that says well is is obama really onboard with biden well we have elizabeth warren pumping up bernie sanders a lot of people taking shots at the frontrunner and i think that aposs what you aposre seeing here perino what do you know about that anne in terms of the relationship between obama and biden aposs team not even about the two men but even sometimes it matters what the teammates think anne gearan the washington post yes it does it does matter but in this case i really think that it aposs the relationship between the two men that is more important that very deeply reported new york times piece i urge everyone to read it it aposs a really thoughtful look at a long relationship that has changed many a lot over many years starting with a mutual distrust and even almost dislike between them when they were primary competitors and up to now in which the article shows how obama is on board and has tried to help has been offering advice and how his own view shifted from you don apost really have to do this to being supportive perino right like if you aposre going to do this gearan right and the big question now is when when will he endorse will he endorse perino think that will be i don apost think that i don apost think he will gearan i don apost think he will before perino because he only has one chance to be a kingmaker or a peacemaker if it comes down to a gearan that that aposs a really good way of putting it i mean it would certainly wouldn apost be before iowa and new hampshire perino josh i have to ask you about elizabeth warren her numbers are going up but now you start to hear there aposs a new york times piece you saw josh kraushaar aposs piece this morning that democrats are kind of nervous like well what what if we do nominate her then does that actually help president trump aposs re election chances josh holmes former chief of staff to senator mitch mcconnell yes i mean i think going back to our last discussion electability is in the eyes of the beholder right i mean electability for joe biden is one thing but electability for a more progressive left is another and i think the bottom line the one thing you have to conclude is that the heart of the democratic primary electorate is not with joe biden it aposs with bernie sanders but you aposre starting to see voters after a couple of debates start to come perino and she aposs super organized holmes start to come to the conclusion that perhaps there aposs a ceiling for bernie sanders and the one candidate that has the absolute best case to make at taking his economic progressive economic agenda forward is elizabeth warren i think she aposs getting a bump out of it perino what did you want to say anne gearan i was going to say that you know bernie sanders isn apost doing as well at this point in the race this year as he did you know chaffetz right gearan last time out so that ceiling chaffetz but he was he was sort of a unicorn gearan well the ceiling might be here chaffetz he was a unicorn last time and the problem for the democrats is they all rushed and took over bernie aposs policies gearan and now everybody aposs inaudible chaffetz he aposs not even a registered democrat perino i know in some ways he should have just said mission accomplished i got it all done chaffetz i did it but they aposve they aposve lurched so far to the left i don apost know how they recover in a general election because they aposve got these crazy nutty ideas perino what about steve bullock we just had steve bullock the governor of montana on not being able to break through i said he aposs at 0 5 percent in the rcp average he put almost all of his eggs in the iowa basket he thinks that will bear some fruit if he can stick it out for a while what did you think chaffetz i think he aposs an exceptionally nice guy and i with all due respect i think he aposs you know headed towards if the democrat somehow miraculously won being like the interior secretary i don apost see him going any further than that perino he he has said he won apost run for the u s senate josh do you think that schumer could pressure him holmes well look i mean i don apost know exactly when the filing deadline is but that full effort for both parties happens all the way to the very end you see you know folks like mike pompeo on the republican side people going to work right up until june of 2020 to try to get him in so i have no doubt that they aposll try to do that the problem is for these presidential candidates what we aposve seen recently is it don apost really translate well to them going back you see people start to accumulate these massive liabilities we you know hickenlooper is a good example of this somebody who could have walked into the democratic nomination for senate two months ago now is going to have a real battle on his hands if he wants that perino after those two debates probably not holmes yes absolutely perino what about williams can i perino yes please go ahead williams i just wanted to pop in on on the electability thing because i think that you aposve identified the key issue for democrats i don apost i think democrats are looking for various lanes and candidates and breakout moments perino but is that a mistake to look for electability williams but it aposs all about but hang on but it aposs all about beating donald trump that that aposs the one thing if you look at the polls all democrats buy into and the question is how do you do this and that aposs why we come to elizabeth warren she may be rising but can a woman beat donald trump i mean a lot of people are still hurt over what happened with hillary perino well but hillary clinton won the well the problem for me with that is when democrats say a woman can apost beat donald trump hillary clinton won the popular vote she didn apost win three key states williams that aposs right and who did she lose with white men working class white man in you know michigan wisconsin pennsylvania so chaffetz i don apost think it aposs holmes it aposs not a gender issue williams i wonder that aposs what that aposs just the anxiety on the part of democrats holmes it aposs an economy honestly williams but i i mean her voice they aposll say oh remember hillary clinton aposs voice is this way oh i don apost like the way perino but that aposs going to be true that aposs going to be true for for any of them they all know that panel i would love to keep talking to you in the commercial break we will see you next sunday thank you so much holmes thank you perino up next our power player of the week the master guitar maker turned high tech guru commercial break perino it aposs not easy to have fans ranging from world famous musicians to a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff as we first saw last april it takes someone special like our power player of the week begin videotape paul reed smith founder prs guitars and digital harmonic i aposm rotating parts in my head graphically like a video game and the entire thing with digital harmonics is all math and it was all invented graphically wallace voice over paul reed smith is explaining the remarkable work he does in two different worlds guitars and high tech he aposs a big success at both wallace on camera everyone from carlos santana to u s special operations command wants your products why smith they need a tool to do a job so they can have clarity to make good decisions it aposs the same thing it aposs a tool to do a job wallace voice over let aposs start with guitars because that aposs where smith started prs is now the third biggest electric guitar manufacturer in the u s behind only fender and gibson he showed us one of his top end models wallace on camera don apost wreck your guitar smith i aposm not wrecking anything i aposm not wrecking anything look how beautiful this is wallace oh my oh my smith so when it gets it it aposs clear coated it almost explodes with color wallace voice over smith not only makes them he plays them wallace on camera you aposre telling me that aposs mathematics smith look it aposs art and math mixed and and woodworking and spraying and finishing but for me i aposm rotating the part in my head i can see it wallace voice over which brings us to the second part of our story almost 20 years ago smith and his father who was a retired navy mathematician were working on a synthesizer that turns digital data into sound they discovered they could make it do a lot more than that amplifying information you can apost hear or see smith so here aposs an x ray that aposs done with low radiation it aposs very very hazy all right and we were able to dig the information out of that file so that doctors can see what aposs going on in there and here it is wallace on camera now i can see smith because of our math wallace voice over smith set up digital harmonic in 2015 it now has almost 100 registered and pending trademarks and almost two dozen patents and they keep testing its limits smith for example we sent up a drone at night ok and then we are putting it through the algorithm machine learning is deciding what to do with this thing wallace on camera whoa smith and you can see detail you just can apost see her the fascinating part for me is it aposs in color it aposs not in black and white wallace well the fascinating thing for me is you can see houses here that you didn apost know existed smith the trees and cars and all kinds of things that aren apost there wallace voice over if you still don apost understand how it works don apost worry neither did i wallace on camera how can the computer see it smith because it looks at all the numbers and says oh that one aposs higher wallace so it aposs math smith it aposs math it aposs graphic math it aposs almost like tic tac toe and chess wallace is it fair to say that the u s military and the intelligence community are interested in what you do smith i think the intelligence community is very interested wallace voice over which brings up one final question wallace on camera which is more satisfying for you the music or the high tech smith that aposs not fair you watching carlos santana play on stage playing a prs sorry that aposs good i aposm looking at information that i know no one aposs ever seen before that aposs good too you can apost compare the two that both are good and what aposs the best interview you ever did that aposs not fair end videotape perino since this story originally aired smith has
