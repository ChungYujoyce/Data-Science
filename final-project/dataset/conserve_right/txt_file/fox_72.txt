ican congressman from south carolina says if the president is innocent of russia collusion he and his lawyer should act like it calls for the russia investigation to run its course this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday march 18 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i m chris wallace president trump lawyer calls for shutting down the special counsel s russia probe as the attorney general fires former deputy fbi director andrew mccabe begin videotape sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary we do think that it is well documented that he has had some very troubling behavior and by most accounts a bad actor wallace jeff sessions moves against mccabe as he faces growing pressure from the republicans to appoint a second special counsel sen lindsey graham r south carolina the fbi and department of justice were corrupt in my view when it came to handling the email investigation of clinton wallace but robert mueller continues his investigation ordering the trump organization to hand over documents related to russia sanders we re going to continue to fully cooperate out of respect for the special counsel we re not going to comment wallace we ll discuss it all with congressman trey gowdy a top republican on the house committee which found no collusion between the trump campaign and the kremlin then students gear up for their march on washington is congress any closer to gun in school safety legislation in wake of the parkland massacre dick durbin the number two democrat in the senate joins us plus a big democratic upset in pennsylvania aposs trump country we ll ask our sunday panel what it means for november and about hillary clinton aposs latest take on why she lost all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington we begin with a call from president trump aposs personal lawyer to end robert mueller aposs investigation that just after former fbi deputy director andrew mccabe was fired that decision by attorney general jeff sessions will likely prevent mccabe from retiring today with his full pension mccabe says this is all part of a trump administration aposs war on the fbi and an effort to undermine the special counsel investigation of the president we ll get reaction this hour from republican congressman trey gowdy and democratic senator dick durbin but first to correspondent peter doocy with the latest from the white house peter peter doocy fox news correspondent chris we now know that the fired deputy fbi director andy mccabe wrote memos that have not been given to the special counsel robert mueller about his conversations with president trump who he blames for a termination that jeopardizes his pension even though the fbi s own disciplinary office recommended mccabe aposs firing because he made an unauthorized disclosure to a reporter and then lied about it mccabe says this quote here s the reality i am being singled out and treated this way because of the role i played the actions i took and the events i witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of james comey well president trump just tweeted back about that he said this spent very little time with andrew mccabe but he never took notes when he was me i don apost believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date same with lying james comey can we call them fake memos well an outrage personal attorney for president dowd sees an opening he says this quote i pray the acting attorney general rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the fbi office of professional responsibility and attorney general jeff sessions and bring an end to alleged russia collusion investigation manufactured by mccabe s boss james comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt dossier just end it on the merit in light of recent revelations that statement got the senate minority leader chuck schumer aposs attention he says this the president the administration and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail interfere with or end the special counsel aposs investigation or there will be severe consequences from both democrats and republicans and that is as republicans on the house intel committee end shut down their probe into russian interference in the 2016 election after finding no evidence of collusion between moscow and the trump campaign chris wallace peter doocy reporting from the white house peter thanks for that now let aposs bring in congressman trey gowdy a top republican on the house intelligence committee which this week found no evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and russia to influence the 2016 election congressman i wanted again by getting your reaction to president trump aposs lawyer calling for rob rosenstein the deputy attorney general to end the mueller investigation do you support that rep trey gowdy r s c house oversight committee chair i don apost and i think that president aposs attorney frankly does him a disservice when he says that and when he frames the investigation that way chris if you look at the jurisdiction for robert mueller first and foremost what did russia do to this country in 2016 that is supremely important and it has nothing to do with collusion so to suggest that mccabe should shut down and all that he is looking at his collusion if you have an innocent client mr dowd act like it russia attacked our country let special counsel mueller figure that out and if you believe as we have found there s no evidence to collusion you should want special counsel mueller to take all the time and have all the independence he needs to do his job wallace but congressman it does not appear that john dowd the president aposs lawyer is freelancing is going off by himself here the president has been on a tweet storm this morning i just want to put up one of his latest tweets and for the first time he aposs going after mueller by name here it is why does the mueller team have 13 hardened democrats some big crooked hillary supporters and zero republicans another dem recently added does anyone think this is fair and yet there is no collusion question sir do you think the gloves are off that the president and his legal team are now moving against the mueller investigation and if they go up from tweets to actual effort actual actions to try to stop the mueller investigation what will you and other top republicans in congress do gowdy well i hope that aposs not what aposs happening this is the same bob mueller that just indicted a dozen russians for interfering with our election in 2016 my advice to the president is the same thing i just told his lawyer give bob mueller the time the independence and the resources to do the very job keep in mind chris he didn apost volunteer for this he didn apost start waving his hand and say pick me a trump nominated rod rosenstein is who picked bob mueller so give him the time the resources to do his job when you are innocent if the allegations of collusion with the russians and there aposs no evidence of that and you are innocent of that act like it wallace but if i may sir again there seems to be a concerted effort by the president and his lawyer to go after the mother investigation if they try to shut it down what will you and other republicans in congress do gowdy well i m not sure the house can do a lot we don apost have advice and consent i think the president is going to have a really difficult time nominating and having approved another attorney general it aposs going to be i would just counsel the president it aposs going to be very very long bad 2018 and it aposs going to be distracting from other things that he wants to do and was elected to do let it play out its course if you aposve done nothing wrong you should want the investigation to be as wholesome and thorough as possible wallace now andrew mccabe the former deputy fbi director who was fired late friday night says the reason that he was fired was to undercut his credibility as a potential witness in the mueller investigation i want to put up some of andrew mccabe aposs statement this attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally but to taint the fbi law enforcement and intelligence professionals more generally it is part of this administration aposs ongoing war on the fbi and at the efforts of a special counsel aposs investigation which continue to this day congressman your response gowdy oh andy mccabe has undercut his credibility all by himself he didn apost need any help doing that and i find it richly ironic that he is lamenting that those are attacking the fbi when he himself does the exact same thing it was the fbi who said he made an unauthorized disclosure and then lied about it that wasn apost president trump it wasn apost me it wasn apost a crazy house republicans it was his own fell fbi agents that said he leaked and then lied about it so if he aposs got credibility issues he needs look no further than himself wallace i just want to go on one point and look leaking is improper and the lack of candor some would call it lying to investigators especially under oath it s inexcusable and should be held to account but my guess is most people would think that what andy mccabe was involved with leaking was something against the trump administration my guess is most people don apost know that in fact what he asked he didn apost actually leak he apparently authorized and official to talk to a reporter about was the fact that the fbi wanted to pursue the clinton foundation investigation over the objections of the justice department gowdy yes that aposs right i mean if you look at his statement he was really upset that he is being blamed for ending something and the interesting part of his statement which i ve heard a lot of people talk about is that he was really blaming doj the department of justice who shut down the investigation but you know what chris we don apost live in a relativistic world and you don apost get to pick and choose which rules to abide by and you don apost get to decide when to tell the truth and what not to i m going to withhold judgment until horowitz s report comes out crosstalk wallace we should just say horowitz is the inspector general gowdy right who you know two weeks ago the president was criticizing and now all of a sudden mccabe is criticizing so he is probably doing his job because everyone is criticizing him let aposs wait and see what he found let aposs wait and see what that lack of candor was and then we can judge the fact pattern and the proportionality of the penalty of his losing his pension we can judge all that once we understand exactly what he is alleged to have done but make no mistake the fbi who recommended that he d be fired it wasn t crazy house republicans and it wasn apost the trump administration it was one of his own fellow bureau agents wallace point well taken all of this congressman comes on the same week that the house intelligence committee on which you are a prominent member basically ended your investigation of russian collusion i want to put up one of the key conclusions from the republican members of your committee we have found no evidence of collusion coordination or conspiracy between the trump campaign and the russians gop members also said that while they believe the russians meddled in the campaign they did not believe in fact they broke with the intelligence committee s conclusion that this was an effort by the russians to benefit the trump campaign question why what aposs the basis of your conclusion and you i say collectively republicans on the committee what s the basis for the conclusion case closed gowdy well the basis for the conclusion case closed on no evidence of collusion is that we interviewed north of 70 witnesses and chris i personally have as every one of them give me any bit of evidence you have regardless of whether you believe it and regardless of the source that president trump colluded conspired coordinated with the russians and not a single witness from susan rice to ben rhodes to donald trump jr to jared kushner no one has any evidence i mean folks who were sympathetic to the president and folks who are antagonistic to the president not one scintilla of evidence of coordination collusion conspiracy between trump and his campaign and the russians so i can apost tell you what i don apost know i can just tell you i asked every single witness and every single witness including former obama administration officials had no evidence of collusion wallace but here aposs the one question i have about this congressman i want to put up the sum of the people that you and members of your committee never had a chance to talk to michael flynn paul manafort rick gates george papadopoulos these are some of the central figures in the mueller investigation so without having spoken to them how can you conclude that there was no conclusion gowdy well we can apost talk to them they are all under indictment or pled guilty which is why i say there is no evidence i can apost tell you what four people i haven apost talked to are going to say but chris i can apost talk to them they have a fifth amendment right not to talk to congress i mean steve bannon is not under indictment and he didn apost talk to congress so there s lots of things to blame congress for but us not knowing what people who won apost talk to us or say should not be one of them i don apost know what mueller has found i ve been really very clear leave him alone ph let him do his job i can tell you with the universe of folks that we ve interviewed there is no evidence of collusion that aposs the best i can do i can apost tell you what people i haven apost talked to would say wallace here aposs my only point about this is that the president is using the house intelligence committee aposs findings in effect as grist as a defense to say that there was no collusion and what you aposre admitting is that there were a lot of key members to this investigation who you aposve never talked to so your conclusion is not conclusive gowdy well that aposs why i always say based on the evidence you don apost know what you don apost know and you don apost know what witnesses you haven apost talked to or documents you haven apost seen you look i m disappointed that steven bannon would sit there and be interviewed by a salacious book author but he wouldn t answer our questions i m frustrated by that but executive branch investigations have more credibility they have more tools and that aposs what i think my fellow citizens ought to be waiting for and have confidence in not congressional investigations that are run by guys running for the senate in california who has never met a camera that they didn apost fall in love with that aposs what you should not have confidence in have confidence in the executive branch investigations and if mueller find stuff more power to him but the best i can do is interview the people in front of me and ask all relevant questions and no one has said there was no one has said that there was collusion wallace i want to bring up one final question president trump this week finally imposed sanction on russia for meddling in the 2016 election this after and i know you voted for it congress approved sanctions back last summer in fact the president didn apost even impose all of the sanctions that all of you in congress did authorize him given the opportunity to use back last summer do you think the president has stood up has taken action against vladimir putin or do you wish he had been tougher to him gowdy i think he aposs done a hell of a lot better job than president obama did it wasn apost donald trump who laughed when that romney said russia was our number one geopolitical enemy it wasn apost president trump who handed that awkward reset button to the russians and it wasn apost president trump who said on a hot mike i ll have more flexibility in the second term all of that was president obama so this country can apost be tough enough on russia they tried to interfere with the fundamentals of our democracy i mean their war is not against democrats or republicans it aposs against americans so you cannot be tough enough against russia in my judgment i hope he does more but he did a hell of a lot more than his predecessor did wallace congressman gowdy thank you thanks for your time it s always a pleasure to talk with you sir gowdy yes sir wallace up next reaction from the number two democrat in the senate dick durbin on the mccabe firing the russia probe and the push for a gun and school safety on capitol hill commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway of the chicago river which was dyed green for st patrick aposs day a tradition there since 1962 and joining me now from chicago dick durbin the senate aposs number two democrat senator i want to begin with you as i began with congressman gowdy what s your reaction to the president aposs lawyer john dowd urging the deputy attorney general rod rosenstein to shut down the mueller investigation sen dick durbin d ill senate minority whip congressman gowdy is right we should allow bob mueller to complete this investigation and any effort by the president or his counsel to stop this investigation needs to be resisted on a bipartisan basis wallace well let aposs pick up on that because when i asked congressman gowdy he said basically the house can apost do much about it what can you do if there is if we go from tweets to an actual move to stop the investigation durbin well i ll tell you i think quite honestly chris that if the president reaches and stops this investigation that is a constitutional crisis in this country that aposs been said by democrats and republicans alike and what it means is it would be incumbent on congress on a bipartisan basis to use the tools at its disposal wallace and the tools at its disposal are you talking about passing a law to try and protect the special counsel or are you talking about impeachment sir durbin when you think about the obvious they were two bills before the senate judiciary committee which has been absent without leave on this issue two bills before the committee a bipartisan bill to protect the special counsel we are to pass those bills now this president is engaged in desperate and reckless conduct to intimidate his law enforcement agencies of this country and to try and stop the special counsel that is unacceptable in a democracy wallace i want to pick up on that when you look at what john dowd said when you look at the president aposs tweets when you look at the attorney general firing andrew mccabe when you look at the house intelligence committee conclusion that there was no collusion between the term campaign and the russians what do you think is going on here sir durbin well i could tell you what aposs going on with the house intelligence committee devin nunes and the republican majority has squandered their credibility i respect congressman gowdy but i heard what he said based on the witnesses we have talked to and you gave a long litany of those that they have not even spoken to based on the evidence they have they aposve issued a whitewash and said there was no collusion i don apost know if there was collusion i know bob mueller has access to witnesses evidence and information that i don apost and neither does the house intelligence committee in fairness they should a step back and said let the investigation be completed by mueller and we accept the conclusion wallace all right but let aposs look at the firing of andrew mccabe because this was not a case he talked about listening to gowdy he s right this was not a case of the political appointees of the president going rouge freelancing going off on their own this was the independent inspector general and a disciplinary arm of the fbi the office of professional responsibility that said one that mccabe was involved in disclosing information about an ongoing investigation and that he quote lacked candor even under oath on multiple occasions didn apost mccabe need to be held accountable for that durbin common sense and fairness suggest that congressman gowdy is right let aposs wait until see these reports let s see how they stack up against the facts as we know them and the statements that are being made by mr mccabe but make no mistake chris it was in december that the president trump announced we have 90 days to get mccabe before he retires he put basically a hit on him and said do this before he qualifies for retirement just hours before he would have qualified and left the fbi this action was taken it aposs highly suspicious wallace but the office of professional responsibility the disciplinary arm of the fbi recommended that he d be fired sir durbin what we need to do as congressman gowdy your republican guest said is to see the actual report itself i haven apost seen it neither has he wallace while we are talking about the 2016 election your pal hillary clinton was on a book tour in india this week and she said that while she won in places in the country that are doing well that have high gdp that things are very different for the trump parties here she is begin video clip hillary clinton former presidential candidate his whole campaign make america great again was looking backwards you know he didn apost like black people getting rights you don apost like women you know getting jobs you don apost want to see that indian americans succeeding more than you are whatever your problem is i m going to solve it end ivdoe clip wallace senator is that helpful to democrats in 2018 to have hillary clinton dismissing the 60 million plus voters who supported and elected donald trump dismissed some could even say condemned as racists and misogynists durbin no it aposs not helpful at all in fact my friend hillary clinton is wrong thirty percent of the people that voted for donald trump had voted for president obama why the same people who look for change with president obama thought there wasn apost enough as far as their personal lives were concerned and they supported donald trump that is a reality the democrats acknowledged that aposs why we are focusing on issues to address this concerned they have about the economic insecurity that many working families face i can tell you a tax bill that gave tax breaks to the wealthiest people in america and the republicans and president trump is not responsive to that concern wallace heidi heitkamp one of your senate democratic colleagues who is running for reelection in at the red state of north dakota said hillary clinton can apost go away soon enough is she right and should hillary clinton go away durbin well i can tell you hillary clinton like every american has the right to express her point of view and she obviously gets press coverage but we are moving onto the next chapter in american history we have new democratic leadership and more people inspiring to be candidates in 2020 it will be a different cast of characters completely wallace i want to turn to your day job hundreds of thousands of students are marching on washington next saturday marching on cities across the country demanding gun and a school safety but as we sit here right now more than a month after the parkland school shooting massacre congress all of you and i mean that collectively republicans and democrats have done almost nothing haven apost you failed these students durbin no and i ll tell you why the democrats are prepared to move forward we have said to the students and to america we are support in universal background checks the republicans have not said that the president has reversed his position as usual on this issue within a matter of days we have also said that we need to do something about these high capacity magazines and that assault weapons that are being used to kill children in classrooms we try to make it abundantly clear that we believe there are ways to plug the loopholes in our current system to stop those who are mentally unstable and those who are disqualified from coming into possession of firearms the senate judiciary committee which i m proud to serve on has been absent without leave i challenge the chairman of the committee this week for goodness apos sakes this is our jurisdiction why aren t we holding a hearing on universal background checks so far he aposs refused wallace well let me ask you to think that house republicans had passed that are on the plate in the senate having passed the house one is a school safety bill one is to improve the background check system would you support those durbin i can tell you this chris seventeen lives in florida in at that are worth more than the proposals that have been made by the republicans it aposs a weak soup let aposs do something that will make america safer listen we have a situation here in chicago captain paul bauer unned down in the loop in chicago a brave man who gave his life to defend this city the gun that was used to kill him was a gun that was commerce sent in commerce without background checks on two different occasions what they have proposed in the house would not even touch that reality let s pass a universal background check that would work wallace i understand that it aposs not as far as you want to go but it aposs something that would pass are you willing to pass that or is it your feeling that this just lets republicans off the hook and as a result you re going to end up with nothing durbin about once every eight years we get around to this issue now is the time to do something significant stop the political posturing and going just a little step with a toe in the water let aposs do something that will make america safe it isn apost safe if you can buy a gun over the internet without a background check it isn apost safe that you can buy a gun at a gun show without a background check america understands that ninety seven percent of americans support it even gun owners support it but the republican leadership in at the house and senate have stopped us from bringing that measure to the floor wallace all right i got about a minute left and want to talk about one more subject because we are back here again next friday the government once again runs out of money in the effort to pass a spending bill that will keep the government funded until october 1st democrats are saying they are not going to use the leverage of passing that bill to try and get a daca fix is that true if that is true if you want to insist on a daca fix as part of that spending bill aren apost you the the democrats abandoning the dreamers durbin president trump was the one who abolished the daca program on september the 5th president trump has rejected six different bipartisan proposals to pass a law and solve the problem he created he is the key to solving the daca problem i have spoken to the leaders of both sides of the aisle house and senate begging them to do something into it now for daca even included on the omnibus bill but the president aposs approval to move forward is critical for the republicans crosstalk wallace but yes or no are you going to insist on a daca fix as part of this bill or are you going to let the bill passed avoid a shutdown and do nothing about daca durbin we re not going to have a shutdown but i m urging the leaders to basically come together and understand there is an emergency at hand here 780 000 young people have their lives hang in the balance because president trump killed the daca program we have to move on a bipartisan basis to put it back in business wallace senator durbin thank you thanks for joining us always good to talk with you sir durbin good talking to you wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss the latest developments in the russia investigation and talk of more turmoil in the trump s staff and cabinet plus what would you like to ask the panel about continuing shake ups in the white house just go to facebook or twitter at fox news sunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up democrat conor lamb declares victory in pennsylvania aposs special election begin video clip conor lamb d pennsylvania congressman elect we went everywhere we talked to everyone we invited everyone in end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel whether democrats can use the same strategy to win back the house in november coming up on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip sen lindsey graham r south carolina and i aposve come away believing that it was shoddily done that there were conflicts of interest that there was political bias that may have resulted in giving clinton a pass and the reason we want a special counsel is i think crimes may have been committed end video clip wallace republican senator lindsey graham calling for a second special counsel to investigate alleged corruption in the fbi aposs handling of both the clinton and trump investigations and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove charles lane of the washington post fox news analyst marie harf and former republican congressman jason chaffetz congressman it seems to me that the big story this week and and in fact i think for the last several weeks has been a fight for control of the larger narrative the republicans say the big story is what the fbi did democrats say the big story is what donald trump did what do you think the big story is jason chaffetz fox news contributor i think it aposs yet to be written because i think the inspector general michael horowitz his 450 employees that work there is about a week or two away from actually having a final report and that will sort of dismiss every other narrative that aposs out there because the one with the most credibility is still yet to be written and that will be the inspector general and you aposve seem part of that play out but when you ask a democrat what aposs the single best piece of evidence that donald trump colluded they don apost have anything nothing wallace so what what about you say the single best piece of evidence or the single big story is the inspector general what about the special counsel chaffetz well i think that is the and you saw trey gowdy fully support mr mueller and i i think that is the right decision i don apost think what donald trump aposs attorney is doing and saying helps the situation as trey gowdy pointed out if you aposre innocent act like you aposre innocent and and doing these calls to get rid of the special counsel at this point when it was appointed by somebody that you appointed rod rosenstein i don apost think plays well wallace chuck are republicans whether we aposre talking about the president the president aposs lawyers some republicans on the house intelligence committee are they trying to short circuit the mueller investigation and if if the fbi was as corrupt and biased as there aposs some evidence it was should that maybe happen charles lane fox news contributor well obviously if we have a corrupt fbi yes something something should be done about that but i don apost think we do have a corrupt and biased fbi at least that aposs not the fundamental problem if any with the mueller investigation going back to what congressman chaffetz just said when this whole thing began when the mueller investigation began i thought ok donald trump has just gotten a break now the whole thing can be the whole issue can be parked over here with this independent guy and allowed to run its course and he can move on to other things but from the beginning he has been refusing to accept that break so to speak and instead has cast doubt on its integrity has repeatedly raised the prospect that he will in some way as you say short circuit it fire robert mueller et cetera et cetera it aposs a great mystery unless one of two things is happening and i hate to make political analysis amateur psychology he just can apost control himself or two there aposs some political benefit to him from doing this that in some way this plays well to his base and will help his prospects wallace but but what about the fbi component of it as as as has been pointed out repeatedly now this wasn apost jeff sessions lane right wallace just going off on his own on mccabe lane right wallace this was the inspector general and the office of professional responsibility it wasn apost jeff sessions who wrote the peter strrzok lisa page memos texts it was they these two lead fbi officials i mean there clearly was a problem of bias inside the fbi lane there aposs something not kosher going on in the fbi i think the strongest piece of that is this mccabe piece because we have an independent body as close as you can get in this town these days saying andrew mccabe made a mistake and he deserved to be fired he can apost get around that i just think there aposs a there aposs a there aposs two separate buckets here one is whatever may have been going on with the clinton investigation which was the substance under the andy mccabe stuff and you know peter strzok aposs potential bias in that and so forth and so on and then over here a whole other narrative which is russia and mueller and i don apost think they necessarily cross cross each other wallace karl what do you think of the president aposs personal lawyer yesterday going out and calling for shutting down the mueller investigation and what do you think of the president today just a tweet storm of attacks against by name the mueller investigation karl rove fox news contributor yes i took john dowd aposs statement as client management managing his client president trump by making by saying bad things about mueller making his client feel good the president aposs tweets today are not useful i agree with congressman gowdy if you aposre innocent act innocent and we have every bit of evidence thus far is is that there is no evidence of collusion conspiracy or coordination with the russians and the president is about ready to have two big things handed to him that are enormous one is the outcome of the inspector general aposs report on the handling of the clinton investigation which i think is going to show real problems inside the fbi in the handling of the e mail investigation and that will put the the democrats on the defensive and the president on the offensive and second of all the the office of professional responsibility acting upon a referral from the independent inspector general say mccabe ought to go the president should have been quiet with that and let let that information soak in on its own without looking without gloating and without tweeting the president can be on the can can benefit from this by withdrawing himself from it not by by rubbing his by grabbing it and holding it close to him and screaming and shouting via tweet that that he aposs he aposs moving forward wallace another big story this week was the firing and it aposs amazing to think it happened this week the firing of secretary of state rex tillerson and rampant rumors about a quote bloodbath in the white house and the trump administration we got this on twitter from lee geller i aposd like to know why is it such a bad thing i think as a businessman he the president expects results and if something isn apost working he changes it isn apost that exactly what the people voted for someone from the outside to shake things up marie how do you answer lee and how do you feel as somebody who used to work in the state department under a different secretary how do you feel rex tillerson was treated marie harf fox news analyst well i think that some chaos is you know it aposs helpful because you can get your people in the president has the prerogative to do that this is not normal turnover and this level of chaos people getting fired on twitter not knowing if the chief of staff will be there next week is not helpful for governing i think at the state department a lot of my former colleagues are happy to see tillerson go they know he was not close with the president he also didn apost do a lot to endear himself with the workforce he didn apost really invest in it on the other hand they aposre a little worried about pompeo because he has expressed hawkish views on things like the iran deal he hasn apost put a lot of credibility in diplomacy historically so in his confirmation hearing they will be looking to seeing whether he actually wants to be a diplomat or whether he will continue down this more hawkish route i i think people still have a bit of an open question about pompeo at the state department wallace you sound like you want to say something chaffetz well i i thought it was poor form you have somebody who aposs the secretary of state has put his whole career on the line to serve as the secretary of state harf right chaffetz and i don apost think you should be on the receiving end of a tweet harf right chaffetz to saying that you aposre dismissed at the same time i do believe that the president you want to have somebody who aposs reflective of the president and mike pompeo fits that bill he served with us in the house a lot of people on capitol hill believe him trust him i think he aposs done great things at the cia and i think he will be a marvelous and and and great secretary of state wallace i was going to say the and excuse me for this but the striped ph pants group at the state department might not like what pompeo says about iran but what he aposs saying about iran is what the president aposs saying about iran right chaffetz he will be reflective of the president harf that that aposs right but i think it aposs clear to all of us that president trump is surrounding himself with people that he aposs more ideology aligned with especially on foreign policy that will also be true if he wallace well isn apost that what president aposs do harf well sometimes they like the sort of team of rivals model if he gets rid of h r mcmaster who aposs more of a mainstream republican foreign policy seeker and replaces him with someone who aposs a little more hawkish i think it will show that the policy may be changing in the next year of the administration wallace speculation was so rampant about major turnover there was talk about the chief of staff about the national security advisor three of four cabinet members that white house spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders had to put out this statement begin video clip sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary the the staff i actually spoke to a number of staff this morning reassuring them that there were personnel changes no immediate personnel changes at this time and that people shouldn apost be concerned end video clip wallace karl as someone who worked in a white house have you ever seen anything like this and does it matter rove it does matter because the president wants to have people focused on their jobs and not worried about losing their jobs and they wanted to also be felt that they aposre being treated with respect the fact that john kelly calls the secretary of state on friday night and says there aposs going to be a change and the changes is made by tweet on tuesday morning and the president finally calls a secretary at noon from air force one and says thanks for your service is troubling i mean and not only that but it aposs troubling for the administration the president said he wanted to make this change because of the upcoming meeting with korea so he could have a new face in place by the time of the meeting with korea does anybody think that mike pompeo is going to be confirmed by the united states senate in a matter of five or six weeks no the democrats are going to use this as an opportunity to make the administration bleed and and even more so given the way that it was done and the president could have done this in a different way after the meeting in may he could have had pompeo deeply involved in the preparations for the meeting done it in a way that made it more attractive for people to come into service by announcing it in a rose garden ceremony with tillerson and pompeo standing with him complementing tillerson for his service and acknowledging the new role that pompeo is going to have instead we get it all done by tweet and it doesn apost look good lane this is the alternative universe but donald trump has shown repeatedly he doesn apost like being handled and i think some of the people he aposs pushing out now are people he perceives as people like tillerson who were opposed upon him by the republican establishment to handle him rove well and we aposre also seeing him fire people using the methods he used on the apprentice which mat work for reality tv but not good for government wallace all right well it aposs pretty good for television all right panel we have to take a break here when we come back a dramatic upset in pennsylvania aposs 18th congressional district what does democratic conor lamb aposs win signal for the midterm elections and hillary clinton is still expanding her loss to donald trump and people in her party can apost run away fast enough commercial break begin video clip connor lamb d pennsylvania congressman elect it took a little longer than we thought but we did it paul ryan r wis speaker of the house i think the candidate that aposs going to win this race is the candidate that ran as a pro life pro gun anti nancy pelosi conservative end video clip wallace democrat conor lamb declaring victory in pennsylvania aposs special election this week and speaker paul ryan trying to dismiss the shocking defeat for republicans and we aposre back now with the panel karl republicans are offering all kinds of excuses for conor lamb aposs apparent victory in pennsylvania 18 he ran as a republican the republican candidate rick saccone was a lousy candidate in the end how big a deal is the democratic victory in this very red district rove well it aposs a big deal and and look we can i accept a lot of them we had a terrible candidate and they had a candidate who aposs not likely to make it through the democratic primary this year anti gun control pro life said he wasn apost running against donald trump a marine a prosecutor culturally conservative but republicans had better uses this as a wake up call and make sure that that every one of their candidates does everything better this year from raising money having a constructive message that it aposs not i mean rick saccone ran as trump 2 0 that only works if your opponent is hillary 2 0 and so and republicans have got to do everything better this year the good news for republicans and the only good news is that we aposre not likely to see many conor lamb aposs nominated by the democrats and this was an open seat republican incumbents will run better and of the 23 seats held by republicans that were won by hillary clinton in 2016 17 of those 23 are running for re election so an open seat race like this is more problematic an incumbents can and should have the advantages of incumbency to help them win across the board wallace chuck reporters as you know love to read the tea leaves of a special election like this and project what it aposs going to mean to the november midterms but are are we making too much and this isn apost the only one you had the virginia governor aposs race you had the alabama senate race now you have this pennsylvania special election how significant is it in terms of what it portends for november i mean is it just a one off or do you think we may be headed for a democratic wave lane well don apost forget we aposve also had a lot of down ballet state legislature special elections that have gone the democrats way i would put it this way the advantages with the democrats just by the normal rules of politics it aposs a midterm in a president aposs first first four years and then when you add to that all the negatives that trump self inflicted negatives that he aposs imposed his low approval rating and so on you aposd have to say that the wind is at the democrats apos back you know there aposs a similarity here and in a funny way with the 2010 election that barack obama faced he won with a coalition that was very much attached to him and when he was not at the top of the ticket anymore democrats didn apost do so well we aposre going to see if the same kind of phenomenon plays out here where if donald trump himself is not at the ballot can a lot of these republicans nevertheless get into congress i think the senate by the way is looking a lot better for the republicans we aposre we aposre only talking i think if there aposs going to be a blue wave it will be limited to the house wallace yes we should point out if democrats pick up 24 seats correct they take back control of the house which would be interesting because you aposve got conor lamb and a lot of other democrats now saying they wouldn apost vote for nancy pelosi as speaker all right meanwhile hillary clinton is back at it she was on a book tour in india and continuing to explain why she lost and here aposs why she said she didn apost do well with white married women begin video clip hillary clinton d former presidential candidate part of that is a an identification with the republican party and a a sort of ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband your boss your son whoever believes you should end video clip wallace marie is it just me or is that kind of a curious analysis from a feminist that women white married women were browbeaten by the men around them harf yes you aposre right and she should go away i hate to say that i really do the first female nominee of a major party has an historical you know role certainly and the right to speak up she is not helping the democratic party and i think she should take a very long vacation and leave the future of the party to other people i think the future of the party is not with her and the clearest indication of that is the fact that in the 20 special elections that have taken place so far in 2018 democrats on averaged have gotten 24 more points than she did the party of the future is not hillary clinton aposs party and i get why she wants to keep explaining it but it is not wallace you say you get why she aposs explaining what aposs going on here do you think it aposs just bitterness do you think she aposs just a sore loser harf you know i wouldn apost use that term but i think this was a hard fought competition rove i would harf and i think most people including most republicans didn apost think she was going to lose so i aposm not going to psychoanalyze why she keeps giving excuses for it and there aposs probably a time and place for that but it aposs not what mitt romney did it aposs not what john kerry did it aposs not what al gore did and if your goal is to help the party and help us understand how to get white working class men and women back in the midwest this is not helpful to that cause wallace congressman chaffetz as marie says she should go away i assume you aposd like to see hillary clinton keep talking all the way to november chaffetz she she can stay as long as she wants look as long as the democrats have hillary clinton you sucking out all the oxygen in the room putting up nancy pelosi and chuck schumer then the enthusiasm gap which i think is the intangible in these races it shrinks because it fires up republicans when they hear hillary clinton and nancy pelosi it reminds them why they aposve got to fight so hard day in and day out to get more republicans elected wallace karl at least two democratic senators running for re election in red states claire mccaskill in missouri heidi heitkamp in north dakota distance themselves from clinton as fast as they could are clinton aposs comments just good copy that we enjoy talking about on a sunday show or could they really hurt republicans democrats running in red states that donald trump won karl look they have hurt and they will continue to hurt because they aposre representative of the identity politics that aposs infected the democratic party does anybody really think that barack obama after talking about the bitter clingers people who cling to their guns and their religion that this is not a problem that is endemic inside the leadership of the democratic party there aposs a reason why they aposre no longer viewed by the you know by ordinary americans in flyover country as the party of the little man and the little women it aposs because they aposre elitist the democratic party is dominated by a mindset that says those people the deplorable people the people who are religious the people who have values different than us the people who live in flyover country and the people who don apost understand why it aposs important that people have the right to take a knee at a football game i mean all of these you know this is a problem democrats have had growing for years and she her comments are over the top but they aposre representative of a problems that aposs going to remain even if she shuts up and for one i hope she continues to talk out but even if she doesn apost the problem is still going to remain that that aposs the mindset of the democratic of a large swath of the leadership in the democratic party wallace you aposve got 15 seconds harf the candidates the democratic party is running in 2018 are not representative of that identity politics it aposs not just conor lamb it aposs across the country i think the party has learned a lesson from 2016 rove let me give you harf that aposs my prediction rove let me just give you one quick wallace all right we aposre running out of time real quick rove one wallace five seconds rove twenty third district of texas one democratic nominee is gina ortiz turner ph wallace ok rove who has never used the word ortiz ever in her professional life and probably do
