association said on fox business network like many u s industries still in the dark on where exactly the trump administration s tariffs will land mr helfenbein said he hoped the tariffs wouldn t hit his sector trade moves the china decision came close on the heels of a string of other trade moves to implement mr trump s america first economic agenda and reverse what he sees as decades of misguided u s trade policy promoting open markets and multilateral trade agreements the administration announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports this month although a number of markets including canada mexico the european union south korea and australia will be exempted initially from the tariffs mr trump since the beginning of the year has put tariffs on chinese solar panels and south korean washing machines a week later china s biggest maker of solar panels announced plans to open a u s factory the u s is also locked in lengthy talks with canada and mexico over mr trump s demand for a renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement the president has vowed to leave the 24 year old pact if a new agreement is not reached commerce secretary wilbur l ross jr a prime advocate of the tariffs acknowledged that china was likely to retaliate against american companies many expect beijing to target states where the president is most popular but mr ross played down the prospect of an all out trade war we will end up negotiating these things rather than fighting over them in my view mr ross told bloomberg news with u s companies long complaining about china s failure to protect foreign investors intellectual property rights the president s order focused on technology imports but the list of items subject to the tariff could expand to include such items as clothing and shoes the tariffs are being imposed under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 that authorizes the president to take action or retaliation against unjustified unreasonable or discriminatory foreign trade laws that hurt u s commerce they are part of a package of measures to combat beijing s aggressive trade tactics including forced intellectual property transfers for u s companies as the price of doing business in china the actions included adding 25 percent to tariffs on products supported by china s unfair industrial policy including aerospace cellphones computers and machinery opening a world trade organization case against china s discriminatory technology licensing practices new restrictions on chinese companies buying into u s technology business at the white house signing ceremony mr trump was surrounded by former top national security officials and ceos from defense companies raytheon lockheed martin general atomics and leidos lockheed martin ceo marillyn hewson called it a very important moment for our country we are addressing what is a critical area for the aerospace and defense industry and that is protecting our intellectual property she said that is the lifeblood of our companies and so we very much welcome this action on the part of the trump administration and the president of the united states corporate angst u s trade representative robert lighthizer who spearheaded the action against china said the trump administration was moving to protect america s future technology is really the backbone of the future of the u s economy he said still leaders from many business sectors overwhelmingly opposed the tariffs and warned that it would be a tax ultimately paid by u s consumers the internet industry has serious concerns with the impact of these tariffs and potential retaliatory actions on american jobs consumers and the digital economy said melika carroll of the internet association an industry lobbying group the business roundtable an association of ceos from the biggest u s companies said in a statement that the trump tariffs will only raise prices in america make american companies and products less competitive and harm u s workers and consumers mr trump brushed aside the concerns emphasizing that america s 800 billion trade deficit with the world could not be allowed to continue mr trump said other trading partners such as south korea and the european union were begging to make deals in the face of his tough trade policies the u s trade deficit with china topped 375 billion last year but mr trump cited calculations that put it over 500 billion he said the tariffs which do not take effect immediately had already brought beijing to the negotiating table since taking office mr trump has been pressing chinese president xi jinping and other top officials to rein in unfair trade restrictions and lower the trade deficit by 100 billion we are in the midst of very major and very positive negotiations the president said but pulling the trigger on tariffs could pressure mr xi to respond at least as hard to show his own governm
