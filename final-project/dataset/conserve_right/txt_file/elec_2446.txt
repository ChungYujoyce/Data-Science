Andrew Yang shifts blame to Trump for Iowa Democratic caucus debacle

Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang ripped President Trump after the voting app commissioned by the Iowa Democratic Party to count Democratic caucus voters experienced a technological error.

"It might be helpful to have a President and government that understand technology so this sort of thing doesn’t happen," tweeted Yang.


Yang, 45, made a name for himself in the tech industry and has established himself as the most comfortable presidential candidate when speaking on topics of tech and automation. His cornerstone universal basic income plan would guarantee $1,000 a month to every adult in America.

Late-night scenes from Iowa showed agitated campaign officials and voters awaiting word on the results but being told it could be hours before the votes are tabulated. The Department of Homeland Security said the Iowa Democratic Party refused to allow them the ability to test the failed app, which was coded by a company called Shadow Incorporated.

“No one hacked into it, so this is more of a stress or load issue, as well as a reporting issue we’re seeing in Iowa," said acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf in an interview with Fox on Tuesday morning.

Federal Election Committee filings show that former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign paid more than $20,000 to Shadow Incorporated on July 23, 2019, for "software rights and subscriptions."
