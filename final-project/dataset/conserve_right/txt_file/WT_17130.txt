talk about it or not north korea is a big world problem and it s a problem we have to finally solve people have put blindfolds on for decades and now it s time to solve the problem he said at the white house north korea poses one the sternest national security challenges facing the 3 month old trump administration the administration has settled on a strategy emphasizing increased pressure on north korea with the help of china rather than trying to overthrow kim jong un s isolated government or use military force but senior officials have repeatedly said that all options remain on the table china is a traditional ally of north korea and fought on its side in the 1950 53 korean war those ties have frayed but beijing remains the north s economic lifeline the xi trump call on monday morning beijing time was the second time the two leaders have spoken by telephone since meeting in florida earlier this month xi told trump that china strongly opposes north korea s nuclear weapons

to do something she praised china s increased pressure on north korea asked about the threshold for u s action haley told nbc s today that if you see him attack a military base if you see some sort of
