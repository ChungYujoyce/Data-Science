apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic former vice president joseph r biden is increasingly taking fire from his left flank over issues including the iraq war and consumer protections as rivals sens bernard sanders and elizabeth warren try to wound him in the run up to the kickoff caucuses in iowa mr sanders hammered mr biden for talking in the past about cuts to entitlement programs helping lead the effort for the 2003 invasion of iraq and voting for disastrous deals such as the north american free trade agreement you think that s going to play well in michigan or wisconsin or pennsylvania mr sanders a vermont senator said on cnn if we re going to beat trump we need turnout and to get turnout you need energy and excitement and i just don t think that that kind of record is going to bring forth the energy that we need to defeat trump top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time it was arguably mr sanders most direct and extensive attack on mr biden until now the senator from vermont has more often put president trump in the crosshairs and campaigned on general themes of soaking the rich and cracking down on big corporations democratic party strategist hank sheinkopf said taking on mr biden is a smart strategy for the other candidates at this stage of the primary race they ve got to try to mess up his hair before iowa and to make sure that he s less competitive in new hampshire he said mr biden s performance on the campaign trail has been heavily criticized but primary voters have not settled on a clear alternative generating a renewed sense of urgency among the other top contenders to kneecap him ms warren a senator from massachusetts laid out a proposal tuesday to try to make it easier for debt ridden americans to seek bankruptcy she clashed with mr biden on the issue more than a decade ago when she was a professor she didn t mention mr biden by name but she complimented several democratic senators including minority whip richard j durbin of illinois for siding with her on the issue in the past ms warren noted in a medium post that a 2005 bill supported by mr biden that made it harder for certain consumers to declare bankruptcy passed with overwhelming republican support and some democratic support the progressive change campaign committee a liberal advocacy group backing ms warren said she has a clear record of corporate accountability and is the most electable democrat in the presidential field when thinking about electability it would be complete malpractice to nominate someone who conspired in backrooms for years with credit card lobbyists and voted for every corporate bankruptcy bill wall street deregulation and trade deal that voters hate said committee co founder adam green biden would ironically cede the outsider mantle to a corrupt incumbent president mr biden has slammed ms warren s campaign rhetoric as elitist and questioned the logistics and cost of her medicare for all universal health care plan he also recently told reporters that he didn t feel the need to respond to mr sanders critiques of his foreign policy record i don t respond to bernie s ridiculous comments he said you re not going to get me in a fight with bernie bernie s got enough baggage instead mr biden kept his focus on mr trump he questioned the president s rationale for ordering an airstrike that killed iran s top military commander last week in baghdad and said the white house must get the green light from congress if the president wants to go to war with iran president trump has no strategy here no endgame mr biden said in a speech in new york and here s the hardest truth of all his constant mistakes and poor decision making have left us with a severely limited slate of options for how to move forward and most of the options are bad far left activists didn t ease up on the establishment front runner in the race they jabbed mr biden for once again misspeaking this time by saying the iran parliament voted to eject all americans and coalition forces from the country it was the iraqi parliament that voted to expel u s troops though mr biden has fallen behind in some state level polling the incoming fire underscores his standing as the clear front runner said antjuan seawright a south carolina based democratic strategist there s been a number of candidates in the primary who have attacked biden who are no longer around politically to talk about it and i don t know if it s a smart strategy to attack vice president biden he said that seemed to make him stronger with some very important constituencies in the party when these attacks ramp up mr biden has retained solid support among black voters many of whom rushed to his defense when he was assailed last year for supporting a 1994 crime bill that critics say paved the way for the mass incarceration of people of color sen kamala d harris of california famously confronted mr biden at a debate last year over his record on desegregation busing but ms harris equivocated on the issue later and failed to sustain her brief bump in the polls after the exchange she dropped out of the democratic race last month i ve been clear about this from the beginning i think we should focus on running for our party s nomination and not against each other mr seawright said mr biden s central pitch is that he is the most electable democrat in a head to head matchup against mr trump and that his coattails will help pull democrats in tough house and senate races across the finish line it s not enough for the next nominee of the democratic party merely to win the presidency he said tuesday at a fundraiser in new york according to a pool report of the event that nominee is going to have to be able to bring along a democratic senate in order to be able to get things done public polling has generally confirmed mr biden s electability argument a morning consult poll released tuesday showed mr biden holding a 6 point lead over mr trump in a hypothetical matchup the widest margin among a handful of top democratic contenders mr sanders held a 2 point lead and ms warren trailed mr trump by 1 point their latest attacks paint different pictures of the sanders and warren campaigns heading into the early state contests mr sheinkopf said sen sanders has already got a significant base he s added onto it as a function of warren s flub and he s moving straight ahead he said bernie sanders is playing the new hampshire game elizabeth warren is playing any game and joe biden believes that he ll win in south carolina that s the basic state of play not all criticism of mr biden has come from the far left more moderate candidates such as former mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana and sen amy klobuchar of minnesota are battling for support from voters who are more inclined to back the former vice president mr buttigieg criticized mr biden last month for supporting the worst foreign policy decision made by the united states in my lifetime which was the decision to invade iraq this is an example of why years in washington is not always the same thing as judgment mr buttigieg said on iowa public television mr biden responded by saying he would put up his foreign policy record against anyone else s and that people should look at the vote in context he has said president george w bush misled him at the time about the scope of the iraq conflict tv s judge judy sheindlin who recently endorsed former new york mayor michael r bloomberg also delivered a backhanded compliment to mr biden this week joe biden is a very nice man i m sure he is she said on cnn he wasn t great for 40 years wasn t great so nothing s changed except he s gotten older seth mclaughli
