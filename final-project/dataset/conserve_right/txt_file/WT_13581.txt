or persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion for far too long the united states has stood idly by and allowed the people s republic of china to conduct what is charitably described as a massive power grab throughout the asia pacific region looking back just a few years ago such a statement seemed unimaginable under the leadership of president obama while america has talked about pivoting to asia with robust rhetoric we have offered the world s most economically dynamic and strategically important part of the globe some impressive photo ops but little substance to ensure the status quo which has allowed asia to enjoy decades of peace stability and unparalleled economic opportunity would be preserved china sensing clear weakness has been all too eager to capitalize on our mistakes from entrenching themselves in the south china sea thanks to a quick build up of fake islands with growing military bases now sitting atop of them starting what can be described as a dangerous game of high seas chicken with our ally japan in the east china sea all thanks to a massive military machine that is in part powered by stolen american technology the stage is set for beijing to dominate the region in the years to come top stories trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed from there things could get even worse as china marches towards hegemony in asia one country stands to lose far more than any other and if trend lines continue could not only fall under china s sway but actually be absorbed into its borders that nation and it is a nation in every sense of the word is none other than the republic of china or what is commonly known today as taiwan thankfully and most timely change is coming to america s asia policy especially when it comes to taiwan president elect trump in words in as well as in deeds has shown he will push back against chinese aggression ensuring the region remains at peace so while i not only applaud mr trump s 10 minute phone call with the democratically elected leader of taiwan tsai ing wen i would argue mr trump should take the next logical step if our new president truly wants to break with the old foreign policy molds that simply no longer work and push back against chinese coercion i have a simple solution meet with president tsai when she passes through the united states next month the reasons mr trump needs to meet taiwan s leader are obvious first this small but scrappy democracy of just 23 million people has been eager for a greater relationship with washington for decades and is in both nation s mutual interest taiwan is america s 10th largest trading partner and is eager to sign a bilateral investment treaty especially now that the trans pacific partnership will not move forward a meeting between the two heads of state would be a good way to jump start negotiations that could see both nations gain clear economic benefits for years to come second no nation that is a responsible democracy that respects the rule of law that has a vibrant press and strong record on human rights deserves to be treated as an international second class citizen while taiwan the birth child of a chinese civil war that is yet to be brought to a clear conclusion would find it difficult to be granted full diplomatic recognition by washington beijing would see this as a clear move toward independence and could spark a war mr trump should ensure ties are enhanced to just below this level as a clear sign of support for the taiwanese people last but not least if china were to ever gain control of taiwan it would have unfettered access to the pacific ocean at present geographic realities make it difficult for beijing s naval forces to sail into the wide expanses of the pacific without passing through certain chokepoints chokepoints that could be reinforced with weapons that could deter china from sailing into open waters in the event of a crisis indeed taiwan might just be the most valuable piece of strategic real estate in the whole of east asia all the more reason this nation must become a true arsenal of democracy armed with the best and most sophisticated american weapons to deter any hostile act america s most important goal that it shares with partners and allies across the asia pacific and wider indo pacific in which taiwan is a pivotal part is the maintenance of a peaceful and prosperous status quo that ensures no one nation unilaterally coerce others or attempt to bend their will through forced measures turn near seas or oceans into territory or use hostile acts to achieve its aims there can be no better way to advance such a cause than to meet with the president of taiwan harry j kazianis serves as
