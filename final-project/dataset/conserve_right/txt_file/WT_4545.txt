apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap there were attacks on the credibility of a witness in uniform and hand wringing by another witness on all that he knows now that he says he didn t know then vice president mike pence was name dropped and lawmakers heard expressions of concern about the july phone call between president donald trump and ukraine s leader the third day of impeachment hearings was the longest yet bringing to the forefront four witnesses in two separate hearings all were steeped in national security and foreign affairs some takeaways from tuesday s testimony top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender concerned by the call republicans consistently criticize the house impeachment inquiry by saying witnesses didn t have firsthand knowledge of trump s role in trying to persuade ukraine to investigate a chief political rival on day 3 of the proceedings that posture became more difficult to maintain the two witnesses in tuesday morning s hearing each listened to the july 25 phone call in which trump prodded his ukrainian counterpart to investigate democrat joe biden jennifer williams an adviser to pence said she considered the call unusual since it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter army lt col alexander vindman who arrived for the hearing in military uniform adorned with medals went even further he considered it improper and acting out of duty reported his alarm to a lawyer for the national security council my intent was to raise these concerns because they had significant national security implications for our country vindman said i never thought that i d be sitting here testifying in front of this committee and the american public about my actions for his part tim morrison who recently left his national security council post said he did not believe that anything illegal occurred on the call but was worried about the political ramifications if the contents leaked attacks on vindman republicans frequently attacked vindman s credibility even lacing an occasional nicety with a not so veiled barb republican rep chris stewart called vindman s uniform a good reminder of his military service but also questioned why vindman a purple heart recipient felt it necessary to wear it rather than a suit to the hearing he wanted to know too if vindman always insisted on being referred to by military rank rather than mr as he did in an exchange earlier with rep devin nunes the committee s top republican in that moment he corrected nunes and asked to be called lt col vindman please the committee attacks mirrored the combative approach of the white house which used its official twitter account to retweet attacks on vindman who continues to work at the white house some republican attacks struggled to land after rep jim jordan suggested that vindman s peers questioned his judgment vindman read from a glowing performance review that called him brilliant and unflappable some attacks including from the white house s director of social media sought to imply that vindman a naturalized american citizen who was a toddler when his family fled ukraine may have dual loyalties under questioning from gop impeachment counsel steve castor vindman revealed that he was offered three times the post of ukraine s defense minister while attending ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy s inauguration but immediately dismissed these offers he says two american officials witnessed the exchange with a top adviser to zelenskiy and that he notified his chain of command and counterintelligence officials upon returning to the u s castor questioned whether that created the impression of a conflict to which vindman replied it s more important what my american chain of command thinks in hindsight there s a lot that kurt volker the former special envoy to ukraine contends he didn t know at the time he says he didn t know that security aid to ukraine was linked to the country pursuing investigations he says he didn t know that when u s officials spoke about investigating burisma the ukraine gas company that this referred to biden he says he should have made that connection much earlier and had he done so would have raised objections he says he didn t know that then national security adviser john bolton had strong concerns about discussions of investigations by nsc staff and he insists that at no time was he aware of an effort to urge ukraine to investigate biden whom he described as an honorable man one detail though that he recalled on tuesday that he did not during his closed door deposition concerned a pivotal july 10 encounter at the white house involving u s and ukrainian officials he initially said there was no discussion that day of investigations but on tuesday recalled that gordon sondland the ambassador to the european union made a generic comment about them pence role pence has been portrayed largely as out of the loop about trump s request that ukraine investigate biden williams testimony refocused attention on what pence knew about the events that sparked the house impeachment investigation but pence s office says the vice president and williams barely interacted williams a career foreign service officer who was detailed to pence s office compiled briefing materials for pence on ukraine she was in the room when he met with zelenskiy in september and was among the staffers in the white house situation room who listened and took notes during the july 25 call katie waldman a pence spokeswoman noted that williams appointment began april 1 and said she she doesn t directly report to the vice president pence failed to come to williams defense when trump recently tweeted that she should meet with the other never trumpers who i don t know mostly never even heard of work out a better presidential attack williams said she was confused by the attack and would not consider herself a never trumper white house real time response the white house reacted to the impeachment inquiry in real time tuesday stepping up its engagement after facing complaints from republican allies that it wasn t doing enough to fight back white house press secretary stephanie grisham slammed the first hearing tuesday as further evidence that democrats are blinded by their hatred for donald trump and rabid desire to overturn the outcome of a free and fair election trump at a cabinet meeting called the proceedings a disgrace and kangaroo court the white house sent a steady stream of rapid response emails to reporters beginning before the first witnesses were even sworn in the messages sought to defend trump and undermine the credibility of the witnesses the president of the united states determines
