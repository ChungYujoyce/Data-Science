apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic so you re sick of the news media and its assorted journalistic sins such a sentiment prompted president trump to literally fire the new york times and washington post this week the white house has canceled its subscriptions to the two newspapers irked by their endless negative speculative or suggestive coverage of mr trump and his administration yes well such fierce sentiments about the press are not a new phenomenon consider that fox news host howard kurtz wrote a book titled media circus the trouble with america s newspapers the year was 1993 and obviously the circus is alive and well and has even expanded and mutated in the past quarter century top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender but wait mr kurtz also authored another book titled spin cycle how the white house and the media manipulate the news in 1998 during the clinton administration years in 2012 mr kurtz produced yet another book titled hot air all talk all the time which tracked bombastic broadcasters by 2018 the author produced media madness donald trump the press and the war over truth ok then mr kurtz has significant institutional knowledge and here s what he has to say these days as told to full measure host sharyl attkisson on sunday in your view did donald trump cause the media to descend into madness or just expose media madness that was already in existence she asked the media s credibility problems were maybe more like a fever once trump trauma took effect that s what i call it i think he sort of made the media go crazy that s not to let the press off the hook but there s something so visceral in the response of many journalists and pundits to the trump presidency to donald trump himself i mean in addition to the fact that you might expect them to be ideologically opposed to a lot of what he wants to do he just drives them up the wall mr kurtz replied they never fully accept many of them that he is the president so i think that s where i got the madness in the title for the press donald trump has become like the great white whale and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that so many journalists are invested in an outcome that either sees him driven from office or defeated in 2020 he observes the gop skewers socialism the republican party is formally pushing back against the constant and often glowing calls from assorted democrats and progressives who seek to persuade americans that in an ideal world the united states should really be a socialist nation democrats want to bring socialism to america they are offering free everything from government run health care to free college for all learn the truth about what that actually means from real people who lived in socialist countries and survived to tell their tale the gop advises at a brand new online resource which offers a reality check from those who have not had a very positive experience with socialism this is the truth about socialism hear from the people who have suffered under the oppression of a centralized socialist government the promises of free government services and equality for all turned into a nightmare advises an introductory video america was founded on liberty and independence not government coercion domination and control we are born free and we will stay free stand with president trump to tell democrats america will never be a socialist country it concludes curious take a peek at victimsofsocialism org for all your impeachment needs yes the ever mutating impeachment inquiry is hard to track
