regime for using chemical weapons to murder its own people begin videotape donald trump president of the united states these are not the actions of a man they are crimes of a monster instead wallace we aposll discuss the decision to hit syria again what it means for the civil war there and the president aposs message to other countries supporting assad trump to iran and to russia i ask what kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men women and children wallace nikki haley u s ambassador to the united nations live only on fox news sunday then the fbi raids the president aposs personal lawyer michael cohen raising questions whether mr trump will fire special counsel robert mueller trump why don apost i just fire mueller well i think it aposs a disgrace what aposs going on we aposll see what happens wallace we aposll discuss the latest developments with trey gowdy chair of the house oversight committee plus former fbi director james comey aposs new book lashes out at president trump and the white house responds james comey former fbi director the intelligence community does intelligence the white house does pr and spin sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary comey will be forever known as a disgraced partisan hack that broke his sacred trust with the president of the united states wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel if there are bombshells in the new book or just a political food fight all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington the strikes on syria by the u s france and britain are a show of western resolve meant to punish bashar al assad for his latest chemical weapons attack on his own people the pentagon describes the strikes on three targets as precise overwhelming and effective but what happens if assad uses chemical weapons again and where does this leave u s policy for dealing with a civil war and terror threat in syria in a moment we aposll speak live with the u s ambassador to the united nations nikki haley but first to national security correspondent jennifer griffin with the latest on the military operation begin videotape jennifer griffin fox news national security correspondent over 100 u s french and british missiles all hit their targets successfully landing simultaneously within just a few minutes despite being launched from military assets deployed from the mediterranean to the persian gulf james mattis defense secretary clearly the assad regime did not get the message last year this time our allies and we have struck harder griffin the three targets included a research center near damascus a chemical weapons storage facility near homs and a weapons bunker a few miles from that second site russian and syrian state media claim they shot down dozens of the allied tomahawks and missiles but the pentagon says the russian guns remain silent adding syria fired 40 surface to air missiles wildly into the air after the u s missiles had already hit dana white pentagon chief spokesperson what happens next has everything to do with what the assad regime decides to do nikki haley u s ambassador to the united nations i spoke with the president this morning and he said if the syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again the united states is locked and loaded when our president draws a red line our president enforces the red line end videotape griffin u s intelligence has only concluded at this time that chlorine was used in the most recent chemical attack they suspect sarin but don apost have the proof yet leaving many to wonder if use of chlorine bombs in syria is a new red line for the u s and its allies and the possibility of future military actions chris wallace jennifer thank you joining us now from new york u s ambassador to the united nations nikki haley ambassador i want to start with president trump aposs tweet after the military action against syria here it is a perfectly executed strike last night could not have had a better result mission accomplished a lot of people say that echoes president bush 43 aposs premature claim of mission accomplished back in 2003 isn apost president trump aposs claim of success just as premature haley well first of all mission accomplished is a military term and as a military spouse i know that mission accomplished means you have one task currently in front of you and when it aposs completed it is mission accomplished politically mission accomplished means something broader and i think the president was referring in military terms we of course know that our work in syria is not done we know that it aposs now up to bashar al assad on whether he is going to use chemical weapons again and should he use it again the president has made it very clear that the united states is locked and loaded and ready to go wallace yes i want to pick up on that because obviously you have no idea how assad is going to respond to this attack although i suspect you think that he got the message and to add a little bit to this confusion president trump and defense secretary mattis sent very different signals on friday night about the campaign take a look at both of them begin video clip trump we are prepared to sustain this response until the syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents james mattis defense secretary right now this is a one time shot end video clip wallace so which is it a one time shot or a sustained response haley that is totally up to assad what i can tell you is the president has made it very clear when it comes to weapons of mass destruction we have no tolerance for it we are going to watch out for the best interests of the american people and so he made a point and hopefully assad gets it if assad doesn apost get it it aposs going to hurt and i think what general mattis was saying the strike happened basically responding to their continued use of chemical weapons but of course if assad continues to go forward there will be more and it will hurt and i think that he has a lot to think about wallace i want to pick up on that because there are certainly indications since the first strike in april of last year that assad had used chemical weapons and there had been no u s response this particular case last weekend was especially egregious and horrific but are you saying that going forward any use of chemical weapons by assad will trigger an immediate u s response haley well i think first of all you said it this last one was egregious it was barbaric and it was disgusting so i think what you saw was there had been a cumulative wave of constant use of chemical weapons assad knew that russia had its back assad knew that russia would cover for him at the united nations and assad got reckless and he used it in a way that was far more aggressive we have to be very conscious of the fact that we can apost allow even the smallest use of chemical weapons that aposs why you saw the president strike this past weekend that aposs why you saw him expel 60 russian spies after the attack in salisbury this very easily could happen in the united states if we aposre not smart and if we aposre not conscious of what aposs happening this was a message sent to assad we aposll see how smart he is wallace but to press my point if i may are you saying that going forward there is zero tolerance any use by assad of chemical weapons will trigger a military response haley well i don apost think there aposs any way that i can answer that i mean we don apost know what he aposs going to do the level he aposs going to do or anything else i will tell you that the president is watching and i think the national security team is ready so basically we will watch his actions he now dictates his life and he dictates what happens between the united states our allies and his regime and so hopefully he has gotten the message it was a pretty strong message not only did we go after their absolute strongest research facility we went after their storage units where they hold the products and we went after their production so we put a heavy blow into their chemical weapons program setting them back years and i aposm sure it aposs going to take them a lot to recover from it wallace ambassador here is a question that a lot of people have you have spoken very movingly about the slaughter of civilians in syria and we are seeing pictures right now of the attack in douma but doesn apost the president aposs policy allow the mass murder of women and children to continue as long as it aposs carried out with conventional weapons and not chemical weapons haley well i think that aposs just a very unfair question in what respect are you asking that wallace well what i aposm saying is we aposre saying that any use of chemical weapons we aposll respond to but we aposre not saying that about conventional weapons and assad has slaughtered hundreds of thousands of his people why are we drawing a distinction and saying to assad it aposs ok to do it with conventional weapons but we aposre going to object if you do it with chemical weapons haley i don apost think we aposve ever said it aposs ok period there is no way that any american or the president would ever say it aposs ok to kill women and children i think that we have a lot of issues in the world and i think we aposre trying to put out as many fires as we can we can apost control what a country does to its people we can condemn it we can acknowledge it we can try to do everything at the united nations i think what you aposve seen is the president has used a lot of sanctions whether it aposs in venezuela whether it aposs been related to syria whether it aposs related to russia and human rights there aposs been a lot of things that we have done and taken action we aposve never sat back and watched bad things happen we do wait and use military force as a last response to that but we aposve always acted in every way related to every incident in some form just to let them know how much the united states condemns it wallace i want to ask you about u s actions and how we aposre responding though when it comes to the displacement and the torture of the syrian people i want you to look at some state department numbers on how many refugees have come into this country over the last three years in 2016 more than 15 000 syrian refugees came into this country last year 3 000 so far this year 11 on humanitarian grounds how do you justify that haley i will tell you we have spent well over 6 billion on the syrian conflict i personally went to the refugee sites in both jordan and turkey and spent time with refugees whether they were in camps or whether they were out i talked to them about the situation at hand i will tell you from a humanitarian standpoint the united states has been a massive donor to this situation but also when i talked to the refugees what i talked to them about they want to go home and there is a mountain that they look over and know it is on the other side and know that syria is in shambles and they are prepared to rebuild it but not one of the many that i talked to ever said we want to go to america they want to stay as close to syria as they can so that when god willing this fighting stops and when there is finally stability and peace in that area they want to go rejoin their family members they back to go to what they remember the kids talked about where they used to play and what they used to do the adults talked about the fact that that aposs where they were born that aposs where they were raised there was a real emotional string to syria and i think we need to be conscious of the fact that aposs really where they want to go wallace let aposs talk about the overall strategy for syria because a couple weeks ago president trump talked about a very fast pull out of our troops there take a look begin video clip trump we aposre knocking the hell out of isis we aposll be coming out of syria very soon let the other people take care of it now very soon end video clip wallace president trump reportedly wanted to get all 2 000 u s troops out within 48 hours and had to be persuaded by folks at the pentagon to keep them there for a couple of months which raises the question what is our goal in syria and what is our strategy to get there haley well i can tell you because i was in the national security council meetings with the president when it came to discussing russia and he had three major goals that he wanted to accomplish he one wanted to make sure that chemicals chemical weapons were not used or weapons of mass destruction were not used in any way that could harm american national interests he wanted to make sure that we defeated isis completely and wholly to make sure all of that threat was gone because it is a threat to american national interests and he wanted to make sure that we had good grounds to watch what iran was doing and they weren apost making a lot of aggressive headway in terms of that because iran is a national threat to american interests and so i think that no he never thought he would get out in 48 hours yes it is all of our goal to see american troops come home but we aposre not going to leave until we know we aposve accomplished those things what he has done is talked to our allies and said they need to step up more they need to do more it shouldn apost just be us doing it i think that aposs the right approach but be very clear if we leave when we leave it will be because we know that everything is moving forward we aposre very invested in the political process in geneva and invested on a political solution and those talks continue wallace one area where there has been a dramatic escalation in the last week has been in the direct verbal attacks by the administration on russian president putin here is a tweet from president trump this week president putin russia and iran are responsible for backing animal assad and here you are at the u n begin video clip haley history will record that on this day russia chose protecting a monster over the lives of the syrian people end video clip wallace ambassador has our relationship with putin and russia changed this week haley well i think it aposs been changing over time this is a very strained time between the united states and russia i mean if you look at what russia is doing they continue to be involved with all the wrong actors i mean whether it aposs their involvement in ukraine whether you look at how they are supporting maduro in venezuela whether you look in syria and their way of propping up assad and working with iran that continues to be a problem there is multiple issues we have with russia right now and what they aposre doing whether it aposs the chemical weapons use in great britain that was another issue so what we aposre doing is we aposre letting russia know this is not something that we want to be a part of it aposs not something we aposre going to tolerate and they aposve got to make a decision right now they don apost have very good friends and right now the friends that they do have are causing them harm i think they aposre feeling that whether it aposs been with the fact that we aposve sanctioned just recently the russian oligarchs which made their stock market plummet whether it aposs the fact that we gave arms to ukraine which makes them realize that their life is about to get harder in that region whether it aposs us sending 60 spies home to let them know that we aposre not going to put up with you using a chemical agent anywhere or whether the sanctions that are continuing to happen which you aposll see again on monday that lets them know this is not good behavior so everything that has strained this relationship has been on the side of russia the military strikes did not have to happen if russia had not covered for assad six times they vetoed chemical weapons resolutions related to syria and this last resolution that they had they only had three votes out of 15 the international community is telling russia that either you make a decision on how you act and when you act or the rest of us will make a decision in isolating you wallace so in 15 seconds how would you characterize u s relations with putin and russia right now haley very strained right now but our hope is always to make sure we can get a better relationship with russia it aposs in our best national interest to do that but we aposre not going to put up bad behavior to get it wallace ambassador haley thank you thanks for taking the time with all you have going on right now we aposll stay on top of the latest developments haley great thanks so much wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the situation in syria and where the u s our allies in europe and our adversaries in russia and iran go from here commercial break begin video clip lt gen kenneth mckenzie director joint staff we accomplished our military objectives route material interference from syria i aposd use three words to describe this operation precise overwhelming and effective end video clip wallace lieutenant general kenneth mckenzie director of the joint staff at the pentagon describing friday aposs strikes on syria and it aposs time now for our sunday group jonah goldberg of the national review and author of the new book suicide of the west charles lane of the washington post fox news national security correspondent jennifer griffin doing double duty today and former press secretary to vice president pence marc lotter jen let aposs start with the strike there are reports that there was some dissension even a battle inside the president aposs war cabinet that ambassador haley and the new national security adviser bolton wanted a tougher more aggressive response that defense secretary mattis wanted a quote show strike and that he prevailed with the president is that true was there a difference in terms of how they should respond friday night griffin i think there is a natural tension between the pentagon officials defense secretary mattis being in the lead and other national security officials the defense department doesn apost want to broaden this when they go in present options they want to know what is the strategy are we now going to step in to the syrian civil war what are the what are the chances of hitting russian bases or iranian troops i mean they aposre all interlaced there so i think what secretary mattis pushed back on was anything that was broader that was going to suggest regime change they obviously all of the top leadership at the pentagon has a lot of experience with regime change and it hasn apost gone well in either libya or iraq wallace jonah i want to pick up on the president aposs tweet mission accomplished and he responded today saying i was talking in military terms not political terms he is political he is the commander in chief but obviously it does have a political resonance what is the mission and what did we accomplish jonah goldberg fox news contributor i mean i think it remains unclear i thought your question to nikki haley and i should fully disclose my wife works for nikki haley was interesting in the sense that she didn apost have a great answer to the question of was it ok for assad to slaughter civilians with conventional weapons but we aposre going to step in with if you use chemical weapons which i think is very small solace to the victims of assad and i think in many ways that the mission here was in some ways defined by the fact that we had video i mean nikki haley at the u n said there had been 50 other chemical weapons uses which we did not respond to and i think that one of the things that donald trump has made clear is that when there aposs video of kids suffering he responds to that that aposs his red line i aposm not sure that is a super coherent strategy going forward because first of all let assad continue to wipe out his domestic enemies and it doesn apost really change the status quo on the ground wallace no and she did not even commit that if there were other chemical weapons attacks that the u s would necessarily strike she said it depends so it isn apost a red line when it comes to chemical weapons attacks it comes to chemical weapons attacks that goldberg have video attached i think that might be the case wallace all right here is what president trump said announcing the attack on friday night begin video clip trump the evil and the despicable attack left mothers and fathers infants and children thrashing in pain and gasping for air these are not the actions of a man they are crimes of a monster instead end video clip wallace but i want to pick up on this discussion that i had with the ambassador and i just had with jonah the president seems to be saying one that if it aposs conventional weapons it aposs ok we aposre going to accept it maybe not that it aposs ok we aposre not going to do anything about it but chemical weapons we will and to further slice the meat it depends on how bad the chemical weapons attack can you argue that it is a reasonable policy to say look we aposre not going to get sucked into this civil war we aposre not going to get on the ground we aposre not going to stop all the slaughter but we are going to enforce the principle no chemical weapons charles lane fox news contributor if we have a policy that must be it because that is the only political objective that is even conceivably related to this strike and of course the strike the general described it in very glowing terms but it aposs very limited three targets they made sure the russians were safely out of the way before they engaged in it so it was you know i guess if you use that term pinprick strike maybe it aposs a little more than that but it aposs not some kind of overwhelming attack and at the same time it aposs extremely ironic we have a president who came into talking about american first very contemptuous of all the alliances and international law that entangles that united states and yet this use of military force now the second one he has done in syria has been to uphold a humanitarian international norm i happen to think it aposs a norm worth upholding actually that you shouldn apost use chemical weapons against civilian populations but it is interestingly it aposs not what he came into office to do i think that aposs why there aposs going to be continuing tension his instincts are to get out and as you said let other people handle this but he has now committed to this minimal objective in syria which is whatever else happens you aren apost going to do it with chemical weapons wallace so mark you have heard criticism of the president aposs actions his tweets his strategy as the former top advisor a top adviser to vice president pence your response marc lotter former vice president pence press secretary i think the one thing we need to note is that this is a different attack than what we saw last year last year was mostly focused on the delivery and the methods used to deliver the weapons this time they took the additional step by reducing syria aposs ability to produce the weapons and that aposs so it was a targeted response to degrade their ability to use these weapons in the future and not just how they delivered them like they did last year so i think it was a furthering reducing likelihood that we aposre going to see attacks like this in the future there will be residuals we can apost guarantee that there won apost have any left but this definitely degrades that capability wallace and what do you think of the criticism of the lack of a strategy and the idea that it aposs ok ok is the wrong word i aposm going to stop saying it that we will turn a blind eye to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands maybe a half million civilians unless it aposs chemical weapons and unless there is video of it that the president sees lotter i think that aposs where you do find that broader issue there in terms of are we going to get drawn into a civil war are we going to get into regime change nation building which is what this president has firmly said we are not going to do that he aposs drawn a red line on the use of chemical weapons he has now acted twice because of that but it aposs a much different story when you aposre going to have to go in and try to a also confront russia also confront iran and what they aposre doing to support that regime and i don apost think that is a line the president is willing to commit to but we do have to take steps in minimizing the use of these weapons we aposve done it with north korea we aposve done it with russia we sanctioned we will continue to do sanctions on syria and i think that aposs where the president aposs leadership is that we are going to respond and in this case we had allies with us wallace jennifer griffin i think there are two points lieutenant general mckenzie did say that these three spots that were hit does not prevent assad from firing chemical weapons in the future there are more spots that they chose not to hit because of the fear of civilian casualties i think what we have to look at is the opcw those of those inspectors and what syria signed onto wallace organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons griffin prohibition of chemical weapons wallace which is supposedly on the ground right now in douma griffin they aposre on the ground right now but what syria signed onto in 2013 when they were supposed to give up their chemical weapons did not include chlorine so the question now for the president is the use of chlorine bombs in the future is that the red line and is the u s and are its allies required to respond military if he uses chlorine bombs wallace jonah goldberg yes just to switch gears slightly i do think john bolton aposs position is one that we need to give some credence to or not credence to at least acknowledge insofar as there is john bolton is not a neocon he aposs not for nation building and democracy spreading but he is america firster but an interventionist america firster he sees the syrian civil war as a way to bleed russia resources a way to bleed iran aposs resources a way to diminish their role in the region and i think that aposs one of the reasons why he was more eager to get involved in this as a way to sort of push back on iran wallace how do we bleed russia aposs resources iran aposs resources without bleeding our own which we have seen in afghanistan and iraq goldberg that aposs the pickle laughter griffin i think it aposs by having limited strikes and that is why secretary mattis pushed for such limited targeted strike wallace yes but couldn apost you argue that this morning as putin wakes up at the kremlin as khamenei wakes up in tehran as assad wakes up in damascus they all think oh that wasn apost so bad griffin they didn apost pay a price no from that point of view russia and iran did not pay a price but i think what it did was it set a line that the u s will not get involved in the civil war but there are certain red lines wallace all right we have to take a break here we aposll see you all a little later when we come back president trump has other pressing business to deal with the criminal investigation of his personal lawyer the russia probe and former fbi director james comey aposs new book republican congressman trey gowdy joins us to break it all down next commercial break wallace coming up james comey aposs new book is causing quite the stir but not everyone aposs impressed begin video clip sarah sanders white house press secretary the american people see right through the blatant lies of a self admitted leaker end video clip wallace we aposll ask congressman trey gowdy what the comey book means for president trump next on fox news sunday commercial break wallace normally the decision to launch a military strike would fill the plate of any president but this weekend president trump has plenty more to deal with the criminal investigation of his personal lawyer a special counsel continuing to breathe down his neck and now a damaging book by the former head of the fbi joining me to discuss all this south carolina congressman trey gowdy chair of the house oversight committee and a member of the house intelligence committee congressman let aposs start with the fbi raid on the home the hotel and the offices of president trump aposs personal lawyer michael cohen which raises obvious questions about possible violation of attorney client privilege as a former federal prosecutor are you convinced that this raid was appropriate or at least on its face not inappropriate rep trey gowdy r south carolina well here aposs what we know we know a neutral detached federal magistrate had to sign off on the search warrant we know that it requires the highest levels of doj permission to seize attorney client records and by that i mean the attorney general or the deputy attorney general and we also know it must have nothing to do with bob mueller aposs probe either directly or indirectly or he would not have referred it what we don apost know is what the basis of the probable cause was what was searched and what was seized but so so we know a little bit we don apost know a little bit i think the most important thing we know is that a neutral detached federal judge that has nothing to do with politics signed off on this warrant wallace i i want to pick up on on one of your points which is that you you noted that special counsel robert mueller referred this to prosecutors in manhattan and here was the president aposs furious reaction to that and it led to this exchange begin video clip donald trump president of the united states why don apost i just fire mueller question inaudible trump well i think it aposs a disgrace what aposs going on we aposll see what happens but i think it aposs really a sad situation when you look at what happened and many people have said you should fire him end video clip wallace question do you still think we talked several weeks ago do you still think it would be wrong it would be a serious mistake to fire mueller and given the growing calls to fire the deputy attorney general do you feel the same way about firing rod rosenstein gowdy well let me take mueller first i don apost know what mueller was supposed to do other than what he did when a prosecutor comes in contact with information or evidence of a crime what are you supposed to do other than to refer it to the appropriate jurisdiction now if mueller had kept something tangential or unrelated for himself then i aposd say fine you can criticize him but he came in contact with potential criminality potential criminality he referred it to the u s attorney aposs office of jurisdiction and he did so with the permission of rod rosenstein i don apost know what else he could do as for rod rosenstein i i don apost see a basis for firing him in his handling of this probe now he aposs the one who drafted that original jurisdiction for mueller so if you think it aposs too broad you aposve got to direct your criticism towards rosenstein and not to mueller if you aposre upset with rosenstein because he aposs slow walking document production to congress take that up with him but but how this is mueller aposs fault just defies logic to me chris wallace yes but here aposs the the point and steve bannon the president aposs former and apparently exiled adviser has suggested this if you fire rosenstein and you put a new guy in there as the deputy attorney general to oversee the mueller investigation then you don apost have to fire mueller but you can restrict him are you concerned about that gowdy so this is the same steve bannon that accused the president aposs son of an act of treason the same steve bannon that did something no one else in the world can do which is elect a democrat in alabama i don apost know who the hell would take advice from steve bannon and if i were to president i aposd say go get advice from anyone else in the world other than steve bannon wallace but but just to make it clear while you you rule out flatly the firing of mueller you aposre leaving the door open to firing rosenstein gowdy it depends it depends i mean look the president is the head of the executive branch he doesn apost i mean he doesn apost have to run his hiring and firing decisions by us so if he aposs upset with rod rosenstein because rod rosenstein is not producing documents to congress that aposs a legitimate thing to be upset about if he aposs upset with rod rosenstein because he wants to get at bob mueller and that aposs the way he aposs going to do it taking the advice of steve bannon which i would strongly recommend against then no i don apost think that aposs appropriate does he have the power to get rid of rod rosenstein yes he does do i think it aposs wise i don apost wallace in the midst of all this this week the president pardoned scooter libby he of course is the former dick cheney aide who was convicted of lying to the fbi in the outing of valerie plame as a cia undercover officer case given the timing congressman are you at all concerned that the president is sending a message to people associates who may be under fire from bob mueller just listen if you protect me then i will protect you with a pardon if it comes to that gowdy well i would hope most of the folks involved in this already know the president has the power of pardon he aposs already proved that with sheriff joe arpaio in arizona so i aposm not a big fan of pardons i aposm a prosecutor most of the commentary i aposve read chris on scooter libby aposs pardon is that they thought that it was an overzealous prosecutor ok there aposs a way to deal with that don apost hire overzealous prosecutors but he was convicted if memory serves me correctly of a false statement and obstruction of justice those are things that you want to dissuade people from doing all the time i think everyone knows the president has pardon power so i don apost know if he needs to send this signal except to really slow witted people wallace i want to turn to one of your big issues now and that is the way the fbi has handled the clinton investigation and the trump investigation former fbi director james comey has a new book out you may have heard of it and one of the questions he aposs going to have an interview on abc tonight you may have heard of that as well one of the questions is what he told the president elect when he talked to him at trump tower in january about the steele dossier and the fact that it had been paid for by the clinton campaign take a look begin video clip james comey former fbi director no i didn apost i don apost think i used the term steele dossier i just talked about additional material george stephanopoulos abc news did but did he have a right to know that comey that it had been financed by his political opponents i don apost know the answer to that i it wasn apost necessary for my goal which was to alert him that we had this information end video clip wallace congressman what do you think of comey aposs answer and what do you think of comey aposs book gowdy well as for his book chris i aposm disappointed i had i hold prosecutors and law enforcement officials to a higher standard so i think the book is sad let aposs don apost kid ourselves jim comey now complains that president trump is untethered from the truth he aposd still be the fbi director if he had his way so all of the complaints he had about president trump he was willing to put those aside so he could keep his job the reason he wrote his book is because he got fired not because he thinks president trump is untethered from the truth not because president trump aposs ties are too long not because he thinks he wears tanning bed goggles it aposs because he got fired now as for whether or not he should have told the president the source of this salacious opposition research would you want to know i mean that aposs the first question you ask is where did you get that from so you can judge the credibility i aposm more concerned about the fact that they didn apost tell the fisa court that aposs what i aposm really concerned about because president trump doesn apost sign off on warrants the fisa judge did so i think he should have told president trump but i know for a fact they should have told the fisa court wallace well let me let me pick up on this because we learned this week that you and the chair of the house intel committee devin nunes have now read the original fbi memo that launched the whole trump investigation in the summer of 2016 having read it are you persuaded that they had a legitimate reason to launch this probe gowdy i aposve always been persuaded i i didn apost have to read the the initiating document i mean you aposve got george papadopoulos you aposve got a meeting at trump tower you aposve got an email from cambridge analytica you you aposve got reasons to look into what russia did and who if anyone did they do it with so this origination document is important to me though because it goes to the credibility of those who launched the investigation was it because of george papadopoulos because this initiation took place months after george papadopoulos had his little conversation drunken conversation in a bar or was it the dossier so that aposs important to me to know but you aposre going to have a russian i mean russia someone hacked the dnc server someone hacked john podesta aposs e mails someone played games with the american people whether or not there aposs a dossier so i aposve never thought that discrediting the dossier did away with the russia probe wallace all right one final question i want to switch subjects in your role as chair of the house oversight committee you wrote a letter to epa administrator scott pruitt this week seeking formal interviews with five of his top aides why and how much trouble is pruitt in gowdy well i don apost know how much trouble he aposs in the reason the oversight committee wants to know whether or not the epa is a good steward of taxpayer money is because congress created the epa we fund the epa so it is entirely legitimate for us to ask are you being good stewards of the american taxpayer dollar and it aposs also appropriate because we have jurisdiction over the office of government ethics to look into his lease i didn apost hire him i aposm not the one contemplating promoting him or demoting him or getting rid of him that aposs all for president trump but congress does have a responsibility to provide oversight and i think the responsible way to do it is gather the documents look we aposre not having a prime time hearing i aposve got you know wallace but let me just ask you because i aposve got 30 seconds left how troubled are you by this raft of reports that he spent too much money on his desk his office the planes the security detail that there are some serious ethical questions here about mr pruitt gowdy i aposm concerned about both what you cited and the explanation for it and whether or not it is credible look if you sit first class you aposre guaranteed to come in contact with everybody else on the plane if you really want to avoid people on the plane sit in the last seat not the first seat i aposd be shocked if that many people knew who scott pruitt was so the notion that i aposve got to fly first class because i don apost want people to be mean to me you need to go into another line of work if you don apost want people to be mean to you like maybe a monk where you don apost come in contact with anyone wallace yes a monk who sits in the last seat in the plane i listen i aposm going to have to consider that congressman gowdy thank you gowdy yes sir wallace thanks you spending your weekend with us always good to talk to you sir gowdy you too thank you wallace when we come back more on the fbi raid of the president aposs personal lawyer and mr trump aposs ongoing face off with the special counsel plus what would you like to ask the panel about former fbi director comey aposs new book just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump it aposs a disgrace it aposs frankly a real disgrace it aposs a an attack on our country in a true sense it aposs an attack on what we all stand for end video clip wallace president trump venting his anger over the news his personal lawyer michael cohen was raided by the fbi and we aposre back now with the panel jonah what do you make of the president aposs i think it aposs fair to say furious reaction to the raid of his long time personal lawyer some say fixer i guess cohen likes to call himself a fixer michael cohen and the fact that he left in that same event left open wide open the question of whether or not he aposs going to fire robert mueller jonah goldberg national review yes i mean in the trump organization they actually refer to him as tom as a shorthand for tom hagen the character from the godfather so he aposs owned this fixer persona for quite a while wallace may i simply say having known michael cohen and having seen the godfather movies goldberg he aposs no tom hagen wallace he aposs he aposs no tom hagen goldberg fair enough i think i aposve always been a deep skeptic of the russia collusion narrative this idea that trump conspired with vladimir putin to steel the election i still want to find out what mueller finds out but i aposve always thought that his biggest objection to the mueller probe was he was afraid of what else they might find and if my theory is true then this has to be the most terrifying thing that could happen to anybody who has something to hide is to have your fixer aposs entire world seized by the fbi and gone through with a fine tooth comb and so i completely understand why he aposs he aposs livid about it at the same time i do not think that this is a violation of all that america stands for the as trey gowdy explained you had to get a warrant you had to go through all these loopholes all these hurdles at the fbi and the doj and the test will be what they actually find there my hunch is is that they aposre going to find a lot and we should also one last point donald trump and michael cohen both publically say that michael cohen was not working for donald trump when he did the fixed the stormy daniels situation which means he was not his lawyer at the time which means there is no attorney client privilege at stake at that wallace that aposs why you shouldn apost talk right the reaction from top senate republicans to another round of will he fire robert mueller was strong and fierce take a look begin video clip chuck grassley r iowa senator it would be suicide for the president to want to talk about firing mueller marco rubio r florida senator i don apost believe he aposll fire mueller and if he does it will be a terrible mistake cory gardner r colorado senator well look i think it would be a mistake a great mistake end video clip wallace jennifer at least on capitol hill among democrats and especially among republicans no appetite for the idea of firing the special counsel jennifer griffin fox news correspondent no appetite but sarah sanders white house spokesperson raised eyebrows when she said that on tuesday at the briefing that the president has the right to or believes he has the right to fire mueller that aposs why you aposve seen in the last 24 hours an open letter from 245 former doj officials calling on congress to act to protect mueller so clearly there is a sense that the president may act and in fact you heard reports this week that rod rosenstein has been telling his close associates that he feels he may be fired because the president really has two choices and the legal advice he aposs getting is that well maybe you can apost fire mueller but you can fire rod rosenstein and so so i think you have to really watch what does the president say about rod rosenstein in the coming inaudible wallace you know i just to give you a sense of of the frenzy about all of this one of our top people on capitol hill put out an alert to us on friday night saying he aposd gotten from a close trump source that rod rosenstein was not going to be fired tonight so i mean anyway let aposs turn to the new book from james comey the former fbi director you may have heard about it here aposs what he says about president trump aposs preoccupation with the steele dossier and it aposs contention that he spent time with prostitutes in moscow here is mr comey begin video clip james comey former fbi director honestly i never thought these words would come out of my mouth but i don apost know whether the the current president of the united states was with prostitutes peeing on each other in moscow in 2013 it aposs possible but i don apost know end video clip wallace things that we never thought we aposd have on the air we ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook from hal widsten is there any new information in this book or is it just comey as a disgruntled former government employee attacking president trump marc how do you answer hal marc lotter former vp pence press secretary i think there aposs not a lot that aposs new in this book one of the things that i found unique was the fact that the former director actually talked about there being classified information that we still don apost know about relating to attorney general lynch that would have compromised her which also influenced his decisions in the in the hillary clinton investigation now if those are unsubstantiated that aposs very reckless for him to actually throw his former boss under the bus in a in a book like that and if they aposre true then i think we need to know what is actually out there that compromised her and helped prompt his decisions in addition to political inaudible wallace but what do you make of what he has to say about the president both factually and also his opinions lotter i think the one thing that has brought washington together in the last year and a half is everyone at one point or another has has questioned jim comey aposs credibility his disservice to the fbi and wanted him to lose his job and i think he just continues that narrative of flip flopping his stories and having not a lot of credibility in the book wallace chuck on a scale of one to 10 10 being woodward and bernstein how damaging is this book to donald trump charles lane the washington post well my expectation was somewhere in the seven eight nine range and i think it came much more in the four or five or maybe three range look people it aposs like everything else people who are already predisposed to think ill of the president are going to think ill of him and vice versa and so what you aposre looking for in this is some real powerful nugget of brand new information not just the atmospherics about how i felt like maybe i was listening to a mafia don we you know that aposs atmospherics and i don apost yet see a blockbuster new fact in here what what is interesting is this revelation of comey kind of admitting you know i was thinking about politics as i was going through some of these decisions regarding what i would say about hillary and he aposs sort of confessing that he got that wrong or you know and what that tells me is this is a guy who aposs kind of bad at spin says he shouldn apost do spin because it aposs inappropriate to his role and then keeps trying to do spin and in a way he aposs he aposs i wouldn apost dismiss him as some kind of disgruntled inaudible it aposs much more important than that but he is still trying to effect his legacy in the public eye i aposve got to say just one final thing how we all have to sort of sit back and think how extraordinary it is the former director of this large police law enforcement agency is calling the president of the united states somebody he thought of as a mafia boss on the one hand and the president responding calling him a slime ball this kind of interaction between these kinds of people is just i mean it is really a bad show for democracy it aposs totally unseemly wallace jonah your thoughts about the comey book both the facts and his characterizations of the president goldberg yes no i largely agree with chuck i was always skeptical that he could have real blockbuster news in this because it would be outrageous for a former fbi director to sit on damaging news so he could monetize it a year after he you know is firing if he had anything truly damning he has to give it to mueller and he can apost say anything so i expected the book to be mostly atmospheric i do think that the problem for comey is that he is basically trying to get down on trump aposs level on the one hand while seeming above the fray on the other that is a hard look for a polished politician and he just doesn apost pull it off and i think it it leaves him diminished griffin it actually reminds me of during the republican primary when when the candidates wallace marco rubio griffin they didn apost know whether to go high go low when they would go low then it aposs when the president when trump the candidate had them and knocked them out of the ring wallace we aposve got less than 30 seconds what impact could this have his clear animus and the fact that he aposs told his story if he ends up being a witness does it just hypothetical in a case on the issue of obstruction of justice has he damaged his credibility lane well obviously this president aposs lawyers were goin
