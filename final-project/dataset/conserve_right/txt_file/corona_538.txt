after two months lived under the threat of coronavirus the key characteristic of the crisis remains uncertainty we don t know where the virus came from we still don t know for sure all the ways it attacks the body which is a big part of why we still don t know how best to treat it we certainly don t know how to cure it and as it spreads despite our best efforts among asymptomatic carriers and carriers not yet symptomatic and carriers who have no choice but to keep coming into contact with others we still don t know with nearly enough precision to whom exactly it has already spread on this last question at least we d seemingly been making strong progress in recent days after a rocky april during which america s covid testing apparatus struggled to keep up with the demand of spiking cases we righted the ship in may according to official state data accumulated by the covid tracking project the last day we processed fewer than 200 000 tests was april 27 and we ve averaged more than 350 000 a day over the last week over the past month the percentage of new tests coming back positive a key metric of how successfully our testing operation is growing relative to the growth of the pandemic itself has gone from north of 20 percent down to a much more encouraging 5 percent to 6 percent we ve known for a while there were blips in this data on may 13 the atlantic reported that the state of virginia was fudging its testing numbers by combining the results of two incomparable types of tests in their official number the pcr or nasal swab test which determines whether a person is currently harboring the virus and the serology blood test which checks for covid fighting antibodies to determine whether a person has ever had the virus serology tests are useful in many ways people who are shown already to have had the virus can likely safely re enter the workforce and their donated plasma is among the most promising early treatments doctors have discovered for people still suffering from the virus at the macro level knowing what percentage of the population has already been exposed is a crucial factor in many public health decisions but when it comes to the most pressing current reason for testing knowing how many new cases are cropping up in a given region they are useless combining the two therefore is an extremely foolish strategy that seriously obscures the public health situation after the fudging in virginia was revealed the government apologized and pledged to separate the data and that seemed to be the end of it only it turns out that this issue was far more widespread than anyone had previously thought this week we learned that not only virginia but also pennsylvania texas georgia vermont and maine had been likewise combining their testing data meanwhile the centers for disease control had been doing the same thing at the national level combining the two types of tests in their own state by state totals even in cases where states had reported them separately the news is a blow one which casts serious doubt on the formerly encouraging testing numbers what accounts for this extremely basic categorization error in at least one state the answer appears to have been politics of the prisoner s dilemma variety if another state is including serological tests and they re ranked above virginia and we are not and we re getting criticized for that hey you can t win either way a top virginia official told reporters earlier this month now we are including them and our ranking will be better and we re being criticized the cdc s decision to begin lumping the data this week has seemingly given the other states cover to fess up to the practice too in a statement the georgia department of public health insisted that it was following current centers for disease control and prevention methodology in lumping the numbers together what s less clear is why the cdc opted to do the same in the first place while many have assumed that this too was a political decision designed to airbrush the federal pandemic response it s unclear that lumping all the nation s prc and serology tests together would actually lower the test positivity rate overall in states that are still early on in their pandemic curves lumping in serology tests drives down the rate dramatically but in states like new york and new jersey that have already crested the wave of new infections lumping in serology tests would actually bump test positivity higher since so many people have already had the disease as time goes on and the ratio of people who have the disease compared to those who have had it continues to shrink combining the data would serve less and less of a political purpose to anybody in other words it s an open question whether putting serology and pcr tests in the same data bucket actually makes the data look rosier what s undeniable is that it makes the data itself far far worse it s horrible dr howard forman a professor of public health at yale told the dispatch it s like the stupidest thing to do and it doesn t even serve any political end i don t even think that they re doing it purposely to be deceptive i think they re being lazy if there s a silver lining here it s that this problem now brought to light shouldn t be too difficult to rectify keeping these two dissimilar data sets separate statistically is the easiest thing in the world all states and the cdc have to do is stop mixing them within a week or two we ll hopefully have a clear picture again of where our testing operation stands the bigger issue forman said is how this debacle reflects on the reliability of the cdc and their aptness to handle the current crisis in general for months the cdc has done a subpar job tracking and publishing state testing numbers at all largely ceding that collating work to outside outfits like the covid tracking project for them now to have flubbed such a foundational element of that work is not an encouraging sign let s face it the apparatus that you would have to put in place to have done this part of things really well is tiny forman said it s a less than a million dollar a year operation right four analysts with phones and a couple of higher level associates tracking data from 50 states telling them the deadline that they have to have for reporting data to you i can t for the life of me get my head wrapped around why we haven t fixed something as simple as that photograph by paul hennessy echoes wire barcroft media getty images we sent an email to with a link to finish logging in i would love to have an article examining the turnover and hiring efforts of scientific staff during this administration everywhere else in the trump administration we have seen open positions being unable to hire the best talent because of opposition to trump during primaries hiring cronies into key positions etc i remember when tillerson was sos doesn t that feel like a lifetime ago there were reports that the state department was so understaffed that they didn t have enough personnel to attend key meetings in south america i have worked at startups all my professional life and i have a sense of when a problem comes from being understaffed or not having the right talent thedispatch could you please look at the current staffing overall i found this article from 2017 and i don t really have the time to research this to my liking on my own or of course have the contacts to get background from former officials i d like to know if this was rectified or addressed in the last 2 3 years https www washingtonpost com news to your health wp 2017 05 19 nearly 700 vacancies at cdc because of trump administration hiring freeze though hhs has exempted many positions from the freeze including physicians and personnel who respond to cybersecurity and public health emergencies many support personnel who often play critical roles have been affected it s all the operational details said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because cdc staff are not permitted to comment publicly without approval from hhs the situation has been made worse the official said because the agency has been operating without a permanent director since tom frieden stepped down in january that job is considered one of the most crucial public health positions in the government given the cdc s role in tracking and stopping infectious disease outbreaks in the united states and worldwide this is what happens when your first and most important interview question is did you vote for donald
