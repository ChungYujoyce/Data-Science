apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the fbi s four wiretap affidavits to a federal judge in 2016 and 2017 deliberately hid a part of trump campaign volunteer carter page s professional life that would have revealed his patriotic role as a cia informant instead of the bureau s nefarious depiction the justice department inspector general s report shows the 476 page history of how the fbi targeted the trump campaign contains over a dozen instances in which the fbi violated its own rules by including inaccuracies in the foreign intelligence surveillance act applications or omitting exculpatory evidence perhaps none was more damaging than the actions of fbi attorney kevin clinesmith whose social media posts revealed a deep dislike of president trump top stories sex at birth

democracy is at risk during the drafting of fisa warrants in 2016 and 2017 the cia confirmed to the fbi that mr page a naval academy graduate and energy investor who joined the trump campaign as an adviser served as an informant from 2008 to 2013 that biographical fact never made it into any affidavit in 2017 the cia sent an email to the fbi restating that mr page had been an asset mr clinesmith who is not named in the inspector general s report altered the email to say mr page was not an asset sen lindsey graham south carolina republican outed mr clinesmith on wednesday during the senate judiciary committee hearing with justice department inspector general michael e horowitz mr graham gave his theory about why mr clinesmith lied what does that matter mr graham said because if the court had known then there is a lawful reason for mr page to be talking to the russian guy he wasn t working against his country he was working with his country which undercuts the idea he is a foreign agent that s why clinesmith lied because he didn t want to stop this investigation rep mark meadows north carolina republican first outed mr clinesmith in june 2018 as one of five fbi officials identified as fbi attorney 2 called out in a previous inspector general s report for bad mouthing mr trump to understand how mr clinesmith s deception harmed mr page the story starts in new york in 2013 the future trump associate ran his own energy investment firm and was looking for opportunities in oil and gas rich russia he lived in moscow in the mid 2000s while working as a merrill lynch banker and at that point apparently became a cia source in new york he met victor podobnyy at an energy symposium in january 2013 mr page was working for u s intelligence but had been inactive for a year moscow posted mr podobnyy as a united nations diplomat but he actually was a spy for the svr the russian cia mr podobnyy and two countrymen ran an espionage ring and tried to recruit mr page as he sought help in making money via russian energy mr podobnyy whose calls were intercepted by the fbi according to a justice department filing in 2015 played along with mr page s desire to find a business deal in russia the recruitment ended in june 2013 when fbi agents interviewed mr page who is identified as male 1 in court documents one of the three russian spies was convicted of espionage mr podobnyy and a comrade had left the u s by the time the government filed charges mr page cooperated he was never charged fast forward to the fall of 2016 when the fbi and its crossfire hurricane team were drafting what would be the first of four fisa warrants that would allow the government to electronically spy on mr page for a year agents also could monitor his activities for the campaign emails texts and documents would all be in play included in all four warrant applications was mr page s contact with mr podobnyy the justice department released the heavily redacted application in 2018 under pressure from rep devin nunes a california republican who then led the house permanent select committee on intelligence mr nunes accused the fbi of violating its own fisa rules the inspector general s report released monday supported his allegations altered document by september 2016 the fbi was finishing the first warrant on mr page its prime piece of evidence was the now discredited christopher steele dossier sourced to the kremlin and financed by the democratic national committee and the hillary clinton presidential campaign an fbi attorney for the office of intelligence asked whether mr page as he claimed had worked for other intelligence agencies a crossfire hurricane agent said that perhaps briefly when he lived in moscow based on that response the attorney did not include that part of mr page s biography the agent s information was inaccurate an aug 17 2016 memo from the cia the inspector general s report describes it simply as another agency said mr page had been approved as an operational contact in 2008 and reported his contacts with russian intelligence agents in 2009 when agents interviewed mr page in 2013 he told them he had been a cia source for years the fbi included none of this in the fisa applications as it should have been the inspector general said when news leaked in june 2017 that the fbi had bugged mr page he went public to deny the steele dossier s allegations against him he also said he had been a u s intelligence source at that point mr clinesmith identified in the inspector general s report as the fbi office of general counsel or ogc attorney sent an email to the cia asking for confirmation the cia answered that the fbi should review its august 2016 memorandum and that mr page did indeed have a working relationship here is where mr clinesmith s skullduggery occurred according to the inspector general the ogc attorney told the fisa agent that page had never had a relationship with the other u s government agency in addition the ogc attorney altered the email that the other u s government agency had sent to the ogc attorney so that the email stated that page had not been a source for the other agency the ogc attorney then forwarded the altered email to the fisa agent who told us he relied on the email afterward the agent completed the last of four three month fisa warrants without including mr page s cia work the office of intelligence attorney told the inspector general it would have been a significant fact if page had a relationship with the other u s government agency that overlapped in time with his interactions with known russian intelligence officers described in the fisa applications because it would raise the issue of whether page interacted with the russian intelligence officers at the behest of the other agency or with the intent to assist the u s government the new york times reported that mr clinesmith is under criminal investigation by john durham the u s attorney for connecticut attorney general william p barr named mr durham to investigate the origins of the fbi russia probe mr barr told nbc news on tuesday that he disagrees with mr horowitz s conclusion that the investigation into the trump campaign was justified mr clinesmith moved from the fbi s office of general counsel to special counsel robert mueller s probe he resigned in 2018
