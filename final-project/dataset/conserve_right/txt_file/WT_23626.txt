reporter anthony cormier made the blunt assessment at a investigative journalism symposium he is a prominent player in the buzzfeed investigative unit that obtained the dossier but wasn t a story

interference the dossier was complied by ex british intelligence officer christopher steele who was financed by the hillary clinton campaign and democratic national committee he asserted there was an extensive conspiracy between the trump campaign and the kremlin to interfere in the 2016 election mr mueller said he found no such conspiracy that f ked up document mr cormier said i m going to say that it was a f ked up document i think we need to know more about where it came from why it is what it means but i still defend the right and decision to publish it because i believe in radical transparency and if the u s government is passing that kind of intel to the president and president elect i think you guys deserve to know mr cormier is referring to the fact that president obama s

story at the time and his 448 report contains no such charge it quotes mr cohen as saying mr trump told him to cooperate with congress the clinton camp made sure the dossier was as widely circulated
