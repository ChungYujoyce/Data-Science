opinion analysis opinion this may be the most entertaining road show yet round and round the presidential campaign goes and where it stops nobody knows even mitt romney is said to be thinking about jumping in again no doubt figuring that some of jeb s investors who are familiar indeed may be looking for another place to place their bets hillary clinton s campaign still gets respectful attention but nobody s any longer practicing what to call her if as in a prospect ever more unlikely she s actually elected madame president that sounds like something from a bordello or worse from france mrs president the feminists wouldn t like that because it pays homage to a husband miss president sounds like everybody s seventh period latin teacher perhaps fetching in her own way but not much fun top stories purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni australian researchers see virus design manipulation coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history joe biden everybody s good old slightly daffy uncle lovable but prone to gaffes boners and extravagant slips not only of the tongue but sometimes of the brain like his suggestion meant to warm the hearts of gun owners that if you hear a varmint or a prowler in the middle of the night the thing to do is to take your shotgun to the front porch and blast away at the night hoping nobody is still up across the street is optional the republican establishment has the opposite problem they re having to quit laughing at donald trump and start taking him seriously he keeps increasing his polling lead over the field and where that stops nobody knows either he s an outlier the currently fashionable 2 word for outsider but he s not as outsiderly as he used to be the liberal media the greek chorus assigned to enlightening the halt the unhip and the dumb spent the weekend chortling over the fact that the donald attracted only 20 000 fans to a football stadium that seats 30 000 in mobile the cops wisely declined to offer an estimate of the size of the crowd but it was bigger than anyone else has drawn so far who but the donald who compared it to a crowd at a billy graham revival meeting would risk holding a political rally in a football stadium in alabama exposing empty seats and inviting unwanted comparisons president obama himself threw a big flat rock in the democratic pond on monday with a resounding splash he sent his press agent out to suggest to reporters that he might endorse someone in the democratic primaries and it didn t sound like he was talking about hillary the president said press secretary josh earnest thinks taking joe biden on his ticket seven years ago was the smartest political decision he ever made he reminded everyone that he had spoken warmly about hillary too then it was back to praising good old joe i ll just say that the vice president is somebody who has already run for president twice he s been on a national ticket through two election cycles so i think you could make the case that there is no one who has a better understanding of exactly what is required to mount a successful national presidential campaign i wouldn t rule out the possibility of an endorsement in the democratic primary a press agent always speaks for the man who pays him so we can safely assume that mr earnest didn t make a semi endorsement sort of on his own mr obama s endorsement would be valuable in a democratic primary a signal that he has found someone who will protect his legacy such as it will be in the general election his endorsement might be a sloppy kiss of death where voters of all kinds could rush to make the judgment that is likely to be the verdict of history mr obama was a freak of history elected by a well meaning but naive electorate eager to show good faith and hope for the best taking a flier is rarely a substitute for making a sound judgment nominating a candidate with little political experience can be tempting the republicans tried it in 1940 nominating wendell willkie a wall street lawyer who had never been elected to anything thinking everyone shared their contempt for franklin d roosevelt that s what terrifies the republican establishment about donald trump if the establishment understood politics a little better than it does establishment republicans would recognize how they brought the donald to political prominence themselves the establishment doesn t understand how cable tv the internet and a succession of mushmouth candidates have changed everything the republican grass roots hankers for rough justice applied without mercy these are the grass roots that are a minority of a minority but they re loud they re angry and they re out for blood wesley pruden is editor emeritus of the washington times manage newsletters
