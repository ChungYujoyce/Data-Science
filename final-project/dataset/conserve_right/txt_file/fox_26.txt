mcdaniel reacts to former fbi director s appearance before the senate intelligence committee this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday june 11 2017 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news anchor i aposm chris wallace now that former fbi director james comey has told his story where the investigations in the trump agenda go from here begin videotape james comey former fbi director i don apost think it aposs for me to say whether the conversation i had with the president was an effort to obstruct donald trump president of the united states no collusion no obstruction he aposs a leaker but we want to get back to running our great country wallace we aposll discuss comey aposs damaging testimony with republican party chair ronna mcdaniel and ask how the trump white house and gop can rebound ph it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive then questions still linger about possible links to russia and whether the president tried to obstruct the investigation reporter would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of these events trump one hundred percent wallace we aposll discuss the continuing probes in congress and by the special counsel with democrat jack reed who serves on the senate intelligence committee and says he expects president trump to face a deposition plus british prime minister theresa may tries to hold onto power after losing her majority in parliament theresa may british prime minister i will now form a government a government that can provide certainty and lead britain forward at this critical time for our country wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel what it means for the future of europe and relations between the u s and our closest allies and our power player of the week some words of wisdom for the class of 2017 oprah winfrey tv host when you don apost know what to do you do nothing wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington president trump is claiming victory after former fbi director james comey aposs testimony this week saying there aposs no evidence of collusion with the russians or obstruction of justice but the president recognizes the investigation isn apost over saying he would 100 percent testify under oath before the special counsel where did the investigations and trump agenda go from here joining me now the chair of the republican party ronna mcdaniel ms mcdaniel the president has been tweeting today i want to put up one of those tweets here it is i believe the james comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible totally illegal very cowardly what do you think the fact that comey admits that he leaked at least one memo to the press what do you think that indicates about the former fbi director ronna mcdaniel rnc chairwoman i think it shows how questionable his character is that he would take conversations that he had with the president of the united states which should be protected under executive privilege and then he gave them to a friend to leak to the new york times i think it proves that the president made the right choice in firing director comey and it brings into a great question some of the decision making he made as fbi director and since wallace now the president on friday after comey aposs testimony said that he viewed that testimony as quote total vindication but in his testimony the mr comey said that the president he repeatedly said that he lies he said the president in a private dinner sought a pledge of loyalty that in an oval office meeting he basically asked comey to let the flynn investigation go total vindication mcdaniel listen chris we have to keep in mind that this is one person aposs record of what happened the only two people who know what happened in those meetings are the president and james comey so james comey put forward his memos his recollection but that aposs his version of events the things that james comey said with regard to the president that he aposs not under investigation he aposs never been under investigation that there aposs been no obstruction that there aposs been no effort to impede the investigation those are things we aposve heard across from many witnesses and many other individuals so that corroborated exactly what the president has been saying all along but i think james comey aposs testimony as just his version of events and it aposs important that we look at it that way wallace you created an opposition team and operation inside the rnc this week to defend the president against james comey you had 60 staffers who sent out thousands of tweets with the hashtag bigleaguetruth question why is it appropriate to have a trump war room inside the rnc mcdaniel well the rnc is always going to defend the president but listen it aposs so lopsided out there there aposs so much distortion it aposs important that we are pushing back on some of the stories that are just fake and to watch james comey go in front of the senate we wanted to make sure that it aposs reported correctly what we learn from him we learned that as fbi director attorney general lynch said to him we don apost like that the way you aposre referring to the hillary clinton investigation can you please call it a matter and he did that we learned that he leaked memos that he put together from conversations he had with the president the president of the united states that were protected under executive privilege and that he leaked them to the press all of those things should be called into question and it aposs up to the rnc to push back we aposre going to support the president of the united states wallace but do you have any concerns as chair of the rnc to have any concerns about tying the party too closely to this president given all of his political and potentially legal problems mcdaniel absolutely not we support the president 100 percent and we are the political arm of the white house and that aposs the role the rnc has traditionally played but i aposll tell you i feel like the coverage has been imbalanced i feel like the truth is not getting out there and so we aposre going to push harder because we want to make sure that the american people are hearing a different narrative and the right set of the right version of what aposs happening wallace now you say that you aposre going to push harder there are a couple of investigations several investigations going on you aposve got the senate intelligence committee the house intelligence committee you say that you have confidence in a special counsel robert mueller but former speaker newt gingrich we did this republicans need to focus on closing down independent counsel because it clearly isn apost independent do support that closing down the special counsel mcdaniel i aposm not going to get into what the special counsel should or shouldn apost do or if it should go on what i will say is the trump administration is complying 100 percent they want this done they want to move on listen the democrats have a playbook chris we know it it aposs resist obstruct we see them do it at every level resisting the president on things like helping the american people on obamacare you aposve seen obstruction with things as critical as the supreme court nominee that they knew was highly qualified in neil gorsuch and now it aposs throw doubt on the administration open as many investigations as possible cloud the administration as much as possible because they are trying to run out the clock to 2018 that is their playbook we know it here aposs what we found from jim comey the president has never been under investigation there aposs been no obstruction no one has asked him ph to impede wallace wait wait now comey didn apost say that he said that aposs up to the special counsel mcdaniel yes in his testimony though he said he aposd never been asked to stop the investigation by the president he said that he said were you directly asked to stop the investigation he said no to me that aposs no obstruction so we learned a lot from james comey that these investigations are going to keep going forward if the democrats have their way the american people want it to stop the trump administration is working 100 percent cooperating with all of these investigations but it needs to end this is a fishing expedition to try and run out the clock for the democrats hoping to make gains in 2018 wallace are you calling for an end to the senate and house intelligence committee investigations mcdaniel i aposm calling for an end to the investigations about the president trump aposs campaign colluding with the russians there aposs been no evidence of it i don apost think that should continue of course we need to figure out what russia did with regards to the election the president has said that but not yet do you have a single senator saying that there is definitive evidence that there aposs been any collusion between the trump campaign and the russians that needs to stop wallace and when it comes to the special counsel do you believe that that investigation specifically on the issue of possible collusion between the trump campaign and the russians do you think that should stop mcdaniel well that aposs going to run its course we aposll see what happens i think it should end quickly i want them to get to a final conclusion soon because this needs to end nobody has come forward with any evidence that there aposs been collusion between the trump campaign and the russians and it keeps persisting so it aposs time to put an end to this let aposs let the special investigation take its course and end but let aposs not keep finding ways to open new investigations wallace all right let me excuse me ask you one question more about the special counsel the president seemed to make a pledge a promise in the news conference on friday should he keep his promise and testify under oath before the special counsel mcdaniel that aposs going to be up to the president and his legal counsel to determine that but what it does signal is that the president is going to cooperate 100 percent he wants this done he aposs focused on the american people and helping make better health care and tax reform and national security he wants this over with this is a distraction wallace i aposm going to get to the agenda in a second one more question in this regard though some republicans are defending the president aposs actions as comey laid them out as others have laid them out by saying that he basically doesn apost know any better take a look begin video clip sen marco rubio r fla intelligence committee no one has either informed him or he aposs been unwilling to be informed about why the sort of request like the one he made would be inappropriate rep paul ryan r wis speaker of the house his new at government and so therefore i think that he he aposs learning as he goes end video clip wallace chairwoman mcdaniel do you buy that defense that if the president did something anything inappropriate it aposs because he aposs basically an amateur mcdaniel chris i aposm going to go back to this was just james comey aposs version of events we don apost know what happened in these conversations that aposs his interpretation i take the president at his word but that aposs just one person aposs version of events the president knows what he aposs doing and let aposs go back to what james comey even said say has version is true and he said the president said i hope you let this go he said i aposm a mom of kids there aposs the difference between saying i hope you do your homework and go to your homework donald trump president donald trump is somebody who speaks definitively he aposs somebody who when he talks to you you know what he means so again this is all james comey aposs version of events and we aposve got to look at it that way wallace as you said the president wants to end all of this to get on with his agenda to help the american people here was the reaction though this week from house democratic leader nancy pelosi begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d cali house minority leader how dare the republicans and the president say this investigation into the integrity of our elections and government is an impediment to our getting our agenda through what agenda show us the job show us the agenda where are the bills end video clip wallace doesn apost pelosi have a point there aposs no tax reform bill that the white house has submitted there aposs no infrastructure build the white house has submitted and obamacare repeal and replace is tied up in the senate mcdaniel well president trump has passed 37 laws in his first five and a half months as president more than any of the past four administrations he aposs hit the ground running wallace but wait a second i mean we aposre talking about big legislative agendas i aposm sure there are a bunch of laws but you know his main legislative agendas health care reform tax reform infrastructure the only one that aposs even passed one house is health care reform you aposve got a majority a republican majority in the house and senate under budget reconciliation you could pass them without any democratic support why haven apost you mcdaniel well let aposs go back 37 laws deregulation he aposs restored our standing as a global leader across the world with his foreign trips and his decisive actions in syria but let aposs go back health care tax form infrastructure these are huge issues they don apost just happen overnight we aposre five and a half months in the house has already passed the repeal and replace of obamacare we aposre going to continue to work at that but this just doesn apost quickly happen and republicans are doing it the right way we aposre going back into our districts we aposre talking to constituents we aposre having a diverse discussion we aposre making sure that when we do it we do it right because we recognize the failures of obamacare passing 30 000 pages of legislation quickly ramming it through without anybody looking at it now look at what it aposs done across this country it is failing you have insurers pulling out of marketplace you have people whose premiums have doubled if we aposre going to fix this we have to make sure we do it right and not rush it through wallace all right mcdaniel five and a half months is pretty early to have all of those things done and we aposre making very strong progress the president is laser focused on helping the american people wallace final question i got less than a minute left quinnipiac came out this week with a new poll and let aposs take a look at that mr trump aposs approval now stands at 34 percent disapproval at 57 percent that aposs the lowest we can find for any president this early in his first term isn apost the president at this point a drag on republicans and your agenda mcdaniel absolutely not you look at the montana special election with greg gianforte who had lost in november running for governor by four points he wrapped himself around the president he had donald trump jr in there and he won by seven in a state with a democrat governor and a democrat senator the president resonates with our base he has faced more obstruction more resistance and more negative media than any president in our history but he aposs going to keep laser focused on policies that help the american people and you aposre going to see all those numbers rebounded as they start to feel that in their everyday lives wallace chairwoman mcdaniel thank you thanks for your time this week and please come back mcdaniel thanks for having me will do wallace up next we aposll get reaction from democratic senator jack reed who is calling for the president to tell his side of the story under oath commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway at the busy harbor in newport rhode island that looks familiar to you doesn apost it sen jack reed d ri ranking member armed services committee it does wallace president trump says he would be glad to testify under oath to dispute james comey aposs account of their meetings now the question is will he joining me is jack reed the top democrat on the senate armed services committee who also serves on the senate intelligence committee the senator who is from rhode island and newport welcome back to fox news sunday reed thanks chris wallace let aposs start with the president aposs pledge in the rose garden on friday to tell his side of his conversations with james comey here he is begin video clip reporter would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of these events donald trump president of the united states one hundred percent reporter if robert mueller wanted to speak with you about that you trump i would be glad to tell him exactly what i just told you jon end video clip wallace senator before that you said you thought that the president should face a deposition are you willing to take yes for an answer reed indeed i am but the deposition is not just about his conversations with mr comey there aposs issues with respect to his conversations with director of national intelligence coats admiral rogers the nsa director his relationships with manafort by the time the special prosecutor mr mueller is ready to depose or ask the president to speak under oath there will be a myriad of questions so what i don apost want to see is simply well i just said i would talk about comey i aposm not talking about anything else to resolve the situation he has to be prepared to speak on all these matters wallace would you also like to see the president testify under oath before congress reed well that raises the issue of separation of powers frankly and at that point i think there aposs some the history would suggest that that aposs not done often the special prosecutor mr mueller is the person that is charged to conduct this investigation and i believe he is the appropriate individual to conduct through his staff these investigations wallace in his testimony james comey acknowledged that he had repeatedly told the president that he is not a target of an investigation with regard to collusion with the russians here aposs one instance begin video clip james comey former fbi director we briefed the congressional leadership about what americans we had opened counterintelligence investigation cases on and we specifically said the president is not one of those americans end video clip wallace given the fact that this investigation clearly puts the president under a cloud and hinders his visibility to do his job does congress including democrats do you feel a need to wrap up this investigation as quickly as possible and what do you think about the republican national committee chairwoman ms mcdaniel just said which is that when it comes to collusion you should stop your investigations reed well no i don apost think that aposs at all appropriate i think the special prosecutor has to look at all the different aspects of this investigation and there are multiple manafort aposs actions while he was chairman of the republican committee the trump committee wallace paul manafort who was campaign manager reed exactly all those things it goes back carter wallace page reed page carter page all these people and then he has to come and i think present the president with a list of questions that only the president can answer and the president should answer truthfully under oath to those questions wallace well what about the suggestion because she said that the special counsel should go ahead but what about ms mcdaniel aposs suggestion congress should wrap it up reed well no we have a separate obligation the intelligence committee in a bipartisan basis and what aposs remarkable this is truly bipartisan senator burr is the chairman senator warner a ranking member we aposre conducting investigation because i think one thing that the president continues to diminish which i think is unfortunate is the fact that the russian government at the highest level deliberately interfered with our election in 2016 and according to all of our experts in the intelligence community they are coming back with more force in apos18 and apos20 we have as a legislative matter find out what they did why they did it how we can prevent it do we need statutory improvements do we need to empower our agencies to do something else so we have a separate mission in addition to finding out what went on is how do we fix it wallace but forgive me senator i mean i watched all three hours of the hearing reed right wallace there was precious little talk about what the russians did it was all about president trump reed well it was about president trump but director comey made several points very emphatically that we should understand that this attack this hostile action by the russians was unprecedented that it continues and that one of the reasons that he was so conscious of conducting this investigation was not to sort of look back and you know appropriately charge people who may have done something wrong but that he was also looking forward to what could happen and what would likely happen in apos18 and in apos20 wallace all right you reed and he said that repeatedly wallace you also heard this week from admiral mike rogers who aposs the head of the national security agency here he is begin video clip admiral mike rogers nsa director i had never been directed to do anything i believe to be illegal immoral unethical or inappropriate and to the best of my recollection during that same period of service i do not recall ever feeling pressured to do so end video clip wallace again as we sit here today do you have any evidence of the president president trump being involved in collusion with the russians or being engaged in an obstruction of justice reed there are questions that have been raised about the involvement of his campaign there aposve been questions raised about his contact with admiral rogers admiral rogers refused as did director of national intelligence coats to say if he was asked by the president to in any way exonerate them and the wallace yes but wait a minute though he did say and you just heard reed i did wallace i aposve never been directed to do anything illegal immoral unethical or inappropriate reed i aposve never been directed but i think what we saw there was two individuals who are very uncomfortable answering and ultimately when i asked them on were you asked and senator king repeatedly asked the same question they refused to answer and the obvious point that i made was if you were never asked it would be very easy and almost reflexive to say no i was never asked they wouldn apost do that they couldn apost do that so there aposs a whole series of issues about the president aposs conduct does it constitute a pattern of trying to get pressure relieved off of this investigation and the president himself when he met with the russian foreign minister declared that you know first of all i got rid of that crazy nut job mueller i think excuse me comey i think frankly mr comey demonstrated he aposs not a crazy nut job second he said the russian investigation the pressure is off now et cetera and that aposs the russian foreign minister as well as leaking other classified intelligence information at that meeting so the president himself has declared that his purpose was to somehow throttle this investigation into russian participation all of these things add up to very serious set of potential charges perhaps not against the president but certainly against individuals surrounding him wallace all right well let aposs talk about one of those individuals attorney general sessions testifies before senate intelligence on tuesday you will be there on the panel what do you want to hear from him reed well first there aposs a question on his participation in the firing of director comey he had already recused himself and then suddenly he aposs the one apparently recommending to the president that comey be fired and the president has indicated suggested not suggested declared it was all about the russian investigation so there is a real question of the propriety of the attorney general participating in that in any way shape or form then there aposs been allegations publicly of meetings that go beyond the meetings that he aposs already declared he had with representatives of russian government that will come up wallace well let me ask about that do you have any evidence that he met there are two times now that he aposs on the record as having said he met with russian ambassador sergey kislyak do you have any evidence that he met with him in other times reed it aposs an open question i think it aposs also one of those questions that because of some of the classifying reports it aposs inappropriate to comment upon it wallace former national security advisor michael flynn has been a special focus of this investigation he held repeated meetings with the russians he aposs the one that the president allegedly reed right wallace told comey to go easy on how important is flynn to this investigation reed well i think at this point he aposs one of the key figures he was involved apparently from reports that have not been refuted with contacts with the russians the question again it goes back to why the questioning the president will not be restricted and discrete to the comey situation you know what did general flynn tell the president was he directed by the president to initiate these conversations were these appropriate conversations but i think general flynn is someone who is the key focus of the investigation now not the exclusive focus but the key focus wallace the key focus reed well i think so because i think working through general flynn that will develop other possible connections other possible leads and again this appears and i think again former fbi director mueller is probably the best person to do this investigation he aposs taking a very broad view but i think it begins simply because in terms of sort of the timing the dismissal of general flynn as national security adviser has triggered a lot of this interest a lot of the investigations comey was working to make sure that that investigation was going forward wallace finally we got 30 seconds left reed yes wallace will this investigation on the hill with the special counsel will it still be going on a year from today reed i hope not it certainly is not going to be resolved in a few weeks or a few months because and i think the pace will be set by special prosecutor mueller he will be the one that will drive sort of the timing of this case wallace senator thank you thanks for joining us always good to talk with you sir reed thank you chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group including former speaker newt gingrich to discuss his idea to shut down the special counsel plus what would you like to ask the panel about comey aposs testimony and what it means for the president just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up british prime minister theresa may goes back to work after losing her majority begin video clip theresa may british prime minister at this critical time for our country it aposs important to form a government in the national interest end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the future of brexit and relations between the u s and our closest ally commercial break begin video clip comey well there is a big difference in kicking superior officers out of the oval office looking the fbi director in the eye and saying i hope you let this go i think if our if the agents as good as they are heard the president of the united states did that is a real risk of a chilling effect on their work marc kasowitz trump personal attorney the president never in form or substance directed or suggested that mr comey stop investigating anyone end video clip chris wallace fox anchor a sharp disagreement between james comey and president trump aposs lawyer marc kasowitz over whether the president wanted the fbi to shut down its investigation of former national security advisor michael flynn and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove charles lane of the washington post former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and former speaker newt gingrich author of the upcoming book understanding trump out this tuesday that must be a long book newt gingrich former house speaker yes it aposs interesting wallace i aposm sure it is speaker gingrich i want to speak to you about something else though and i want to start with the your tweet that i discussed earlier with republican chairwoman ronna mcdaniel here it is up on the screen again republicans need to focus on closing down independent counsel because it clearly isn apost independent what aposs your reasoning and wouldn apost that really look like an obstruction of justice gingrich well first of all look at what comey said comey said i deliberately leaked through an intermediary to create this counsel who happens to be one of his closest friends then look at who mueller aposs starting to hire i mean these are people that frankly look look to me like they aposre they aposre setting up to go after trump they aposve including people by the way who have been reprimanded for hiding from the defense information into major cases i think this this is going to be a witch hunt i think that comey himself by his own testimony tainted this particular process you have a director of the fbi deliberately leaking in order to create a special counsel who we aposre now supposed to believe is going to be this neutral figure i think that aposs just nonsense wallace let me bring you in congresswoman edwards and let aposs go back as the speaker suggested to james comey aposs testimony about one of his leaks here he is begin video clip comey i asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter i didn apost do it myself for a variety of reasons but i asked him to because i thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel end video clip wallace comey says he set the special prosecutor process in motion taking the word that was used by the speaker does that taint it donna edwards former u s congresswoman d md no it doesn apost tainted it at all and in fact i think it aposs really shocking that the speaker and others are challenging the credibility not just of james comey but also of the special counselor mueller i mean nobody on capitol hill has been questioning the integrity and the independence of the special counsel and i think it was a you know appropriate i man the james comey heard the president say things that were untrue and that were a mischaracterization of their their meetings and he put out in the public sphere not classified information information that he had prepared and it wasn apost a leak into the public sphere and i think it aposs appropriate for the special counsel to look into that to investigate that that aposs why the special counsel aposs in place wallace karl karl rove fox news contributor well i thought it was interesting you played the piece of tape of comey saying if this got out that the president said to me in the oval office i hope you can let let this thing go that it would have had a chilling effect on the fbi agency because comey proceeded to talk about the incident widely within the fbi widely enough in the fbi that wallace not the investigating officers just with his top friends ph rove well but widely enough within the top staff of the fbi that it got printed in the new york times on the 11th of may so or no excuse me before that before before the presidents tweet that supposedly wallace no that was the loyalty pledge but anyway rove right right but the point the point wallace but to this question of mueller and whether or not he aposs rove look look i we do i think it would be a huge mistake to try and checked down the special counsel this would leave the trump administration the trump presidency under a cloud until the very last day and make it an ongoing issue i do have confidence in mueller i the question is is robert mueller patrick fitzgerald or not is he going to look for an underlying act and focus on the underlying act wallace now we should point out patrick fitzgerald was the special counsel in the case about valerie plame and the leak of that information rove and the day that he took the day he took his responsibility he knew exactly who had leaked her name richard armitage undersecretary of state he knew she was not a covered person that there was no underlying effort chuck aposs paper when they found out when it was was several years later revealed that it was richard armitage they said well why why did we even go through all this exercise because everybody knows richard armitage had no axe to grind but the but he ground an axe for a long period of time trying to find people that he could indict on the fact that they had said one thing in in that he could get them on and he got scooter libby on the fact that he had not that he said wallace let me let me let me let me just move on because we aposre i i don apost want to talk about scooter libby i i will say you were also a target and you ended up spending a whole pile of money on private legal fees rove yes charles lane the washington post inaudible wallace wait let me just bring in chuck so we were all here go ahead lane well this gets really really complicated but wallace well let aposs keep it simple should robert mueller be able to should he stay on or should he be shut down is he tainted lane of course of course he should stay on and and honestly if republicans were thinking about their own best political interest that aposs what they aposd want for two reasons he aposs widely regarded notwithstanding what we just heard here by republicans and democrats on the hill as an honest broker in this affair secondly it gives it a channel for all the discussion and all the investigation to go through one pipeline instead of 50 different committees and 50 different leaks it aposs it it aposs actually in the republicans apos own the president aposs own interest to have it go through this process but look let aposs look at the big picture here i aposm not in any position to say whether a particular crime or impeachable offense occurred but what i am and i think we aposre all in a position to say after this testimony the last week the president of the united states did something terribly inappropriate he misused his authority by engaging in that kind of meeting in that kind of conversation with jim comey under those circumstances and backhandedly paul ryan is admitting it by saying in effect at this is what a person doesn apost understand government would do and that all by itself that ought to ought to be a source of great concern rove president aposs often presidents often do stupid things but this is not obstruction of justice this is not illegal he is the head of the executive branch of government lane i didn apost say he was i specifically said i don apost know whether he did rove listen he aposs the head of the executive branch he could have directed him to end the investigation lane he could have pardoned mike flynn actually rove he could have pardoned mike flynn but he could have directed him to end the investigation and it still would have been appropriate he would have had a huge political price to pay but he aposs the head of the executive branch of government we once had an fbi director who thought he did not report and was independent of any authority his name was j edgar hoover and and lane and i would respect the president a lot more if he stood up and and in an unaccountable way called a press conference and said i aposm pardoning mike flynn this is over edwards well i mean but what what defines that is that the president of the united states asked everyone else to leave the room and so this idea that he aposs somehow naive and doesn apost understand what aposs going on the president has one a lot of experience with litigation and with with the law and so i think he didn apost understand what was going on he asked those other people to leave the room so that he could have an independent conversation with the fbi director wallace speaker you caused this trouble today ph go ahead gingrich well i just if you aposll put up with it for a second i want to go back to what karl said the the the special counsel in the bush years locked up a new york times reporter for 85 days to to get her to testify wallace this is the valerie plame investigation of the leak i just want to explain it to folks gingrich right right eighty five days a reporter aposs locked up to get her to testify to something she later writes a book saying was a lie that she did under enormous pressure i distrust independent counsels i think that the people mueller aposs bringing in are dangerous people and any republican who thinks this counsel aposs going to be neutral is crazy it will be like expecting the post of the new york times to be accurate wallace well you aposve kind of taking the uzi out and shot at everybody here who wants you want to take offense first rove well look my point is this my point is this the the die is cast if the president i think chuck is right look i don apost see anything here that a that a reasonable person will say was in violation of the law the president did not obstruct justice the president did something that was inappropriate but not illegal in fact it is legal it is the president of the united states can direct him to end the investigation and he aposs within his authority as the president of the united states and he did not in fact the said i hope you go find out what those satellites manafort carter page and others were doing so i say the die is cast the president i agree with chuck the president ought to now restrain himself he and his people ought to restrain themselves they ought to keep it in this silo ph and wallace ok one last one last thing the president says he is happy to testify under oath to the special counsel that you say is engaging in a witch hunt gingrich well i think sooner or later he was going to be asked to testify under oath and i don apost think he aposs giving up much in terms of special counsel because that was going to happen wallace panel we have to take a break here when we come back british prime minister theresa may tries to hold onto power after losing her majority in parliament how will this affect brexit and relations with the u s that aposs next commercial break begin video clip theresa may british prime minister what the country needs more than ever is certainty and having secured the largest number of votes and the greatest number of seats in the general election it is clear that only the conservative and unionist party has the legitimacy and ability to provide that certainty end video clip wallace prime minister theresa may trying to hold onto her job after a stunning setback in this week aposs british elections and we aposre back now with the panel well speaker gingrich what do you think the surprise election results mean for britain for europe and for the u s gingrich well it means a lot of instability i think particularly from her standpoint because i think she aposs very shaky at staying in power and maybe we aposll have a a contest in the next few weeks i think equally important is the vote today from macron who aposs done an astonishing job of building a party in france and has a real chance wallace the french the french president gingrich the french president has a real chance of winning control of the french parliament in a way that is almost unimaginable created a party in 15 months and has competitors i think in 525 of the 555 seats so you know two different stable positions have developing ironically the french may turn out to be stable in the british may turn out to be unstable and it was both a bad campaign on their part and i think a big miscalculation because it turned out that the the united kingdom independent party voters once they had brexit reverted to being labour party voters and went back to their natural party base i think nobody in the conservative party thought that would happen wallace karl i want to pick up on brexit because the the brits were supposed to start formal negotiations with the european union which are going to take a couple of years but on the exit and the terms of the exit from from the european union brexit and now that aposs kind of up for grabs isn apost it rove well yes absolutely in fact look i happened to be flying into london the day after the morning after the brexit vote and as we got off the plane every brit on the plane turned on their phone to get the news there was a guy who i had been sitting near he was working in the financial services industry merely began swearing at older britons he said if we hadn apost let those senior buggers vote we would have won because under 35 year olds voted overwhelmingly to remain well this time around they had their revenge the young particularly those with college degrees turned out in in a much higher number and they voted for not conservative in order to thereby soften the which may had said i will have a hard exit if you re elect the conservatives and so they voted not for the conservatives in order to give a soft exit for to brexit and they got their revenge wallace so to give you a sense of karl rove there aposs something he very much wants to say go ahead rove well look i was watching the election with inaudible and we we made we got to establish this tradition in the united states we talk about texas one and congressional district one and california aposs district 35 they could brought in returns for basenstroke ph and then dumbfreshire ph clydesdale ph and tweedale ph which is one constituency it aposs got we aposve got to name each one of our districts inaudible wallace so you you would if we were doing this you would say well the clydesdale precincts are coming in and rove well i aposd say the dumbsfreshire ph clydesdale and tweedale precincts now one one one point of disagreement the labour leave vote remained with the conservatives if you were a labour ite who had voted for leave you remained largely conservatives inaudible made the election not worse than it was and the people and you kept ph you kept ph the vote 18 percent went with labour the largest share of them went conservative you kept ph this would have been a worse election had that not happened in wallace and the worst election independence party pro exit rove and a worst election and the scottish independence referendum played a role there were 13 additional seats won by the conservatives in scotland because they had been the conservatives were identified as the unionist party in the wallace let me just say folks this is after i just instructed in the commercial karl rove not to get into the weeds on this election rove this is not the weeds this is inaudible wallace ok this is pretty weedy all right the leader of the opposition labour party jeremy corbyn did not gain the majority but he still was declaring victory begin video clip jeremy corbyn labour party leader the prime minister called the election because she wanted a mandate well the mandate she aposs got is lost conservative seats lost votes lost support and lost confidence i would have thought that aposs enough to go actually end video clip wallace i like the guy on the right with the with the we need more people like that standing behind candidates congresswoman edwards does this real surprise in this election the fact i mean the reason that she called an election two years early prime minister may is because she thought she was going to expand her majority now she doesn apost have a majority and she has to deal with the northern ireland vote the unionist vote to try to get that majority in the parliament do these results mean that the anti establishment throw the people who are in power out sentiment still is running strong edwards well i think it is and i think if any i don apost want to draw too many parallels between the united states and great britain but i do think that it bodes you know dark days ahead for the incumbent establishment here in the united states and i think that you know there aposs going to be a lot wallace well who is the incumbent establishment ph edwards well i think that there republicans they aposre the ones who are in power and i think it you know really spells a lot of trouble ahead i think there still is this anti establishment sentiment going on not just here but around the world and that doesn apost bode well for the people who hold power wallace chuck edwards i mean democrats have a lot of work to do though wallace chuck prime minister may i think it aposs fair to say and there aposs not a big crowd may have been maybe donald trump aposs best friend in europe what does this do to that relationship lane well i wondered actually what the role of sort of the european and british rejection of trump what role that might have played around the margins particularly since he aposs in effect intervened with those crass remarks about the mayor of london after the terrorist attack london went overwhelmingly for labour and so that aposs a question i aposve had is whether in some complicated way this was also influenced by hostility towards trump but i just want to underscore what to me was the real headline here which is the comeback of jeremy corbyn she called this election because his poll numbers were in the were in the garbage he was down in the 30 aposs he was thought to be this played out old marxist and he didn apost shy away from any of that ideology he in effect doubled down on it and embarked on this remarkable comeback i think you know the big picture story here may be this researching not just left but ultra left in in britain it hasn apost been that way so much on the comment but the polarization that aposs gone between the tories ph and this ultra left labour party is really remarkable and there are things jeremy corbyn aposs no fan of nato by the way everybody talks about trump and nato jeremy corbyn has a long history of rejection of nato and sympathy for russia i might add so and he aposs right now on the rise and arguably if things played out a certain way could be the next prime minister he or somebody like him wallace speaker gingrich a couple of questions for you one can we blame this on donald trump may aposs loss and what role do you think he played in that and you talked about how long she can hold on to power i mean that aposs going to be very interesting i mean she has won and seems to have a a coalition a shaky coalition but she aposs got no friends in her own party gingrich well as karl knows well there aposs a studinours ph thing the conservative party in britain has a long tradition of getting rid of prime minister aposs i man wallace margaret thatcher gingrich thatcher aposs a great example so the potential for a group to gather around the foreign secretary who has wanted to be prime minister i mean the pressure on here is going to be wallace foreign boris johnson gingrich but also the the secretary who negotiating the minister who aposs negotiating brexit has a real shot here so i think there aposs a very i think his name is davies ph there aposs a very real possibility that she aposs going to face some kind of confidence vote probably not i mean brexit aposs going to move forward on schedule but probably in the next two months there aposs a real chance that she aposll face a no confidence vote wallace and will she survive that are not rove she aposll survive the confidence wallace i mean you look you aposve looked at your precincts rove yes she aposll survive the confidence vote but that may not be enough to have have the parliamentary conservatives hold her in power that aposs what happens is they aposll hold the government up they don apost want other election she loses a no confidence vote in parliament the government falls what will happen though is they aposll sustain her there but they aposll say it aposs time for you to go and she aposll go and whether it aposs boris johnson i took george osborne ph who was the former chancellor the number two guy in the government basically said she aposs got a limited amount of time and she aposs got to she aposs got to go and the look we talked about corbyn having a great campaign she ran a dreadful campaign and turned out to be a dreadful candidate wallace next week the german elections folks so study up thanks panel see you next sunday up next some surprising advice for the class of 2017 from our power players of the week commercial
