The leader of Hong Kong announced that she is withdrawing an extradition bill that has sparked mass protests across the area.

Leader Carrie Lam, 62, made the announcement Wednesday. A full withdrawal from the bill, which would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China, was one of the main demands that demonstrators had.

She had previously suspended the bill in July, although protests continued in the streets.

Lam said in a public announcement Wednesday that although the government had responded to protesters’ demands, it “may not be able to address all the grievances of people in society.” She spoke about putting dialogue before violence.

“The government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns. The Secretary for Security will move a motion according to the Rules of Procedure when the Legislative Council resumes,” Lam said, according to CNBC.

“Our foremost priority now is to end violence, to safeguard the rule of law and to restore order and safety in society. As such, the government has to strictly enforce the law against all violent and illegal acts,” she added.

In addition to withdrawing the bill, Lam said there would be “direct dialogue” with people in the special administrative region and the appointment of two new members to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Stocks in Hong Kong rallied upon the news, with the Hang Seng index gaining more than 4% value.
