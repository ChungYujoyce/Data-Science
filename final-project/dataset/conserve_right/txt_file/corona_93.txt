national review brexit architect cummings defends decision to travel amid lockdown china warns u s pushing to brink of new cold war with coronavirus accusations israel the eu and international law ending the dangerous u s dependence on china how to avoid a china led world order if the covid 19 pandemic tails off in a few weeks months before the alarmists claim it will they will probably pivot immediately and pat themselves on the back for the brilliant social distancing controls that they imposed on the world they will claim that their heroic recommendations averted total calamity unfortunately they will be wrong and sweden which has done almost no mandated social distancing will probably prove them wrong lots of people are rushing to discredit sweden s approach which relies more on calibrated precautions and isolating only the most vulnerable than on imposing a full lockdown while gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited and high schools and colleges are closed sweden has kept its borders open as well as its preschools grade schools bars restaurants parks and shops president trump has no use for sweden s nuanced approach last wednesday he smeared it in a spectacular fashion by saying he d heard that sweden gave it a shot and they saw things that were really frightening and they went immediately to shutting down the country he and the public health experts who told him this were wrong on both counts and would do better to question their approach johan giesecke sweden s former chief epidemiologist and now adviser to the swedish health agency says that other nations have taken political unconsidered actions that are not justified by the facts in the rush to lock down nations and as a result crater their economies no one has addressed this simple yet critical question how do we know social isolation controls actually work and even if they do work for some infectious epidemics do they work for covid 19 and even if they work for this novel coronavirus do they have to be implemented by a certain point in the epidemic or are they locking down the barn door after the horses are long gone in theory less physical interaction might slow the rate of new infections but without a good understanding of how long covid 19 viral particles survive in air in water and on contact surfaces even that is speculative without reliable information on what proportion of the population has already been exposed and successfully fought off the coronavirus it s worth questioning the value of social isolation controls it is possible that the fastest and safest way to flatten the curve is to allow young people to mix normally while requiring only the frail and sick to remain isolated jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription

quarantining the sick and vulnerable as fredrik erixon the director of the european centre for international political economy in brussels wrote in the spectator u k last week the theory of lockdown after all is pretty niche deeply illiberal and until now untested it s not sweden that s conducting a mass experiment it s everyone else we ve posed these simple questions to many highly trained infectious disease doctors epidemiologists mathematical disease modelers and other smart educated professionals it turns out that while you need proof beyond a reasonable doubt to convict a person of theft and throw them in jail you don t need any actual evidence much less proof to put millions of people into a highly invasive and burdensome lockdown with no end in sight and nothing to prevent the lockdown from being reimposed at the whim of public health officials is this rational when we asked what evidence is available to support the utility of quarantine and social isolation academics point to the diamond princess cruise ship with 700 covid 19 passenger cases and eight deaths but the ship is an artificially engineered densely packed container of humans that bears little resemblance to living conditions in most countries the other major evidence academics often cite is the course run by the 1918 swine flu which swept the globe 102 years ago and was not a coronavirus philadelphia did not practice social distancing during the 1918 pandemic but st louis did and had a death rate lower than philadelphia s but how is that relevant to today s crisis apart from the post hoc ergo propter hoc nature of the argument a key difference was that the gis returning from world war i europe who were carrying the swine flu virus couldn t fly nonstop from paris to st louis they had to land at east coast ports such as philadelphia it s therefore not surprising that the sick gis rested and convalesced while spreading the virus on the east coast and they got better before continuing to st louis and other interior cities basing the entire architecture of social distancing on the evidence from the 1918 swine flu makes no sense especially when that architecture causes significant destruction in the lives and livelihoods of most of the american population but the social isolation advocates frantically grasp at straws to support shutting down the world it bothers them that there is one country in the world that hasn t shut down and that hasn t socially isolated its population it bothers them because when this coronavirus epidemic is over they would probably love to conclude that social isolation worked sweden has courageously decided not to endorse a harsh quarantine and consequently it hasn t forced its residents into lockdown the strategy in sweden is to focus on social distancing among the known risk groups like the elderly we try to use evidence based measurements emma frans a doctor in epidemiology at sweden s karolinska institute told euronews we try to adjust everyday life the swedish plan is to implement measurements that you can practice for a long time the problem with lockdowns is that you tire the system out anders tegnell sweden s chief epidemiologist told the guardian you can t keep a lockdown going for months it s impossible he told britain s daily mail we can t kill all our services and unemployed people are a great threat to public health it s a factor you need to think about if social isolation worked wouldn t sweden a nordic country of 10 1 million people be seeing the number of covid 19 cases skyrocket into the tens of thousands blowing past the numbers in italy or new york city as of today there are 401 reported covid 19 deaths in sweden the really good news is that in sweden s icu census which is updated every 30 minutes nationwide admissions to every icu in the country are flat or declining and they have been for a week as of this writing based on currently available data most of sweden s icu cases today are elderly and 77 percent have underlying conditions such as heart disease respiratory disease kidney disease and diabetes moreover there hasn t been a single pediatric icu case or death in sweden so much for the benefits of shutting down schools everywhere else there are only 25 covid 19 icu admissions among all swedes under the age of 30 sweden is developing herd immunity by refusing to panic by not requiring social isolation sweden s young people spread the virus mostly asymptomatically as is supposed to happen in a normal flu season they will generate protective antibodies that make it harder and harder for the wuhan virus to reach and infect the frail and elderly who have serious underlying conditions for perspective the current covid 19 death rate in sweden 40 deaths per million of population is substantially lower than the swedish death rate in a normal flu season in 2018 for instance about 80 per million of population compare that with the situation to switzerland a similar small european country which has 8 5 million people switzerland is practicing strict social isolation yet switzerland reports 715 cumulative wuhan virus deaths as of today for a death rate nearly double the number in sweden what about norway another nordic country that shares a 1 000 mile open border with sweden with a language and culture very similar to sweden s norway population 5 4 million has fewer reported covid 19 deaths 71 than sweden but a substantially higher rate of coronavirus icu admissions on friday one of us spoke with ulf persson in his office at the swedish institute for health economics he said that everyone he knows is calm and steady behaving with more caution than normal following such government mandated social controls as a 50 person limit on gatherings and only sit down service at bars and restaurants persson estimates that the swedish economy will drop about 4 percent because of the global economic shutdowns but that s nothing compared with the great depression unemployment levels of 32 percent that the u s federal reserve board of st louis recently forecast for the united states nature s got this one folks we ve been coping with new viruses for untold generations the best way is to allow the young and healthy those for whom the virus is rarely fatal to develop antibodies and herd immunity to protect the frail and sick as time passes it will become clearer that social isolation measures like those in switzerland and norway accomplish very little in terms of reducing fatalities or disease though they crater local and national economies
