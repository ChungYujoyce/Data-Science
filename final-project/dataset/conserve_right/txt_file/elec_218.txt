have exited the presidential campaign after explosive undercover videos showed them discussing voter fraud and their roles in planting paid agitators at campaign events for republican candidate donald trump robert creamer founder of democracy advocates and the husband of rep janice d schakowsky illinois democrat stepped down from the campaign tuesday a day after scott foval was fired from his post as national field director of americans united for change mr trump who has long complained of a rigged election system said at a tuesday rally in colorado that the video released by the conservative group project veritas action confirmed his suspicions of democrat sponsored political chicanery top stories 500 doctors tell trump to end the coronavirus shutdown say it will cause more deaths oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces the protesters are paid a lot of money by the democratic national committee and they kept saying i wonder why those people are here because they never seem to have much on their mind other than stand up and protest mr trump told a crowd in colorado springs and yesterday it came out but it was barely covered by the media but it s all over the internet they were busted brad woodhouse americans united for change president said in a late monday statement that mr foval is no longer associated with americans united for change he insisted that the democratic political consulting firm has always operated according to the highest ethical and legal standards mr creamer a four decade democratic strategist who pleaded guilty in 2005 to charges of bank fraud and tax violations said in a statement that he was unwilling to become a distraction to the important task of electing hillary clinton we regret the unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations that were captured on hidden cameras of a temporary regional contractor for our firm and he is no longer with us said mr creamer who is also featured in the videos the two 16 minute videos were released monday and tuesday after a yearlong undercover investigation headed by project veritas james o keefe known for his hidden camera probes into planned parenthood acorn and voter fraud mr o keefe said the investigation reveals compelling evidence of a dark money conspiracy and that he would continue to release videos as part of a series titled rigging the election until voters go to the polls on nov 8 the first video shows democratic strategists discussing how they hire agitators including union members homeless people and the mentally ill to incite violence by provoking trump supporters on camera at campaign stops project veritas released a second video tuesday showing mr foval brainstorming over ways to commit voter fraud such as by busing people from one state to another while appearing to indicate that it had already been done in iowa it s a pretty easy thing for republicans to say well they re busing people in mr foval said well you know what we ve been busing people in to deal with you f ing assholes for 50 years and we re not going to stop now we re just going to find a different way to do it so i mean i grew up with that idea they used to bus people out to iowa if they needed people there we d bus people out to iowa the same video shows mr creamer discussing a proposal by a project veritas investigator to register people to vote illegally by setting up a shell corporation i m going to write down these options mr creamer said let me see if i can chat with the people who are most involved in hispanic voter registration mr foval who has worked for the george soros funded people for the american way said his paid agitators fueled a chicago protest in march that forced the trump campaign to cancel its event they re starting confrontations in the line right said mr foval they re not starting confrontations in the rally because once they re inside the rally they re under secret service s control when they re outside the rally the media will cover it no matter where it happens the key is initiating the conflict by having leading conversations with people who are naturally psychotic inciting trump supporters was easy he said i mean honestly it s not hard to get some of these assholes to pop off mr foval said it s a matter of showing up to want to get into the rally in a planned parenthood t shirt or trump is a nazi you know you can message to draw them out and draw them to punch you another operative aaron black who identified himself as deputy rapid response director for the dnc for all things trump on the ground said he was with mr creamer s group democracy partners but that his work was supposed to be a secret nobody s really supposed to know about me mr black said so the chicago protest when they shut all that that was us it was more mr creamer than me but none of this is supposed to come back to us because we want it coming from people we don t want it to come from the party he said the idea is for the protests to appear spontaneous not orchestrated by the dnc so if we do a protest and if it s branded a dnc protest right away the press is going to say partisan said mr black also known as aaron minter according to the video but if i m in there coordinating with all the groups on the ground and sort of playing field general but they are the ones talking to the cameras then it s actually people but if we send out press advisories with dnc on them and clinton campaign it just doesn t have the same effect he said the same day the video was released mr black posted a photo on twitter showing protesters outside trump tower holding signs with messages such as trump demeans women keeping the protesters connection to the dnc hidden from the press was a priority mr foval said we have to be really careful because what we don t need is for it to show up on cnn that the dnc paid for x people to that s not going to happen he said mr o keefe said the first video raises questions about whether the clinton campaign is coordinating with super pacs and independent expenditure committees in violation of campaign finance rules the clinton campaign dnc americans united for change and democracy partners did not return requests for comment tuesday the only public criticism of the videos has come from foes of mr o keefe s past work such as salon s brendan gauthier who said project veritas has been criticized for strategically editing footage to make false accusations in the video mr foval made clear his connections to the dnc and the clinton campaign we are contracted directly with the dnc and the campaign both i am contracted to mr creamer but i answer to the head of special events for the dnc and the head of special events and political for the campaign said mr foval he goes on to say the campaign pays dnc dnc pays democracy partners democracy partners pays the foval group the foval group goes and executes the sh on the ground mr creamer indicated that he was in close contact with the clinton campaign saying we have a call with the campaign every day to go over the focuses that need to be undertaken wherever trump and pence are going to be we have events mr creamer said and we have a whole team across the country that does that both consultants and people from the democratic party and the democratic party apparatus and people from the campaign the clinton campaign and my role in the campaign is to manage all that another activist zulema rodriguez told the project veritas investigators i just had a call today with the campaign and the dnc every day at 1 o clock she also took credit for being involved with two anti trump events in march the chicago rally and another in arizona in which anti trump protesters blocked a highway federal election commission records unearthed by project veritas show that ms rodriguez was paid nearly 2 000 on feb 29 by the hillary for america campaign in conversations with project veritas reporters mr foval described his operation as bird dogging meaning that he places hired protesters in key positions at republican campaign events often in front of rallies or lines he said he has training centers in new york washington las vegas colorado and minneapolis and that trainees include the mentally ill and homeless people i m saying we have mentally ill people that we pay to do sh make no mistake mr foval said over the last 20 years i ve paid off a few homeless guys to do some crazy stuff and i ve also taken them for dinner and i ve also made sure they had a hotel and a shower and i ve put them in a program i ve done that he also has contacts with unions such as the afl cio but the reality is a lot of people especially our union guys a lot of union guys they ll do whatever you want mr foval said they re rock n roll mr foval also made it clear that he viewed mr creamer as a mentor i work for bob creamer one to one mr foval said in the video i m the white hat democracy partners is kind of dark hat bob creamer is diabolical and i love him for it note graphic language in the video copyright 2020
