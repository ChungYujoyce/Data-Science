riddled with holes and rust the brp sierra madre has become a fragile symbol of the philippines claim to second thomas shoal an eight kilometer five mile long submerged coral outcrop that has been disputed by china and the philippines for years it s a lonely ship where pelotera and his team wage a daily battle against isolation top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time there s a point where you tend to feel low pelotera said of the challenges of his team s four month deployment at the reef where there is no land to stand on and nothing to stare at all day but sea but we

second thomas shoal in 1999 a chinese frigate and maritime surveillance ships arrived last year to press china s claim to the shoal which is believed to be sitting atop undersea oil and gas reserves the move was an example of china s increasing assertiveness in the south china sea something that is alarming the united states manila s longtime ally analysts say china s strategy is to slowly take possession of islands and outcrops in the south china sea using intimidation where necessary but avoiding any major confrontation its military might and economic dominance in the region mean it can push its weight around with little fear second thomas shoal and the nearby spratly islands lie about 120 miles 190 kilometers from the western philippine province of palawan and about 700 miles more than 1 000 kilometers from southern china china s foreign ministry says beijing has indisputable sovereignty over the shoal the sierra madre is now effectively a shipwreck but the philippine military has not decommissioned it this makes the ship an extension of the government and means any attack on the ship is tantamount to an assault against the philippines the chinese ships are around 5 miles 8 kilometers from the outpost clearly visible to those on board when associated press journalists and other members of the media were allowed to board the ship over the weekend the marines went about

to an upturned lifeboat and toppled iron poles doors and wooden scraps cover holes and weak deck sections that could collapse and hurl a marine down into the cavernous cargo hold its towering mast is heavily rusted and could be toppled by the next big storm three weeks ago the chinese succeeded in blocking for the first time a philippine boat bringing troops and supplies to the sierra madre manila deployed a civilian boat last week with a fresh batch of marines and 10 tons of food in a bid to draw global attention to what philippine officials have called china s bullying tactics they invited more than a dozen journalists tv cameramen and photographers to come along on the 30 hour plus journey from the philippine mainland two chinese coast guard ships tried to block the slow moving vessel with one cutting dangerously through the philippine boat s path twice the chinese coast guard warned the boat by radio to turn back saying it was illegally venturing into chinese territory the chinese ships blew their horns continuously but the boat maneuvered toward a shallow approach to the shoal dotted with submerged rocky outcrops preventing the chinese from continuing carl thayer a professor at the university of new south wales and an expert on the dispute said china is trying to wear the philippines down china is mainly motivated to squelch the philippines and its vocal and legal
