of power stemming from the july phone call with the ukrainian president when mr trump requested a corruption probe into a political rival former vice president joseph r biden and democrats activities in 2016 while withholding financial aid to ukraine a second article accuses the president of obstruction of congress for claiming immunity from the house s probe and blocking witnesses and documents democrats sought no republicans voted for the articles in the house marking the first time the impeachment of a president happened on a purely partisan basis the president s allies have argued that mr trump had the authority to request a probe into possible corruption saying mr biden s son hunter sat on the board of a ukrainian energy company receiving about 50 000 a month from burisma though he lacked expertise in the industry democrats say mr trump abused his position and that there s no basis to question the bidens behavior during the house impeachment inquiry democrats picked the witnesses to be called and blocked the president s team from calling its own witnesses or cross examining the democrats choices no witnesses testified that he or she heard the president condition aid on ukraine investigating the bidens but several said they believed it to be the case based on circumstantial evidence democrats said those in the know such as former national security adviser john r bolton and acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney rebuffed attempts to get them to appear mr bolton has since said he would testify to the senate and has written a book that reportedly says he was asked by the president to help facilitate a meeting between ukrainian officials and his personal attorney rudy giuliani who was allegedly part of the pressure campaign to start corruption
