trump administration will hold six days of hearings starting monday in washington on the next barrage in an escalating trade war between the world s two largest economies trump s proposed tariffs of 10 percent to 25 percent on 200 billion in chinese goods that could kick in as early as next month once in effect the tariffs would immediately inflate the prices that american companies would have to pay for chinese components they need to build their products those companies would have to decide whether to pass those costs on to their customers or absorb the higher prices themselves the first shots have already been fired in july trump slapped 25 percent tariffs on 34 billion in chinese imports taxes on an additional 16 billion are set to kick in this week china is counterpunching with tariffs of its own but the 200 billion in additional chinese goods that the trump administration is considering taxing would mark a significant escalation in its trade fight with beijing washington and beijing are clashing over u s allegations that china uses predatory tactics to try to overtake american technological dominance those tactics the administration argues include cyber theft and pressure for u s companies to hand over trade secrets in return for access to the chinese market so far the u s tariffs have targeted imported chinese industrial products not the electronics toys and food that ordinary americans might buy at a mall or order online but adding 200 billion to the target list would expose to hefty taxes many more of the 506 billion in goods that china shipped to the united states last year including many consumer products the list includes 6 031 chinese imports an eclectic compilation that ranges from buttons to burglar alarms to motorboats jo ann stores which

lot of them are mom and pop businesses saying please don t do this to us said bryan riley director of the free trade initiative at the conservative national taxpayers union consider seattle s groundfish forum a trade group for the operators of 19 fishing trawlers off alaska it warns that the tariffs will hit flatfish caught off the u s coast that are sent to china for processing before being shipped back to the united states trump s proposed 10 percent tariff on those fish would leave the sustainably harvested fish caught by u s fishermen at a competitive disadvantage the group says
