he s been stymied at home on his pleas to congress for more jobs and stimulus money after showing strong solidarity during the height of the financial crisis the leaders are divided now over whether to stimulate economic growth with more spending as obama wants or to rein in budget deficits in light of debt crises in greece and other heavily indebted nations obama made the point that stimulus to keep the recovery going and austerity are not exclusive french president nicolas sarkozy and to some extent obama agreed that budgets must be cut in the long term and that withdrawal of stimulus should be phased said a european official familiar with the talks portugal spain and greece need fast strong reduction germany and france have more room to maneuver and can focus on spending cuts
