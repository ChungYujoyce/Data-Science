ucci talks trump s agenda relationship with the press this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday july 23 2017 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news sunday host i m chris wallace a shakeup inside the white house six months in where does the trump agenda stand and will it be overwhelmed by the russia investigation begin videotape anthony scaramucci white house communications director i think we re going to get the health care done i also think we re going to get tax reform done and whatever else is on the president s agenda we re going to work very very hard very studiously here to make it happen wallace voice over we ll discuss the president aposs plans and is ongoing relationship with the media with the new white house communications director anthony scaramucci then special counsel robert mueller expands his investigation looking into possible russian ties to trump businesses as the president criticizes his attorney general and warns the investigators kellyanne conway counselor to the president let aposs go back to what the purpose of the investigation was russian interference in our election donald trump president of the united states sessions should have never recused himself jeff sessions u s attorney general i have the honor of serving as attorney general and i plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate wallace we ll discuss the latest developments on russia with republican senator john thune and democratic senator ben cardin on camera plus the president s legislative goals are stalled as repeal and replace creates a logjam in congress voice over we ll ask our sunday panel if senate republicans can bring their health care bill back from the dead all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington president trump has hit the six month mark with his push to repeal and replace obamacare stalled in the senate and investigations were expanding into possible links with the russians little wonder then the president has decided to shake up his white house staff joining me now to discuss the trump agenda moving forward is the new white house communications director anthony scaramucci anthony welcome to fox news sunday scaramucci it aposs great to be here chris thank you good morning wallace let aposs talk about how you see your new job here aposs what you had to say on friday begin video clip scaramucci i think there has been at times a disconnect between the way we see the president and how much we love the president and the way some of you perhaps see the president end video clip wallace so how do you close what you call that disconnect scaramucci well listen i actually don apost think that aposs the hard part i think the hard part is to get reorganized and figure out one of the first things i want to do is mission to be ph we ve got to get the leaks stopped chris i know that it aposs washington so it aposs going to be impossible to stop all of them but i think what aposs going on right now is a high level of unprofessionalism and it aposs not serving the president so my three simple things is i would like to reset the culture inside the comms department so that people recognize that i m actually there to serve them and they re going to be working with me not for me that aposs a very big distinction and that all of us are there to serve the president of united states and his agenda so first thing for me is i want to hit a cultural reset button second thing is we ve got to get the leaks stopped if we don apost get the leaks stopped i am a businessperson and so i will take dramatic action to stop those leaks and the third thing is i ll be traveling with the president this week and we re going to focus and refine the messaging from the white house he s one of the most effective communicators that s never been born and we re going to make sure that we get that message out directly to the american people and i think that albatross spread the gap between how certain people think of him and how i see him or say like someone like ivanka sees him that will start to narrow soon wallace i want to pick up on the leaks you say you re willing to take drastic action to stop them now these are leaks both coming from inside the white house and also from what aposs called the deep state people in the bureaucracy particularly the intelligence agencies or law enforcement what kind of drastic action scaramucci i m being very very clear with people as far as i m concerned that staff has amnesty we ll see how they do with me at the helm if the leaks don apost stop i m going to pare down the staff because it aposs just not right chris i think it aposs not fair to the president it aposs actually not fair to america or the people in the government i m not going to be able to stop the leaks in the intergovernmental agencies and all that other stuff that aposs a whole different ball of wax but something is going on inside the white house that the president does not like and we re going to fix it wallace well you say pare down the staff i mean this isn apost coming just from the communications team are you saying that you aposve been given carte blanche you ve given authority by the president scaramucci no i m just i m just focused on the communications team as far as i m concerned it aposs a new start for everybody in that team and everybody in that team can stay as long as they follow the protocol of not leaking because at the end of the day the president is super upset about the leaks it aposs unprofessional and so you re asking what the four steps are that s going to be one of my first steps wallace do you believe that the mainstream media deliberately puts out fake news about this president scaramucci there is some fake news unfortunately when you see the mainstream media i think that aposs a very broad statement and so what i would like to say and what i would like to believe there still a level of objectivity in the mainstream media but unfortunately there are specific individuals that do stretch stories or do fabricate things i ve been the victim of it myself and so it aposs definitely there chris i don apost think we can dial that down but we can use the mechanisms of social media and the president aposs presence in social media to hop over that if necessary but what i would say to you is that the good news here is that it aposs a fresh start for everybody i certainly want to engage the mainstream media i expect that they re going to want to hold me and the white house accountable but we re going to sort of want to hold them accountable too so i m hoping that it will be symmetry in that relationship wallace you say that there are certain individuals certain outlets do you want to call any of them out by name scaramucci no no again it aposs more specific to specific stories for that matter and so it aposs not necessary to call anybody out by name i m hoping to create an era of a new good feeling with the media give everybody a fresh start let aposs see if we can reset this and create a more positive mojo among everybody and again like i said we have a story that we want to tell it aposs a phenomenal story for the american people there aposs a policy agenda in place but i think it aposs phenomenal for the american people if you look at the last six months i think there aposs been some distortion in terms of how successful we aposve actually been and i think we want to clear that up i think the president made that clear in his press release on friday that we are doing very very well lots of the american people are super happy and we just need to close that gap if you will and make that connection more forcefully wallace well one of those areas where the president has said there aposs been a lot of fake news has been in the russia investigation and the potential for a scandal there president trump reportedly wanted you because you are a tough street fighter like he has is he putting together a ward staff and the white house to take on the various russia investigations scaramucci well listen i sort of see this a two prong as it relates to that i mean we want to refine our rapid response team in some ways we want to deescalate things and have there be a level of diplomacy in other ways we want it to be very hard hitting and war like and so it s sort of a blend of those two things chris but as it relates specifically to russia you know there s certain things that i can talk about from inside the white house and there s certain things i m not allowed to talk about and i really haven t been briefed yet by white house counsel don mcgahn as to what i can and cannot talk about wallace well let me ask you scaramucci here s what i ll say to you if you don t mind me saying this wallace go ahead scaramucci i worked intensely on that campaign and i think that the russian situation is completely overblown i was falsely accused of things related to russia i know other people are being falsely accused of things related to russia and i m confident that tomorrow when jared kushner speaks and i ll keep my fingers crossed in saying this you it ll probably the last time that he has to talk about russia and so for me i d like to get this behind us i ll tell you one of the things i do not like about washington i sort of feel like it s scandals incorporated down in washington that we have to make up things about each other chris so that we can personally destroy each other to make us less effective as public servants i don t like it all i m going to try lead wallace let me interrupt for a minute you ll learn we do this in washington but on the specific question could you say that you know part of it is diplomacy and part of it is hard hitting do you see anything wrong with going after the special counsel and his team when it comes to possible conflicts of interest or when it comes to your feeling or the president s feeling that he is expanding the scope of his investigation too far into the president s business affairs scaramucci i want the president to be the president and i want him to express the full nature of his personality corey lewandowski used to say early on on the campaign let trump be trump a little disrespectful now that he s president so let s let the president be the president and my point is if he wants to talk about things like that i m not going to want to stop him or be able to stop him i want to be there to help aid and abet his agenda so for me i have a different personality style from this president in some ways in other ways we re very similar i just want to there to be fairness and objectivity and so let s see how the whole thing rolls out but my feeling about this thing is it s overblown it s completely unfair it s designed to take people off message and off of our agenda and we re going to get people on our message and on our agenda crosstalk wallace let me ask you one last russia question then i want to talk about agenda in a tweet this week the president said this this weekend he asserted his complete power to pardon question if he and his people have done nothing wrong why even talk about pardons scaramucci see this is one again this is one of those things about washington and it s the convolution and the nature of the things i m in the oval office with the president last week we re talking about that he brought that up he said but he doesn t have to be pardoned there s nobody around him that has to be pardoned he was just making the statement about the power of pardons and so now all of the speculation and all the spin and oh he s going to pardon himself and do all this other nonsense the president does not need to pardon himself and the reason that he doesn t need to pardon himself is he hasn t done anything wrong wallace ok scaramucci and so for me we can micro analyze every one of the president s tweets that s fine we can go in that direction but what i want to do for people is get it back on the president s agenda this is a president this is a jobs president this is a president who s going to help middle class families lower middle class families you want to talk about gaps chris there is a wide income gap that many elites do not feel but the president feels it and members of his staff feel it and people in the middle of america feel it and you know what we re going to do we re going to put policies together that close that gap if people want to talk about these nonsensical scandals i ll let them do that but i m going to be missile locked on focusing on the president s agenda and helping people to understand the president the way i know him and the way i love him wallace i got to ask you one last question and i hesitate to do that but does the president still have confidence in his attorney general he s had some tough things to say about jeff sessions this weekend and his decision to recuse and then this new story in the washington post that the russian ambassador told supposedly told his superiors that he had talked with sessions about campaign matters but session denies so does the president still have confidence in sessions scaramucci see this is something that i think is super important a question like that i want to leave that for the president and attorney general sessions to talk about themselves my guess is that he s in the seat and so therefore the president still has confidence in him i m sure like all of us there s things that attorney general sessions has done this president doesn t like and let them have that conversation among themselves and hopefully we can fix it but chris here s the thing the good news about president trump is that he wears a lot on his sleeve we know exactly where he comes from and where he stands on things the reason why the american people love him and the reason why he became president is because he s a you know wears heart on his sleeve type of person very caring but also as a business executive he sort of tells people how he feels wallace all right scaramucci again another thing i don t like about washington if i don t like something that you re saying and i put out a tweet saying i don t like chris wallace all of a sudden now you and i have to be mortal enemies for the rest of our lives i don t i don t think that s how it works in american business and so we sort of need to stop doing that in the political system wallace ok speaking of tweets in the time we have left let s do a lightning round quick questions quick answers anthony scaramucci yes wallace you have been deleting some old tweets over the last couple of days you say and quite understandably because they were a distraction they were when you weren t working for donald trump now you are working for donald trump but as you know all this stuff lives forever and i wanted to put one of them up scaramucci right wallace in 2012 you tweeted we the usa has 5 percent of the world s population but 50 percent of the world s guns enough is enough it is just common sense to apply more control question do you still believe that scaramucci well ok so the answer to the question and i m a pro second amendment person my dad was a hunter i ve got no problem with that what i was worried about in 2012 in urban centers if you don t have a little level of gun control it could lead to more violence but truth be told and is why i deleted the tweets chris it s a total distraction it s total nonsense when i made the decision to take this job my politics and my political ideas do not matter at all what matters is that i am supporting subordinating all of that to the president s agenda ed koch who lived in this city had a great line if you believe in nine out of the twelve things that i m for you should vote for me if you believe twelve out of the twelve things you need a psychiatrist laughter scaramucci as far as i m concerned wallace wait wait now let me pick up because you re blowing the whole idea of the lightning round and i want to move on scaramucci all right but that s a super loaded question for a 15 second answer wallace ok scaramucci but go on chris go ahead wallace here s another one you talked on friday about that famous incident in 2015 i know you re going to shake your head where you called president trump a hack politician but i looked at the tape it s actually much worse than that anthony so take a look begin video clip scaramucci he s a hack politician and unidentified female well you re in trouble now scaramucci he s probably going to make elizabeth warren his vice presidential nominee with comments like that politicians don t want to go at trump because he s got a big mouth and he s afraid he s going to light them up on fox news and all these other places but i m not a politician crosstalk unidentified female so why s he resonating so why s he resonating scaramucci you an inherited money dude from queens county bring it donald end video clip wallace bring it donald here s the question scaramucci hey look we re both new yorkers by the way crosstalk wallace no but here s the question is that what trump likes about you mr trump president trump likes about you you re like him you fight like him scaramucci hey let me tell you something he hit first and he so he called me from air force one yesterday on the way down to christening the aircraft carrier he says you don t even remember the whole story and i said what do you mean sir he says i brought you into my office i said i m thinking about running for president you told me that i wasn t running which is true and this is way way early and i was i told him i was going to sign up with scott walker because i needed a candidate wallace all right we re on a lightning round get to the to the point scaramucci ok but if we re on a lightning round and you re showing a clip like that you ve got to give me a chance to explain myself the president was hitting the hedge fund industry that morning on fox and friends wallace i know that scaramucci ok and so i m a fighter when he s hitting the hedge fund industry and that s my life lifeblood i m hitting back ok he knows that he respects that about me we were laughing about that last night but what i love about you guys ok is this three minute segment that i guess is going to be played for eternity we should put it on the voyager spacecraft and send it interstellar ok i love the guy wallace let me just scaramucci we re new yorkers and this is my point i want to finish my point i love the guy i spent the last 18 months supporting him unyieldingly because he s a great person and he s going to be a phenomenal he is a phenomenal president and he s going to be a better president but you re not allowed to fight a little bit amongst your friends if you re not allowed to do that what are we doing wallace am i not allowed to actually put that on i mean it s funny scaramucci no i love it i love it wallace i make you i make you a promise i will never play that clip again scaramucci play it you can play it again wallace no i don t want crosstalk wallace final question scaramucci i m totally fine with what you re here s my point i m a new yorker he s a new yorker we re allowed to go at it a little bit wallace i m a new yorker too so that makes us three of us scaramucci so god bless but my point is we were laughing about it yesterday i think jon karl asked me about it at the press conference he says does the president remind every 15 seconds reminds me ok i apologized for it we re moving on wallace one quick final question you ve got 30 seconds to answer this one scaramucci go ahead wallace you have suggested this was before you became communications director maybe we ll put on a show a white house show every morning anchor desk on the north lawn to talk about the administration policies are you serious scaramucci i got to talk about the president about it i mean that was when i was brainstorming before i had an official job but here s what i would say to you in less than 30 seconds we are going to reinvent the way we deliver information out of the white house because the world has changed i have in my pocket a radio studio a television studio and a movie studio the entire world has changed we need to rethink the way we re delivering our information and so stay tuned wallace anthony thank you thanks for your time we hope to have you back often scaramucci great to be here wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss what the white house shakeup says about where president trump wants to go from here commercial break begin video clip scaramucci i love the president i love the president i love the president i love the president end video clip wallace new white house communications director anthony scaramucci leaving no doubt about his loyalty to his new boss and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz who is now a fox news contributor and welcome columnist for the hill juan williams julie pace washington bureau chief of the associated press and former national security council staffer gillian turner well julie at the risk of repeating them i love this new guy laughter wallace finally the trump white house as a surrogate who talks like the boss julie pace washington bureau chief the associated press exactly i think that aposs what has a lot of trump loyalists and supporters happy with this pick they feel like this is somebody who understands the way the president communicates who s going to go up there and have one mission and that aposs to serve the president to promote his agenda and i know that sounds simple that aposs what you aposre supposed to do in this job but at the reality is that in this white house you have a lot of different factions and there s a lot of speculation every day about their true motivations about what they are really there to do and particularly in the comms shop you have a lot of people wallace communication pace communication shop you have a lot of people who came over from the republican national committee an organization that while they were tacitly supporting trump in the general election it was pretty clear that they did not believe he was actually going to win that has fueled a lot of attention and some of the things that anthony said in that interview would make me pretty nervous if i came from the rnc and i was working in that comms shop right now wallace yes and we should point out they were brought over by reince priebus and sean spicer and he was basically saying there aposs a new sheriff in town pace exactly what do you make of the same question i asked him what do you think his appointment and his aggressiveness says about the way this president is going to take on the russia investigation pace well i think the russia investigation is something that they re going to be dealing with for months or even years and they have to figure out a strategy they can be aggressive they can take this head on every day or and this is what a lot of republicans would prefer that they do is they try to push a different agenda they try to focus more on health care have the president out there talking about it try to focus on tax reform or infrastructure that aposs where they have fallen down on this they keep getting bogged down by russia and they haven apost had this ability to promote a different more positive agenda wallace well speaking about getting tripped up and mixing messages i want to play some clips from the president aposs interview with the new york times this week here is the president s take on his own attorney begin audio clip trump how do you take a job and then recuse yourself if he would recuse himself before the job i would have said thanks jeff but i can apost you know i m not going to take you it aposs extremely unfair and that aposs a mild word to the president end audio clip wallace and here is the president on special counsel robert mueller aposs investigation begin audio clip michael schmidt reporter new york times if mueller was looking at your finances and your family aposs finances unrelated to russia is that a red line maggie haberman reporter new york times would that be a breach of what his actual charge is trump i would say yes i would say yes end audio clip wallace congressman chaffetz is it a mistake for the president to take on sessions and mueller or should he go after them aggressively jason chaffetz fox news contributor well he aposs going to do what he aposs going to do i mean i think that aposs part of what aposs endearing to america is the fact that he just kind of lays it out the way that he should the way that he wants to i do think it was a mistake to have a special counsel i don apost think it s risen to that level but nevertheless it s in place and i think he aposs going to have a very aggressive style going after him wallace but do you think that aposs smart to go after the prosecutors and try to undercut them chaffetz well i don apost i don t think that aposs necessarily the right way to do it but it is the way the president is going to do it and i think that aposs why he brought on anthony scaramucci he actually speaks native trump and he s going to convey that to the american people wallace not only did attorney general sessions get a kind of vote of no confidence from the president but he also has to deal with this new washington post story that i talked to anthony scaramucci about which reports that the russian ambassador was intercepted electronic intercepts telling his superiors in moscow in the kremlin that he had discussions with sessions about campaign matters something as you ll see now that sessions flatly denied begin video clip sessions let me be clear i never had meetings with russian operatives or russian intermediaries about the trump campaign end video clip wallace gillian how much trouble is jeff sessions in and with jared kushner testifying not once but twice this week before congressional committees behind closed doors how serious is the russia investigation at this point gillian turner fox news contributor the russia investigation from my perspective is growing more serious by the day to the point about the attorney general his dealings with russian ambassador kislyak are the reasons he recused himself from the investigation from the get go so he did that voluntarily it s something the president has now said he resents it was completely his decision to do that and i would just say in terms of the attorney general and this ongoing investigation there aposs really to build on a point julie made there s really two models that the president can follow this is something that steve hadley president bush aposs national security advisor captured brilliantly in may he said there s two models here for the entire administration there is the nixon clinton model where you treat it as a criminal investigation you lawyer up you have your hand in the pot every day you push back as hard as you can or there is what he called the reagan model that he chose during iran contra which is you take a step back you have respect for the process and you let the chips ultimately fall where they may the trump administration is clearly choosing the former model they could still reverse course if they wanted to and i think certainly they would be politically smarter for making that decision wallace you know it didn apost work for nixon it did work for clinton turner yes but i think they both well it worked for president clinton to a certain extent yes he stayed in office wallace and he survived and he roughed up ken starr turner yes wallace let me move to you juan what do you think and i want to put this all together what do you think the president aposs various actions this week on scaramucci on giving that surprising interview to the new york times on shaking up his legal team the guy who was in charge new york lawyer marc kasowitz no longer is what do you think that tells you about where this president is right now juan williams fox news political analyst well i think he s totally focused on the russia story i think you know let aposs use the cultural term the godfather he aposs going to the mattresses right now i mean he brings in scaramucci because he sees scaramucci as a guy who got an apology from cnn got people fired at cnn he had wallace let s exactly point that out cnn did a story that said that scaramucci was under investigation there s no evidence that he was williams right wallace and that aposs what followed williams and then president trump who had initially taken advice from his white house chief of staff not to bring in scaramucci his white house public liaison suddenly he is now fascinated with scaramucci because he aposs had success in the kind of street fight attitude so you have that but then the big surprise was as you point out the new york times interview to go after his old attorney general and you have to wonder about the subsequent leaks about the attorney general it could be given what he said about robert mueller and trying to discredit robert mueller who is the investigator that he now thinks if i can get rid of sessions i can get somebody over there who will fire mueller and make it easier for me as we go down that path so i think what we are right now is we re on war footing i mean this is an explosive moment for the president for the legal system for the constitution wallace i just want to ask you one quick questions at the end of the segment because i must say the thought occurred to me on thursday you have the president basically saying i m really unhappy with jeff sessions and i wouldn apost have appointed him and the next day there is this leak of information i see you smiling about the fact that sessions may have misled everybody about what he talked to kislyak about do you think i mean is that obviously the thought has occurred to you pace it has occurred to me and many other reporters i ll just go with the my friends of the washington post said about the story which is that they have been working on this information since june laughter wallace all right turner chris if the president thinks he s felt the ire of the washington d c firmament ph fire the attorney general or the special counsel and you will really feel the wrath of washington wallace all right you know what we re going to do folks i promise we are now going to talk agenda well maybe not quite but we are we re going to take a break see you a little later coming up the senate gets ready to vote on obamacare but what will they be voting on two key senators join us next commercial break wallace coming up president trump puts pressure on senate republicans to keep a major campaign promise begin video clip trump any senator who votes against starting debate is really telling america that you aposre fine with obamacare end video clip wallace we aposll ask two top senators if repeal and replace is still alive next commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway at mount rushmore in keystone south dakota the senate holds a big vote this week on what to do about obamacare with major splits among republican members meanwhile other priorities like the budget tax reform and raising the debt limit are stacking up like planes over an airport on a summer afternoon joining me now to discuss the trump agenda from south dakota the chair of the republican conference senator john thune and from baltimore democratic senator ben cardin gentlemen before we get to obamacare i want to talk you all about an agreement that congressional leaders in both parties have apparently reached over the weekend about a bill to impose new sanctions on russia and to limit the president aposs ability to lift those sanctions senator thune is the president going to sign that bill sen john thune r south dakota i believe he will chris because the senate passed it 98 2 obviously both senator cardin and i voted for that the house has made some minor modifications we included iran they extended it to north korea but this is a bill that will go to the president aposs desk and he should sign it into law wallace you say he should sign it into law there has been some pushback from the administration they don apost like the idea that it limits his ability to conduct diplomacy by imposing sanctions and limiting his ability to lift them thune well that aposs true but i think that the in the end the administration will come to the conclusion that an overwhelming majority of congress has and that is that we need to sanction russia for their meddling in the u s election that i think will pass probably overwhelmingly again in the senate and with a veto proof majority so the president would i think it aposs in his best interest for a lot of reasons to sign it and i believe he will wallace senator cardin do you share your colleague aposs confidence the president will sign it and what if he doesn apost what if he does veto it sen ben cardin d maryland well chris this is a very strong bill it imposes mandatory sanctions on russia it provides for congressional review if the president wants to wait or eliminate sanctions it was it aposs very bipartisan the senator corker and i on the senate foreign relations committee drafted a good part of it senator crapo ph and brown from the banking committee it has broad support in the senate and in the house if he vetoes the bill we will override his veto wallace let aposs turn to the big health care vote this week here aposs what senate democratic leader chuck schumer said begin video clip sen chuck schumer d ny minority leader we democrats don apost know what our republican friends are planning to vote on it next week i aposll but many republicans don apost know yet either end video clip wallace senator thune as the number three republican in the senate do you know what you aposre going to be voting on next week is it repeal or is it repeal and replace thune it aposs voting to get on the bill chris it aposs voting to open the debate we can apost change the status quo which is skyrocketing premiums and collapsing markets out there for way too many americans less we get on the bill so the vote will be at some point this week to proceed to consideration of the bill it aposs a procedural vote at which point all amendments become an order there will be an unlimited opportunity for democrats for ben cardin and some of his colleagues to offer their amendments for republican colleagues to offer theirs to try and improve and strengthen the bill but you can apost do that unless you get on the bill so the first vote which will occur sometime this week will be to proceed to that consideration of that legislation and to and to at least have a debate where we can have an open amendment process and give people a chance to be heard wallace but but but without getting too far into the weeds i know the first when you get on the bill the bill is the house bill which nobody likes the question including a lot of people in the house then senator mcconnell is going to offer a substitute the first amendment and is that going to be repeal or repeal and replace thune i think ultimately that aposs a judgment that senator mcconnell will make at some point this week before the vote depending on how these discussions go if we can reach an agreement among republicans about the senate bill and i my own view is and i aposm speaking myself i hope we do because i think the senate bill does strike the right balance but one way or the other we need to get on the bill in order to have that debate and the leader will make that decision at some point about whether that aposs repeal repeal and replace i hope it aposs repeal and replace but whether which camp you aposre in you can apost have a debate about either unless we get on the bill so we need a yes vote that aposs the only way to change the status quo wallace senator cardin this got even more complicated on friday when the senate parliamentarian said that some measures in the mcconnell bill the bill that the senate majority leader is offering are outside senate rules and may be out of order so where does that leave this whole thing cardin well if we go on the bill if the republicans had the votes to move on the bill 22 million to 33 million americans are at risk of losing their insurance coverage all americans are at risk of losing quality insurance coverage so if we get on this bill we aposre under what aposs called reconciliation and many of the amendments will not be in order because they have to deal directly with the fiscal issues because it aposs reconciliation so we don apost have an open process if we get on the bill we have a very narrow opportunity to really change this bill wallace senator thune president trump and you were at that meeting this week in the white house said told republican senators that you aposve all talked tough when president obama was in the white house but things have changed here it is begin video clip trump for seven years you had an easy route we aposll repeal we aposll replace and he aposs never going to sign it but i aposm signing it so it aposs a little bit different end video clip wallace senator thune if republicans blocked the bill this week either don apost vote to begin the debate or begin the debate and then go against whatever is on the floor is that the end of repeal and replace thune it aposs not but it is a vote i think for the status quo but what will happen and if and when that were to occur is we aposll go back to the drawing board and we aposll get a bill up we are going to vote to repeal and replace obamacare the question is not it aposs not a question of if it aposs a question of when my argument chris is that we need to do it sooner rather than later which is the argument that the president made because this thing is spiraling out of control obamacare is in a death spiral you have seen since 2013 premiums in this country in the individual marketplace have more than doubled you aposve got markets that are in a free fall in a collapse and something has to be done sooner and i think that aposs why we need to get on the bill and start this debate and then if people want to amend it it is an open amendment process there will be unlimited amendments that can be offered and in the and the united states senate will have an opportunity to work its will but that can apost happen we can apost change the status quo less w get on the bill and i think we have a responsibility and a duty to the american people that we committed and promised that we would repeal and replace obamacare with something that aposs better and so they need to hold us accountable and i think the sooner we get on the bill and debating these issues the more quickly we will get a we will get a result which takes us in a better direction with lower premiums and stable markets and liberating people wallace right thune from all these mandates and regulations and taxes that they have an obamacare today wallace finally gentlemen i want to ask about we aposve only got a couple of minutes left senator cardin as i mentioned before there are a lot of other things that are stacking up that to basically keep the government running you aposve got to pass a budget the government runs out of money on october 1st you aposve got to raise the debt limit at a certain point we reach that barrier what are the chances that we are going to be able to avoid a train wreck this fall thune well if you want me i aposll take that chris first off wallace no wait no i aposm asking senator cardin cardin well there aposs a better way to move forward and inaudible there aposs a there aposs a better way to move forward in response to senator thune if democrats and republicans work together we can get things done senator alexander the republican chairman of the health committee says he aposll schedule hearings we had no hearings on the health care bill that the republicans are considering let aposs work together we aposve worked together on the fy apos17 budget we want to improve the affordable care act not repeal it and there are ways we can do that by bringing down overall health care costs and making particularly in the individual marketplace health insurance more affordable on the budget issues we have members of the authorizing committees on both their democratic and republican side the environmental public works committee this week will be passing out some authorization bills that deal with the budget we need to deal with a realistic budget for fy apos18 that reflects the progress we made in fy apos17 working together if we do that it aposs going to be in the best interests of the american people we can improve the health care system we can get a reasonable budget and we can move this country forward wallace gentlemen we aposre going to have to close on that optimistic note senator cardin senator thune thank you both thanks for coming in today always good to talk with you gentlemen thune thanks chris cardin thanks wallace up next we aposll bring back the panel to handicap whether senate republicans can revive repeal and replace or whether it aposs time to move on plus what would you like to ask the panel about the white house shakeup and what it says about the trump presidency six months in just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump let obamacare fail it will be a lot easier and i think we aposre probably in that position where we aposll just let obamacare fail we aposre not going to own it end video clip wallace president trump who took a number of different positions on obamacare this way repeal repeal and replace and as you saw there just let the whole thing collapsed and we aposre back now with the panel so julie what do they really think at the white house do they think that repeal and replace is dead or do they somehow think that at the last moment faced with a vote that some of these senators who have come out against it will vote for it pace it kind of depends what day you ask them that question there have been some days recently where they have been pretty down on this where they can apost exactly see how they aposre going to get back particularly with senator mccain being out at the a crucial vote for this look they planned to spend the next couple of days trying to see if there aposs a way through here trying to see if repeal and replace could get the votes trying to see if repeal only could get the votes when you talk to republicans though they mixed messages the constant shifting from the president sometimes within the same day is hugely unhelpful because republicans also want to move forward on this they want to put a bill on his desk and have that bill signed but it aposs really unclear day to day what bill the president actually wants to sign wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and f d tweeted this could donald trump has done more to dig into health care legislative process was there a lack of presidential effort involvement congressman chaffetz you know i looked into this the president has not made since he took office a single major speech that was really devoted to repeal and replace and say what you will about obamacare and i know you aposve got a lot of problems with it but president obama barnstormed the country at least pushing it so the question is how do you answer f d chaffetz no i think the president actually could do more use the power of the air force one get out to the country make the speeches i think at this point the white house communication is let aposs just have something we need some sort of victory you know it aposs sort of like al davis from the oakland raiders just win baby just get just put something up on the board i mean now that they aposre playing with live ammunition you aposve got a lot of republicans that are getting squishy so it aposs ultimately the responsibility know of the senate here aposs a motion to proceed it aposs a motion to are we going to have a debate from what is supposed to be the most deliberative body on the face of the planet and we can apost even get republicans to agree to debate the bill wallace so so what do you think is the impact of that if they won apost even go into at this point they do not have the 50 votes plus the vice president pence to break the tie to even begin debate chaffetz that aposs what aposs so frustrating and i think if you go to the heartland that aposs what people are most concerned about you don apost even have the debate let alone the vote it may fail but at least have the debate and that aposs the first question that will come up this week wallace we had some shocking news this week senator john mccain we learned has an aggressive malignant form of brain cancer here was mccain aposs best friend in the senate lindsey graham begin video clip sen lindsey graham r south carolina i can apost think of anything i aposve done since 1999 politically and in many ways personally that was worth doing without john i just asked god for one thing that he has a voice and he can use it as long as possible end video clip wallace juan this has both personal and political residence here in washington doesn apost it williams it has tremendous residence here in washington i think i think our prayers i think everybody aposs prayers are with john senator mccain and his family i want to just say a special expression to meghan mccain our fox colleague you know to her and her dad much love much respect mccain has a special place in washington chris because he aposs in a time of polarized politics that we live in he aposs able to operate across party lines you think to mccain feingold for example on finance reform you think of mccain kennedy on immigration reform you think of his efforts going overseas tirelessly traveling to places in the midst of war to say this is the american policy i want to know what aposs going on on the ground and he takes people who are politically opposite like elizabeth warren with him to show them what is actually taking place on the ground so he operates in a way that i think gives him some special cachet if you will because everybody wants to talk to him everybody embraces him and i would add given his status as a military hero there aposs no one like him in that sense in this generation you think about the idea that he stayed in a prison camp and said i aposm not leaving despite the statue of my father and grandfather i aposm not leaving till my men do wallace and the north vietnamese gave him said we aposll let you go because your father aposs an admiral wallace right so at that moment you say wow now there aposs a man of character there aposs a guy who you want standing up and if you want to talk about you know i so often hear republicans these days say somebody aposs a patriot like oh he aposs one of us he aposs a good you know what there aposs a real patriot right here john mccain wallace gillian as a member of the national security council staff for both bush 43 and obama how big a player is john mccain when it comes to national security issues turner he is everything you know as a as a person i messaged meghan the other day when this became public and i said you know your dad is truly an american national treasure we don apost have many of them in this country but he aposs one of them the potential loss of his service in the senate whether he steps aside tomorrow or years from now wallace right we should say he he says turner he says yes wallace and if anybody can pull it off he says i aposm coming back turner and i hope he does but that the loss of his senate service whenever it comes whatever he steps aside constitutes a national security crisis for the gop but by extension for the country in the sense that this is a person who has been the primary voice on national security issues for a decade this is somebody who explains the isis threat to us starting in 2014 when they first emerged on the scene he has explained the threat posed by our nuclear adversaries around the world and i don apost see on the republican side i don apost see any current leader who rival him and i don apost see the next generation of leaders who are going to have that same you know have that same voice on these issues wallace and i want to pick up turner so it aposs no worry ph wallace i want to pick up on that with you congressman chaffetz because you know both with barack obama and with donald trump there has been this talk about kind of pulling back rolling up our engagement with the rest of the world and john mccain is one of the few voices out there in either party talking about the kind of reagan esque aggressive dominant engagement with the rest of the world chaffetz well his heart and soul is with the united states of america he aposs a warrior a true patriot in every way he aposs uniquely american and i think he wants to help lead the charge he doesn apost want to sit back he wants to take the take the fight to the enemy and and he aposll do that till every step of the way and you know his fight with cancer touches all of us all of us have some relative or some friend that aposs fighting cancer and god bless him we wish him nothing but the best wallace well very good strong sentiments and i i have to say it it feels like a it aposs not a good sunday without john mccain on one of the sunday shows he loves to do it and senator if you aposre watching all of us are thinking of you and come on back and get into an argument with me because we aposve got into plenty thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week she calls her profession the
