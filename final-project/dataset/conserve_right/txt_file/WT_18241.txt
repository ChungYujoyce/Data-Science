apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic mumbai india ap telecom companies and trade groups are urging india to soften tough new security regulations on foreign telecommunications companies believed to be aimed at china which they say could set a troubling global precedent for onerous security norms india s telecom infrastructure is being built almost entirely by foreign companies that has raised concerns that the nation s vast mobile phone network by far the most comprehensive communication system in a country with relatively few landlines could be vulnerable to foreign infiltration particularly from china at stake are billions worth of contracts for companies like ibm cisco ericsson nokia huawei technologies and zte corp in the world s fastest growing mobile market

first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds under guidelines proposed last week foreign equipment makers must allow regular security inspections and make their network design and source code proprietary information used to run a network available to the indian government companies would also be subject to large penalties and blacklisting for security breaches and would have two years to replace foreign engineers with local hires on july 27 11 u s trade groups appealed to secretary of state hillary rodham clinton to get the indian government to suspend implementation of the new rules not only do india s new telecommunications security requirements raise potential wto compliance concerns if they remain unchallenged other governments may use them to justify their own elaborate information security regimes they wrote in a letter obtained by the associated press india s approach is establishing a dangerous precedent the next day 20 groups from the u s europe and japan fired off a letter to india s home technology and commerce ministers calling the proposals a nonstarter india began the crackdown in december by requiring companies to get a government security clearance on telecom equipment orders since then billions worth of procurement orders industry estimates range from 1 billion to 5 billion have languished awaiting security clearance china s huawei and zte have a backlog worth an estimated 750 million nokia siemens networks said second quarter sales fell 5 percent to euros 3 billion 2 2 billion mostly because of sales blocked by india s security issues ericsson s quarterly india sales plunged 63 percent for largely the same reason analysts and executives say india s security concerns are not unreasonable but that the measures go beyond international norms the u s japan and europe struggled to establish effective information security rules in the 1980s and 1990s rather than limiting data encryption or requiring automatic disclosure of proprietary information most countries require disclosure only in exceptional circumstances we deeply respect and support the steps taken to beef up security said ericsson india vice president p balaji however we feel that some of the clauses are unprecedented we request a dialogue to ensure that the security concerns can be balanced with good international practices telecom department spokesman satyendra prakash said telecom devices have been misused in the past and india s response to security problems is in line with what other countries are doing the government wants to prevent spyware and malware and has built in safeguards so source code would only be accessed if there is a security breach he said he declined to comment on the letters officials at the home ministry did not return calls seeking comment the crackdown comes as china gains strength in india s telecom equipment market and grabs business from western companies like nokia that have turned to india to make up for flagging growth in the developed world chinese executives say china s telecom exports to india are about 3 billion annually making them a significant chunk of india s estimated 21 4 billion trade

pricewaterhousecoopers whatever the intent may be the new rules will apply to everyone companies worry they could face huge liabilities for security problems outside their control and lose control of proprietary information at the core of their business in the event of a security breach operators would face a penalty of 500 million rupees 10 8 million plus 100 percent of the value of the contract which often totals several hundred million dollars while equipment vendors could be blacklisted no other country imposes penalties of that size and it s rare to punish operators for security breaches
