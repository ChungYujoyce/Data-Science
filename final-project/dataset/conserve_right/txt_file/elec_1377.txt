mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong the trump 2020 campaign noticed something interesting while crunching data from its february rally in el paso a significant percentage of the crowd crossed into texas from las cruces new mexico including plenty of women and hispanics who will be pivotal to the president s reelection prospects that piqued our interest in new mexico said tim murtaugh the trump campaign s director of communications mr trump will rally with supporters outside albuquerque the state s largest city on monday as part of a bid to expand his 2016 victory map and win states that have tilted blue in recent presidential cycles top stories gall and nerve val demings rips trump for trying to capitalize on biden you ain t black comment you are not going to die from covid 19 oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens besides new mexico the campaign is eyeing new hampshire colorado nevada and even oregon which has a libertarian streak and the trump team theorizes could be stocked with voters sick of hyper pc antics in liberal portland mr trump s critics say his campaign is looking for insurance against leaking support in the upper midwest and elsewhere though the campaign insists that s not the case the campaign says its operations in big states such as ohio and michigan are well funded so they are going to reach for more why would you not if you think you can be competitive and win in any given state why would you not take a shot at it mr murtaugh said the campaign says new mexico is a ripe target because mr trump has a good story to tell about job creation there especially in the petroleum industry michael glassner chief operating officer of the trump campaign organization cited an economic boom in new mexico when he announced the rally last week he said the state has added 34 000 jobs since mr trump took office the rio rancho event will be mr trump s third rally in new mexico though his first since 2016 analysts said mr trump faces an uphill battle in turning the state red he lost new mexico to democrat hillary clinton by 8 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election and barack obama won it comfortably in each of his presidential elections back in 2000 and 2004 new mexico was truly a battleground state in which george bush had two very close elections one of which he won and one of which he lost however since then the democratic presidential candidates have won in new mexico by very comfortable margins said brian sanderoff president of research polling inc in albuquerque he said mr trump s fortunes will hinge on hispanics who account for about a third of the new mexico vote in presidential cycles as it stands about 7 in 10 typically vote for the democratic candidate mr sanderoff said his final polling from the 2016 cycle suggested that mr trump grabbed 27 of the hispanic vote and former new mexico gov gary johnson the libertarian party candidate got 14 mr trump will have to reel in some of that johnson share in 2020 and find a way to garner 40 of the hispanic vote to have a shot at winning new mexico mr sanderoff said many hispanics are liberal on economic issues and more conservative on social issues such as abortion he said i think the trump campaign will attempt to sway the hispanics on social issues and border security he is right about the strategy the trump team says it is confident that the president s pro life record is a winner with hispanics and they insist mr trump can sway members of the bloc by posing a simple question if you or your family members immigrated to the u s legally shouldn t others they say damn right said mr murtaugh we think significant numbers support the president s approach to immigration contrary to what democrats believe the trump campaign is hoping to make inroads during national hispanic heritage month it held a training session thursday for volunteers in houston ahead of the democratic primary debate in the city and it plans to follow up mr trump s rally with a vamos to victory event in albuquerque on tuesday campaign manager brad parscale and other top campaign figures will appear at the session rep ben ray lujan a hispanic democrat running for an open senate seat in new mexico responded to the announcement of the president s rally in rio rancho by tweeting that his values are not our values the democratic national committee meanwhile said it has no intention of losing steam in new mexico after a good showing in the midterm elections last cycle democrats crushed republicans in new mexico because voters are fed up with president trump s toxic health care agenda and broken promises said david bergstein the dnc s spokesman on battleground states we take nothing for granted but this gop strategy looks like they re concerned about a realistic pathway to 270 electoral votes copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read
