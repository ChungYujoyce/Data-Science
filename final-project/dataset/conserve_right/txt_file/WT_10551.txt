i smoke because i work in sales and it helps me cope with the stress of meeting targets said wu a slightly overweight woman who smiles warmly but has stained teeth i know it is bad for me and i m trying to quit but i m still very healthy now and i m optimistic about my future newly prosperous china is facing a very changed health picture from a generation ago when it was still largely poor and agrarian and the diseases plaguing chinese have changed too heart disease cancer and respiratory disease have replaced hepatitis diarrhea and malaria as desk work replaces farming cars replace bicycles and smoking remains stubbornly popular chronic diseases account for more than 80 percent of deaths in china or nearly 8 million in 2008 according to the world health organization the epidemic comes as the united nations general assembly holds a high level meeting on non communicable diseases in new york next week compared to the united states china has three times the death rate from respiratory diseases like emphysema by another measure chinese are healthier with only a quarter of the population overweight compared to two thirds of americans chronic diseases are costly the world bank estimated in a july report that reducing the death rate of cardiovascular disease conditions that cause heart attacks and strokes by just 1 percent a year over three decades could generate an economic value equivalent to 68 percent of china s gdp last year or about 10 7 trillion china s breakneck economic development over the past 30 years has pulled hundreds of millions out of poverty and moved many people into cities but a broken health care system and inadequate state insurance mean getting treated for serious diseases can impoverish many families unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyles have helped accelerate an explosion in chronic diseases lu nanxu 28 a programmer at an it services company in beijing knows he needs to exercise and eat less to shed some of the 215 pounds 98 kilograms on his 1 7 meter 5 foot 8 inch tall frame that categorizes him as obese but he doesn t i have plenty of time to exercise but i m too lazy he said with a sheepish grin at a japanese fast food joint when i finish work i prefer to go home and surf the internet or watch movies on my computer lu said he used to be a competitive ice skater when he was growing up in harbin a city in frigid northeastern china but as an adult he stopped exercising it s not only exercise but i would have to control my eating and that can be very difficult he said as he polished off a dinner of braised thinly sliced fatty beef and fried chicken with rice and steamed vegetables a side of mashed potatoes and a soft drink a high salt diet is also a major problem in china experts believe high blood pressure is the leading preventable risk factor tied to stroke and heart attack on average the chinese consume twice as much salt as the recommended maximum set by the who according to the organization s food safety expert in geneva dr peter ben embarek unlike in the u s where salt is usually consumed through processed foods like bacon cheese and fast food the high sodium intake in china comes from the liberal use of soy and oyster sauces and the flavor enhancer msg which is added to soups stews instant noodles and other foods the popularity of pickled mustard greens cabbage radish and other vegetables also contributes the average chinese person consumes 11 grams 0 4 ounces of salt a day compared to americans who eat 8 5 grams 0 3 ounces embarek said we believe that it s one of the places where if you can reduce it just a little bit not even down to the maximum recommended level but just a little bit you will swiftly see a positive impact in public health another big killer is smoking which is linked to 1 million deaths in china every year more than a quarter of adults in china smoke roughly 350 million people a number about equal to the entire u s population in may china tried to ban smoking in indoor public places but in a country where half of all male doctors smoke and cigarettes are commonly presented as gifts such restrictions are usually ignored

scans showed a spot on his left lung that was this big said li indicating with his fingers a circular shape of about an inch in diameter it was not difficult for me to quit smoking i have to do it for myself and for everybody around me he said li said he was fortunate that insurance provided by his government job would cover most of the expenses for his father s treatment others are not so lucky after decades of underfunding the health care system china recently poured 124 billion into building hospitals and expanding state insurance coverage but there are still many for whom a serious chronic illness like cancer can wipe out a family s life savings after only one round of chemotherapy 25 year old wang yuanjin fears he won t have enough money to continue the treatment that is
