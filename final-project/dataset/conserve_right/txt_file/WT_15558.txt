sacrifice quentin tarantino declaws django unchained in bow to chinese censors for an industry that promotes free expression and alleged liberal values to work with totalitarian government that is the antithesis of the values we hold dear as americans is in many ways a hypocrisy said tom fitton president of judicial watch they often mask what they do with other values such as the first amendment but if indeed they are working with china s censors then obviously they don t believe in those values said fitton dan harris an attorney with harris moure an international law firm that represents american companies involved in china s film industry said china s state administration of radio film and television sarft must approve all films prior to release growth in viewership of movies has slowed in the united states but in china with 1 3 billion people and more people emerging into its middle class all the time movie viewership is skyrocketing said harris sen jay rockefeller d w va introduced the violent content research act in january the bill would compel the national academy of sciences to study the effects of violence in the media on children the bill has bipartisan support but the entertainment industry is working against its passage the censoring of content is simply good business as far as the studios are concerned said stephen tropiano an associate professor of screen studies at ithaca college and author of obscene indecent immoral and offensive 100 years of censored banned and controversial films according to frank couvares an expert on censorship and the film industry in america at amherst college legislative interest in hollywood is nothing new movies were considered commerce not art until 1952 and were therefore not afforded first amendment protection pressure from religious groups women s groups and other public interest groups led to the establishment of local and state censorship boards said couvares there were real threats of government censorship every year there were calls for federal censorship which were never passed but the threat was there couvares said hollywood studios created the motion picture association of america mpaa to head off calls for federal censorship the mpaa established the production code administration to assign film ratings and internally censor questionable material couvares also noted hollywood compliance with foreign censors while pushing back on u s regulation is nothing new hollywood has been doing this for a hundred years gabe rottman legislative council and policy adviser for the american civil liberties union said hollywood s relationship with china s sarft is not its only tie to censorship the mpaa was a prominent supporter of last year s proposed stop online piracy act sopa in the house and protect ip act pipa in the senate rottman acknowledges the industry s commercial need to protect its intellectual property but said the bill went to far sopa was a conduit to censorship rottman said it implicated takedown of content from the internet which is a direct first amendment problem the bill was defeated after the technology community organized a vigorous grassroots opposition when asked whether hollywood s relationship with china will give u s politicians leverage in pressing down on the film industry s use of violent content fitton said not to worry i think federal regulations of the content of films is something the courts will be very skeptical of i just don t see it happening couvares also agreed hollywood s work with china will not bolster the case for censoring violent content noting hollywood s practice of censoring movies for foreign audiences is business as usual it s par for the course this is nothing new in this but tropiano is wary he said hollywood s commercial interest in censorship might damage the artistic quality of films and studios are stepping into dangerous territory i am sure it is easy for a studio to justify making a minor cut in a film so it could be released in china but censorship alters the content of films and when you alter the content you alter the meaning although the mpaa declined to comment former sen christopher dodd d conn who is now chairman and ceo of mpaa told reporters at this february s national press conference that regulating content is a slippery slope movies do matter said dodd mary anne mcelroy is a co founder of the tammany a new york city cultural blog and is a former deloitte consultant and usa student ambassado
