apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion special counsel robert mueller s two year long fishing expedition found no evidence of the trump campaign colluding with russians so why is mr mueller now hinting that mr trump is somehow guilty after all maybe it s because the media which had heaped praise on him now see him as a sellout or loser or maybe it s because he wants to distract from a glaring fact he never addressed the real scandal which is the obama administration s flagrant abuse of the fbi and intelligence agencies to damage a presidential campaign and then failing that to destroy a sitting president since the russia collusion scandal dominated the news every day mr mueller may have helped democrats take the house in 2018 you d think they d be grateful but since he did not outright nail mr trump mr mueller s star has fallen top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning for his part former fbi director james comey has been outed as a squirrely partisan who used his office to target mr trump and allowed hillary clinton to skate away from actionable offenses connected with her unsecured email server her people wiped evidence bearing computers and used hammers on cellphones what s the big deal mr comey who admitted identifying as a communist when he was a young man and still reveres marxist theologian reinhold niebuhr as his spiritual lodestar is running around posing as the last uncorrupted man in washington this is the guy who collected a mountain of evidence against hillary and then publicly exonerated her he also leaked information to the press in a self serving attempt to damage the president he lied under oath to congress insisting that the fbi had not put the trump campaign under surveillance the whole mueller fiasco is not the only thing that needs to be addressed more is coming out about the leftist backgrounds of prominent obama officials former cia director john brennan who claims that president trump committed treason by colluding with russian leader vladimir putin voted for the communist party usa presidential ticket in 1976 despite this as noted in diana west s new book the red thread he was welcomed four years later into the ranks of the cia the only russian collusion in the mueller saga turns out to be the fbi s using the russia sourced steele dossier to mislead the fisa court into allowing surveillance i e spying on the trump campaign the democratic national committee and hillary clinton s campaign paid for the steele dossier and the fbi deliberately withheld that crucial piece of information if the court had known this it s doubtful they would have issued the warrant mr steele by the way was an outspoken socialist at cambridge backed the soviet sponsored nuclear freeze movement and hated mr trump according to sources cited by ms west meanwhile the clintons lucrative russia connections that poured money into their foundation s coffers have elicited almost zero interest contrast that with the media s fascination with mr trump s exploring the idea of building a hotel in moscow as he s done in many major international cities prima facia evidence that he s mr putin s puppet here s another thing that begs explanation james clapper s long tenure as president obama s director of national intelligence from 2010 to 2017 mr clapper was caught in a bald faced lie under oath before a senate committee on march 12 2013 denying that the nsa was spying on millions of americans shortly thereafter edward snowden leaked the truth but mr clapper kept his job mr clapper told the house intelligence committee in 2011 that egypt s chapter of the muslim brotherhood the parent organization for the terrorist group hamas was secular and that the muslim brotherhood has no overarching agenda and he was in charge of intelligence in the aforementioned book the red thread ms west gives chapter and verse on the main characters in the now obvious cabal to overturn the 2016 presidential election mr brennan s admission of voting for the communist party ticket in 1976 came during a sept 16 2016 panel discussion at the summit on increasing diversity in the intelligence community hosted by the congressional black caucus foundation cpusa presidential candidate gus hall in 1975 had called the united states the home base of the hit men of imperialism the cesspool of corruption of the lifeline of the capitalist world a year later mr brennan voted for him good cia recruitment material mr hall who died in 2000 also ran in 1980 and 1984 with angela davis as his vice presidential candidate ms davis is still a darling of the left getting back to mr comey he was among the signers of the fisa applications authorizing domestic spying on republican candidate trump s campaign then he denied that any surveillance took place if this all sounds wildly out of whack that s because it is but it fits a pattern the deep state hates mr trump because he has declared war on socialism and the washington swamp if allowed attorney general william barr will shine a light and generate indictments no wonder the democrats and the press now insist that we all move on there s nothing to see here and yes it s time to impeach mr trump for whatever isn t that what mr mueller was trying to say the other day robert knight is a contributor to the washing
