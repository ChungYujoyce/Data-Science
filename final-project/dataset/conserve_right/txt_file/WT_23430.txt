tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn so are they actors activists anarchists it doesn t much matter at this point plenty of west coast famous folks have dropped f bombs and spoken out against president trump his administration and republican voters in recent days now comes some good advice from one hollywood veteran roger l simon an academy award nominated screenwriter novelist blogger and co founder of pj media says the curtain should close on such antics and attitudes a finale is in order with conservatives leading the way trump derangement syndrome in tinseltown is simply around the bend and back and around the bend again and again writes mr simon top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots it s time for conservatives and what townhall com columnist kurt schlichter calls the normals to have an entertainment industry of their own hollywood has effectively divorced conservatives and the normals and after a divorce as they say living well is the best revenge the question is how mr simon points out that conservative financiers prefer funding think tanks to the arty world but then there is reality the truth is one good movie or television series is worth more than a hundred or even a thousand position papers when it comes to moving society mr simon observes what is needed here by investors on the right is a little guts for a change it shouldn t be so hard but somehow it is or has been it s obviously true that film theatre and publishing are risky investments but the center to right audience is huge plenty of proof of concept exists with films like the blind side lone survivor and american sniper just some examples of box office smashes that fit that profile he advises it s also obvious that mistakes will be made in forming companies like this plenty of them the lack of financial help has created a dearth of center or right talent but all this can be corrected with effort time and a bit of luck as the zen buddhists say you can t get there by trying but you won t get there if you don t try mr simon s newest novel the goat by the way was just published hollywood s quiet conservatives i think you would be surprised at the amount of conservatives in hollywood comedian michael loftus tells fox news citing grey s anatomy star isaiah washington who vexed the locals after deciding to leave the democratic party people like isaiah need to come forward there are normal people out there we just don t think big government is the solution i m sorry but that doesn t make us evil mr loftus said liberal hollywood activists are tough though they re trying to peel away trump supporters and make you feel like you re a weirdo if you lean to the right there is something that must be wrong with you how can you be this evil you re a nazi it s horrifying so good people need to stand up mr loftus advised a lesson from the road some observers offer evidence that america is not necessarily the land of racial turmoil that certain politicians and news organizations claim it to be all you have to do is take a road trip to find out america isn t racist as i traveled across america this summer i found something that would surprise many in the media i found a lot of racial harmony writes david marcus the new york correspondent for the federalist he drove from brooklyn to arkansas then on to california everywhere i went in the bars and restaurants i haunted along the way was a level of racial harmony that belies the notion of our nation as a hotbed of racism the people i met along the way and there were a lot of them were white black brown asian and native american and they weren t self segregated within the establishments i found much the opposite they were mixing mingling laughing and drinking together without even a hint of racial tension mr marcus continues what becomes clear very quickly is that for americans who do not choose to center their sense of self on their demographic identities a whole host of other interests and qualities animate their social behavior whether they were college football fans in a barstow hotel bar truckers sitting out front of a greenville illinois motel smoking and sharing beer and tales from the road or more upscale denizens of a fancy tulsa wine bar sniffing and swishing a new rose nobody seemed to care much about skin color the columnist says none of this is to say that racism is dead in our society of course it is not he notes as far as america has to go to live up to the promise of equality for all it is wrongheaded and even dangerous not to celebrate how far our country as diverse as it can be has come so much for climate change tv viewers were not particularly thrilled with cnn s recent seven hour town hall on climate change which featured 10 democratic
