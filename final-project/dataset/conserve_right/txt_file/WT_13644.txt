little to solve the underlying problem of mountains of government debt in europe leaving markets still waiting for a permanent fix european leaders gather next week for a summit on the debt crisis the european central bank which has been reluctant to intervene to stop the growing crisis on its own continent was joined in the decision by the federal reserve the bank of england and the central banks of canada japan and switzerland the purpose of these actions is to ease strains in financial markets and thereby mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses and so help foster economic activity the central banks said in a joint statement china which has the largest economy in the world after the european union and the united states reduced the amount of money its banks are required to hold in reserve another attempt to free up cash for lending the display of worldwide coordination was meant to restore confidence in the global financial

banks cut business loans by 16 percent in the third quarter and no one knows how much european banks will lose on their massive holdings of bonds of heavily indebted countries until the damage is clear banks are reluctant to lend banks are also being pressed by european governments to increase their buffers against possible losses that helps stabilize the banking system but reduces the amount of money available to lend to businesses european banks are having trouble borrowing in general including in dollars said joseph gagnon a former fed official and a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics the fed did the europeans a favor foreign central banks are reducing by half a percentage point to about 0 6 percent the rate they charge commercial banks for dollar loans commercial banks need dollars because it is the no 1 currency for international trade the lower rate is designed to get credit flowing again to get the dollars to lend central banks go to the fed and exchange their currency for dollars under a special swap program foreign central banks pay the fed whatever interest they earn from commercial banks the fed had offered dollar swaps from december 2007 when world financial markets were weakening because of fear about subprime mortgages until february 2010 it reopened the program in may 2010 as european debt concerns grew and planned to end it aug 1 2012 on wednesday the fed extended the program to feb 1 2013 if it all works the market rates on dollar loans will drop and stock and bond markets will calm down it shows that policymakers are on the case said roberto perli managing director at the international strategy investment group an investment firm he said it has symbolic value even if it does not have a big impact on credit markets the decision to cut the interest charged on the dollar swaps was taken by the federal reserve following a videoconference held by fed officials on monday morning the fed s policy

announced their move finished lower for the day the statement came out at 8 a m in the middle of the european trading day and an hour and a half before the market opened in new york borrowing costs for countries across europe fell an encouraging sign the yield on benchmark 10 year national bonds dropped 0 32 percentage points in belgium it also fell in spain france and germany the yield on 10 year italian bonds fell 0 08 points to 7 01 percent the 7 percent level is significant because it is considered the point at which a country s borrowing costs become unsustainable yields above that level forced ireland portugal and greece to seek bailouts in the u s the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 2 08 percent from 2 percent late tuesday that showed investors were willing to take money out of assets considered super safe such as u s government debt and invest it in riskier assets like stocks it is also a sign of increased confidence in the u s economy which is beginning to pick up after it faltered in the spring and summer it grew at an annual rate of 2 percent in july august and september the strongest since late last year it will take more than that to bring down unemployment

of what its economy produces in a year the ecb extends unlimited short term loans to banks it cannot lend directly to governments including by buying their national bonds it can however buy national bonds on the secondary market lowering borrowing costs for governments the ecb has resisted expanding even this indirect support because it believes that would take the pressure off politicians to cut spending and reform government finances a concern known as moral hazard european leaders are considering other options including creating a fiscal union giving a central authority control over the budgets of sovereign nations that would ease the ecb s concerns the ecb has also worried that injecting too much money into the european economy would trigger inflation the coordinated action was a demonstration of how interconnected the world financial system is and that the debt loads of countries like italy and greece are everyone else s problem too germany s economy depends heavily on exports and if economic output in the rest of europe collapses the people of smaller countries couldn t buy as many german goods across the atlantic ocean the united states depends on europe for 20
