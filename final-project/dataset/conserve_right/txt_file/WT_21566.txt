changing their gender cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches i gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted trump told reporters at a campaign style rally in lima ohio i didn t get a thank you but that s ok in fact mccain s family made clear that trump was not welcome during the week long cross country

2008 to deliver eulogies on the value of pursuing goals greater than oneself trump signed off on the military transport of mccain s body went golfing and was uncharacteristically quiet on twitter during the washington events trump s publicly nursed grudge against mccain has not appeared to alienate core supporters some of whom had soured on the senator by the time of his death aware of this

trump s indecency to john s memory and to the mccain family will convince more officeholders that they can t ignore the damage trump is doing to politics and to the country s well being or remain silent despite their concerns said mark salter mccain s biographer they must speak up trump has said for years that he doesn t think mccain is a hero because the senator was captured in vietnam mccain

said he never had been a fan and never would be his relentless new targeting of the deceased senator seemed to cross a boundary for several republicans senate majority leader mitch mcconnell called mccain a rare patriot and genuine american hero in the senate mcconnell tweeted his memory continues to remind me every day that our nation is sustained by the sacrifices of heroes the kentucky

mccain s seat from arizona john mccain is an american hero and i am thankful for his life of service and legacy to our country and arizona she tweeted wednesday everyone should give him and his family the respect admiration and peace they deserve that mcsally declined to criticize trump directly reflected the broader wariness among republicans to cross a president famous for mobilizing his followers against gop lawmakers he deems disloyal but this week trump seemed to inspire a new determination among some to draw a line however delicately sen lindsey graham who wept openly on the senate floor after mccain died but has allied himself strongly with trump said i think the president s comments about sen mccain hurt him more than they hurt the legacy of sen mccain a lot of people
