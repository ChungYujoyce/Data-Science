this week for talks with the people s republic s military leaders amid growing tensions over beijing s militarization of islands in the south china sea mr mattis told reporters en route to alaska aboard an air force e 4b jet a militarized boeing 747 that he plans to gauge china s strategic approach to the united states during talks in beijing on our relations with china obviously we re reviewing our military to military relationship to make sure it s aligned within our larger strategic framework he said top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning the defense secretary described the upcoming meetings in china which will include talks with senior generals as an exchange on strategic perspectives on topics of mutual concern to determine where we have common interest and where our interests diverge the pentagon for the first time in decades identified china along with russia as a strategic military threat under a new national defense strategy made public in january the strategy labeled china a strategic competitor reflecting the new white house national security strategy that has focused on economic and trade threats posed by beijing s unfair policies china for years has rebuffed repeated u s attempts to build trust through military exchanges of senior officers which critics say have often been exploited by the people s liberation army in a bid to gain intelligence on american military strengths and weaknesses that could be used against u s forces in a future conflict mr mattis declined to say whether the review of military exchanges would lead to scaled back visits by senior military officials from both countries the defense secretary left sunday from joint base andrews on a six day visit to asia that includes stops in alaska china south korea and japan the visit to china comes amid u s complaints at china s recent deployment of advanced anti ship missiles and air defense missiles on disputed islands in the south china sea the missile emplacements violated a september 2015 pledge by chinese president xi jinping announced during a summit with then president barack obama that china would not militarize the disputed islands the islands also are claimed by philippines vietnam and several other states in the region china has built up some 3 200 acres of new islands in the sea over the past several years and quietly added military facilities including runways bunkers storage areas and recently missiles as a result of the missile deployments the pentagon blocked the chinese navy from taking part in the upcoming u s led international naval exercise called rim of the pacific or rimpac mr mattis is scheduled to arrive in china as naval forces from more than two dozen nations kick off the exercises later this week the coinciding of the mattis visit with the start of rimpac will likely be viewed by the chinese as further highlighting the snub of the pla navy the idea is to maintain transparency to maintain understanding what each other is doing mr mattis said of rimpac navies can be one of the most stabilizing influences in terms of counter piracy freedom of navigation disaster relief humanitarian support several recent u s warship passages in the south china sea were met with chinese warships that tried to force the navy vessels out of the region china also upset the u s military recently by firing a laser at u s military aircraft flying near a chinese military base in djibouti on the horn of africa the laser injured the eyes of two aircrew members aboard c 130 transport aircraft flying to a nearby u s base china in recent months also has stepped up military coercion of taiwan an american ally by flying bombers near the island located 100 miles off china s southeastern coast mr mattis s first visit to china comes after he criticized beijing activities in the region last month during a speech in singapore i think the way to address issues between our two nations is to first establish a transparent strategic dialogue he said mr mattis said he plans to study how the chinese view the current state of relations with the u s and how they are developing he also plans to explain to beijing s leaders how the u s views the relationship and the way to get to the other issues that are vexing is to start with strategic transparency as a way to get to operational transparency he said so that would be my message he said without elaborating further china under current supreme leader mr xi has initiated a major purge within the military over corruption analysts however say the ousting of scores of senior military members is more likely the result of mr xi s bid to consolidate power by removing potential rivals mr xi in addition to being party leader also heads the central military commission the ultimate power organ within the system of the ruling chinese communist party mr mattis declined to characterize u s china tensions over the south china sea taiwan and beijing s theft of american technology as the harbinger of a new cold war we have larger issues and you see those being handled he said trade negotiations between the state department and chinese foreign ministry are also under way and again i m going there to get what i consider to be straight from them what they see for a strategic relationship mr mattis said the retired marine general added that he plans to go in right now without basically poisoning the well at this point as if my mind is already made up i m going there to have a conversation asked whether he planned to scale back military engagement with china mr mattis declined to say what he would or would not do in the future i would tell you that going forward that we obviously look at the actions of china but i m going there to do a lot of listening and identification of common ground and uncommon ground on the strategic level he said mr mattis said he believes china shares the u s interest of seeking a denuclearized korean peninsula that s their policy he said but by and large i want to go in and take a measure for where they re at today and see where our interests converge at the same time i m going in to do the listening this time and make certain that where we can we can engage in a transparent strategic conversation asked about the new defense strategy s identification of china as a strategic competitor mr mattis said that s why i m going there i want to understand how they see the strategic relationship developing and first of all hear in their words how they see this going strategically i do not want to immediately go in with a certain preset expectation of what they are going to say i want to go in and do a lot of listening as for the issues of u s concerns i ll be very clear on what we see developing he said but that s the whole reason i m making the trip instead of just sitting in washington and reading news reports intelligence reports or analysts reports during the wide ranging interview with reporters mr mattis said the pentagon is preparing two military bases in the u s to house detained illegal immigrant families the bases are part of logistics support to the department of homeland security that is grappling with the politically charged issue of illegal immigrant children held in detention centers mr mattis said the military support will resemble what was provided to fleeing vietnamese boat people after the communist takeover of south vietnam in the 1970s and u s military support to americans displaced in the aftermath of natural disasters mr mattis also defended the decision to suspend u s south korean military exercises that came out of the summit between president trump and north korean leader kim jong un a large scale joint exercise set for august has been suspended but could be rescheduled if progress in the nuclear talks with north korea stalls we anticipate that progress will be made and as it was decided in singapore the large joint combined exercises have been suspended he said i would just say we see if the continuing negotiations keep them that way but right now they ve been suspended i don t have a crystal ball no one knows it s up to the diplomats to make sure this goes ok mr mattis said he remains in close communication with secretary of state mike pompeo who is expected to visit north korea soon for follow on nuclear talks mr mattis plans a monday visit to fort greely alaska the location of american ground based interceptors part of the anti missile system that would be used to counter any north korean missile attack currently 40 ground based interceptors are deployed and more are being added mr mattis also said the united nations command in south korea is prepared for north korea to turn over remains of soldiers killed during the korean war from 1950 to 1953 north korea s agreement to return the remains which may include casualties from nations other than the u s and south korea was one of the outcomes of the recent singapore summit the u n command has staged appropriate logistics materials and we are simply standing by for whenever the diplomatic activities are done and this begins he said we re optimistic it will be done because that was an agree
