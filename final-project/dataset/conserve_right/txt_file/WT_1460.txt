apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic rick bright a top vaccine researcher at the national institutes of health warned congress on thursday that the u s is risking the darkest winter in modern history and that the trump administration is not prepared to combat the coronavirus pandemic adequately he told a house committee that the administration ignored his early warnings about supply shortages and the seriousness of the outbreak putting the country behind on combating the disease mr bright who was removed from his job as director of the biomedical advanced research and development authority barda says he was the victim of retribution for criticizing president trump top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed hogan says maryland can begin testing residents for covid 19 without appointment symptoms he raised alarms about the brewing pandemic he said and lives were lost because higher ups didn t heed him he said he faced hostility and marginalization from officials at the department of health and human services who ignored the warnings to start work on a vaccine and to ramp up production of personal protective equipment early on in the outbreak hhs secretary alex m azar ii slammed mr bright on thursday afternoon and said the administration moved swiftly and early on all fronts while we re launching operation warp speed he s not showing up for work to be part of that he said referring to a project to find a vaccine so this is like someone who was in a choir and is now trying to say he was a soloist back then what he was saying is what every single member of this administration and the president saying we need more personal protective equipment we need more ventilators we need therapeutics we need vaccines mr azar clearly angry shouted in rising tones as the president s helicopter hummed in the background at the white house everything this president was on this president achieved he said mr bright told the house energy and commerce committee that he was getting alerts in january about the medical supply chain starting to dry up and wasn t believed in early february when he warned hhs about a shortage of n95 masks he argued that by not taking those early steps to bolster u s supplies lives were lost early in the outbreak particularly health care workers on the front lines of the pandemic response we did not forewarn people we did not train people we did not educate them on social distancing and wearing a mask as we should have in january and february he said all those forewarnings all those educational opportunities for the american public could have had an impact in further slowing this outbreak and saving more lives regarding a vaccine mr bright cautioned that the 12 18 month time frame to create a vaccine many have touted is aggressive but he does think a cure will be found my concern is if we rush too quickly and consider cutting out critical steps we may not have a full assessment of the safety of that vaccine so it s still going to take some time he said however there needs to be a plan to shore up resources especially if there s a rebound of cases overlapping with the seasonal flu mr bright said it was fortunate the coronavirus outbreak began as flu season was starting to end there s no one company that can produce enough for our country or for the world he said we need to have a strategy and plan in place now to make sure that we can not only fill that vaccine make it distribute it administer it in a fair and equitable plan mr bright filed a whistleblower complaint last week he said he was demoted because he clashed with political leaders regarding the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine an existing malaria drug that the president touted not long after the pandemic became the subject of daily press conferences but has since largely dropped republicans who acknowledged the seriousness of mr bright s accusations pressed him on why barda wouldn t at least consider looking into the potential use of the drug since it was already widely used and there were anecdotal reports of success when used early enough mr bright explained that while he was initially open to it the data that came in didn t suggest there was enough of a benefit to explore it i tried to track the media and the scientific journals as well however i rely on the guidance of the science within hhs he said the first i d heard of that was from my colleague dr janet woodcock at the fda and then a summary report from our scientists at fda cdc nih and barda indicated that the evidence for its benefit was weak and the evidence for its safety concerns was stronger and they did not believe at that point it was something that should be supported in a letter from the office of special counsel circulated by mr bright s lawyers before thursday s hearing investigators found a substantial likelihood of wrongdoing by hhs but notes the investigation is not a final determination that the allegations are substantiated we need to be truthful with the american people mr bright said we have the world s greatest scientists they must be permitted to lead let them speak truthfully without fear of retribution mr trump defended his promotion of hydroxychloroquine saying there was a tremendous response to the drug before dismissing mr bright s complaints to me he is nothing more than a really unhappy disgruntled person the president told reporters dave boyer and tom howell j
