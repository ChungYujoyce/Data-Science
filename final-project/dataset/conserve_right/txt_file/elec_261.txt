 sign in second presidential debate will be a draw manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion you can almost chalk tuesday s presidential debate up as draw before it even starts this verdict should not depress republicans because it does not mean mitt romney won t again do a stellar job what it means is that because of the first debate the landscape has changed and there are factors in play this time that are largely beyond his control expectations have been reset if not entirely reversed because of mr romney s first debate victory the first time mr romney benefitted from unrealistically low expectations a product of mr obama s campaign strategy of personal diminution and the press s readiness to echo it that advantage is gone gone too are the equally unrealistically high expectations that previously prevailed for mr obama it is now all too clear that he is not the democratic demosthenes advertised of course no one could have been but mr obama paid a price for it this time he won t have to because expectations for his performance have been lowered most people expect another romney win top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens australian researchers see virus design manipulation coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history expectations are important especially in the subjective world of politics there are no objective standards when it comes to political debates no rules or standards that produce a clear winner and loser out of each contest the outcome is what we make of it measured against the expectations we bring to them mr romney s first debate triumph was built on the fact that he vastly exceeded while obama greatly fell below the public s pre debate expectations the combined separation was unmistakably large and so the verdict on the debate was unquestionably clear the outcome this time will be far murkier expectations are more realistic this time it will be very hard for mr romney to improve from his first debate performance he did all the right things then while it is certainly possible that he could do them better it won t be easy one of the hardest things there is to do is exactly the same thing twice mr obama will certainly improve his performance as vice president joseph r biden showed in the vice presidential debate whatever else the democrats are determined to be going forward they are not going to be disengaged or dispassionate again such an approach will at least appeal to mr obama s base while that may seem a small thing it was something mr obama failed to do the first time around the democratic base will not let their guard down again after the first debate they along with the media let their disappointment rule them they were shocked and unguarded enough to say so they turned on mr obama his campaign and even jim lehrer maybe they felt they had no choice but this time they will feel they have no choice but to not do so after the first debate fallout they now know they are playing for keeps this time mr romney s first debate win has been a huge boost when he desperately needed it another romney boost could prove electorally fatal to democrats so close to the election this time the president s base will not allow themselves the luxury of venting their frustration with mr obama s performance regardless of what it turns out to be by showing such restraint they can at least assure that there will not be a clear cut consensus as to who won this debate the very consensus that has continued to propel mr romney since that first debate the final reason that this debate is likely to be judged a tie on the day after is that mr romney does not have to win this is not to say that he will not debate to win or that he should not prepare or try to what it means is that he has already established his credibility in the first debate making himself appear at least the equal to mr obama in the eyes of much of the broader public this time he does not have to extend himself to do so he just has to be himself the person who has to extend himself in this debate is the president with that greater need comes greater risk as well you only had to watch the vice presidential debate to realize what that risk is together this all means the second debate is likely going to be judged a tie in the media yet romney supporters should not be dismayed a tie likely will just mean that their candidate has been a victim of his own success j t young served in the treasury department the office of management and budget and as a congressional staff member manage newsletters copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view comments click to hide terms of use privacy policy manage newsletters
