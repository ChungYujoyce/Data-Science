 obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion it s one thing to notice the media focusing on limited panic inducing headlines and narratives we see them do that every day during this trump era as the left relies on panic and victimhood to control people controlling most of the legacy media is a necessary part of being able to implement that strategy if you doubted this it is during a crisis where the intentions of the establishment and other people become clear the media reaction to the coronavirus also known as the wuhan virus reminds us of several important things not the least of which is that the liberal and media establishment really holds this country and its people in contempt from the start when president trump took decisive and swift action by cutting off certain travel to and from china and establishing a task force on the virus he was attacked by various media as being xenophobic and racist his governing and leading was inconvenient you see because the left s agenda at that point was still riding impeachment to death when that became a debacle they switched midstream back to the clownish allegations that everyone they didn t like was a russian spy operative or troll top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey you see everything that happens is viewed by the left as a prism of opportunity i can say this with confidence as having been on the left and that mindset was the driving factor never was there an effort or even an idea that existed purely based on how it would improve society help the individual or make this nation safer and stronger enter the wuhan virus something the united states did not create plan or want it is an external biological disaster many add the word natural to that but it s too soon to draw that conclusion to say china has not been transparent or forthcoming with information would be an understatement we do know there is a governmental biological laboratory in wuhan experimenting with viruses including those of the corona class the chinese are telling the world to stop calling it the wuhan virus and are absurdly demanding an apology from the west for doing so this is because the name reminds humanity that the biological catastrophe comes from a nation that has no one s best interest in mind msnbc hosts jumped on the bandwagon beclowning themselves with accusations that calling the wuhan virus the wuhan virus was racist on twitter msnbc host chris hayes insisted just astoundingly gross to call it the wuhan virus this after a republican member of congress referred to it as such david gura also with that network tweeted fyi calling covid19 the wuhan virus is racist in this age of being concerned about an intervention in our country by foreign interests it s astounding certain media would move a message that is the preferred narrative of the chinese government why that would not raise a red flag for them is perplexing pj media outlined the innumerable cases of cable network hosts and guests getting excited at the prospect that the wuhan virus could be mr trump s katrina moment pj explained katrina moment is to disasters what watergate is to corruption anything can be a katrina moment if you add enough sizzle from the media it also reported cnn s chris cillizza is on rumor patrol writing whispers have begun that president donald trump s handling or mishandling of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic has the potential to have political consequences quoting never trumper rick wilson about this possibly being a katrina moment don t you love the reliance on whispers as an excuse to further abject nonsense in an effort to use a life and death situation as a political cudgel but cnn is gonna be cnn moreover newsbusters highlights an exchange between msnbc host nicolle wallace and princeton professor eddie glaude both of whom got animated and seemed excited over the idea that hundreds of people could die but it would be worth it because finally some of trump s base would stop supporting him and then there are the headlines from cnn international is coronavirus trump s katrina huffington post tom steyer predicts coronavirus will be trump s hurricane katrina marketwatch scaramucci this could be trump s hurricane katrina and it goes on and on in the meantime mr trump wasn t sitting around obsessing about how america s suffering would be a good thing with which to nail his political opponents quite the contrary after establishing a political career hating mr trump california gov gavin newsom found himself in the midst of the wuhan virus disaster and actually needed the president s assistance fortunately for mr newsom mr trump operates differently from him and focuses on actually governing and doing what s right a fact mr newsom recently had to admit at a press conference mr newsom commented trump said we re going to do the right thing and you have my support he said everything that i could have hoped for and every single thing he said they followed through on the washington examiner reported newsom s remarks were in contrast to his usual criticism of trump he recently called california the most un trump state in the country california is un trump the dire condition of that state proves that point perhaps now is the time to reject the harmful and absurd obsession with hating the president and recognize that we re all in this together the president understands that to the benefit of everyone
