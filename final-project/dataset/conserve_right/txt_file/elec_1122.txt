earlier this month rand paul announced his run for the white house in 2016 and was immediately dragged through the mud by the mainstream media why is the media being so harsh on rand paul in short it s because they just don t like him his attitude toward them coupled with their overbearing love for other candidates makes him an easy media target however a more fitting question could be why does the media love covering hillary clinton and jeb bush so much comparing bush to clinton is almost like comparing coke to pepsi and the media is consuming it like they haven t had a drink in weeks since many candidates other than clinton and bush are outside of the establishment or status quo they are treated differently by being given less coverage sen rand paul r ky announces the start of his presidential campaign as the audience cheers tuesday april 7 2015 at the galt house hotel in louisville ky paul launched his 2016 presidential campaign tuesday with a combative message against both washington and his fellow republicans declaring that we have come to take our country back ap photo carolyn kaster googletag cmd push function googletag display div gpt ad in content 300x250 102 clinton and bush have also received their fair share of negative coverage most notably the recent new york times article discussing the hillary campaign s hidden donations however when looking at media coverage of many other candidates including ted cruz marco rubio and others they are getting hardly any coverage compared to the big two and most of it is negative how and why are the other candidates being grouped into this different category against these two to begin both of these candidates have similar views histories and strategies what is most important to note however is that they also have many of the same backers and donators these are two candidates coming from opposing political parties yet they have the same people supporting them you may be asking yourself how this can be possible as you very well should be the big businesses supporting these candidates want the race to come down to these two because they re so similar that it does not truly matter to them which one wins both candidates claim that they have the main street american in mind but have only ever been a wall street resident themselves clinton makes more than the top 10 ceo s in the country do and is backed by some of the same companies and the 1 percent she claims to want to take down bush on the other hand has only ever experienced politics firsthand with both his father and brother serving as presidents before him thankfully paul has recently started calling out and exposing the media for being particularly hard on him and not on other candidates their lovefest as he calls it with hillary clinton is unfair considering how much they hound him and other gop candidates on their views and boy does the media love covering clinton reporters are so desperate to get coverage of her that they resorted to running after her van like children after an ice cream truck there were also so many of them at her campaign opening that they even outnumbered the voters although she has also recently received much negative coverage the media can t seem to cover her enough where is all of this media love for rand paul rand paul and the other candidates outside of the normal realm are being targeted because their ideas are new and different and that scares people when it comes to politics big businesses want a candidate that will continue doing the things that have helped them rake in the money and won t ever accept a candidate that aims to change this even though these ideas are often in the best interest of the consumer big businesses and their money have a lot more pull than the average american consumer at one time journalists upheld their duty to deliver objective stories backed by unbiased facts but those days are long gone while media darlings like the clintons and jeb bush get loads of coverage both positive and negative rand paul can t catch a break the reporters that aren t fond of him need to get over their egos think about what will help americans as a whole and work to once again go back to real unbiased journalistic practices chris markowski has carried the titles of author investment banker equity analyst muckraker all around trouble maker and most importantly consumer advocate he is the personality behind watchdog on wallstreet and founder of markowski investments theblaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views the opinions expressed in this channel are solely those of each individual author
