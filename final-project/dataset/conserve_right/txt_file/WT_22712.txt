a administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion last week special counsel robert mueller who had been appointed by the department of justice two years earlier to investigate the nature and extent of russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election and to determine if those attempts did occur whether the russians had any willing american collaborators in the trump campaign came to the cameras and announced his resignation he also underscored some of his findings and did so in such a manner as to gin up house democrats in their march toward impeachment since his nine minute statement and his subsequent resignation he has been praised by many in the political class averse to president donald trump and harshly condemned by the president he was even criticized by his longtime friend and former boss attorney general william barr praised and criticized for what here is the backstory top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots when mr mueller confronted roadblocks during his investigation he sought and received authorization from the department of justice to expand his investigation the roadblocks consisted of attempts by the president himself to interfere with mr mueller s work in order to keep mr mueller s fbi agents at bay because of this behavior the president who originally was not personally a focus of the fbi investigation became a subject of mr mueller s investigation we learned from mr mueller s report to mr barr that while there is evidence of members of the trump campaign collaborating with the russians there is not enough evidence to establish a conspiracy we also learned that mr trump personally engaged in 10 or 11 depending on how you count them efforts to interfere with mr mueller s investigation each of these attempts at interference constitutes the crime of obstruction of justice that crime consists of any material attempt whether successful or not to impede a federal investigation for a corrupt purpose so a lawyer who files motions asking a judge to restrain fbi agents from violating the lawyer s client s constitutional rights is interfering with a federal investigation but for a lawful not a corrupt purpose yet when the subject of a criminal investigation orders those who work for him to lie to fbi agents or to falsify documents that are soon to enter fbi hands as mr mueller found mr trump did that constitutes an attempt to interfere with a federal investigation for a corrupt purpose the corrupt purpose is not the vindication of constitutionally protected rights rather it is keeping law enforcement away from the person who ordered the deceptions when federal law enforcement discovers evidence of presidential obstruction of justice this immediately triggers two questions the first asks whether the president can be prosecuted for these acts as any other person would and the second asks if these acts are impeachable offenses we know that presidential obstruction of justice is an impeachable offense because both president richard nixon and president bill clinton each of whom instructed aides to lie to fbi agents and falsify evidence were charged with it the charges came in articles of impeachment in these cases either the house of representatives or its judiciary committee found that the appropriate constitutional language that forms the basis for impeachment high crimes and misdemeanors includes obstruction of justice when mr mueller gave his short farewell he emphasized his view that this issue whether mr trump s obstruction of justice warrants impeachment is squarely before the house he did not argue that the issue of whether mr trump in fact obstructed justice is an issue because his 448 page report laid out unambiguous evidence of mr trump s obstruction then mr mueller addressed the issue of whether or not the president can be criminally charged while still in office on that issue he chose not to come to a conclusion but to leave it to his boss the attorney general to do so he did that knowing well that the attorney general who had just been appointed to his job by mr trump was on record as having argued that a sitting president should not be charged with crimes mr mueller said publicly however that the reason for his personal hesitation in charging the president is an october 2000 doj legal memorandum it offered that charging a sitting president with a crime would impair his ability to perform his constitutional duties and thus ought not to be undertaken but the 2000 opinion is just one of three that the doj has commissioned in the modern era of the three two say the president ought not be charged while in office and one says that he may be charged none says he cannot be charged stated differently and this is no doubt what drew mr trump s ire mr mueller revealed in his farewell that but for the 2000 doj opinion there is ample evidence to have indicted president donald trump for obstruction of justice i have argued in this column and elsewhere that mr mueller s deference to the 2000 doj opinion is misplaced we know that because two months after it was promulgated federal prosecutors threatened to indict incumbent president clinton for obstruction of justice on the day after he left office mr clinton chose to address the threat while still in office and directed his lawyers to engage in plea negotiations with prosecutors they negotiated a plea deal in which he pleaded guilty before a federal judge mr clinton had appointed to the bench the plea was to ethical violations in which he admitted that he lied to the court question what do you call a threat by federal prosecutors to seek an indictment of the president and subsequent plea negotiations answer a prosecution of the president where does all this leave us mr trump s legal woes are behind him impeachment is a political process that can only be successfully undertaken with broad public sentiment behind it i doubt there is such sentiment today andrew p napolitano a former judge of the superior court of new jersey is a regular
