 sign in christian voters need to know when they re being patronized manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion the ideal presidential candidate is a man or woman with god at the core of his or her life and the constitution at the center of his or her philosophy of government that candidate would probably not be donald trump many conservatives even some evangelical christians may not get it that includes those at liberty university on jan 18 who rocked the arena with applause as mr trump spoke in tweets and seven second sound bites that garbled true conservative principles and perhaps even christianity top stories australian researchers see virus design manipulation russian fighter jets intercept u s navy patrol aircraft over mediterranean coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history it s good that liberty is inviting presidential candidates so that the big university s predominately christian voters can get to know them first timothy 3 6 gives solid advice about choosing leadership the candidate should not be a novice lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the same condemnation as the devil while the context refers to leaders in the church the principle is a good one for leadership at large questions therefore arise is donald trump a novice christian and novice conservative know those who labor among you says 1 thessalonians 5 12 do evangelical and catholic christians along with conservatives in general really know donald trump mr trump came happily to work his shtick on the nice religious people as he put it packing the liberty university arena sadly he gave an incoherent speech consisting mostly of lines that pandered to his audience the performance was insulting to christians everywhere i wonder if the majority of the liberty audience grasped that fact when it comes to speaking the language of evangelical christianity mr trump is like a first semester foreign language student who tries to sound like he s spoken the new lingo all his life native speakers understand right away that such a person is a beginner and try not to laugh in his or her face mr trump would do well to learn from marco rubio ted cruz ben carson carly fiorina and other candidates who speak evangelical christianity with fluent ease because they really do have god deep in their lives and not just as a political facade in an attempt to patronize the religious crowd mr trump cited a scripture containing the word liberty there was a smattering of laughter when he cited two corinthians 3 17 at the bible based school where most pronounce it second corinthians i believe that mr trump said of saint paul s words in the text really was he saying he believed that christ had come to free people from the enslavement to the law to try to please god by giving grace to all who would receive it that s the meaning of the reference but what did mr trump mean he didn t say whatever it is to him it s the whole ballgame mr trump soared on to the heights of pandering if i m president you re going to see merry christmas in department stores believe me he promised how will he do that executive order mr trump promised he would protect christianity in a world where it is under siege that is reassuring however he is not running to be god but the president of the united states to really be the defender of the christian faith mr trump needs to first humble himself before god if he hasn t already what the audience at liberty and american christians everywhere need to hear from mr trump is what god means in his own life mr cruz mr carson mrs fiorina and mr rubio have all done this in some of their appearances evangelicals call this a testimony it s a report of how a relationship with jesus christ has transformed the person s life i hope donald trump is a truly born again regenerate follower of christ however the electorate especially evangelicals must decide if he is a preacher who has just found his political voice or a politician trying to sound like a preacher christians and other conservatives flocking to mr trump are like people with their eyes wide open but who see nothing donald trump constantly proclaims that as president i will do this or that his adoring followers don t perceive that all those claims mean the enlargement not the reduction of government mr trump is a populist progressive like teddy roosevelt and barack obama in the spirit of those two chief executives he is running for dictator not president some conservatives assert that they are constitutionalists but are weary of not getting results however many people who voted for teddy roosevelt because he could deliver found they didn t like what he delivered surely we have learned that in the obama era the roosevelt obama style of presidency eats the constitution for breakfast devours the congress for lunch and dines in the evening on the judiciary energized this godzilla mauls washington smashing the walls that separate the oval office from the rest of government until the presidency is the whole and the rest nothing more than an aggravating case of indigestion america needs the outcomes of a president who has god in his or her heart and the constitution in their head donald trump may seem to be saying it like it is but there s too much unsaid or muddled to make him the ideal candidate for the presidency of the united states tom delay is former majority
