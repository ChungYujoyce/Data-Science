corporation 27 95 394 pages for centuries the united states and china have had a multifaceted relationship these two countries with different histories political systems and traditions have traded goods traveled the high seas and increased their economic and military might while the mystery and intrigue of those early meetings has long since past the nations regularly meet along the road to power and success and this will continue for the foreseeable future yet it s rather surprising that so little has been written about the early period of u s china relations eric jay dolin an acclaimed author who has blended history wildlife and the environment in previous works the duck stamp story leviathan and fur fortune and empire was up to the challenge his new book when america first met china an exotic history of tea drugs and money in the age of sail is a well written account of two nations far from each other and the sea by which they forged an uneasy albeit profitable financial arrangement top stories trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds mr dolin s book starts at an intriguing time in america s history one ship the edward was traveling down the east river delivering what could arguably be called the birth certificate of the united states meanwhile another ship the empress of china was making a very important statement of its own announcing to the world that this new nation was ready to compete in the international arena the irony both ships set sail on feb 22 1784 george washington s 52nd birthday as mr dolin writes while this was just a coincidence it was particularly fitting that the infant nation s first foray to the far east should have commenced on the birthday of the man who had done more to found the united states than any other person the empress was funded by prominent financiers including robert morris one of the signers of the declaration of independence who established the first national bank the ship carried a huge amount of cargo including spirits fur ginseng and lead as well as nearly 20 000 in spanish silver coins which would be most welcome in canton the ship s captain john green was an imposing figure at six feet four inches tall and nearly three hundred pounds when the empress finally weighed anchor on july 22 the young nation s history was about to change as americans were finally entering the middle kingdom a talented researcher and wordsmith mr dolin has the ability to bring important historical accounts to life with china he paints a portrait of an ancient empire that viewed itself as a beacon for humanity and it expected other countries to accept willingly its elevated position trade with european countries was indirect at first because the chinese were wary of europeans the new european barbarians were often violent unpredictable and at times seemed as intent on gaining christian converts as they were on bartering for goods although this guarded position dropped over time it showed that china wanted to trade and build relations on their own terms what about the united states most colonists knew nothing about china and according to mr dolin regarded it as an imperial exotic empire that remained shrouded in myth even though some europeans had less palatable views of the chinese many educated americans including those in the american philosophical society remained positive in contrast china had never heard of the united states and was not quite sure what to make of the americans at first thinking that they were englishmen as the chinese learned more about the americans the more intrigued they became and eventually dubbed them the new people economic relations between the pearl of the orient and the revolutionaries soon took off american voyages across the sea to china increased with merchants like john jacob astor stephen girard and elias hasket derby taking the lead mr dolin writes new ships had to be built for the burgeoning china trade bringing shipyards back to life and employing thousands of men in various trades while these voyages were fraught with many dangers including the loss of life the taste for the middle kingdom s wares was nearly insatiable in when america first met china many chapters are spent detailing the growth of industries like silk and flowers the opium war also exploded much to the chagrin of emperors qianlong and jiaqing foreign factories were built throughout canton to meet the high demands of imports and exports even novelty acts such as chang and eng the siamese twins became popular attractions in the united states america and china knew little about one another two centuries ago and much has obviously changed mr dolin s book of historical facts unique tales and financial success in the glorious age of sail opens an important passageway into little known america china relations of the past that may also provide some guidance in the present michael taube is a former speechwriter for canadian
