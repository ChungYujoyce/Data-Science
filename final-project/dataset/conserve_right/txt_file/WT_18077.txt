ael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic some pundits and republican naysayers contend that former utah gov jon huntsman jr is too moderate to win the gop presidential nomination and that s a claim he denies with vigor and a hint of anger during a recent interview with the washington times mr huntsman checked off his accomplishments as utah governor from 2005 to 2009 making record tax cuts signing into law the first school voucher program and overseeing the rise of his state s economy to first in the nation status top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time he is confident that the race won t turn on his religion and downplays whispers from evangelical protestants who vow not to support a mormon these presidential nomination contests aren t about religion they re about leadership mr huntsman told the times in the kitchen of his home in washington s tony kalorama neighborhood mr huntsman 51 is proud of his leadership which he predicts conservatives will respect despite his tenure as president obama s ambassador to china and his positive comments about what republican voters see as an overly liberal president all people have to do is look at the record sometimes they don t and they just rely on tags he said when you look at what we did on record tax cuts being pro life and pro second amendment passing the largest tax cuts in the history of our state we went to the no 1 position economically he said education reform the first governor to sign a voucher program we did it around special education he noted that the pew research center named utah the best managed state in america mr huntsman said he won t stand a chance if voters allow the 2012 republican presidential nomination to revolve around religion if it s about religion i ll always come up short anyway said mr huntsman a mormon who until april 30 was mr obama s hand picked ambassador to china mr huntsman steers conversation away from one of his obvious advantages if elected he would be the only u s president with an intimate firsthand knowledge of the culture language and economy of china the one country capable of eventually challenging u s economic and military supremacy he speaks fluent mandarin and has spent much of his adult life on the communist mainland and in non communist taiwan making a president huntsman less likely to miss cultural nuances during critical trade and security talks but he and chief campaign strategist john weaver know that few voters choose the nation s chief executive on the basis of china planks or foreign policy generally instead he said he will run on what former governors normally do his record as a manager of a state at a time when the nation is in dire need of successful management mr huntsman declined to reveal his money raising target for the end of this year though he did say if the money comes in it will be because we have a message of leadership people want if we don t raise the money then we re not on a winning trajectory although that seems to suggest that he will drop out of the contest sometime this year unless the donors start coming through for him he insists that won t happen we re not going to drop when asked again what he figures he will need to have raised by december to stay in the race he laughed softly and said a lot it s going to go all the way to florida where i think the nominee is going to be decided he recognizes florida as a financially draining place to campaign with several major tv markets and comfortably more people than the first four states in the republican national committee s approved primary caucus calendar combined iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina that s a big expensive media market yet i think that s where the nomination is going to be won mr huntsman said still the former utah governor said he will vigorously contest new hampshire where former massachusetts gov mitt romney is a clear front runner the four latest polls at real clear politics give mr romney an average 21 7 percentage point lead mr huntsman and mr romney are the wealthiest contestants for the nomination but mr romney campaigning for far longer has far outraised mr huntsman whether mr huntsman is willing and able to match or exceed the television ad spending of the top candidates going into florida he won t say mr romney raised 18 25 million from april through june mr huntsman raised 4 1 million in his first 10 days of his candidacy about a third of it in seed money from his own pocket he said mr huntsman betrayed no concern that he is in a tie with former sen rick santorum of pennsylvania at 2 percent each for last place among 10 declared and prospective nomination candidates in real clear politics average of recent polls still mr huntsman faces an uphill campaign because he served a liberal democratic president and because many evangelical protestants who play a significant role in republican presidential contests say they won t vote for a mormon also mr romney a better known wealthy mormon who also has been around the nomination track once before is running and has had a large multistate experienced organization in place for a long time again mr huntsman s answer is because it s not going to be about r
