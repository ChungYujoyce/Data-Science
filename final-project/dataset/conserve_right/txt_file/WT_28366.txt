tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn amul thapar broke new ground when he became the first federal judge of south asian descent in 2007 and over the next decade he built a record as a well respected jurist when president trump nominated judge thapar to a seat on a federal appeals court the american bar association unanimously graded him well qualified yet when the son of indian immigrants came up for a vote on the senate floor not a single democrat backed him the process played out the same way for neomi rao a daughter of indian immigrants whom the aba rated well qualified but who was confirmed only on a party line vote and for michael park a korean american and kenneth lee a korean immigrant top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens none of them earned a single democratic vote it s tough to square that record with democratic senators complaints about a lack of racial diversity or female presence on the federal bench conservative court watchers say these are some real standouts said carrie severino chief counsel at the judicial crisis network democrats are looking at the wrong thing we are trying to come up with quotas and ratios let s look at having great judges men and women across the spectrum democrats have reasons for their opposition in each case judge rao who replaced justice brett m kavanaugh on the u s circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia was dinged for past writings on date rape democrats said judge thapar was reversed too often by higher courts on criminal and campaign finance cases judge park drew complaints for the clients he had as a lawyer who backed the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 census and challenged college affirmative action programs marge baker executive vice president of the liberal people for the american way said it comes down to the nominees records and whether they can be fair minded jurists it also comes down to ideology ms baker said one common theme in democrats opposition is that the nominees were part of the federalist society an organization of conservative and libertarian leaning lawyers and scholars that was a big factor for sen mazie k hirono a hawaii democrat who while demanding diversity on the bench has found little to like in the picks mr trump has offered many of them regardless of the sex age or background have written all kinds of articles or made their positions very clear on choice lgbtq rights she said they share some common traits large common factors membership in the federalist society which is a very conservative right wing organization ms hirono a member of the judiciary committee has supported 54 of mr trump s female and minority judicial nominees sen cory a booker of new jersey another committee member and a backer of judicial diversity has supported even fewer of mr trump s female and minority nominees the same goes for senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat and

frankly mr levey added mike davis president of the article iii project which backs the president s nominees said democrats have a history of resisting minority nominees from republican white houses
