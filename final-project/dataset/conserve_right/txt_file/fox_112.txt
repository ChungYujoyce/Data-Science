in paris we are reporting from the elysee palace the residence and office of the french president on the eve of emmanuel macron aposs state visit to the u s the first of the trump presidency the two leaders both political outsiders both with ambitious reform agendas have developed an unlikely friendship this hour we will explore their relationship and the dramatic differences on key issues they will try to resolve this week our exclusive with president macron in just a moment but first fox news senior foreign affairs correspondent greg palkot with a look at macron aposs astonishing rise to power and his controversial first year in office begin videotape greg palkot fox news senior foreign affairs correspondent nearly one year ago emmanuel macron strode onto the scene in france as president just 39 at the time he was the youngest leader in france since napoleon bonaparte the former investment banker got there by creating his own antiestablishment centrist political party and defeating a well known populist challenger marine le pen with two thirds of the vote emmanuel macron french president through translator i will do everything i can in the coming five years to make sure you never have a reason to vote for extremism again palkot the members of his new party called la republique en marche or the republic on the move also won a majority in the french parliament macron used his popularity to go against entrenched union to shake up a badly stagnating french economy a battle raging today he took a tough stand on the pressing immigration issue and honored an officer killed saving dozens in yet another terror attack in france his pro european union and internationalist approach getting the attention of leaders friendly and sometimes not so friendly after a tough handshake at their first meeting and some outstanding differences on issues like climate change video gap become close friends and allies first lady melania trump also hitting it off with macron aposs wife brigitte some 24 years older than the french president the two leader aposs business background and shared outsider status cementing the bond macron nothing will ever separate us palkot french involvement in a u s led missile strike against syria in response to the alleged gas attack there is a good example of the new alliance macron has taken knocks for sometimes being too interested in p r and his bowling has dipped as he aposs been accused of being more interested in the perks of the job but in a world looking for fresh leaders emmanuel macron often fits the global bill chris end videotape wallace greg thanks our interview with president macron came just one week after the u s france and britain launched a coordinated strike on the assad regime in syria but on the eve of the state visit there are still big issues that divide presidents macron and trump i came to the elysee palace to talk with the french leader built in 1722 for a french nobleman it was first used by the president of france in 1848 and the interview took place in the salon dore the golden room the french equivalent of the oval office begin videotape wallace mr president thank you for speaking with us macron thank you very much for being here in my office you aposre welcome wallace let aposs start with the state visit and your address to congress what message will you bring about relations between our two nations and what role the world would like to see the u s play macron look first of all i aposm very humbled to come to your country at the invitation of president trump and have the opportunity to discuss with him and going to the congress for this address my objective is to highlight a long term history between our two countries based on values we are very much attached to the same values and especially liberty and peace and i think the u s today has the very same role to play for peace in different regions of the world and especially the middle east and i think it aposs one of the last resorts player for this peace and for multilateralism so i will advocate for multilateralism and follow the congress for that which means playing altogether in order to reduce the international support ph of some rough state and very tough dictators obviously fight against terrorism together wallace many foreign leaders over the last year have come to washington but this would be the first state visit of the trump presidency how do you explain your special relationship with the president and some have called you the trump whisperer macron look i think we have this very special relationship because both of us are probably maverick ph of the systems on both sides i think president trump aposs election was unexpected in your country and probably my election wasn apost expected in my country we are not part of the classical political system second i think we are very much in line on some very critical issues of this world ph and especially combat terrorism and fight against isis third i think we have a strong personal relation based on the different meetings we aposve had and especially his visit your president gave to my country for bastille day in 2017 wallace i want to go back to your first meeting and the famous first handshake between the two of you at the nato summit in may of last year it lasted six agonizing seconds and you said afterwards it was not an innocent moment that it was a moment of truth how important do you think it was to establish that you are not going to be pushed around macron look i think there aposs a very direct and yes a very direct and lifting ph moment when i say it aposs not innocent it aposs to say we were sitting together and we had to shake hands and to say now we work well together wallace but you also made it clear they were going to let him macron normally it aposs especially inaudible wallace yes macron so i was very i mean seeing prime minister abe and some of the different victims i resisted in fact it was a very natural moment i have to say and a very friendly moment don apost worry wallace as you know the special counsel is investigating president trump this week the former fbi director james comey said that he was morally unfit to be president does this hurt president trump aposs credibility and his effectiveness on the world stage macron i don apost think so and audio gap back i mean people of the united states voted for president trump and elected him you have your system you are a free country with a rule of law which is i mean very good i have the same in my country this is an actual democracy with judges with media and with all the controversies but here in this office i aposm not the one to judge and in a certain way to explain to people what should you be your president or to consider because of his controversies or because of his investigations your president is less credible for me for my people and for the rest of the world i mean i aposm here to deal with the president of the united states and people of the united states elected donald trump wallace do you ever wonder whether he will serve his full term macron i never wonder that i mean i work with him because both of us are very much at the service of our country in both side and for me that aposs why even when we have some disagreements on climate and on some issues i think the most important thing is to i mean just to remind that we are at the service of our people that aposs our legitimacy and this service is to work for is a very long term history history for freedom for difference of our values and that aposs i mean lafayette came when you decided to be a free country he came from france he helped the united states to exist during the first world war during the second world war when we were attacked when our liberty was attacked thousands of your people came here and died here for my country that aposs a story of our relationship and president trump and myself are whatever happens in the line of this inaudible that aposs why my gift to your president will be oak taken in a very symbolic place especially for your marines in north of france that together i mean we will put in his garden because that for me is a great symbol of this long term relationship wallace audio gap the united states as a country of last resort your relationship with president trump was a bit strained this week after the attack on syria mr trump has made it clear that he wants to pull out begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we aposll be coming out of syria like very soon let the other people take care of it now end video clip wallace after the missile strike you said we convinced him it was necessary to stay for the long term the white house pushed back he wants u s forces to come home as quickly as possible so mr president which is it is president trump going to pull out of syria as soon as isis is defeated or have you persuaded him to stay to help stabilize the situation there macron it aposs not automatically u s forces but that aposs u s diplomacy and that aposs your president we will have to build the new syria afterward and that aposs why i think the u s hold is very important why i will be very blunt the day we will finish this war against isis if we leave definitely and totally even from a political point of view we will leave the floor to the iranian regime bashar al assad and his guys and they will prepare the new war they will fuel the new terrorists so my point is to say even after the end of the war against isis the u s france our allies all the countries of the region even russia and turkey will have a very important role to play in order to create this new syria and ensure syrian people to decide for the future wallace let aposs do what we call a lightning round quick questions quick answers when the president announced new tariffs on aluminum and steel for the european union you said we will not negotiate with a gun pointed at her head macron yes wallace there is now a may 1st deadline who is going to blink president trump or you macron i hope i mean he will not implement these new tariffs and he will decide for an exemption for the european union you don apost make trade war with your ally wallace but he has said that he is going to implement macron he said exemptions through may 1st let aposs see what it will do on may 1st i just say where are your priorities you cannot make a trade war with our ally i aposm very i aposm an easy guy i aposm very simple i aposm straightforward it aposs too complicated if you make war against everybody you make trade war against china trade war against europe war in syria war against inaudible come on it doesn apost work you need ally we are the ally wallace iran president has a may 12th deadline for deciding whether or not to life continue to lift the sanctions on tehran would it be a mistake for the president to pull out of the iran nuclear deal macron if this inaudible jcpoa a perfect thing for our relationship with iran no but for nuclear what do you have as a better option i don apost see it what is the what if scenario or your plan b i don apost have any plan b for nuclear against iran so that aposs the question we will discuss that aposs why i just want to say on nuclear let aposs preserve a framework because it aposs better than the audio gap of north korean type of situation second i aposm not satisfied with the situation with iran i want to fight against ballistic missile i want to contain their influence in the region my point is to say don apost leave now to jcpoa as long as you don apost have a better option for nuclear and let aposs complete it with ballistic missile and a regional containment wallace president trump appears close to holding a summit meeting with north korea aposs kim jong un do you think that his threats fire and fury his insults little rocket man however unconventional they may be brought kim to the table macron look i don apost know i aposm not an expert about i would say rationality of the north korean president and i think we always have to be very careful about this kind of declarations but i think the pressure he brought to this region plus the chinese role in this region because president trump worked very closely with president xi inaudible but now we will have to deliver wallace during president putin aposs visit here to france you called him out on russian interference in your election what do you think of vladimir putin macron i think he aposs a very strong man he aposs a strong president he wants a great russia people are proud with his policy he aposs inaudible with minorities and opens with an idea of democracy which is not mine but i have a permanent discussion with him even if we don apost we are disaligned on a lot of things his taunt ph and inaudible but don apost be naive he aposs opposite ph by indifferences in our democracies that aposs why i do believe that we should never be weak with president putin when you are weak he uses it and it aposs fine that aposs a game that aposs he made a lot of fake news he has a very strong propaganda and he intervenes everywhere along i mean around europe and the u s to fragilize ph our democracies because he thinks it aposs good for his country i respect him i know him i aposm lucid ph i want to work with him knowing everything about that end videotape wallace coming up much more of our exclusive interview with president macron we aposll discuss his reform agenda for france which has sent thousands of protesters into the streets as fox news sunday reports from the elysee palace in paris commercial break wallace coming up we ask president macron about criticism he rules france like a king begin video clip wallace some in the french press compare you to napoleon some have compared you to louis the 14th end video clip wallace more of our exclusive interview with emmanuel macron next on fox news sunday commercial break wallace coming up we ask president macron about criticism he rules france like a king begin video clip wallace some in the french press compare you to napoleon some have compared you to louis the 14th end video clip wallace more of our exclusive interview with emmanuel macron next on fox news sunday a welcoming ceremony for the president of senegal at the elysee palace home to the leaders of france since the 19th century and we aposre back now with more of our exclusive interview with french president macron ahead of his state visit to washington this week president trump likes to call himself a disruptor determined to transform the american economy but when it comes to shaking things up he has nothing on his french counterpart begin videotape wallace let aposs talk about your political movement en marche on the move how would you describe your reform agenda to americans emmanuel macron french president so my reform agenda is to modernize the country we fixed labor rule we fixed corporate taxes we are modernizing the different sectors railway and some ph and we will pursue this agenda to the end and at the same time we launch with germany a very strong approach in order to modernize the european union and eurozone agenda that aposs i mean that aposs my top priority because i want this country to be both much stronger and totally adapted to the new challenges like digital and green economy wallace when you came into office the unemployment rate was 9 5 percent it aposs now 8 9 growth is at 2 percent which is the fastest rate in 10 years but your critics say you are the president of the rich how do you plead macron when you have 10 percent unemployment are the rich victims i aposm not so sure the more you decrease unemployment the more you serve poor people because you provided jobs so my policy is focused on job creation helping business people and entrepreneurs in order to accelerate that job creation my agenda my emancipation agenda i would say i want people coming from poor neighborhood from middle classes to succeed through education and work in my country when you have a country with a lot of public expenditure with high unemployment your victims are poor people and people coming from poor neighborhoods wallace one of your main targets has been the national railway system jobs for life guaranteed benefits for life train engineers can retire at 52 but in your reform you don apost want to end that for the people who currently have it only for future workers i must tell you and you probably wouldn apost hear this much in france there are some american conservatives who say why not go further macron look i aposm not running the u s they should audio gap france because i know the situation i know what is fair and unfair and what can be delivered and what cannot be delivered why because i think the system is fine if inaudible current workers will preserve the situation but given the fact that we will have to take a lot of new workers we want to clarify the situation and hire them as a normal company you can always say you should do more when you are not the one in charge of it i aposm in charge believe me i take some commitments i delivered but i delivered to make fair and efficient decisions not to take unfair or inefficient decisions wallace you talk about fairness let aposs talk about your tax reforms you have dramatically cut the stiff tax on wealth but you are taxing retirees more heavily how is that fair macron look first indeed i kept the wealth tax which was very which was strong advocate ph for the french economy why because when people succeeded with a company and so on especially entrepreneurs they had to leave the country if they wanted to escape so we lost a lot of opportunities ph when they reinvest in the economy when they create jobs when they decide to reinvest in different listed or unlisted corporations i don apost want them to pay a wealth tax because they are good for the economy so i think this reform is both efficient and fair as for the retiring people i ask them a small inaudible that aposs why it aposs fair because in france workers pay for retirement for retired people that aposs the solidarity between generations if i don apost manage to push my country to have better results more workers and more inaudible for my workers i will jeopardize my capacity to pay retirement for retired people so that aposs fair that aposs a fair deal i told my retired people first thank you i told you during the campaign i will do it it aposs not a surprise i don apost betray you and third it is innocent ph and it is fair because when you look at the average in the society retired people are richer than middle class working people and when you look at the situation between the different categories 30 to 40 years ago people get retired at the same age as today but living 15 20 years less than today so that aposs the situation there aposs a chance i ask inaudible i know it aposs difficult you have always protests when you change something in the country but i do endorse because i think it aposs fair and it aposs one again fair in general between different generations and efficient in order to increase my results wallace one result of all this is that you have had major protests you aposve had these two day a week strikes one demonstration 200 000 people took to the streets any chance that you will back down macron no chance it aposs the classical way to proceed in france was to say we have an issue we will put new public money in order to solve this issue which is not the right way to fix the situation what i told french citizens before the election is that i want to address the deep roots of our problems it will take time sometimes you will have to take bold decisions but we have to fix the situation in depths so we will deliver and i have no other choice because if i stop here because some protests they are legitimate but they audio gap if i stop do you think it will be able to modernize the country and make this future it aposs finished so i will deliver because that aposs my duty and that aposs my commitment wallace but your poll numbers are down you were elected with 66 percent of the vote and the latest poll 58 percent disapprove of you only 40 percent approve macron you know polls are not the one to tell you where you have to go when you are elected if you follow the polls you never reform you never fix the situation you never transform because you are always obsessed by following where people want to go i was elected on a very clear basis and a very clear mandate i will deliver the mandate and i will look at the polls in due time not now wallace you talk about what it takes to be a leader you embrace symbols on your election victory night they played the ode to joy at the louvre the first time you addressed a french parliament it was at versailles and you have even said that france to some degree is still a monarchy is that how you see your role as a leader macron i don apost want to be a monarch i aposm president of the french republic i aposm elected and inaudible of my people which is very important to me because this is the only way to have a strong stimulus to work and to be to do your best i mean it puts a lot a pressure ph to meet on your own so each day you have to think about that in the sort of symbolical burden you have because of the history and because of this place of the country i do understand ph wallace some in the french press compare you to napoleon some have compared you to louis the 14th your predecessor in this office and your former political patron francois hollande has that has warned you to remember that the french also cut off the head of the king do you ever feel you need to guard against being arrogant macron definitely but having authority deciding being aware of all the consequences of your decision and thinking that you have to stick to your decision to deliver when it aposs good for the country is not the same as being authoritarian or arrogant so i try to preserve my inaudible i mean all of us are full of faults and weaknesses but i think the situation of my country is the best for me ph of being arrogant you aposre inaudible to do so i aposm here to serve my people in my country and make it great again as somebody i know very well could say but that aposs a that aposs the whole story and making great again means delivering good results having more unity for the country and being fair with with the people so all this criticism you mentioned i aposm just here to say now somebody decides and endorses you have employment ph to inaudible you have election you have a democratic system well one of the greatest democracies in this world but here in this current situation because all all of the challenges in france in europe in our world i have to take these responsibilities and i have to decide to endorse and to remain everyday both lucid ph and committed and i am chris wallace mr president thank you macron thank you wallace thank you for talking to us and safe travels to washington macron thank you very much thanks to your people and i will be very honored to to come visit your country and speak with your leaders thank you wallace thank you end videotape wallace president macron arrives in washington tomorrow for his state visit and he aposll also make a rare address by a foreign leader to congress up next we aposre back in washington with our sunday group to discuss what to expect from the macron visit in the week aposs other major developments and later a more personal look at the french president as he tells us what he likes most and least about his job commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states hopefully that meeting will be a great success and we aposre looking forward to it if i think that it aposs a meeting that is not going to be fruitful we aposre not going to go if the meeting when i aposm there is not fruitful i will respectfully leave the meeting end video clip wallace president trump clearly excited about a possible summit with north korea aposs kim jong un but still leaving himself an exit ramp and we aposre back in washington now with our sunday group former speaker of the house newt gingrich columnist for the hill juan williams former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and former nsc spokesman michael anton now with hillsdale college we aposll talk about president macron aposs visit in the next segment but first we want to tackle the other big news this week michael let aposs start with kim aposs surprise announcement on saturday morning that he intends to freeze his missile program his nuclear weapons program but no talk about giving them up so the question is how significant a development is this michael anton former nsc spokesman well he had he had already said that he would freeze the program the the new news was he aposs going to close a certain site which would be great if you he followed through this is one of the things that will have to be worked out as the administration talks to him get inspectors in there insure that that aposs genuine and permanent i think that this is a game plan that the north koreans inaudible on the united states and others before feel the pressure pretending inaudible game plan because it has been run so many times before you know as you saw the president saying he aposs ready to walk away if he doesn apost feel the north inaudible and in the meantime he you know let aposs inaudible and see where they go and see how serious the north koreans really are wallace congresswoman harmon the fact that we are so close to a kim inaudible unthinkable two months ago one of the questions that is will as the president and you heard him yes he did give himself the off ramp but he also talked and there is just this hype machine about the visit will he feel pressure to make concessions on the u s side in order to come away with a big deal jane harman former u s congresswoman d california well i hope concessions yes back concessions i hope not i mean a deal is concessions on both sides but this is not going to be denuclearization the best we can hope for is capping what kim jong un has and hopefully also capping the production of fissile material which he hasn apost offered to do inaudible wallace wait wait because you said it aposs not going to be denuclearization kim has specifically talked about that are you saying that the best we can hope for is recognizing them as a nuclear state harman i i don apost i think that is likely i don apost think he aposs going to give up his nuclear arsenal i think we can make a better deal than we made with iran if we do it correctly but let aposs understand denuclearization to him is us giving up our nuclear shield in asia which protects south korea japan abe was just here and i don apost think we aposre prepared to do that so what i aposm saying my bottom line is talking is better than bombing i think there is a good deal to reach with our allies that aposs another piece of this if trump is very careful and if he if he has a deep bench of advisors and that worries me because the national security council has been shaken up in the last few weeks and i don apost know if we have the bench we need to do this deal properly wallace speaker gingrich what do you see as the risks and rewards of a kim trump summit as it looks more and more likely that it aposs going to happen newt gingrich fox news contributor well i mean first of all there aposs always any risk when the most powerful nation in the world meets with a relatively small dictator because you aposre automatically giving him a level of prestige but let me remind everybody one of the key moments at the end of the cold war is ronald reagan at reykjavik walking away lecturing gorbachev in public you screwed this up you failed to do this it aposs your fault blitzer reykjavik gingrich reykjavik he walks away every senior republican thought reagan was wrong they all come back and said this is crazy six months later gorbachev has caved totally reagan gained every single thing donald trump understands he wants his deal and if he doesn apost get his deal he aposll take no deal and he aposll simply increase the pressure i mean trump i think is quite capable of saying you know you want more sanctions a key example we almost intercepted three tankers full of oil and the chinese begged us not to do it so he is quite capable of saying to him look you want me simply cut off all economic trade by sea with your country that aposs your choice big boy wallace while we were in paris there were a number of developments in what we call for better lack of a better word the russia investigation let aposs take a look at what happened just this week the comey memos were released former mayor giuliani joined the president aposs legal team mr trump tweeted james comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a special counsel therefore the special counsel was established based on an illegal act really does everybody know what that means and deputy attorney general rosenstein reportedly told the president he is not a target of the investigation but congressman trey gowdy says that doesn apost mean much begin video clip trey gowdy r south carolina congressman i don apost think the president is the target as you and i use that term in a non legal sense but in a legal sense that can change with one witness with one document end video clip wallace so juan you heard that list of developments just this week which of those developments really matters juan williams fox news political analyst well i think to a large extent this last week was about the nervousness here in washington about whether the president was going to fire the special counsel robert mueller and so if you look through all of the developments you listened chris what was really important was rod rosenstein aposs act here this congress you saw trump supporters in the congress threatened him with subpoena if he didn apost give them the memos that jim comey the former fbi director had written contemporaneously with visits with president trump and now having giving them the documents i think that whole argument about whether he would be under subpoena weakened more likely to be fired but president trump has somewhat calmed down and he as you saw he also said he aposs that the president is not a target of this investigation again calming down the idea that the president would fire rosenstein put someone in that job who is willing then to either rein in or fire mueller wallace speaker gingrich what aposs your take away as you look at all of these developments what aposs your take away on what matters what gingrich first first of all i urge everybody to read the original rosenstein memo about comey which trump totally mishandled what trump should have done is released that memo in a state of shock let the country through sunday talk shows deal with the memo it aposs devastating and it aposs clear that if you got that memo and you were the president you aposd have fired comey second i don apost know what rosenstein aposs doing this week the judge has indicated they aposre going to have probably going to have a special reviewer of all of this material would come under lawyer confidentiality they may not learn what aposs in that material till june how wallace you aposre you aposre talking about the michael cohen raid gingrich the michael cohen stuff how could how can rosenstein go in and reassure the president about material they haven apost looked at how can they reassure him about anything i mean this whole thing is a circus and i think we need to understand that we aposre not dealing with a traditional you know legal process we aposre dealing with a highly politicized process and which the number two guy at justice just saw the president of the united states to tell himself he can apost possibly know wallace so in other words we have no idea where we stand gingrich well i think this i think i think wallace and and should the president keep tweeting or should he stop tweeting gingrich well i wish he aposd tweet about 20 percent less but that aposs not going to happen so i mean i aposve lost that fight wallace all right panel we have to take a break here but when we come back we aposll preview this week aposs state visit can presidents trump and macron work out their differences next on this special edition of fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip emmanuel macron french president i think the u s today has a small ph role to play for peace in different regions of the world and especially middle east and i think as one of the last resorts clear ph for this peace and for for military inaudible end video clip wallace president macron saying the u s is still the indispensable player on the world stage and we aposre back now with our panel speaker gingrich i thought it was very interesting that macron would say that the u s is still the player of last resort especially in the context of their disagreement of how long to stay in syria and and the question i guess i have is how do you think they are going to resolve their very different views on the subject given the president aposs strong belief in america first gingrich well i thought and let me say first of all i thought it was a great interview i thought you did a great job and i think that in that context what he said was look there aposs diplomatic presence there aposs economic presence there aposs always sorts of ways the u s can remain involved and the president aposs been very clear i mean if he could figure out a way to get a saudi jordanian arab emirates egyptian force probably paid for by the saudis then he would he aposs trying to figure out a way to maximize impact while minimizing american risk but but i would just point out we are involved everywhere on the planet i mean people who talk about how we aposre going to withdraw somewhere show me where we aposre withdrawing wallace well let aposs talk about one area and because we see this split between macron and trump again over whether to stay in the iran nuclear deal michael and the president has president trump has a deadline of may 12th to decide whether to renew the sanctions which in effect would kill u s involvement in in the iran nuclear deal president macron makes it clear he is going to try to press his friend not to do that take a look begin video clip macron is this agreement perfect and this jcpoa a perfect thing for our relationship with iran no but for nuclear what do you have as a better option i don apost see it end video clip wallace michael how do you see this issue of whether to stay in the iran deal or not where president trump seems to be on one side and all the european allies on the other how do you see that being resolved anton well i just noted too there aposs another if you go into that interview a little further president macron leaves the door open to what president trump is asking for which is not changing the iran nuclear deal it aposs an follow on agreement between the europeans in the united states that iran would not be a party to that commits the united states the united kingdom france and germany to dealing with the ballistic missile program wallace right anton which president macron mentioned to you know eliminating a sunset clause essentially to shoring up the flaws in the jcpoa so that the united and if those flaws can be addressed as the president said inaudible wallace and and also iran aposs acting as a bad anton yes wallace as a bad actor on the regional issues anton the president wallace but is that something that you think that president trump would accept stay in the deal as long as there are these other elements anton what he said he would do in january he laid out conditions he tasked his team to go negotiate with the europeans to see if those conditions would be and he made very clear that when the next sanctions waiver was up if he didn apost get those conditions meant he would not do waiver and effectively take the united states out of the deal wallace no but what what impact does that have if you have a deal between the u s and our allies in europe but iran is not party to that deal anton it has a big impact because remember what the iran most want is sanction relief they aposre getting that sanctions relief under the terms of the jcpoa this would be a a pledge between the united states and are allies to multilaterally re impose sanctions if the iranians went on a track toward a nuclear weapon wallace then there is trade and president trump aposs threat to impose aluminum and steel sanctions on the european union president macron made it clear he aposs not having any of that begin video clip macron if you make war against everybody you make trade war against china trade war against europe war in syria war against iran come on it aposs not it doesn apost work you need ally we are the ally end video clip wallace congresswoman harman your thoughts about the differences despite their friendship on the issues between these two men on all these issues well first of all on iran russia and china are also parties to the jcpoa so we aposre talking inaudible basically with our friends which i support in congress would our congress would strongly support that inaudible but if we de certify the iran deal i think trump blows up his chance for progress in north korea and i do think there is a chance for progress in north korea on this macron is right i mean why make war on your friends we need europe with us especially as we try to tamp things down and exodus that aposs what he aposs trying to do from the middle east we need a strategy with our allies and what aposs missing i think in this world and obama

world wallace juan i was struck on the domestic side by how determined this president macron is to enact his reform agenda and because of the powers of his office which are he aposs got a strong presidency and he aposs also got this extraordinary majority that was swept in right after he was elected in the parliament he is determined to rejuvenate to shake up what has been a very troubled french economy williams right but you were also there to see that there are protests that there are people in the streets and so you have strikes by people who are involved with labor specifically in the public sector chris people who are upset that his reforms seem directed at labor in terms of giving big employers more leeway in terms of negotiations what they have to pay in case of layoffs cutting back on public sector employment in france he sees himself as taking the french economy into the 21st century and he aposs become a leader in europe in just this way you aposve been talk about foreign affairs he aposs a leader obviously in terms of what comes from the iran deal he aposs a leader in terms of the trade argument he aposs a leader even now in terms of the north korean deal so in all these ways but he aposs got to deal with the fact that people at home who gave them such support is you know fighting back the far right now angry at him wallace interesting job ph but i will say when i ask him any chance of backing down he went no chance williams yes i saw that that was good wallace thanks panel see you next sunday the first thing that president macron told me before our

deciding ph you can decide when you are inaudible the decision is inaudible the one you believe in you aren apost inaudible and you can make it which i think is great because i mean when you aposre a leader and when you want to transform our country when you when you love your country which is my case i think there is nothing more strong and and great than that wallace what is the worst part of being the president of france macron you aposre never free your time and your life doesn apost belong to you you are always alone when you decide but you are never free because there is such a level of constraint so that aposs probably one of them wallace of course what macron the main feeing ph wallace someone would say is nobody forced you to run for president macron that aposs why i never
