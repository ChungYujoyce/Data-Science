apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap last month the daughter of a jailed cambodian opposition party leader received an email from a well seeming activist at a reputed cambodian non profit for weeks the sender nudged monovithya kem to open an attachment described as containing interview questions kem suspected a trap set by cambodian hackers seeking access to her computer but a monthslong investigation by california security research firm fireeye revealed that kem was among several cambodians likely targeted by a far more formidable actor china fireeye said wednesday it found evidence that a chinese hacking team it believes is linked to beijing has penetrated computer systems belonging to cambodia s election commission opposition leaders and media in the months leading up to cambodia s july 29 election investigators could not immediately tell what if any data had been stolen or altered top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning the foreign ministry in china has rejected these allegations although fireeye did not find evidence that the chinese hackers are working to sway the cambodian elections in the ruling party s favor the revelations may cast a murky geopolitical shadow over the elections critics already say will be neither free nor fair prime minister hun sen one of the world s longest serving rulers and a staunch ally of beijing faced what analysts predicted would have been a tight race before he jailed opposition leader kem sokha last year accusing him of treason after the european union and the united states withdrew their support for the election china stepped in to donate 20 million to cambodia s national election committee said hang puthea a spokesman for the body china also last year pledged 100 million in military aid monovithya kem the daughter of kem sokha and an official in his now disbanded cambodia national rescue party said she has frequently been targeted by cambodian hackers in the past but the

based what you re dealing with is suddenly bigger fireeye s head of cyberspying analysis benjamin read said malware ridden files sent to cambodian targets were traced by his team to an unsecured server operated by the chinese hacking group team periscope on the hackers server fireeye researchers found records showing that the group had compromised cambodia s election commission and several cambodian ministries the servers access logs in one instance traced to an ip address in china s southern hainan island said read who described team periscope as the second most active chinese hacking group fireeye has traced fireeye says the group appears state linked because it seems to be seeking information that would benefit the chinese government they don t go for credit card numbers of bank account numbers they go for information that s of use to a government read said we saw them use the same infrastructure to target the cambodia government and private companies it suggests the chinese

and other institutions with projects in the contested south china sea china s foreign ministry said in a statement that it is not aware of team periscope and resolutely opposes cyberattacks as a
