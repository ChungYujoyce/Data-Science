tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap one by one the republican senators floated their ideas they were trying to find a way out of a seemingly impossible dilemma how to support president donald trump s u s mexico border wall without approving the national emergency declaration he invoked to build it and one by one during a private lunchtime meeting that ran hot at times they found no easy answers as a deadline for voting looms it s increasingly clear that republican senators are deeply uncomfortable with trump s use of executive power to build the wall and desperate to devise a way around the vote top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning senators know whatever they decide will make history it s the first time congress is voting to terminate a national emergency even if trump vetoes the measure as expected it will set precedent for other money grabs by future occupants of the white house this is why they tried to talk trump out of invoking national emergency powers and why they re now in a no win situation as they prepare to vote people are caught between the need for border security and agreeing with what the president s trying to do but not how he s trying to do it said sen chuck grassley of iowa the senior most republican senator in the days ahead senators will be required to vote on a resolution already approved by democrats in the house to terminate trump s executive action senate republicans don t have the votes to stop what trump is doing nor do they necessarily want to many of their constituents want the wall and senators especially those up for re election in 2020 don t want to run afoul of the president whose supporters they ll need but they re trying at least to provide some distance between trump s effort to build the wall and what many see as executive overreach that could echo for years to come trump in a speech saturday to conservatives said a lot of people talk about precedent precedent that if we do this the democrats will use national emergency powers for something we don t want they are going to do that anyway folks the best way to stop that is to make sure i win the election sen mike lee r utah presented colleagues during the lunchtime meeting with a proposal to revisit the 1976 national emergencies act clawing back some of the authority congress ceded decades ago that paved the way for trump s action sen lamar alexander r tenn has been working on a plan suggesting trump could do away with his declaration completely by simply repurposing existing money to build the wall rather than invoking the emergency orders to take more dollars other senators are swapping other ideas this has been a little bit of a wake up call said texas sen john cornyn a member of the gop leadership cornyn said most lawmakers were simply not aware that congress over the years has been so willing to delegate our authority to the president i wouldn t be surprised if some changes are made he said a guiding touchstone for some has been to draw on the principles of a conservative giant what would the late supreme court justice antonin scalia do republicans have railed against executive reach long before trump they criticized president barack obama s executive actions particularly those involving the deferred action for childhood arrivals program or daca that shielded young immigrants in the country illegally known as dreamers from deportation now though republicans are loath to allow trump to go even further by encroaching on the authority the constitution specifically grants congress for appropriating funds trump s declaration allows him to dip into billions of defense department dollars for already approved military construction projects and shift that money along with other funds toward the border wall senators worry what the next presidents will do invoking such power grabs for democratic priorities to fight climate change or lessen the strains of income inequality many folks don t like the idea of the precedent it sets but they realize it s the centerpiece of president trump s 2016 campaign what he ran on and it causes a little bit of heartburn said sen mike braun a newly elected conservative from indiana i kind of would fall in that camp he said braun said he probably will back the president he supports trump and believes there s a crisis on the border but he said the reach of executive authority does give you pause senators are quickly running into the procedural roadblocks that show how difficult it will be to change course because the resolution is a first of its kind efforts to alter it are posing all sorts of parliamentary questions that have yet to be answered even if the senators can agree with an alternative plan they ll also have to clear the procedural hurdles that so far have been high and for now it s unclear if they can come up with an idea that does both there re procedural problems that we haven t figured out yet cornyn acknowledged when vice president mike pence and administration officials visited senators privately on tuesday to buck up support for trump s action it provoked a lively discussion the white house officials made the case for the border emergency and insisted trump s action would not open the floodgates for future presidents to take similar steps for their priorities the senators peppered the vice president with questions and the next day at their own private lunch and in public they started airing their work arounds everybody s blaming the president grassley said the president doesn t deserve any blame congress delegated this authority to him so we re delegating away our legislative authority we ve probably done too much of it editor s note ap congressional correspondent lisa mascaro has covered
