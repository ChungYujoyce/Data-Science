the 2016 primary haunt the party supporters of sen bernard sanders who watched last time as the democratic national committee plotted to derail his insurgent bid see many of the same dark forces at work again the dnc already has changed the debate rules making it easier for billionaire michael bloomberg to be on the stage for the nevada showdown irking sanders backers who also bristled at reports that dnc members are talking about other rules change to hinder mr sanders should he be in the lead at this summer s convention see also joe biden dings bernie sanders next president won t have time for on the job training even house speaker nancy pelosi s curious timing in sending the articles of impeachment to the senate which has kept mr sanders off the campaign trail for most of the last two weeks strikes the vermont independent senator s supporters as suspect it does raise question marks and i don t believe you have to be a conspiracy theorist to believe it said dustin menke who came to hear mr sanders and new york rep alexandria ocasio cortez at a recent campaign rally in perry there are powers that are trying to sabotage his win again for the presidency and it is because he has had the same message for the last 40 or 50 years the 42 year old said that is why the establishment is afraid of him because he is not going to back down mr sanders surged in polling in january seemingly grabbing leads in iowa and new hampshire the first two states on the primary calendar away from former vice president joseph r biden to the sanders camp mr biden is this year s version of hillary clinton the candidate party leaders backed in 2016 emails released later showed the dnc actively worked against mr sanders mrs clinton has picked at that scab in recent weeks saying nobody likes mr sanders calling him a failed career politician and blaming her loss partly on his supporters refusing to back her after she won the democratic nomination in 2016 long gone is the truce the two sides had appeared to strike earlier rep rashida tlaib of michigan campaigning in iowa last week for mr sanders while he was stuck in washington for president trump s impeachment trial joined in a round of boos at the mention of mrs clinton that s all right the haters will shut up on monday when we win ms tlaib said 2016 to 2020 the clinton sanders battle in the last campaign was the precursor to the bloodletting that has played out in the years since as democrats try to decide whether they re the liberal party of mrs clinton or the more socialist party of mr sanders clinton style candidates helped the party win back control of the house in the 2018 midterm elections but a number of sanders wing democrats also managed to unseat incumbent democrats giving the left a bigger foothold among them were ms ocascio cortez ilhan omar of minnesota and ms tlaib freshman lawmakers who now vie with mrs pelosi for control of congress agenda the trio has campaigned for mr sanders as have reps pramila jayapal and mark pocan the co chairs of the congressional progressive caucus in iowa though the story of 2018 was clinton wing democrats who captured republican seats reps abby finkenhauer and cindy axne who ousted incumbent republicans are backing mr biden in monday s caucuses sanders surge mr sanders nearly won the iowa caucuses in 2016 and battled with mrs clinton all the way to the democratic national convention the real clear politics average of polls gives him a 3 percentage point lead though the most recent survey by cbs news yougov showed the race tied between mr sanders and mr biden at 25 each former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg is third at 21 in that poll and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren is in fourth at 16 mr sanders surge has his backers fearing the party s response i look for them to pull the same stunts they did last time said jim tuel an organic vegetable farmer from spirit lake those fears came to fruition late last week when the dnc overhauled the qualifying criteria for future debates removing the requirement that a candidate show grassroots fundraising prowess that could allow mr bloomberg who is using his own massive wealth to fund his campaign to make the stage should he do well enough in iowa or new hampshire or poll well enough in a series of upcoming surveys for mr sanders camp the party s catering to a billionaire sends the wrong message that s the definition of a rigged system said jeff weaver a senior sanders adviser liberal filmmaker michael moore fumed accusing the dnc of opening the door for mr bloomberg solely because he has a expletive dollars oh they are so upset mr moore bellowed at a recent campaign rally in the des moines suburbs they are like asking each other how the hell did this happen bernie wasn t supposed to win on the ground mr sanders troops are using the party s moves as motivation we are fighting the corporate interests and wall street those that want to buy the power and buy the tax breaks said ja mal green a national sanders surrogate we are fighting the democratic party who are doing everything to stop this movement sanders fatigue mrs clinton s return to the political scene is unsettling for the sanders camp and she has shown no reluctance to tear into the senator whom she blames for contributing to her stunning election day loss to mr trump all the way up until the end a lot of people highly identified with his campaign were urging people to vote third party urging people not to vote mrs clinton said friday in an interview on the your primary playlist podcast it had an impact some voters welcomed her critique saying mr sanders young activist supporters are loyal to him not the democratic party they worry he might play spoiler for the eventual nominee just as they believe he did last time absolutely that can happen again said caroline fontenoy who is backing mr biden he is not a uniter he is a divider the 71 year old said when you are 80 years old you don t change i m 70 years old i don t change i mean you just don t change and he is going to be pissed off there may be something to those fears drake university in des moines conducted its usual mock caucus last week and mr sanders did poorly not even getting enough support in the initial balloting to be viable by picking up 15 of the vote under caucus rules his supporters had to try to win over others join another candidate s backers or sit it out and go home some sanders folks went home according to reporters observing the goings on voters in iowa suggest it s a two way street and they aren t ready to back mr sanders should he emerge their nominee donna cantrell said she would leave the top of her ballot blank in that case i ll vote for everyone else on the ballot but i won t vote for him for president ms cantrell said trump will tear him apart being such a socialist he will tear him apart david sherfinsk
