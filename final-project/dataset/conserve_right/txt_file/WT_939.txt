apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the rigged system is suddenly working in sen bernard sanders favor the vermont democratic socialist and most of the other 2020 democratic presidential hopefuls cried foul when the democratic national committee changed the rules and allowed billionaire media mogul michael bloomberg onto the debate stage but the setup proved to be a boon for mr sanders mr bloomberg drew a barrage of fire away from the front running mr sanders at the las vegas debate wednesday night and the tycoon s botched performance further muddied the more moderate lane

most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time though he was branded the debate loser mr bloomberg on thursday said the real winner of the debate was president trump tacitly acknowledging that the free for all could ultimately boost mr sanders who is leading in multiple polls because i worry that we may very well be on the way to nominating somebody who cannot win in november mr bloomberg said at a campaign stop in utah and if we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base like sen sanders it will be a fatal error mr bloomberg head of the bloomberg news empire and former new york city mayor struggled in the debate to fend off a barrage of accusations that he championed racist police tactics in new york and that his company worked to silence women who charged sexual harassment after mr bloomberg missed the first eight debates he was a prime target wednesday absorbing attacks and eating up time that candidates could have spent going after front running mr sanders mr sanders and others should be applauding the dnc for opening up the debate stage to mr bloomberg said republican strategist charlie gerow they should now be thrilled mr gerow said he clearly showed he wasn t ready for prime time much less for aged reruns mr sanders has been leading in nevada polling ahead of saturday s caucuses and is also the front runner in california the biggest prize of the 14 states that vote in the super tuesday primaries march 3 still sanders supporters remain wary that the dnc will try to tip the scales against him after a 2016 democratic race that saw leaked emails where party officials mused about how to block him from toppling hillary clinton last month the party dropped a fundraising requirement for candidates to get on the debate stage in las vegas a move criticized for giving a boost to mr bloomberg who is refusing all donations and is using his 60 billion net

activist who did not qualify for wednesday s debate said thursday that the dnc reshuffled the rules for mr bloomberg the dnc literally told us we don t care about the voters of nevada and south carolina mr steyer said on cnn they changed the rules for mike bloomberg but dnc spokeswoman xochitl hinojosa said thursday that they didn t make the rules based on any particular candidate if you re polling over 10 at this point in the race then you need to answer questions from the american people she said on fox news and i think you saw that from every single person the dnc did provide a path for lower polling candidates to get on the stage saying contenders also could qualify by winning at least one pledged delegate to the democratic national convention from iowa or new hampshire that path had been in effect for the new hampshire debate on feb 7 based on the results of the iowa caucuses it helped sen amy klobuchar of minnesota get on the stage in las vegas ms klobuchar was allocated an estimated seven delegates to the party s national convention based on her performances in iowa and new hampshire while mr steyer hasn t won any delegates john verdejo a dnc member from north carolina disputed the use of the term rigged but acknowledged that the las vegas debate ended up being a good night for non bloomberg candidates if it was rigged bloomberg would have had a better night he said he compared the free for all in las vegas to a scene from the godfather where a young michael corleone is told that crime families have sporadic wars to get rid of the bad blood it had to happen because a whole lot of us and i imagine presidential candidates as well kind of looked at bloomberg like who are you to just come in here meanwhile we prepared for this for the last

more moderate candidates to get out of the race pete buttigieg s team on thursday said their candidate is the best alternative to mr sanders in a state of the race memo the buttigieg campaign said mr bloomberg had the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates if bloomberg remains in the race despite showing he can not offer a viable alternative to bernie sanders he will propel sanders to a seemingly insurmountable delegate lead siphoning votes away from pete the memo said mr buttigieg an openly gay former mayor of south bend indiana pressed mr sanders in the debate on releasing more of his medical records but he got more attention for his verbal jousting with ms klobuchar mr buttigieg harangued ms klobuchar for blanking on the name of mexican president andr s manuel l pez obrador in a recent interview while sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts stuck up for her colleague saying such a slip isn t uncommon i wish everyone was as perfect as you pete ms klobuchar said as the two were discussing immigration policy ms warren meanwhile went nuclear on mr bloomberg in the debate i d like to talk about who we re running against a billionaire who calls
