ecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the obama administration appointed president of the world bank says he feels in no way threatened by and instead fully supports china s creation of a massive infrastructure investment bank despite the administration s tireless behind the scenes attempts to smear the project jim yong kim a korean american who has headed the world bank since president obama tapped him for the post in 2012 said he and others at the international lending institution have been working quite closely with chinese officials on the 50 billion asia infrastructure investment bank he made the comments friday hours after beijing officially launched the bank which chinese officials tout as a fresh well of cash for badly needed loans that developing nations around the globe can spend on telecommunications transportation energy and other projects top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century the catch is that the obama administration privately stands in firm opposition to china s project on grounds that it is a calculated attempt by beijing to undermine american dominance over multilateral international lending since shortly after world war ii when the world bank was created with headquarters in washington it has always been run by a u s citizen several major news outlets including the financial times and the new york times have carried reports in recent days highlighting the administration s attempt to convince other world powers to stay away from the chinese bank for a host of reasons chief among them according to u s officials cited in the reports is the risk that beijing is about to start doling out development loans in a fashion that flatly abandons labor procurement environmental and human rights standards that the world bank has long fought to uphold as a reflection of american norms around the globe mr kim who spoke with reporters friday at a breakfast in washington hosted by the christian science monitor suggested that he simply does not spend much time worrying about such risks and that the white house s political push has carried little weight inside the hallways of the world bank asserting that the bank is not a political organization and that it is actually in our articles of agreement that we don t get involved in domestic politics mr kim said those who seek to know where washington stands on the chinese bank will have to ask the u s their position on it as for the world bank s position he said my sense is that we can work with the chinese very well the chinese government began talking with us very early on really sort of immediately after they had this idea that especially in asia there s nowhere near enough money for infrastructure investment mr kim said in july he told reporters that china s proposal for the bank is good because the developing world has a massive need for infrastructure investment he defended that position friday asserting that the nearly 1 5 trillion needed for infrastructure far surpasses the roughly 205 billion on offer by all of the world s multilateral development banks and private investors the asian infrastructure investment bank should be a very welcome addition to the current situation which is a woeful lack of financing for infrastructure mr kim said with the new chinese lending as a backdrop recent evidence suggests that world bank leaders may be seeking to reduce their institution s lending safeguards despite resistance from the wider international community representatives from more than 300 international rights and civil society groups reportedly walked out of an annual meeting of the world bank and international monetary fund this month to protest a bank proposal to lower its lending standards in a statement featured in a report by the huffington post the organizations said they strongly object to a draft version of world bank loan safeguards because it derogates from well established international standards and would effectively dismantle 30 years of policy evolution setting a dangerous precedent among national regional and global actors mr kim made no mention of such resistance in his comments friday he did however say he and others at the world bank have been working quite closely with the chinese toward the successful creation of beijing s project they want to utilize our technocrats we ve been doing everything from project preparation to implementation support to bringing multifold different groups together to finance budgets he said i think the critical thing for us would be to make sure that our interests are well woven in note an earlier version of this report incorrectly stated that mr kim said the world bank would reduce its lending safeguards the er
