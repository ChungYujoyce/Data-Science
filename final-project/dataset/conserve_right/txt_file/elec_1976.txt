the only problem is she doesn t know what she wants to do she has already established a super pac onward together which will support organizations fighting the trump agenda she s now an avowed member of the resistance so what can she do she s already making some democrats a bit wary since everyone in the democratic party while they still love and respect clinton know that new blood is needed and that her entrance into the midterm race could clog the spot second like with house minority leader nancy pelosi d ca republicans can easily turn her into a villain which means a more energized conservative base pumping cash into gop war chests the hill s amie parnes who along with jonathan allen wrote about the former first lady s failed 2016 election campaign said that the two time presidential loser might go with the party flow and set her sights on california and other congressional districts that split for her and the current gop representative during the 2016 election she also is looking at the house districts she won in last year s presidential contest against donald trump as part of an autopsy of her failed campaign according to two sources who have spoken to the former secretary of state it s at least possible she ll lend a hand on the campaign trail particularly in the 23 districts held by republicans where voters preferred her over donald trump for the white house she s very well aware of how she performed in those districts said one longtime clinton confidant who has spoken to the former democratic nominee democrats are focused on the golden state as they seek to win back the house majority ellen tauscher a clinton ally and former california congresswoman along with a longtime aide katie merrill have started a super pac focused on seven of the so called split districts in that state that voted for clinton but backed a republican candidate for the house chris lehane a democratic strategist added that clinton could have a real voice in these places absolutely she can go into those districts and make a case that there is an opportunity to do a course correction and do it in a fairly compelling way lehane said particularly if democrats strengthen their message and give voters a reason to vote for them even staunch clinton supporters say that while there is room for her to play a role she also needs to leave room for new leaders to emerge garry mauro a longtime friend of the clintons who led bill clinton s 1992 campaign effort in texas thinks the house can be won with the help of the longhorn state where there are three split districts but he doesn t want clinton to be front and center would she be well received of course she would be but we re not going to win these races because barack obama michelle obama hillary clinton or nancy pelosi comes to the state and campaigns mauro said we re going to win it because we represent new leadership and new ideas the problem is that the recruitment of democrats who want to carry on this new mantle could have serious issues post georgia where democrat jon ossoff failed to beat republican karen handel second the candidate farming system that democrats crafted for their 2006 takeover has crumbled to dust it doesn t exist third white working class voter outreach will make a democratic takeover much more easier but i doubt the insufferable urban professional progressive cohort that runs the democratic party would allow lectures on privilege police brutality safe spaces microaggressions and cultural appropriation be relegated to the backburner last despite president trump s shaky poll numbers it s quite possible that we could have a 2018 electorate that mirrors 2016 which benefitted republicans an increase in democratic turnout even at levels not seen in ten years isn t enough to win we saw that in ga 06 which are exactly the districts i e republican ones democrats need to flip to ensure a house takeover california is not where the democratic majority will be birthed to make things more brutal for democrats concerning their 2018 obstacles is that even if the democrats are able to get every single clinton voter who backed a house republican to turn out in 2018 and flip back over it wouldn t be enough to win the house that s from the left leaning third way think tank emphasis mine the numbers underscore how different even the 23 gop held clinton districts are demographically many are suburban and overwhelmingly white others are rural and heavily latino within the broad categories there are stark differences on income educational attainment and employment rates more than half of adults in new jersey s 7th district for example graduated from college only 17 percent in california s 10th district did the most important takeaway is that there is no one kind of voter or district that can deliver the house for democrats in 2018 said lanae erickson hatalsky the vice president for social policy and politics at third way there s been a lot of focus on suburban districts there s no doubt that those are important but there are not enough of them to win the house hatalsky who co authored the report with ryan pougiales emphasized that democrats still would not win the house even if they could get every single 2016 clinton voter who backed a republican house candidate to turn out again in 2018 and cross over you can t get to a house majority without winning over trump voters she said the study also noted that democrats have to defend 12 districts that trump carried as well once again we ve seen how reaching out to trump voters is necessary for democrats to win again after all these voters used to form the backbone of the party which has been replaced by hyper progressive zealots who are characterized by anti free speech antics shunning of white voters and dogmatic adherence to political correctness these people care more about whether transgender americans are able to use the bathroom than job creation there s a lot of time between electon day 2018 and now but let s just say the leaderless divided democratic party doesn t look like it has its act together to mount a campaign that clinches congress for them yet let s not kid around here we know that clinton will take the limelight she sout for revenge alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall
