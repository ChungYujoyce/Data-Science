rida race for house seat becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion it would be easy to feel overwhelmed by the volume of accusations lies hoaxes and general malevolence aimed at president trump and his supporters but don t justice awaits those doing such damage to our country in the name of assuaging their panic at our political reformation make no mistake part of the goal of the democrats ever since donald trump was elected by your votes to become president of the united states has been to exhaust and punish you the president has always been just a proxy for you the actual focus of the democrats rage and contempt it s not surprising the democrats now have resorted to what appears to be another hoax designed with the same template as their russia dossier debacle top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey in the case of the so called ukraine whistleblower scandal it appears they have fabricated a web of complaints and accusations attempting to turn the normal duties of the president into crimes so they can remove him from office in other words the soft coup continues the intelligence community inspector general michael atkinson noted the political bias of the still anonymous filer the complaint itself as we now know describes a situation that never occurred one can only explain this as the democrats presumed the president would never release the transcript of the actual call attorney general william p barr and secretary of state mike pompeo are also being painted as engaging in corrupt or criminal acts in service to the president none of that is true of course but it exposes the intentions to smear the entire administration no matter the impact on the country with this new hoax we re finding that the mentality willing to invent and unleash the russia dossier hoax wasn t a one off act of desperation it may be standard operating procedure that is what we must not lose sight of we are in the midst of as the president has noted in a video statement from the rose garden what s going on now is the single greatest scam in the history of american politics the democrats want to take away your guns they want to take away your health care they want to take away your vote they want to take away your freedom they want to take away your judges they want to take away everything we can never let this happen we re fighting to drain the swamp and that s exactly what i m doing and you see why we have to do it because our country is at stake like never before it s all very simple they re trying to stop me because i m fighting for you and i ll never let that happen again we are seeing a facade cracking revealing the possibility that many others were involved in the development of the fabricated complaint on aug 28 weeks before he would have officially seen the whistleblower report house intelligence committee chairman adam b schiff tweeted a mysterious comment using accusatory language against the president that was almost identical to the complaint nancy pelosi speaker of the house slipped up during a cbs interview fox news reported he told me it was perfect that there was nothing on the call pelosi said on cbs news 60 minutes referring to a conversation she had with president trump before the trump administration released either a transcript of his call with ukraine s leader or the whistleblower s complaint but i know what was in the call pelosi continued before quickly adding i mean uh it was in the public domain to this rep liz cheney asked on twitter in part madame speaker what did you know and when did you know it why such a frenzy now after so many conspirers were exposed through the russia dossier hoax because that exposure has just begun the attempts to defame mr barr are likely due to the fact that the doj s inspector general report on fisa warrant abuse is about to be released the democrats are behaving as though they know some very very bad things are going to be revealed mr trump will be gone eventually specifically from office in 2025 but they know his election was not just a fluke you are the problem people like you and me aren t going anywhere they are behaving as though you need to learn that you must accept that only they know best that elections are theater and you had better not dare to ever again act as though you believe in the u s constitution and the silly notion as determined by the founders that you are the sovereign already we see a sign that their craven strategy against the normals is failing in a remarkable announcement the gop and the trump reelection campaign announced they took in 125 million in the third quarter of 2019 a presidential fundraising record for perspective former president barack obama and the dnc raised just more than 70 million in the third quarter of 2011 these dramas are birthed by an establishment deciding it s too dangerous to have mr trump be in charge of all their secrets believing the ends of removing him justifies the means in other words they are going to have to burn down the village in order to save it we aren t going to let that happen tammy bruce president of independent women s voice author and fox news contributor is a radio talk
