apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic as china gears up for a communist style extravaganza with a military parade and ceremonial grandiosity next week to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the defeat of japan in world war ii beijing is determined and eager to show off its military might to the world it s also making a clear attempt to isolate japan from the international community and send a special message of china s military might to its most distinguished guest russia s equally bombast loving president vladimir putin the campaign is not going well japan has not been isolated as not a single head of state from western democracies except the czech republic accepted the invitation to be at the sept 3 parade and it remains to be seen if mr putin who is obsessed by military bravado will be shocked and awed by the hardware on display when he comes to beijing top stories trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century that s because china and russia have been entangled in a subtle but fierce and not always so brotherly competition when it comes to ceremonial pomposity military superiority and martial masculinity the parade comes less than three weeks after a humiliating rout of the chinese by the russians in the world s largest military games hosted by the russian ministry of defense in the alabino proving ground outside of moscow while most americans were intoxicated with donald trump s campaign and tom brady s deflategate tens of millions of chinese military enthusiasts and the pla high command were consumed by the moscow competition officially known as the international military games state owned china central tv tracked every one of the 14 events of the games closely pla soldiers and china s multitude of military buffs were glued to their tv sets to watch broadcasts of the games china s military commentators had a blast breaking down every possible angle of the competition in the end however the russians beat the chinese soundly in virtually every one of the 12 categories china participated in including tank biathlon aviadarts the caspian cup and the suvorov onslaught russian s military commentators expressed blunt criticism of china s performance and the criticism was promptly picked up by chinese press and the internet officially however china cried foul and accused the russians of cheating gen liu ying head of the chinese military team and numerous military commentators complained that the russian hosts kept changing the rules of the games to deliberately disadvantage the chinese team the russians said china s complaints were nonsense and were designed to cover up the chinese team s inadequacy and shortcomings in particular russia countered that the chinese fell short because they endeavored to be different from the other entrants of all the teams from the 17 participating nations including russia china angola armenia venezuela india kazakhstan kyrgyzstan kuwait mongolia nicaragua serbia and tajikistan china was the only nation that refused to use the weapons and equipment issued to every team russian analysts noted instead the chinese insisted on hauling in their own tanks armored vehicles guns and ammunition it was obviously a sign of chinese distrust for the russians as a result according to the russians there were always many adjustments of rules to make sure china s own weapons which were usually newer and heavier would be comparable to the russian provided standardized weapons that all other participants were using china countered by accusing the russians of ulterior motives in forcing everyone to use russian weapons especially russia s main battle tanks the t 72b3m and t 72b3 in order to promote sales on the world arms market yet china clearly wanted to sell its own tanks to the global market too which is why china brought its own type 96a tanks the tanks are more technically advanced and powered by a much larger engine this year s loss was all the more painful for the chinese because last year s humiliation at the similar event seems to have continued pointing to a pattern of poor performance by the type 96a tanks the chinese tank became a butt of jokes at the russian hosted 2014 tank biathlon after its caterpillar track fell off while passing the vip reviewing stand in the final rush to the finish line losing the competition not only to russia but also to armenia the infamy of that defeat deeply wounded the chinese national ego and military pride and the blame was put squarely on russian dirty tricks to sell a few more of its tanks for a few stinking rubles fumed one prominent chinese military commentator russia is playing hardball with us which shows some russian military leaders are truly small minded next week it will be china s turn to show the small minded russians some chinese big mindedness miles yu s column appears fridays he can be reached at
