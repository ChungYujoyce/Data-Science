cruncher harry enten that gary johnson s polls have been trending downwards indicating that voters may be moving away from third party options well today enten is back with an interesting piece headlined gary johnson isn t fading while noting what we have been warning you about here for years third party candidates typically see their crest of polling support halved by election day according to gallup enten explains that johnson s numbers have so far not followed this pattern in fact the libertarian may have already weathered the most difficult part of the calendar most third party candidates didn t lose that much support between late summer and election day enten writes besides john anderson in 1980 no candidate ended up finishing more than 3 percentage points below where they were polling in late august the average drop off is about 2 percentage points so how does johnson s 9 percent stack up at this point in the campaign against other third party candidates since world war ii according to numbers compiled by enten here fourth place behind ross perot in 1992 20 percent then finished at 19 george wallace in 68 17 14 and anderson in 80 14 7 he s just a tick above perot in 96 8 8 behind which nobody comes close sorry libertarians because of his staying power fivethirtyeight has adjusted its predictions for johnson s final vote upward to 7 1 percent but what about the debates i hear you ask well while teamgov and its supporters are touting this new qunnipiac poll showing 62 percent of americans think the libertarian should be in next month s televised showdown that and a glass of water will get you a drink as enten notes johnson may not be fading but he s also not particularly rising either and there s a whole lotta real estate between 9 and the required 15 percent the l p ticket did reach a new high this week in the quinnipiac poll 10 percent up from 8 percent in june and tied previous highs in polls by nbc news survey monkey 11 percent rasmussen reports 9 percent and reuters ipsos 7 percent but at this advanced date ties go to the loser looking for a glimmer of hope here s one intriguing gap in the numerical record of the commission on presidential debates determinative big five polls in which johnson has been averaging 10 percent instead of 9 none of them have produced results in the last three weeks beginning any minute now we should have a much clearer idea whether the libertarians are rising in the polls that actually matter next timely theater recommendation bloody bloody andrew jackson matt welch is an editor at

side will argue that the dirty dirty third party candidates stole the votes that were rightfully theirs i m not really sure how valid of an argument that is considering large portions of their votes are voting against the other guy gal but you know they re going to make it um that s kind of ironic considering that 99 of johnson s voters are simply against trump and hillary both and not for johnson what you think he has a viable and appealing platform and that s why he s suddenly out of the single digits yeah no the libertarian party is as big of a joke as it s ever been it s just slightly less of a joke in comparison to the major party candidates this particular time around that s assuming trump doesn t lose with a bigger spread than what johnson pulls given the mess of this election i m not so confident candidate x y or z is going to win the important thing is that we the voters win by cashing in our libertarian spoiler votes for tax cuts repeal and deregulation voters win when politicians and their soft machines lose every libertarian vote goes down in history and influences platforms jurisprudence and supreme court decisions forever given the mess of this election we shouldn t be so sure that the current candidates will still be in it by election day now that s an abstract euphemism that s the whole point the commies and prohibition party never installed their candidates in the executive mansion but their platform planks made it into the constitution and have completely wrecked the nation s economy on at least 6 different occasions that s clout anything else is just a wasted vote reinforcing the looter kleptocracy the other side to a looter kleptocracy is freedom i basically profit close to 10k 15k every month doing an online job for those of you who

working from home i was shocked when my neighbour told me she was averaging 120 but i see how it works now i feel so much freedom now that i m my own boss try it out on following website start here this website http goo gl dsy3he i ve said he d collapse on election day and i m going down with this ship i still think he ll be lucky if he gets over 5 barring a complete meltdown in trumpistan which is a fairly decent possibility he s not even trying to reach trump voters johnson is purely focusing on getting dem votes and votes from disaffected berniebros that s transparently false there s no point in trying to reach committed trump or clinton voters johnson has tried to craft a broad appeal strategy that includes winning votes from some disaffected democrats and left leaning independents mostly berniebros but also centrists and disaffected republicans and right leaning independents considering where third parties usually finish he s doing pretty well johnson not solely pandering in addition to libertarians to the hardcore conservatives who might not like trump doesn t mean he s just trying to get democrats the hardcore conservative demographic is hard to please for a libertarian at least and focusing on doing that risks alienating pretty much everyone else and johnson abandoning quite a few of his positions on top of that this group hates clinton so much that even if they came to the conclusion that johnson was a good option and better than trump they re unlikely to actually vote for him because that would be wasting their vote no johnson is positioning himself as a non corrupt slightly more moderate alternative to hillary he s in favor of gun control he s in favor of open borders he s pro aboriton he s pro tpp and he wants to cut the military that platform is not designed to reach disaffected conservatives yes he s nominally in favor of smaller government but that s an abstract concept to most people and functionally irrelevant considering his positions on major issues oh he wants to cut taxes yay he couldn t even come out in favor of serious cuts to welfare behold the great libertarian hope he s not in favor of gun control weld is but not johnson he s only open borders in a world where everything short of a wall is considered open borders smaller government isn t functionally irrelevant given his stance on military spending and since when has cutting taxes been blas among libertarians oh and johnson weld s website seems to be behind a chinese firewall but reason apparently isn t that s just funny i really do think there will be a substantial wikileaks drop incriminating hillary in something that the media simply can not ignore any longer i just want that to be now so gary can get in the debates you underestimate the power of willful denial that s it how many gary johnson articles are you guys going to write it s not like this is a libertarian site what s that oh slinks away i ve taken to clicking on every gary johnson article posted to other news sites all those people care about is clicks and site traffic so bah it don t matter do not trust to hope it has forsaken these lands i m sincerely interested in third party candidates getting traction so this advice is for all of them don t wait around for cpd to let you kick the football that s a sucker s game delegitimize the heck out of the cpd frame them as what they are an assortment of party hacks doing what non duopolists wouldn t be able to get away with awarding themselves nonprofit ta status while promoting duopoly candidates we know perfectly well what would happen if a prominent nonprofit opposed the duopoly or either wing thereof the duopolists would unleash the irs the answer i argue is to repeal the lyndon johnson amendment which politically censors nonprofits in the interest of the duopolists better yet repeal that and the nixon amendment to the irs code where it robs taxpayers at gunpoint to subsidize media ads for non libertarian parties that particular act of congress not to say sodomy occurred within 24 hours of the lp filing papers to organize as a political party that s plank 3 6 in the current lp platform where it adds a touch of class to the whole document brazil is adopting something similar instead of forcing voters to support 33 looter parties and watch their commercials brazilians will soon be robbed and frogmarched in to rubber stamp only the communist nationalsocialist and prohibition parties that s plank 3 6 in the current lp platform where it adds a touch of class to the whole document they should nominate someone on the libertarian platform i especially like this part at the end of paragraph 2 1 for voluntary dealings among private entities parties should be free to choose with whom they trade and set whatever trade terms are mutually agreeable hillary s winning debate strategy mrs clinton is not generally known as a stirring speaker but the moment showcased one of her strengths the ability to deflate opponents arguments with the force of her disdain we saw it in her face at the 11 hour benghazi hearings we saw it in her response to lincoln chafee s strange attempt in an early debate to link the iraq war with her email server asked if she d like to respond she said simply no yes please mistress hillary show us the true depth of your smarmy condescension and contempt for our intelligence on that debate stage give us the full force of your sneering dismissal and disdain give us the verbal cat o nine tails voters want that ooh yes please look at that cover picture smiling shaking hands not saying anything stoopid that s the gary i d settle for as candidate by elimination gary could pull a jackie kennedy and memorize the lp platform in spanish if that new translation ever gets finished opposed to carbon taxes the income tax heck puerto rico might even vote libertarian in fact american samoa guam the virgin islands and the northern marianas also manage without the irs federal income tax liberdad of the commission on presidential debates determinative big five polls in which johnson has been averaging 10 percent instead of 9 none of them have produced results in the last three weeks almost makes you wonder if he s getting close to or has reached that 15 in those polls and they are doing everything in their power to manipulate the numbers for the duopoly tin foil hat off 89 an hour seriously i don t know why more people haven t tried this i work two shifts 2 hours in the day and 2 in the evening and i get surly a chek of 1260 0 whats awesome is im working from home so i get more time with my kids here is what i did http youtubejobs nypost55 com the 15 number is nothing but the commission on presidential debate s firewall it is not designed to be breached and if perchance it were rest assured the cpd has more than one back up plan the key this year is to get the hofstra students to demand the cpd be removed from the debates and the debates controlled by an honest body of which there are many fine alternatives even the hofstra student newspaper could do a more honest job of it than the cpd judging by the intelligent response i received from one of their reporters this will permanently end the atrocious cpd monopoly forever if hofstra students don t do it there are still three more universities whose students may be interested in restoring democracy to the presidential elections and becoming folk heroes in the process fuck this twit the best he can hope for is to elect the utterly evil hitlary if you are not actuall serious bow the fuck out we are fighting for the republic people not the democratic mob rule ideal but the hey you might just be right ideal of the right the you know the you may actually know what is right for you party vs the we always know what is best so stfu party libertarians and real conservatives are not that far apart all the leftists modern day dems are exactly the opposite they think you know nothing only the gubment knows what you want need didn t he lose by even more than expected and yes we vote for his ass what choice did we have my best friend s mom makes 74 an hour on
