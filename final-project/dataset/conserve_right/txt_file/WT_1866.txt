michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion alexa how can i attack trump without making it look like i m attacking trump if jeff bezos owner of amazon and the washington post asked his smart device for that advice we now know the response from his artificial intelligence appliance by running an ad during the super bowl that invokes another republican impeachment scandal one that liberals keep comparing the trump saga to amazon aired during the super bowl an ad touting how alexa would have worked throughout history most of the spot contains humorous examples from long long ago involving indistinct people and events a victorian home a wagon train headed west a homing pigeon carrying a love note all except the last one which is much more recent involves clearly identifiable people and is not even an appropriate alexa command it has president richard nixon in the oval office instructing his secretary rose mary woods remind me to delete those tapes to which she responds yes mr president she then quizzically looks into the camera realizing this is a totally improper idea top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century this part is not only completely out of place it is historically incorrect it has never been shown and i don t recall it ever being seriously alleged that president nixon personally deleted any portion of his infamous white house tapes in fact there has never been any substantive deletion allegation whatsoever there was the famous 18 minute gap on the june 20 1972 tape but it could never be characterized as a deliberate deletion as it was clearly delineated by a noticeable buzz further rose woods herself readily admitted to inadvertently erasing the first several minutes and the cause of the remainder has never been ascertained while the subject of an extensive grand jury probe no indictments were ever forthcoming the amazon depiction is a fake history to totally misrepresent that event involving real people and taken from recent memory and to include it at the end of six non descript century old scenarios did not happen by chance the amazon ad looks like a stealthy anti trump statement paid for by a corporation that is worth nearly 1 000 000 000 000 trillion we learned last year that mr bezos takes great personal interest in super bowl ad production and given that he personally tweeted this year s offering it s probably safe to assume he had great influence over this apparent subliminal shading of president trump the spot would have been every bit as entertaining if this portion had been omitted but mr bezos realizes that by making it political it s more likely to generate buzz in the desired direction if mr bezos thought impeachment revisionism was funny he could have gone with a bill clinton caricature asking alexa for the meaning of what is is if mr bezos thinks political scandals are fair game he could have had president obama asking the amazon device to remind him of his promise to the country if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor when pitching obamacare but no mr bezos landed on watergate probably because the liberal media including his newspaper keep referencing it in hopes that saying the word often enough will lead to their same desired result the end of a republican presidency to be fair no political scenario would have been as entertaining than bezos himself asking the device something along the lines of alexa why has amazon been accused of limited oversight over items listed by millions of third party sellers many of them anonymous many in china that type of self deprecating humor would generate gobs of attention but wouldn t have advanced the anti trump agenda so what we re left with is mr bezos throwing a fake nixon history scene dressed up as comedy as a proxy punch at trump during the biggest television event of the year it s subtle but it s telling of who mr bezos really is whereas mr trump has the guts to call out amazon founder by name this billionaire seems content letting his newspaper and tv ad surreptitiously settle scores geoff shepard served as deputy counsel to president nixon during the unfolding of the watergate scandal he is the author of the real watergate scandal collusion conspiracy and the plot that brought nixon down reg
