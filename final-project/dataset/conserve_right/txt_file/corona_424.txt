early data suggest it s another disease with a profile dependent on inequalities are you under 65 and have no underlying predisposing conditions for covid 19 complications then don t worry about the novel coronavirus even if you live in a hotbed of infection stanford university epidemiologist john ioannidis above who blew the whistle on the bad data being used to justify coronavirus crackdowns on daily life has new research with his colleagues at stanford medical school their specialties also include meta research and women s and children s health the preprint study in medrxiv which has not been peer reviewed sought to evaluate the risk of covid 19 to people under 65 years of age relative to older people estimate the absolute risk of death from infection at the population level and discern what proportion of deaths occur in non elderly people without underlying diseases in epicenters of the pandemic the authors scold the media for seizing on stories of young healthy individuals with severe fatal outcomes from infection however the majority of patients dying with sars cov 2 are elderly and the large majority of the deceased may have severe underlying diseases exaggeration should be avoided in responding to the pandemic more we need herd immunity in a controlled and strategic manner population level covid 19 mortality risk for non elderly individuals overall and for non elderly individuals without underlying diseases in pandemic epicenters https t co ompwoapurp dr david l katz drdavidkatz april 8 2020 the american data they reviewed came from louisiana michigan washington state and new york city based on those locations clearing their threshold of at least 250 deaths as of april 4 stratified by age they also considered countries that met that threshold belgium germany italy netherlands portugal spain sweden and switzerland they found wildly varying risks depending on where people live new york city had 79 deaths per million of under 65 people at the high end while germany s rate was 1 7 deaths per million of that demographic people 80 and older were most at risk in spain 1 in 420 died and least at risk again in germany 1 in 6 000 but when factoring in underlying predisposing conditions the numbers change dramatically those under 65 without such conditions account for 0 3 percent of deaths in the netherlands 0 7 percent in italy and 1 8 percent in new york city the researchers conclude those under 65 have very small risks of covid 19 death even in the hotbeds of the pandemic and deaths for those without underlying conditions are remarkably uncommon the researchers recommend moving away from one size fits all lockdown policies and focusing on protecting high risk elderly individuals echoing increasing concerns about covid 19 s deadliness for marginalized populations the paper notes the higher under 65 death rates in new york city louisiana and michigan compared to washington state and the eight european countries this may reflect unfavorable socioeconomic circumstances for those three locations p reliminary data show that deaths cluster in areas with high levels of poverty and underprivileged populations if this early observation gets validated this may signify that covid 19 is yet another disease with a profile dependent on inequalities of interest influenza deaths seem to have a similar difference in age distribution between the usa and european countries of course a major difference between influenza and covid 19 is that the latter does not cause deaths in children in contrast to influenza read the abstract and full paper more no additional decline in coronavirus infection rate from lockdowns image stanford department of medicine twitter like the college fix on facebook follow us on twitter sign up for the college fix s newsletter we won t bombard your inbox or share your info we just send compelling campus news twice a week
