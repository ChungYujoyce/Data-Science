our economy and to leave for their children a brighter future mr romney said in excerpts released ahead of his speech to the u s hispanic chamber of commerce today those sacrifices are being squandered by a president who cannot stop spending mr romney said his test on federal spending would be whether a program is so critical that it is worth borrowing money from china to pay for it mr romney has accused mr obama of being weak on china and ceding american jobs to the rising asian power the president countered with claims that mr romney has investments in chinese companies and outsourced jobs to china while running the private equity firm bain capital on monday mr obama was turning to the power of incumbency to try to gain the upper hand on the debate officials said the administration will launch enforcement action at the world trade organization because it says china is illegally subsidizing exports in their autos and auto parts sectors the u s says the practice puts american parts manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage and encourages the outsourcing of production to china the administration is taking the issue to the wto because its attempts to get china to address the subsidies on its own have been unsuccessful the officials said jobs in the u s auto parts sector dropped by roughly half between 2001 and 2010 while u s imports of auto parts from china have increased seven fold according to the obama administration the administration also is escalating another case it brought against china at the wto in july that accuses china of imposing unfair duties on more than 3 billion in exports of u s autos the duties cover more than 80 percent of american auto exports to china said the officials who requested anonymity in order to discuss the trade action ahead of the president the cases stem from the interagency trade enforcement center which mr obama set up earlier this year to target unfair practices around the world particularly in

trade practices by china and in his weekly podcast saturday mr romney said in 2008 candidate obama promised to take china to the mat but since then he s let china run all over us mr obama countered with a tv spot focused on its claims that mr romney outsourced jobs to china while working in the private sector his campaign also released a new web video saturday in which obama deputy campaign manager stephanie cutter said mr romney holds investments in chinese companies the maneuvering came as a new national survey by the new york times and cbs news found that mr romney has lost his long standing edge on the question of who voters view as most likely to restore the economy and create jobs despite that the poll found the race narrowly divided mr romney s shift to china also indicated a need to shore up support among the working class voters he needs to turn out in big numbers come november mr obama s quick counter underscored the importance of holding onto his recent gains in
