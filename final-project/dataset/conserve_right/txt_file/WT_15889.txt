hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey a western diplomat in new york who spoke to the washington times on background said the veto by russia and china was disappointing because their concerns had been taken into consideration as the text of the resolution was amended susan rice the u s ambassador to the u n expressed outrage at the council s failure to pass the resolution this is a sad day most especially for the people of syria but also for the u n security council she wrote in a twitter post russian u n ambassador vitaly churkin said his country did not support mr assad s regime or the violence but opposed the resolution because it was based on a philosophy of confrontation contained an ultimatum of sanctions and was against a peaceful settlement of a crisis the associated press reported china s ambassador li baodong said his country opposed the resolution because sanctions or threat of sanctions do not help the situation in syria but rather complicates the situation meanwhile an iranian media report claimed that mr assad had threatened to set fire to the middle east in the event of western military invention but a senior turkish official disputed the account syria s 6 month old uprising has turned increasingly bloody with regime forces targeting locales where newly formed groups of army defectors have taken refuge a western diplomat who spoke on background to reporters in washington said anti regime protests in syria had not yet reached a tipping point but suggested that international pressure could change things an earlier draft had recommended targeted measures against the syrian regime russia wanted language explicitly blocking foreign powers from getting involved in syria s internal affairs the final text of the resolution provided to the times before the vote did not include some of the language to which russia had objected the text reaffirmed strong commitment to the sovereignty independence territorial integrity and national unity of syria expressed concern about the situation in syria and the potential for further escalation of violence condemned the syrian authorities for systematic human rights violations and the use of force against civilians and called on the regime to stop the resolution said the only solution to the crisis is through an inclusive and syrian led political process that addresses the legitimate aspirations of the people russia and china have been reluctant to support a tougher line against the assad regime citing concerns about syria s sovereignty the blame is on russia and china not on us said the western diplomat defending the absence of stronger language in the european draft secretary of state hillary rodham clinton and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov had worked closely on the issue of russian support for the u n resolution the russians have to make their own decisions state department spokeswoman victoria nuland said before the vote they have to think hard about whether the security council is going to be effective here in sending a strong message to a bloody bloody regime china shares russia s concerns about syrian sovereignty the international community should respect syria s sovereignty independence and territorial integrity take a cautious approach in dealing with the syrian issue so as to prevent the situation from becoming further turbulent and regional peace and stability being endangered said wang baodong a spokesman for the chinese embassy in washington hamdi rifai director of arab americans for democracy in syria said syrian activists had traveled to russia in july to seek the government s support for a strong u n resolution that seems to have been a wasted effort he said the fact that a few nations can hold back the whole world doesn t bode well for the u n and it especially doesn t bode well for the syrian people he added in march russia and china abstained from voting on a u n resolution that imposed a no fly zone over libya and tightened sanctions on moammar gadhafi s regime western officials said there is no prospect of the security council approving similar action in syria morally there is a great similarity between the situation in libya and that in syria but there is no practical prospect of getting a mandate for military action the western diplomat said a second u s diplomat noted that unlike libya syria has no rebel held cities and few high ranking army defections the opposition is not going be able to overthrow the government by force he said this is not a repeat of libya on tuesday iran s semiofficial fars news agency claimed that mr assad during a meeting with turkey s foreign minister ahmet davutoglu had threatened a regional war in the event of western military intervention mr assad said syria and hezbollah in lebanon would launch hundreds of rockets into israel and iran would attack u s warships in the persian gulf according to the report but a senior turkish official told the times that the iranian news report was completely untrue ben birnbau
