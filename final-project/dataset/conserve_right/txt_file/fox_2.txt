elena delle donne star basketball player i wanted to be here and i was willing to do whatever it took to get here wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington republicans have finally started making progress on their pledge to overhaul the nation aposs health care system president trump held a celebration in the rose garden after the house passed repeal and replace but there was no celebrating at town halls were gop members who supported the bill like raul labrador the house freedom caucus faced angry constituents begin video clip unidentified female you are mandating people in medicaid accept dying you are making a mandate that kill people rep raul labrador r idaho no one wants to die you know that line is so indefensible nobody dies because they don t have access to health care end video clip wallace health care reform still faces a long tough road in the senate and it could be months if ever before it becomes law this hour we ll look at how the proposed changes in the house bill would affect you with gop strategist karl rove and obamacare architect jonathan gruber but first here in washington the white house chief of staff reince priebus reince welcome back to fox news sunday reince priebus white house chief of staff good morning wallace the senate as we were saying is taking up repeal and replace now they aposre talking about a major rewrite that could take months take a look begin video clip sen bill cassidy r la health committee i mean that aposs the way it works right and so they will pass theirs we will pass hours and then we ll go to conference i don apost think that the house bill necessarily predicts what is in the senate bill end video clip wallace but congressman dave brat a member of the house freedom caucus warns they better not change it the house bill one iota if they change it you aposre not going to have 218 the majority you need of votes in the house reince given that fact that it barely passed the house what does the president think of the senate making major changes and according to them maybe taking months to do it priebus well first of all he thinks that and i think and a lot of people think this is a binary choice it s a binary choice between what we know is a collapsing system offering no options no coverage and getting to a place that is calamitous for americans across the country or a system in place that offers coverage offers lower premiums offers options and we started the process i think faster than anyone expected in the house that aposs what the president understands and that aposs what he believes now we also believe that it aposs up to the senate if there are improvements to be made to make those improvements and i talked to six out of the 12 members of that senate committee yesterday and i wallace the working group priebus the working group including leader mcconnell and others and everyone is excited and ready to go to work and take the time necessary to look at the bill make improvements where they need to be made and then the bill will be brought back for conference most likely wallace but i m asking you for a practical political question just barely passed the house with just one extra vote it was a very delicate coalition if they make major changes in the senate and they take months to do it doesn apost that risk nothing ever getting through congress priebus no i don apost think so i think that everyone is committed to getting this thing done and getting it done as soon as possible i don apost think anyone is going to be beating down the door of this group of 12 i think we want to let them do their work let them work this out they are all very mature they all know what aposs going on they all the commitments that we aposve made to the american people to repeal and replace a failing a failing program and obamacare so i m excited about where we are at the president achieved something that no one thought he would i think we were right to give the congress an attaboy in the rose garden but we also know that this is just the beginning it aposs the first step wallace let aposs talk about the commitment that you aposve made during the campaign here aposs the promise that the president made to voters about obamacare here it is begin video clip trump i am going to take care of everybody i don apost care if cost me votes or not everybody is going to be taken care of much better than they are taken care of now end video clip wallace but here are some of the features of the house bill under obamacare older people let aposs say 55 to 64 could be charged three times as much as younger people in a house built it aposs five times as much or even more under obamacare people with pre existing conditions could not be charged more in the house plan if states opt out folks with pre existing conditions can be charged more given all of that can you really stand by the president s pledge that everybody will be taken care of priebus absolutely chris and if you break this down and i will be very quick in this bill on pre existing conditions 176 million people across this country get employer based insurance this doesn apost affect pre existing conditions for those people number two it doesn t affect pre existing conditions for medicare recipients it doesn apost affect pre existing conditions for medicaid recipients and now you aposre down to about 9 5 million people and it doesn apost affect anyone with continuous coverage even if a governor which i m not sure that s ever going to happen takes the waiver option it wouldn apost affect anyone with continuous coverage now let aposs just assume that there are some people that might not have continuous coverage they may not be in medicare they might not be on medicaid they might not have employer insurance wallace there are millions of people who fall into that priebus and the government takes a waiver we would put billions not millions billions upon billions of dollars wallace eight billions over five years priebus into high risk pools to buy down any premium that they would have that they would have two pay for and that aposs just in the house bill what this tells you is when president trump brought billy long fred upton wallace two members of congress preibus greg walden and dr burgess into his office last week he said let aposs work it out let aposs make sure this pre existing condition is taken care of president trump made it happen which should show every american how committed he is to making sure that if you have a pre existing condition this president is not going to let you down wallace ok you aposre talking about that narrowly there are arguments against it we re going to talk about that in the next segment but here s the broader point the cbo released an analysis of the last bill and let aposs put the stats up on that by next year the cbo said 14 million people covered under obamacare will lose their insurance by 2026 24 million people will that aposs not taking care of everybody as the president promised priebus well first of all we don apost buy that cbo score i mean everybody instantly isn t going to come off of isn t going to come off of insurance as that cbo score would indicate we re also going to have more options for people they re going to have different levels of options for people the pre existing condition is going to be crosstalk wallace rolling back medicaid older people are going to end up paying five times as much or even more priebus and by the way that aposs the old bill that aposs before wallace that s part of the bill stays ph priebus that aposs before the amendments were put in and it aposs also before the senate takes the bill and makes it even better chris the point of all of this instead of getting in the weeds is that go back to the beginning if we go back to the beginning we have two options continued down on the road we were on with a failing collapsing system that every that most people don apost think is going to work if you pull it or start the process with a better system with more choices more options lower premiums keep your doctor all the things that president trump promise we started that process we guided through the house and now it aposs off to the senate we will get this done we will repeal and replace obamacare and give americans a better product that aposs what the president promised wallace let s talk about another aspect of this democrats say that the house bill will be a big drag on republicans politically in the 2018 midterms here aposs house democratic leader nancy pelosi begin video clip rep nancy pelosi r calif house minority leader you have every provision of this bill tattooed on your forehead you will glow in the dark on this one end video clip wallace as we pointed out house republicans are right now facing angry voters at town halls this weekend on friday the cook political report which you know well the kind of unofficial bible assessing house races shifted its assessment of 20 seats now held by republicans in the direction of democrats i m not saying they re going to win them but that they are more likely for democrats to win you could lose your house majority over this priebus yes these are the same people that said that donald trump wasn apost going to run and he ran he wasn apost going to win the primary and he won the primary donald trump couldn apost win the general he won the general he couldn t get health care repeal and replace through the house he got it through the house look the fact of the matter is there are sometimes in life you have to do what aposs right not what aposs politically expedient we believe this is going to be a better product and by the time the people see that premiums are lower it s a better service there are more options and more choices they re going to reward the republicans that stood up and said we are not going to see the obamacare system which is failing and collapsing continue any longer we re going to do something better and we re going to do our job as legislators to get this thing done i think that the republican party will be rewarded wallace ok let aposs turn to another subject congress passed a budget this week to keep the government funded until october president trump said it was a quote big win democrats as you know say that they rolled him and the white house well let me put it out there aposs no money for construction of the border wall the president wanted the bill continues funding for planned parenthood and sanctuary cities and while you did get more money for defense you didn apost get the big domestic spending cuts you were calling didn apost they get more out of it than you guys did priebus i don apost think the democrats got almost anything out of this thing i mean they lost first of all let aposs back up they lost their parity role which means for every dollar increase in military you have to have an increase in domestic they lost it that aposs one of the biggest colossal failures in the democratic party that no one is talking about number one they lost on military spending we ve got one of the biggest increases in military spending in the history of these increases number two for the first time in six years our military is going to get a raise we got 1 5 billion that we can do work on on the border including a 20 foot border walls that are going to go up or fences existing today we re going to be able to buy back the property that we need to continue the wall moving forward crosstalk priebus walls which you aposve seen pictures of wallace the president talked about a shutdown a possible shutdown in october are you going to go at this crosstalk wallace are you going to at this tougher in october priebus i m not even done yet they didn apost get the csr payment wallace ok priebus they didn t get any extra crosstalk wallace you talk about being in the weeds we re in the weeds priebus right but what i m trying to tell you and the american people is that look president trump aposs agenda move forward in this budget and he move forward in this budget big league as he would say now as far as the fight coming down the pike in september we re going to be ready for that fight and we re going to make sure that president trump aposs priorities continue wallace ok speaking of the budget and the president aposs priorities the president talks about fighting the opioid drug epidemic but in a new budget proposal he s promising to gut or proposing to gut the white house office of the drug czar and i want to put this up on the screen funds for the drug czar s office would be cut 95 percent eliminating its two major programs and the acting drug czar rich baum emailed the staff of this white house office these drastic proposed cuts are frankly heartbreaking why on earth when you say that there s an epidemic and you re fight it would you cut the drug czar s office 95 percent priebus first of all that aposs a leaked document and it s and i would tell you that nothing is final in this debate and discussion in regard to this particular issue in this particular office wallace the drug czar takes this pretty seriously priebus great good for the drug czar and had i mean he should take it seriously that aposs his job secondly we have duplicative services in this regard all over the place you ve got in the department of justice you ve got it in the hhs and so that s the first level but secondly i don apost think any president showed more commitment in the first 100 days in regard to tackling opiates putting a commission together obviously putting governor christie in charge wallace i understand which is why people are so surprised about the drug czar s office being cut priebus so what i would say is again back to the beginning it s a leaked document nothing is finalized there s work being done at hhs and doj i would always tell people judge president trump by his actions not leaked documents and hypotheticals and the actual actions of this president is a total commitment to this epidemic across this country wallace finally and we ve got about a minute left the new york times had a front page story yesterday that talks about you and how much you had riding on passing obamacare repeal and replace through the house i want to put up i m sure you re going to love these quotes they report you viewed it as a personal make or break moment another big loss on health care would probably have been an unrecoverable blow to an already weakened mr priebus laughter wallace so other than that is this leak ph true priebus no but i remember the last time i was on your show there was another quote from the new york times and i think it was something on the lines of the person that people are pointing to most for the failure of obamacare was reince priebus and i kind of joke i think at the time so when it passes am i going to be the one person in america that gets all the credit for the passage of course not and the president knows that it aposs ridiculous one person in the west wing among thousands of participants it doesn apost make or break it the point of them the point of it is it was a team effort but it was led by our quarterback president trump and i can say with assurance to everyone without president trump and i think the speaker would say this and everyone in between this would have never happened and got out of the house he did it he brought people together and it was a leadership that we haven apost had for eight years previously to get these kinds of things done wallace the white house the new york times accused you of being a nice guy which only in washington would be considered a character flaw how do you plead mr priebus priebus i think i m a nice guy but i didn apost get here by accident wallace good answer reince thank you always good to talk with you thanks for your time this weekend priebus thank you chris wallace up next a user aposs guide for repeal and replace we ll ask two experts what it would really mean for you and your family commercial break wallace there aposs been a lot of talk this week about the politics of health care the president aposs victory in getting the bill through the house whether it will help democrats in the 2018 midterms but the real question is how the house republican plan would affect you and your family would it mean better more affordable health care coverage or worse joining me now to debate that from austin texas gop strategist karl rove and from boston mit professor jonathan gruber one of the architects of obamacare well one of the big criticisms of the house plan is how it would treat older americans who don apost yet qualify for medicare and also how it would treat people with pre existing conditions professor gruber what s the problem there jonathan gruber mit economics professor well the problem is that for older americans their health insurance is very expensive and under obamacare that is dealt with limiting how much more they could be charged to younger people and by having tax credits that limit the percent of income they have to pay for health insurance as well as expanding medicaid to lower income adults that all goes away under the house alternative the medicaid expansion goes away so for the poor and elderly they don apost have access to health insurance a tax credits become flat tax credits not income based so the elderly have to pay much more for their health care insurance and so basically you have a system which is not as protective of those people as existing law is wallace karl let aposs talk about both aspects of this democrats are now saying the fact that there isn apost as much protection of people just shy of medicare they are calling at the age tax and the compromise that the house passed does this about pre existing conditions it provides states to set up high risk pools with another 8 billion extra over five years to help people with pre existing conditions that aposs on top of 130 billion in the program to help states with other costs but democrats say and you just heard a suggestion from professor gruber karl that that is still not enough karl rove former bush white house adviser well let s first of all take the band the 3 to 1 ban that causes younger people on that act to subsidize people older people it aposs been expanded to 5 to 1 now why is that done that is because older people have health care cost that on actuarial basis are roughly 4 8 times those of younger people so what we got now is a system that if you want to call it a tax right now we are taxing virtually everybody under the age of 50 by causing them to pay more for their premiums to subsidize the coverage of people over the age of say 54 55 to reduce their premiums despite the fact that older group on average has higher incomes higher wealth and less child rearing expenses than the people below that we are overtaxing before we had the affordable care act 42 states have set the bandwidth at 5 to 1 three of them had it in lower level 3 to 1 or 1 5 to 1 wallace ok rove and the rest of them had no standards and the reason was wallace i don t want you to get i got it we got it and now talk about pre existing conditions because that as you know is really the hot button right now rove well look the bottom line is there aposs a lot of trash being tossed about out there there aposs no change in pre existing conditions for the people who are in the affordable care act and are in states that don apost have a waiver if a state asks for a waiver it can say if you haven apost had continuous coverage you haven apost had any insurance coverage or you let it lapse for more than 63 days and you have a pre existing condition you had you get an insurance policy but you can be charged up to 30 percent more than other people your age for one year as an incentive for you to stay under continuous coverage and you are right there aposs 8 billion there to pay for people who have extremely expensive illnesses wallace karl rove yes wallace this is a debate so let me bring professor gruber in why isn apost that enough that protection for people with pre existing conditions gruber look the most important accomplishment of the affordable care act was ending the ability of insurers to say you can t get insurance and you re charged multiple times because you have bad genes that s horrible feature of our systems americans don apost like it why would you possibly want to reintroduce this that aposs what the law does it opens the option for states to reintroduce the ability to literally say just because the genes you were born with you re going to pay more for health insurance many many multiples more now the law does include funds for the so called high risk pool i call it a high risk puddle by all the estimates that are out there these are trivial funds relative to what would be needed to actually pay for this wallace gentlemen let me move on let me move rove no no this is wallace go ahead but quickly karl rove all right first of all it does not change pre existing conditions for the vast majority of people but if your state waves out the only thing that they can do is charge up to 30 percent more if you have elected not to have insurance coverage and as to the amount the last year that states had high risk pools 35 of them in 2011 they spent 1 6 billion out of state money on those high risk pools wallace ok rove excuse me 1 4 billion this provides 1 6 billion crosstalk wallace all right wait gentlemen i ve done this in a presidential debate so i m going to do it with you guys i want to move onto another subject and that is medicaid because more than half of the 20 million people who gained coverage under the obamacare gained through the expansion of medicaid which allows more people higher up over the poverty line to be covered but the house bill cuts medicaid by 880 billion over the next ten years by ending that expansion and turning the program from an open ended entitlement into a fixed block grant to states karl why is that good rove because it focuses medicaid on who was supposed to be focused on which are the vulnerable the disabled and the young and it says to states you can put in work requirements so that the people who are able bodied and capable of going out and getting a job and getting coverage on their own can do so by removing the disincentive to simply stay on the role and yet it cuts the medicaid over the long haul but it increases the amount of money that is spent on the blind and disabled children and those with ailments and those that have children and are single parents so by all means we ought to focus this program more and more on the vulnerable in our society and not simply people based on their income wallace ok let me rove with a disincentive to work wallace let me bring professor gruber in i d like you to respond to that and also to the larger issue of entitlement reform we aposve been talking about that for years and years is this entitlement reform gruber look mr rove is absolutely wrong in his comments on that medicaid let s remember what medicaid does two thirds of the money is spent on our nation aposs elderly and disabled you can apost cut that program by 25 percent without massively hurting the elderly and disabled in this nation it s just simply mathematically impossible so you were talking about a program which takes care of her most vulnerable citizens and cutting it by 25 percent and why once again let aposs talk about what does this do this law does nothing to fix our u s health care system all it is just massively cut funds to have a large tax break so if we want to talk entitlement reform that aposs a totally legitimate discussion to have but let aposs have the discussion in the context of reforming entitlements in a way which doesn apost harm our nation citizens not cutting our program to the vulnerable by 25 percent wallace ok i want to get into one less subject with the two of you because this effort isn apost happening in a vacuum the effort is to replace obamacare as reince said this is a choice between obamacare and something different and i think everybody agrees obamacare has serious problems here aposs president trump on obamacare this week after passage of the house bill begin video clip trump i predicted it a long time ago i said it aposs failing and now it aposs obvious that it aposs failing it aposs dead it aposs essentially dead if we don apost pay lots of ransom money over to the insurance companies it would die immediately end video clip wallace and here are some stats premiums under obamacare went up an average of 24 percent across the country this year the average number of insurers in each marketplace has dropped from 5 9 in 2015 to 3 9 now professor gruber in iowa there is now only one insurance company left in all but five counties in iowa and they just announced medica that they are thinking of dropping out which means there would be no insurance companies for the marketplace in all but five counties in iowa gruber look and whose fault is this before president trump was elected there were no counties in america that did not have an insurer since president trump has been elected and massive wallace wait wait you re going to blame the problems with obamacare on president trump gruber we had a situation under obamacare where there s one time premium increase last year that made up for the fact that insurers massively underpriced in the first two years the problems with fixed insurers positive profits were trending positively insurers were saying positive things about their ability to stay in the exchange succeed and then you have a president who comes in undercuts open enrollment doesn apost honor the obligation this law makes to insurers wallace all right gruber and as a result premiums are going up and insurers are exiting you can look at the quotes for insurers themselves crosstalk wallace we re running out time and i m interrupting both of you equally karl your thoughts about that rove look last week dr gruber wallace here s the white board rove he blamed it all on the insurers because but they guessed strong really actually the government told them to consider that they were going to get a lot more healthier younger people than they actually got in any single year that this program has been in effect he said trump stopped the ads trump stopped the ads on the 26th of january and the end of the enrollment period was in 31st really the problems of obamacare are going to be solved by four days worth of tv ads really he also said the executive order said not to enforce the individual mandate and that that caused problems disruption in the force well president obama delayed the individual mandate for two years and the employer mandate for a year and finally he said oh he talked about the cost sharing payments and that cause distress among the insurance companies well the insurance companies are getting the cost sharing payments despite the fact that last year a federal judge declared them illegal president trump said i ll continue to pay them until the issue is resolved last october dr gruber said the program is working exactly as we designed it now it was designed as he said earlier with the stupidity of the american people built into their calculations how to sell it but it is a broken system wallace all right rove and it s going to go under crosstalk wallace i ve got to give dr gruber the last word here thirty seconds sir gruber ok so basically you have a system which was not working perfectly but it s a system which was very fixable the question is why wallace can you respond to what karl just said gruber what karl rove working as designed it is working as designed there s no there is no sense in which it needs to be fixed mr gruber said gruber no rove the law is working as designed gruber the law could absolutely be improved but the question is instead of improving it why do you take steps to undercut it and then cost 24 million people to lose health insurance and seniors crosstalk rove that is not true that is not true wallace gentlemen we re going to gruber that s actually true rove the cbo no it isn t the cbo said those people who did not have insurance that is to say they would not buy insurance because gruber no 24 million more americans wallace all right crosstalk rove how can you lose 24 million people when 10 million people bought the insurance wallace thank you both professor gruber karl thank you and we will continue this debate but we want to focus on how it will affect you not how it will affect the politicians as the bill makes its way through the senate up next we ll bring in our sunday group to get their take on health care reform plus what would you like to ask the panel about the upcoming battle in the senate will the bill ever become law just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace hillary clinton takes responsibility for her loss in the presidential election but then starts pointing fingers begin video clip hillary clinton d former presidential candidate if the election had been on october 27th i d be your president and it wasn apost it was on october 28th and there was a lot of funny business going on around that end video clip wallace the panel discusses the blame she s placing on fbi director james comey commercial break begin video clip trump on thursday the house voted to repeal one of the worst job killing laws of all it aposs called obamacare perhaps you aposve heard of it end video clip wallace president trump in his weekly address calling on the senate to follow the house and pass republican health care reform and it aposs time known for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume back from florida welcome brit hume fox news senior political analyst thank you wallace columnist for the hill juan williams former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and former house speaker newt gingrich well we asked you for questions for the panel and it aposs clear democrats are already making headway in this argument that the house bill is going to hit older americans susan lloyd farrell sent this on facebook these are the years when the elderly need medical coverage and many live on social security what will happen to us under this new plan now speaker gingrich folks obviously over 65 are still protected by medicare but if you re 55 64 aren t you going to pay more under this new house plan newt gingrich fox news contributor you you may pay somewhat more but the fact is the the obamacare system s collapsing they just announced in maryland a 50 percent rate increase next year there are no plans left in knoxville kentucky in 94 of the 99 counties of iowa there are no plans left i mean people can yell about pre existing conditions if you can apost get any insurance you have no coverage for any condition this is an effort to try to get the program to be to survive to make sure we can offer insurance for everybody wallace let me bring you in congresswoman harman first of all your reaction to what speaker gingrich said and secondly what s your biggest concern about this house bill jane harman r congresswoman well i was in the house when obamacare past i voted for it it passed on a in a totally party line vote as this version did and we re just trading bad for bad why don apost we think about american health care not republican health care or obamacare and my reaction is that this got reince priebus who did a very good job on your show and paul ryan over the goal line but we need it aposs going to be a do over in the senate and it aposs not going to look anything like the house bill if it even passes the senate wallace but do you agree with the speaker that obamacare is is collapsing harman i agree that there are issues with obamacare and they part of that is it the bill that passed the house the congress doesn t didn apost resemble what we did in committee on a bipartisan basis and we just repeated the same movie by having a bill that didn apost go through committee that isn apost scored by cbo and that came out just as the leadership inaudible my view press release wallace ok let s let s switch pivot a little bit to the politics of all this there was a good deal of pushback to the optics take a look at this picture of the president s victory celebration with house republicans in the rose garden and if that wasn t enough senate republican leader mitch mcconnell announced his working group on health care reform and if you notice something all of those people have in common it aposs 13 white men brit first of all what do you think of the pushback and the concern about that and secondly what about this argument that this is going to be as big a political burden for republicans in 2018 as it was for democrats who lost more than 60 seats in the house in 2010 hume first of all i d say that this whole health insurance issue is not a racial issue the second thing i d say about that is that all of this these claims about the political damage that will be incurred by the republicans because of this are ridiculously premature we are not half way to enactment of this we re about a quarter of the way after all the senate will now have to pass a bill then the differences between them will have to be composed and then the final product will have to go back to both the house and the senate you can make an argument that we re a fifth of the way and what we ultimately see is likely to be quite different from what we see now wallace but you ve got to judge what you ve got in front of you hume i understand that but you can t act as if it s already passed and start lining up and making estimates of the number of people that are going to be quote hurt by it particularly when people s grasp of what s actually in the bill seems so seems to tenuous at best so this is all way too soon wallace juan juan williams fox news political analyst you remember next year 2018 key midterm elections nobody is going to act really once you get past the end of this year on such a controversial bill just think about the advertisements the advertisements are going to say congressman y a republican voted to take 24 million people often of health insurance and to increase your remember seniors are more likely to turn on in midterms to increase your premiums and cost for health care including prescription drugs these are devastating ads so yes it aposs a little bit early in the process but nonetheless they voted for this bill it aposs right in front of us for all to see wallace i want to switch to another political subject speaker gingrich and that is we ve got a french election as we re sitting here right now they are still voting in france but you aposve got the far right wing candidate marine le pen against the establishment more moderate candidate emmanuel macron for those of us who haven apost been following the the primaries in lyon ph or marseille ph what s at stake for the united states in this election gingrich well i mean it s a very big election my guess is macron is going to survive but le pen will be bigger than she ever has been before and she may well win the next election i do think there aposs a real there s a pattern building here remember if if europe wallace but let s assume macron wins or le pen wins what does that mean for americans gingrich well if macron wins you have you have decay as unusual politics as usual unemployment as usual explanations of violence as usual and people just get more disaffected but for the short run the european union survives the euro survives et cetera if le pen wins you have a break that is at least as big as brexit and you have suddenly a france that is cutting loose from its relationship with germany and cutting lose from its ties with brussels i don apost think she will win but i think she ll probably get over 40 percent of the vote her her father got 12 percent the first time he was on the ballot so it keeps growing and there s a very single fact if you are a french young person you are three times as likely to be unemployed as if you re a german young person right at that border germans are figuring out a way to have the economies work french socialism is collapsing that ain t going to change under macron and that s why in the long run it s a vote for decay to vote for macron wallace congresswoman harman guess what i agree with newt i m saying it here fair and balanced but also a couple a couple of more points unemployment in france is 10 percent unemployment in french youth is 23 percent it aposs staggering and whatever happens in this election it s going to further isolate angela merkel who in my mind is the moderate wallace the chancellor of germany harman stable voice in europe and one other point chris and that is this huge data dump nine gigabytes of data on an alt right wallace yes but you point ph that macron s files were hacked on friday just two days before the election harman right and it was released just an hour before the blackout in terms of their election coverage i mean they we don t know who did this circumstantially it could be the russians and the russians are probably playing in germany too and this is really scary for the u s to have this kind of meltdown in european politics that does affect us wallace all right we have to take a break here but when we come back hillary clinton and james comey round three and late night talk shows are experiencing a trump bump but are the hosts crossing the line with their commentary commercial break begin video clip clinton i was on the way to winning until the combination of jim comey aposs letter on october 28th and russian wikileaks raised doubt in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me james comey fbi director this was terrible it makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election end video clip wallace hillary clinton and fbi director james comey on the role the fbi investigation of clinton aposs private e mail server played in the 2016 presidential race and we re back now with the panel so brit how much responsibility do you think jim james comey really bears for clinton aposs defeat especially his announcement that he was reopening the investigation 11 days before the election hume well you can argue that flat or argue it round chris i think he it had a limited effect i don apost think it was a main factor but look at it you can look at it this way as well the case he laid out that he said was not the basis for a prosecution could very well have been as numerous legal authorities have argued about that so it aposs possible that he could have recommended an indictment which was obviously would have been devastating he didn apost do that a lot of people think he let her off the hook so you can argue it that way as well obviously his whole involvement didn apost help this whole investigation did not help but whose fault was that it was the person who had the unauthorized system for the use of her e mails that was the original sin of this matter and and that was what in the end this was all about wallace in his congressional testimony comey said that he faced two terrible alternatives begin video clip james comey fbi director i stared at speak and conceal speak would be really bad there s an election in 11 days lordy that would be really bad concealing in my view would be catastrophic end video clip wallace congresswoman harman the argument that comey makes is that if they had not revealed this she had been elected president and then it comes out that there is an investigation going on let alone that she had broken the law that that would have badly damaged the fbi harman well comey had a great chapter in john ashcroft aposs hospital room during the bush administration when he blocked the signing of an order that he thought was illegal and i applaud them for that i think he was wrong three times last year every single thing he did was wrong and the right thing to do as fbi director was keep his mouth shut and conceal no way what we re talking about was this stash of e mails i think on anthony weiner aposs hard drive which no one had looked at and to imply which his announcement did imply that there might be something bad there when it turned out there wasn apost i think was unprofessional wallace all right we got both sides of that argument let aposs turn to the politics of late night comedy here was stephen colbert with this astonishingly prude attack on donald trump this week begin video clip stephen colbert host the late show you re the presidunce ph but you re turning into a real pricktator ph the only thing your mouth is good for is being vladimir putin aposs expletive deleted holster end video clip wallace wow and here was jimmy kimmel talking about the the terrible news about his newborn son in the context of the debate this week over obamacare repeal and replace begin video clip jimmy kimmel host jimmy kimmel live billy was born with a heart disease something called tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia no parent should ever have to decide if they can afford to save their child aposs life it it just shouldn apost happen now here end video clip wallace we should point out that billy the doctors at cedars sinai were able to fix his heart and he aposs going to be a healthy little boy your thoughts about both of those mr speaker gingrich the second one is part of the left s whole mythology i mean if you show up at a hospital with a brand new baby on the brand new baby has a heart problem the doctors of that hospital do everything they can to save the baby they don apost they don t say we ll take care of the baby right after you write a check they try to save the baby s life and that aposs true across the board in this country so that is just part of the mythology of the left the problem you have with humor in american today is that hollywood is so enraged at donald trump that they can apost be funny all they ve got is pure anger and that aposs what aposs coming out in this stuff and then they think it must be funny because they aposre called comedians so they they they exhibit their anger as almost a pathology on late night television and you re supposed to laugh because after all they re comedians they ain apost funny because they aposre too angry to be funny wallace juan williams well i think in the case of jimmy kimmel i don apost think there aposs any question if you re poor in this country if you don apost have health insurance your children are at greater risk and yes if they re if you rush your child to the hospital mr speaker yes in the moment but what we re talking about his long term care and maintenance of that child aposs well being and i think there aposs no question you don apost want to be poor and dealing with this health issue system president trump said this week australia has a better system scotland canada and he s he s changed and said well i didn t mean single payer but i think it aposs pretty clear that in this argument the american people clearly believe that a child like jimmy kimmel aposs should be able to be guaranteed a healthy life without the parents worrying about insufficient funds wallace all right before we get williams let let me wallace wait wait wait before we get to the other one though your reaction to that gingrich inaudible just two things there are 8 000 federal community health centers if you aposre genuinely poor you re on medicaid everywhere in the country and i think it s just again part of the left s mythology we do an enormous amount in this country to try to save people and by the way most of the people who didn apost buy obamacare insurance are young people who preferred to pay a tax to buy the insurance so that obamacare was not able to coerce them enough to make them buy the insurance that s the largest single block of people who didn t buy insurance williams that s true that they re the largest single block but don t don t forget mr speaker that in fact obamacare was performing better than had been predicted even with that but you have republicans who intentionally sabotaged removed subsidies to create the system a collapse of the system to make it implode and now you say oh but the system s not working so we need a replacement i find this not right gingrich so comey comey beat clinton in the public inaudible obamacare ph that s what i just heard ph williams no i just want to say i think that republicans should have been from the start working to create a system that works for the american people rather than simply engaging in a system of trying to destroy obamacare and obstruct improvements and now i think democrats should rise above it and do something to improve the current system that this really is the original sin to my mind as republicans saying we re going to stop this no matter what this is big government now everybody says you should have a right as jimmy jimmy kimmel s kid should survive let me just finish up on go back to stephen colbert for a second colbert wallace yes sir yes sir go ahead williams colbert spoke in crude terms but the suggestion that the fcc should get involved here is ridiculous when should government suddenly be a sensor of late night comics wallace it s over the air williams it s over the air but wallace the fcc the fcc controls it williams no you know what cbs should fire him if that s if they feel that there is a problem let cbs act hume chris williams they government and big government should not be involved inaudible hume i don t wallace wait hume i i think what colbert said was disgusting williams right hume and if and if and if he had said something he or any other comedian had said something like that with regard to barack obama you can bet the guy would be on the or the woman would be on the unemployment inaudible chain having said that i don apost think he should be fired for having set it i don apost think that the fcc should get involved and i suspect in the end it won apost what i think should happen is that people should be repelled by it and tune him out and that will take care of the matter that s how it should be harman the important subject on this show is health care and both parties are blaming the other party and gaming the 2018 and 2020 election what about american health care why don t we think about how to build up a system that would serve everybody wallace but but i i it s a nice thought but we re so far away from that in this country today i mean i m mean i aposm serious look as you said obamacare passed without a single republican vote and this bill passed without a single democratic vote harman right gingrich you have you have a chance in the senate which is a much more open institution harman hey if newt and i can get along why can apost we do this wallace inaudible gingrich i would love to see any democrat willing to stand up tomorrow morning and say i aposm willing to work with mitch mcconnell to produce a better bill than a house bill any hume inaudible chris think of this one with one thing harman yes hume it s being said that republicans are now in dire political straits because they voted for this bill juan made the case for that just a few minutes ago williams yes hume think what would have happened had they failed again so what we now have is a situation in the media and in the body of politics to some extent where they re damned if they do and damned if they don apost inaudible williams but it was seven years wallace all right williams sixty votes and they still don t have a good plan wallace and and i thought rogue ph and gruber ph were going to be tough to control thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week a new basketball star in washington on and off the court commercial break wallace there s long been a debate whether sports stars are just athletes or should also serve as role models well there aposs a new start here in washington who is definitely both she aposs our power player of the week begin videotape elena delle donne first things first you know i aposm a professional basketball player i want to win games wallace elena delle donne is one of the stars of the wnba the league aposs most valuable player in 2015 olympic gold medalist last year in rio which makes her decision this winter to demand a trade from chicago to the washington mystics even more dramatic wallace on camera were you really willing to sit out a season in order to force a move donne i was wallace voice over league rules make it hard for players to move from one team to another donne so if you truly want a move you kind of have to put your foot down i truly thought d c was the right place for me and i wanted to be here and i was willing to do whatever it took to get here wallace which brings us to elena s older sister lizzie who was born blind and deaf and with cerebral palsy donne she aposs always been my angel my guiding light my role model and i aposve always said lizzie he has taught me more than any other person in my life and she aposs never even spoken a word to me wallace the sisters can apost skype or text which makes long separations intolerable for elena donne when i enter a room the first thing she ll do is she ll grab my hand pull me in and kind of just get my scent and she knows who it is and hopefully that means she has a bright smile when she gets my scent but some day she doesn apost and i m like all right sis like really wallace now lizzie is just a short train ride away in delaware but that aposs only part of elena s story off the court in 2008 she contracted lyme disease and it s been a problem on and off over the years wallace on camera when you have a relapse how does it feel what s it like donne for me it aposs always felt like flu like symptoms wallace perfect for a professional athlete donne yes fatigue muscle aches yes all great things for a professional athlete when you shoot you can hold the ball in two different ways wallace voice over elena took me to the mystic s practice court to give me some pointers on basketball shooting donne i always just go to a 90 degrees angle wallace on camera yes donne and you re just going to lift and flick your arm flick your wrist sorry lift your arm flick the wrist it aposs all coming back to you wallace there you go donne looking smooth wallace voice over but then she took me to the three point line which looks a whole lot farther from the basket when you aposre on the court with a star player that aposs when i wisely decided to end the lesson donne that aposs a good one wallace beyond basketball and family her other project is the elena delle donne charitable foundation to raise money and awareness for lyme disease and for families dealing with children who have special needs it aposs all part of a remarkable young woman aposs game plan donne i aposve done something with this limelight and i haven apost just soaked it all in for myself i aposve always said i ve tried to be a voice for my sister and i feel like i aposm doing that to the best of my ability and will continu
