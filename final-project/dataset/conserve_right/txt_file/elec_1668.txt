 sign in kentucky republican casts himself as anti washington crusader manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong sen rand paul the eye doctor turned politician officially kicked off his long awaited campaign for the republican presidential nomination tuesday in his home state of kentucky intent on waging a 50 state campaign that marries the small government libertarianism championed by his father and the millennial generation with the traditional forces of the republican party i am running for president to return our country to the principles of liberty and limited government sen paul said tuesday in his official campaign kickoff the scope of the challenge and the ambition of the candidate displayed themselves in full monday when the first term kentucky senator released his campaign slogan defeat the washington machine unleash the american dream designed to position him as an anti washington crusader able to attract new voters to the traditional republican coalition see also kentucky gop may change from primary to caucus to help rand paul in 2016 campaign advisers also told the washington times that mr paul planned to compete in every primary election and caucus in all 50 states all five territories and the district of columbia a feat that only two gop candidates achieved in 2012 it s time for a new way a new set of ideas a new leader one you can trust one who works for you and above all it s time for a new president mr paul said in a video released by his campaign as a prelude to tuesday s announcement the kentucky senator s all chips in message was enhanced by his winning preliminary commitment from his home state gop to convert kentucky s planned presidential preference primary next may into a presidential caucus earlier in the calendar see also rand paul unveils presidential preview it s time for a new leader a new set of ideas the move will allow mr paul to circumvent kentucky s election law requirement that a candidate s name may appear on the ballot for only one office he plans to seek nomination for a second senate term in case his presidential aspirations go south on him the state party not the state government runs the caucus and the challenge for a politician bred in the shadows of his famous father former texas congressman and presidential candidate ron paul also came into clearer focus the elder mr paul gained enormous popularity among millennials but struggled to gain mainstream support from traditional republicans who worried about some of his views on eliminating some government agencies and his reluctance to intervene militarily abroad libertarians like the elder mr paul have been distrusted on issues like gay marriage by social conservatives who are key to the iowa caucuses as well as war hawks who fear the anti interventionist agenda shared by populists like pat buchanan and many libertarians would force the u s to shrink from its role as the world s superpower the younger mr paul has sought to blunt these expected attacks openly discussing his christian faith traveling to israel to show his support for an ally that both christians and war hawks champion and penning an op ed insisting he would not be an isolationist as president but like his father the younger paul clearly champions the smaller government anti washington sentiments that have made both pauls popular among college students and young adults rand paul won the last three straw polls at the conservative political action conference where younger voters tend to dominate he ll get to test the popularity of his message of reining in washington and unleashing american ingenuity on wider audiences this week during his five state tour which will take him from his home state to the first four presidential nomination contest states iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina getting his name on the republican presidential nomination ballot in all 50 u s states and territories would be no small feat history suggests it s likely to be most presidential nomination aspirants toughest row to hoe it takes hordes of volunteers separate staffs and leaders for organizations in place on the ground in each of the states and territories money to finance it all and the know how to pull it off it also takes organization and a long head start to compete successfully in states that hold presidential preference caucuses instead of primary elections to award delegates to the republican presidential nominating convention to be held next summer in cleveland only two gop presidential nomination candidates managed to have their names on the ballots or to be fully prepared for the logistic challenge of caucuses in every state and territory in 2012 one was former massachusetts gov mitt romney who had more money available than anyone else in the field and a full blown national campaign organization the only other 50 state plus competitor was ron paul the senator s father the libertarian conservative had the advantage of twin followings tens of thousands of millennials belonging to the ubiquitous young americans for liberty chapters on college campuses and older voters whose highest political priority was to get the government off their backs and out of their bedrooms getting on the ballot became a headline issue only occasionally in the last presidential cycle mr paul and mr romney were the only candidates that appeared on the ballot in virginia s march 6 primary one of the super tuesday contests that year former sen rick santorum pennsylvania republican and a favorite of many religious conservatives never filed in the state former house speaker newt gingrich did file but his paperwork fell short of state requirements rick perry then the popular governor of texas lost a legal challenge along with other gop hopefuls on virginia s requirements being on all ballots and winning the most delegates isn t automatic as 2012 showed mr romney wound up with 1 575 delegates mr santorum with 245 mr paul with 177 and mr gingrich with 138 mr paul s campaign also hopes to expand his appeal as a washington outsider willing to smash the conventions and practices of a hostage capital city to help reclaim control of government for everyday americans and reduce the burden of excessive federal spending and debt but behind the scenes his effort to qualify both for senate re election and the presidential nominating in kentucky could pose challenges on the eve of his announcement the times confirmed mr paul has won an important victory inside the kentucky republican party that could allow him to run for both offices next year state gop chairman steve robertson has appointed a special committee to explore converting kentucky s presidential preference primary scheduled for next may to a caucus to be held earlier in the year the special committee will bring back a workable plan to present to the full central state committee to determine the feasibility of going ahead with a caucus which will mean a lot of work for everyone involved said second district chairman scott lasley who is running the effort mr paul and his chief strategist doug stafford persuaded the state gop executive committee to act on the idea with what some republicans call the approval and others call the acquiescence of kentucky s most powerful republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell the state central committee of more than 300 members must vote to approve the plan mr paul says he will help raise the money for the state gop to shoulder the burden the move would benefit mr paul on numerous fronts if mr paul can get all of his home state s 45 delegates to the republican presidential nominating convention in cleveland next summer in his column early in the nomination contest say the first few weeks in march he will look all the better to potential donors and bandwagon voters in subsequent primaries it also would allow mr paul to hedge his election bets running both for president and re election to the senate without having to go to court to challenge the current legal requirements kentucky s election rules call for a state government financed presidential primary every four years the regulations also stipulate that if you want to appear on the ballot for the u s senate nomination as mr paul does so that he might have a second six year senate term you can t have your name on the ballot for a second office such as for a
