apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump and chinese negotiators signed a hard fought trade agreement on wednesday that provides big wins for u s farmers energy companies and financial services firms a historic breakthrough in the lopsided business dealings between the world s two biggest economies that mr trump achieved through his unconventional use of tariffs the president and chinese vice premier liu he signed the phase one agreement during a white house ceremony after nearly two years of trade tensions that saw both sides impose escalating tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of each other s products the 86 page agreement calls for china to increase its purchases of u s goods by more than 200 billion over the next two years from

with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots mr trump pronounced the deal a landmark agreement as he shook hands with mr liu china s top trade official and other chinese dignitaries the president said the deal is a momentous step that puts the two countries on the path toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade together we are righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security for american workers farmers and families mr trump said from the east room which was filled with lawmakers and business leaders the agreement takes effect in 30 days it is good for china the united states and for the world mr liu said china will open itself even wider all three major u s financial markets reached record highs after the deal was signed the dow jones industrial average closed above 29 000 points for the first time in its history finishing up 0 3 to end the day at 29 030 the deal which creates a larger market for u s farmers after they endured chinese boycotts will keep in place most u s tariffs on chinese goods to compel beijing to keep its promises the agreement postpones thorny questions about china s economic manipulation such as industrial subsidies for a planned phase two negotiation we re leaving tariffs on mr trump said i will agree to take those tariffs off if we agree to do phase two i m leaving them on because otherwise we have no cards to negotiate with many business leaders expressed the view that the main benefit of the deal was to eliminate the threat of more tariffs the ceremony provided a stark contrast to partisan impeachment proceedings taking place simultaneously on capitol hill at one point during the victory lap for his economic agenda mr trump interrupted his own hour long speech to warn that some house lawmakers in the audience might need to return to the capitol for a vote on sending the articles of impeachment to the senate some of the congressmen may have to go out and vote it s on the impeachment hoax mr trump said mr trump said previous u s politicians have allowed china to pillage the u s economy with america racking up nearly 5 trillion in cumulative trade deficits with beijing since china joined the world trade organization in 2001 it s probably the biggest reason i ran for president he said there has to be a certain reciprocity he said the deal includes groundbreaking provisions on protecting u s intellectual property it was the first such deal ever with china since president richard m nixon opened diplomatic ties with the communist nation in 1972 henry kissinger who was nixon s secretary of state at the time had a front row seat for wednesday s ceremony vice president mike pence said of the deal the greatest impact may well be on american agriculture the president singled out several republican lawmakers from farming states in the audience saying the farmers are going to be so happy the administration has approved nearly 30 billion in bailouts for farmers and ranchers who have been hurt by the lost chinese markets there is plenty of skepticism in the u s about whether china will live up to its part of the bargain administration officials thought they had reached an agreement with beijing last spring only to have the chinese back out of a commitment to change their laws to reflect new trade requirements former iowa lt gov patty judge said farmers are waiting to see if the deal stabilizes prices and makes up for a deficit created by tariffs and flooding in early 2019 or if it amounts to smoke and mirrors it s complicated mrs judge a democrat who also served as iowa agriculture secretary told the washington times it looks like definitely this is a commitment from china taking quite a lot of agricultural products that s a good thing but she added we re going to have to see how it plays out noting that china hasn t lived up to its commitments in the past she said heartland farmers are a bit wary of mr trump s aims too pointing to his painful use of tariffs and his administration s decision to grant ethanol waivers to oil refineries i think they definitely have a right to be a little miffed she said he s played political games with us the new agreement uses the word enforcement 42 times for example under a section allowing for criminal penalties the document states the parties agree to ensure effective protection for trade secrets and confidential business information and effective enforcement against the misappropriation of such information mr trump staked a large part of his 2016 campaign and his reelection bid on rewriting u s trade deals in a way that foregoes multilateralism and relies instead on his face to face negotiating skills he said it would tilt the landscape in favor of american workers after millions of lost factory jobs iover several decades mr trump said the phase one deal with china on top of other deals with south korea japan and north american partners is a down payment on that promise heading into his 2020 reelection bid the president said he would travel to china soon to begin negotiations for a more comprehensive deal but treasury secretary steven t mnuchin said no date has been set for phase two trade talks to begin china has agreed to increase its purchases of u s agricultural goods by roughly 16 billion per year reaching a level of about 40 billion annually that includes 50 billion in natural gas and crude oil 75 billion of u s manufacturing goods and 40 billion or more on financial services products under the agreement beijing is allowing u s banks and credit card companies to enter china without needing to partner with a chinese company long a priority for financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase democratic presidential candidate joseph r biden said china is the big winner in the deal true to form trump is getting precious little in return for the significant pain and uncertainty he has imposed on our economy farmers and workers the former vice president said the deal won t actually resolve the real issues at the heart of the dispute including industrial subsidies support for state owned enterprises cybertheft and other predatory practices in trade and technology and house speaker nancy pelosi said mr trump inflicted deep long term damage to american agriculture and rattled our economy in exchange for more of the promises that beijing has been breaking for years she criticized mr trump for not standing strong for human rights against china americans are left with nothing more than a showy television ceremony to try to hide the complete absence of concrete progress transparency or accountability in this phase one agreement she said sen rob portman an ohio republican and former u s trade representative who attended the ceremony said the phase one agreement resulted from mr trump s insistence in 2018 to impose tariffs on chinese goods through section 301 of the trade act of 1974 but the agreement will only remain durable over time if it is enforced mr portman said that is why it is significant that this agreement includes the option to re impose tariffs should china fail to hold up its new commitments including preventing the theft of intellectual property under the deal if a dispute arises the two sides would enter a resolution process that should take up to 90 days appeals would begin at lower government levels but could be elevated to the u s trade representatives and chinese vice premier to discuss remedies if one country thinks the other side took remedial action in good faith it cannot retaliate if it thinks the action was taken in bad faith then it can withdraw from the deal in writing the escape hatch is a way to avoid another all out trade war in china former vice commerce minister wei jianguo told the state run newspaper global times the overall signal from the phase one agreement is much larger than the content of the deal itself it is a boon for the world that the world s largest and second largest economies have hit the pause key in the trade war the u s agreed to remove its label on china as a currency manipulator a designation that could have led to more tariffs the president said the deal has strong restrictions on china devaluing its currency mr trump decided to wave off tariffs that would have hit nearly 160 billion in chinese goods including electronics and other popular items on dec 15 existing tariffs on 250 billion in goods remain while levies on another 110 billion will be reduced from 15 to 7 5 senate minority leader charles e schumer said mr trump folded under pressure and accepted a weak and feckless deal ahead of the 2020 campaign from the capitol mr schumer said the initial phase pact had a stunning lack of substance and would harm workers over time since it does not address the chinese government s massive subsidies of domestic industries cyber theft from american companies nor farmers who have already gone bankrupt from the trade war the new york democrat also said china s commitment to buy tens of billions of dollars in farm products is shaky at best it s dubious that this will happen mr schumer told reporters he said he wants mr trump to start negotiations on phase two immediately rather than letting critical items languish beyond the 2020 elections mr trump however says he secured major concessions in the initial stage and that he will be well positioned to demand much more in phase two if he wins a second term in november michael pillsbury director of the center on chinese strategy at the hudson institute met with the president in a smaller group after the signing ceremony and said mr trump has been very concerned about the growth of chinese military power we don t want an arms race with china he told fox business network that s what we may have headed off today with this agreement competitive enterprise institute senior fellow ryan young said the deal will diminish damage caused by any further tariffs but it comes at a cost american consumers and businesses will still pay tariffs on 40 percent of chinese imports that were mostly tariff free just a few years ago he said consumers are worse off overall and those still new tariffs now risk becoming normalized because neither trump nor congress seemed inclined to roll them back anyway and now they re also part of an international agreement the agreement s embrace of managed trade rather than free trade is its biggest shortcoming the administration rejected the notion that by mandating purchases the deal amounts to managed trade that could push the communist chinese government in the wrong direction a senior official said the purchases will be made at market prices and reflect real
