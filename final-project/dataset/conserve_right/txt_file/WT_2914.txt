apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the news media has been insulting president trump since when the dawn of time seems like it particularly to his most ardent fans who point out that mr trump left a billionaire s life to take on the woes of an entire nation and endure an unprecedented number of insults from a hostile press now there is a study charting this trend and it found that things are only getting worse as democratic impeachment fervor continues to grow on capitol hill the media s descriptions of donald trump have become ever more colorful with headlines proclaiming him a criminal corrupt and even a treasonous traitor how have the media s descriptions of the president evolved since he first rode down that trump tower escalator four plus years ago asks kalev leetaru media fellow for realclear politics he is citing research from the gdelt project a global database which monitors the world s broadcast print and web news in 100 languages mr leetaru created gdelt over 20 years ago by the way and has been called the wizard of big data top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey for the trump insult analysis the organization searched out the frequency of the phrase trump is and compiled a list of the most common words or phrases that followed those two words during broadcasts on cnn msnbc and fox news from june 2015 to october 2019 in all cnn used the phrase 76 080 times through november 2016 while msnbc mentioned it 80 037 times and fox news 67 481 times mr leetaru noted the wide ranging results revealed the ugly partisan schism among the many verbatim examples which emerged cnn called mr trump such things as a pathological liar anti christ white nationalist disgusting fraud and uniquely unqualified msnbc said he was a con man terrible person a serious threat temperamentally unfit and phony fox news described mr trump as unstoppable the right candidate historic president a good man and doing great mr leetaru points out that fox news had some insults in the mix but far less than the other two networks meanwhile things appear to be going beyond rude so far in 2019 words have trended towards criminal allegations impeachment and racism representing the most negative wording yet says mr leetaru who is also a senior fellow at the george washington university center for cyber homeland security it is important to recognize that these phrases represent a mixture of descriptions by the channels own personalities and those of third parties which were rebroadcast as is combined they offer a glimpse into the words a viewer would have heard closely associated with the president over time on each channel the analyst observes putting this all together the descriptions found on this link show a news media that was at first dismissive of donald trump rapidly hardened its rhetoric as he raced towards the nomination then has become ever more negative as his presidency has worn on he says impeachment malaise hits the democrats the republican war chest is robust very robust in fact thanks in part to the impeachment hearings some say this might could come as a surprise to house intelligence committee chairman rep adam schiff and democratic national committee chairman tom perez or maybe not while adam schiff s kangaroo court continues to shift more voters away from their sham impeachment inquiry the rnc continues to blow the doors off of fundraising compared to tom perez and the dnc putting president trump and republicans in prime position to win up and down the ballot in 2020 declares republican national committee spokesman michael joyce the numbers so far this year republicans have raised 194 million with no debt and currently have 61 4 million in cash on hand the democrats have raised 75 5 million with 7 million in debt and have 8 7 million cash on hand we have staff in nearly 20 target states and are able to keep up the pressure on vulnerable democrats who support impeachment with newspaper ad buys in 15 states and multimillion dollar stop the madness ad buys no wonder the dnc tried to hide their october fundraising figures mr joyce observes ok everybody take a breath voters appear to be uneasy about the current social climate in the u s they re fearful in fact a new rasmussen reports survey finds that 53 of likely u s voters are concerned that if president trump is impeached and removed from office there will be violence the nature or type of that violence was not specified meanwhile 59 are concerned that people who oppose mr trump s presidency and policies will resort to violence but wait there s more the survey also found that 31 of voters now believe that the u s will experience a second civil war sometime in the next five years over 60 of republicans fear violence from both those opposed to the president s policies and those who support him if he is removed from office the poll analysis said but democrats aren t nearly as worried about trump s supporters which helps explain their strong support for the highly partisan impeachment effort while 40 of democrats are very concerned that those opposed to trump s policies will resort to violence just 18 feel that way about his supporters if the president is removed from office the analysis noted the rasmussen survey of 1 000 likely voters was conducted monday and tuesday and released thursday
