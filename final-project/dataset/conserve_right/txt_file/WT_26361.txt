tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion last year when german chancellor angela merkel announced that she would not seek re election in 2021 she set about casting her political legacy in concrete part of that was hand picking her successor annegret kramp karrenbauer to take over as leader of the christian democratic union party to continue mrs merkel s policies half of mrs merkel s legacy is the strength of the german economy by far the most successful in europe the other half of her legacy is the contumacious refusal to support nato and america s efforts to help europe protect itself like many european elitists mrs merkel doesn t like president trump she is a dedicated and outspoken opponent of his most important foreign policy moves especially his cancellation of the 2015 nuclear weapons deal with iran germany was one of its signatories top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches during her speech to a european security conference in february she sharply reiterated her criticism of mr trump s cancellation of the nuclear weapons deal with iran insisting that the deal was the best way to influence iran s behavior in that speech she also criticized mr trump s plan to withdraw from syria his suggestion that we should withdraw from afghanistan and mr trump s plan to withdraw from the intermediate range nuclear weapons treaty with russia which he has since accomplished under mrs merkel germany has continued to be one of the worst deadbeats of nato it grudgingly increased its defense spending this year to about 1 2 percent of its gdp far short of the 2 percent baseline every nato nation agreed to in 2014 her defense minister ursula von der leyen has said that german defense spending may not reach 1 25 percent of gdp by 2024 nato members defense expenditures as a percentage of gdp are tossed around frequently but are pretty abstruse in practical terms germany s defense parsimony translates into a nearly total lack of military readiness and capability according to the report on the operational readiness of the bundeswehr s primary weapons systems presented by the merkel government to the lower house of the german parliament last june the vast majority of germany s weapon systems are unavailable for training or deployment the report said for example that none of germany s 16 submarines were deployable and only 39 of 128 typhoon jets were operational let s not forget that the german army is unionized in 2016 it had to pull out of a big nato exercise because its soldiers had exceeded the number of overtime hours they could work in january germany cancelled its planned purchase of the american f 35 fighters which could have substantially increased that nation s capabilities all that adds up to the fact that germany has intentionally made itself unable to meet the commitment of mutual defense that it is responsible for under article 5 of the nato treaty the responsibility for that is mrs merkel s mrs merkel continues to champion the nordstream gas pipelines that bring russian gas to western europe her support for the pipelines is contrary to u s warnings that european dependence on russian gas supplies could in a crisis with russia result in reductions or cutoffs that would put irresistible political pressure on the using nations mr trump has been arguing against the construction of nordstream 2 last year mrs merkel agreed to build german terminals to receive u s liquid natural gas thereby reducing russian leverage in a march 4 letter to several u s senators german ambassador emily haber wrote that any u s sanctions on russia that might affect nordstream 2 will cause cancellation of the construction of terminals to receive u s gas since then there have been u s threats to sanction companies participating in the nordstream 2 construction and counter threats from germany in january germany britain and france established financial mechanisms by which those nations and their companies can trade directly with iran without involving u s dollar transactions and u s banks this was accomplished specifically to end run u s economic sanctions on iran in mid march the german foreign ministry refused to disclose information it has regarding iran s efforts to purchase nuclear and missile technologies from european nations that refusal apparently means that the financial mechanism established in january is working and that iran is buying things that germany france and britain shouldn t be selling to them in any event mrs merkel s insistence on trading with iran and russia along with turkey s perfidious conduct in re aligning itself with iran and russia have split the alliance into three factions turkey alone in its alliance with iran and russia germany france and britain which desire trade with iran and russia more than they desire to curtail either nation s aggression and the u s a lone voice for defense against russia and iran mr trump has been repeatedly vilified for his statements regarding nato s member nations refusal to live up to their obligations but he s been consistently correct the temptation for russian president vladimir putin to move against one of nato s eastern european members such as estonia which used to be part of the soviet union may be too great for him to resist if mr putin s little green men invaded and estonia called on its nato allies to defend it germany would be unable to respond it is unrealistic to believe that mrs kramp karrenbauer will change germany s course from that mrs merkel has set that means nato s future may be very short lived indeed jed babbin a deputy undersecretary of defense in the george h w bush administration is the author of in the words of ou
