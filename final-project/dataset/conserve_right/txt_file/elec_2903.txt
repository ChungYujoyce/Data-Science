economic recovery is due to regulatory regime in the white house explains why he endorsed donald trump everyone s a little bit racist sometimes doesn t mean we go around committing hate crimes everyone s a little bit racist from the tony award winning broadway musical avenue q congressional republicans might not be capable of directly measuring their tolerance of donald trump but there is certainly a metric that helps them gauge the amount most republicans have gone along grudgingly with trump if they support the presumptive presidential nominee at all some of those lawmakers are now reviewing that political quotient as they wonder what trump might say next they ponder how many more times they ll have to condemn trump s remarks they ask themselves if they ll again have to awkwardly criticize trump s comments about a judge or women or muslims yet reaffirm allegiance to him in the next breath only trump knows what lies in his heart when it comes to race ethnicity and religion but some of his comments give people pause and perhaps make them think of the lyrics in the avenue q tune no trump doesn t go around committing hate crimes but his comments certainly sound a little bit racist to some and a lotta bit racist to others house rules committee chairman pete sessions r texas says he ll vote for trump but he adds that trump needs to alter his rhetoric and if trump keeps it up it causes a lot of us to think sessions responded senate republican conference chairman john thune south dakota said trump s going to have to adapt this is not working for him this has been an unconventional election year because it flips political norms on their ear but political capital still exists and isn t unlimited republicans cannot repeatedly find themselves crossways with the top of their ticket blasting trump s provocative language yet failing to disavow that person and their ideals political capital is fungible and some of republicans could see their own stock plunge if they are linked too closely to trump i m not going to be sucked into talking about trump 24 7 protested senate majority whip john cornyn r texas when asked about the trump s views that federal judge gonzalo curiel is incapable of fairly adjudicating a lawsuit involving trump university because he is mexican never mind that curiel was born in indiana to hispanic parents cornyn says republicans should focus instead on policy and the issues but try as they might the gop fights a powerful political news vacuum that insists on focusing on trump and his missteps 24 7 at the senate republican leadership press conference tuesday afternoon just outside the senate chamber senate majority leader mitch mcconnell spoke about plans to finish a defense bill this week which didn t happen the leader mentioned opioid and energy measures cornyn then spoke about defense and north korea thune cited the iran nuclear deal and isis sen john barrasso r wyoming discussed the economy and job numbers and then reportersignored the leadership boilerplate and asked four consecutive questions about trump i m going to let you all try one more time beseeched an exasperated mcconnell to the press corps naturally journalists fired a fifth sidewinder interrogative at mcconnell about trump s invective overshadowing the gop agenda and the ability of congress to legislate ok i m going to wrap it up with this huffed mcconnell who turned his ire on trump it s time to quit attacking various people that you competed with or various minority groups in the country and get on message he has an opportunity to do that this election is eminently winnable mcconnell left the scribes with a parting shot we re all anxious to hear what he might say next said the kentucky republican or dreading house speaker paul ryan r wis didn t fare much better when he spoke tuesday in inner city washington at an event rolling out the gop s anti poverty plan naturally the first question focused on trump forcing the speaker to characterize the remarks about curiel as the textbook definition of a racist comment one republican lawmaker hit the ceiling with trump earlier in the week sen mark kirk r ill faces perhaps the most challenging re election campaign of any gop senator this fall kirk this week dropped his support for trump he said the first time candidate and billionaire businessman has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to be president kirk also said he wouldn t support hillary clinton for president when asked who he might back kirk initially said no one before quickly adding he would write in david petraeus trump then published a statement that failed to extinguish the flames on the curiel comments sen jeff flake r ariz doesn t support trump the new statement vexed the senator this is a new level flake said he needs to retract a reporter asked flake whether he thought trump had sufficiently walked back the curiel remarks keep walking replied flake sounding like a pitchman for johnnie walker blue label not all congressional republicans are able or willing to tell trump to take a hike rep lee zeldin r n y says trump would throttle clinton in his district on eastern long island zeldin wants reporters to focus on the issues and not trump s words it s a disservice for any presidential campaign and those following it who is not doing a deep dive on substantive issues argued zeldin but it was zeldin who found himself crossways in a cnn interview about his own word choice you can easily argue that the president of the united states is a racist with his policies and rhetoric he said when confronted by reporters in a congressional hallway the next day zeldin wanted to revert to substantive issues there s a lot more to this presidential race then just analyzing what the most provocative thing of the day was said zeldin said sen david perdue r ga defended trump when reporters asked whether the candidate s statements disqualified him for president absolutely not he answered reporters pressed perdue on whether trump s comments could wound him with voters people back home aren t worried about that said perdue noting that he disagreed with trump s tonality tone is indeed an issue for trump and as mcconnell and even zeldin suggested so is substance after the weekly capitol hill huddle of the pro trump caucus thursday morning rep chris collins r n y remarked that trump would be on message on policy he s going to take the fight to hillary clinton collins also asserted we re going to be disciplined exiting the same session former house speaker newt gingrich r ga said that trump was now playing ball in a much tougher league you ve got to be more careful and you ve got to think through what you re going to say he said within hours trump reverted to name calling he upbraided sen elizabeth warren d mass and called her pocahontas referring to a 2012 dispute about whether she has native american roots sen orrin hatch r utah had an idea on how to fix things for trump you folks in the media need to give him a little more leeway suggested hatch third in line to the presidency as the senate s resident pro tempore sen lindsey graham r s c isn t supporting trump he argues there s a limited threshold for how much political capital some gopers are willing to burn if trump continues the trash talk if he keeps doing this he s really dishonoring that support graham said that s the political risk trump poses to his own supporters especially in republicans in congress lawmakers don t want the public to perceive them like someone out of avenue q as the song goes no one s going around committing hate crimes but if trump continues the rhetoric lawmakers worry voters could label republicans a little bit racist get
