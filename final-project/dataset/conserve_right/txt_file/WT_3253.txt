defense secretary mark esper said monday even though president donald trump has insisted he is pulling troops out of the country and getting out of endless wars the pentagon chief said the plan was

press conference in afghanistan before heading to saudi arabia there has been no decision with regard to numbers or anything like that still the fact that such a plan was under consideration was

of keeping u s forces in eastern syria to protect the oilfields and that trump supported the idea the official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions trump said monday at the white house that he still wants to get all u s troops out of syria but we need to secure the oil in one part of the country while israel and jordan asked him to keep some forces in another part other
