terrorist network al qaeda s iraqi affiliate the islamic state of iraq and syria isis carried out the sophisticated attack on two iraqi prisons in mid july freeing some 500 prisoners including large numbers of al qaeda terrorists and senior leaders those escaped prisoners are now the backbone of the forces controlling ramadi and fallujah under the black flag of al qaeda the july attacks took place at the notorious abu ghraib prison and a prison near baghdad called al taji the military operation was carefully planned and involved dozens of fighters equipped with mortars rocket propelled grenades and assault rifles the attacking forces also used suicide car bombs to breach security barriers before the prison raids al qaeda in iraq was viewed as severely weakened the hundreds of escaped prisoners strengthened the group that now is destabilizing anbar and threatening the government of prime minister nouri al maliki al qaeda in iraq now has an estimated 3 000 fighters many of whom are controlling ramadi and fallujah additionally the lack of u s support the obama administration has promised to speed up deliveries of missiles but has ruled out sending troops is prompting neighboring iran to offer its military support iran s islamist regime gradually has been increasing its strategic influence in iraq through mr al maliki s pro shiite policies for example iraq has become a major transit route for iranian islamic revolutionary guards corps fighters on their way to fight in syria s civil war on behalf of the bashar assad government the escaped terrorists in july were described by u s officials as hardened first and second generation al qaeda terrorists who settled in western iraq including ameriya samarra fallujah and ramadi iraqi government forces failed to recapture the two cities agence france presse reported tuesday security forces and armed tribesmen tried last night to enter areas controlled by the isis in the south of the city a police captain in

the sunni anger to foment an uprising mr al maliki has ordered to the army to retake the cities and is giving anbar tribal militias time to take steps to oust the terrorists cia report backs japan china and japan are locked in a heated dispute over the senkaku islands a group of uninhabited islets said to contain large undersea reserves of gas and oil japan has claimed the islands since the end of world war ii but china claims them as the diaoyu the dispute heightened a year ago after tokyo purchased several of the islands from private japanese owners in an attempt to settle the dispute instead the chinese government set off nationalist anti japan riots in november tensions increased after china declared an air defense identification zone covering the islands japan south korea and the united states said they do not recognize the chinese zone a declassified cia intelligence report from may 1971 the senkaku islands dispute oil under troubled waters makes clear that the islands are japanese the report stated that china s claims to the islands date to the ming dynasty as early as 1403 the cia then said the senkakus are part of japan s ryuku islands which have been japanese for centuries in contrast it is likely that the earliest japanese references to the islets were made sometime in the late 19th century the report said japanese involvement with the ryukus however is dated from around 1166 the year of the first king of okinawa whose father was a japanese nobleman in exile former state department china analyst john tkacik said the cia report declassified in 2007 is a pretty conclusive assessment the senkakus are and always were japanese and taiwan historical claims were fabrications he said con
