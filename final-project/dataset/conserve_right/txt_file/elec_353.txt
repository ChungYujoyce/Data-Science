abandon donald trump but the presumptive republican presidential nominee said this week he s ready to kick them to the curb and go it alone against hillary clinton if they don t man up in some of his most dismissive comments yet mr trump said other republicans need to either get behind him or just be quiet adding to the increasing heartburn among republicans particularly those on capitol hill

admonition came after several weeks of chiding from fellow republicans who decried his proposal for a temporary ban on muslims entering the u s and who said his attacks on a federal judge s ethnicity were unbecoming mr ryan had called it the textbook definition of a racist comment the republicans honestly folks our leaders our leaders have to get tougher this is too tough to do it alone but you know what i think i m going to be forced to i think i m going to be forced to mr trump said on wednesday our leaders have to get a lot tougher and be quiet just please be quiet don t talk please be quiet just be quiet to the leaders because they have to get tougher they have to get sharper they have to get smarter we have to have our republicans either stick together or let me just do it by myself i ll do very well mr trump insisted gop observers said mr trump is playing with fire most people respond better to charm and subtle persuasion than they do to threats and most victories are won by team efforts versus lone wolves said fred malek a white house veteran who serves as finance chairman of the republican governors association trump certainly knows this from his success in business and why would he think it s different in politics mr malek said voters want mr trump to step up and be an inclusive leader but the maverick candidate began his campaign on the other side of the spectrum accusing mexico of sending rapists and other bad elements of its society to the u s his approach appeared to work in the gop primary with his criticism of fellow politicians as stupid and all talk no action earning him fans from alienated conservatives and moderates alike that has led to an uneasy relationship with the republican national committee as well as gop lawmakers nationally who ve had meltdowns over his brash brand of politics concerned that he is tarnishing the party and its chance of retaining control of congress in the november election this week maryland gov larry hogan and richard armitage who served as deputy secretary of state in the george w bush administration announced they were jumping ship and couldn t support mr trump since wrapping up the gop nomination in

him in an ongoing court case involving trump university but the kumbaya moments have been less common than the divisive outbursts republicans on capitol hill repeatedly find themselves being asked to defend or distance themselves from the latest pronouncements from their presidential candidate some have taken to brushing the questions aside while others engage to some extent mr ryan speaking to

rights on behalf of our citizens so that we remain a self governing people he said rnc chairman reince priebus meanwhile downplayed the drama by announcing that he was flying with mr trump to dallas for a rally reports of discord are pure fiction mr priebus said on twitter great events lined up all over texas r s will win in nov but mr trump s critics said the new york businessman s comments show that his post primary promise to act more presidential has already fallen by the wayside and marks an escalation of a yearlong trend that is eating away at whatever good will republicans still have

support the billionaire businessman in trump s world you either become a trump acolyte one of these people defending him on tv that is starting to look like cast of the addams family or you re a
