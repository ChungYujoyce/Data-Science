apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion perhaps unsurprisingly congress and the white house are at yet another constitutional deadlock this time over how the united states should proceed in the ongoing civil war in syria quite rightly president trump is hellbent on keeping his campaign promises to withdraw u s forces from foreign military entanglements congress in a fit of rare bipartisanship meanwhile warns of doom and mayhem if the united states vacates the region leaving our longtime allies the kurds to certain annihilation by the turks and others rep liz cheney wyoming republican issued a twitter message wednesday saying news from syria is sickening turkish troops preparing to invade syria from the north russia backed forces from the south isis fighters attacking raqqa impossible to understand why realdonaldtrump is leaving america s allies to be slaughtered and enabling the return of isis top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens anyone wishing for the return of the good ole days when our system of checks and balances were kept robust by regular fights among the three branches of the federal government regardless of party control should be thrilled by these developments it is true that mr trump won the 2016 election on a blatant non interventionist bordering on isolationist foreign policy platform at least when it comes to military force this position long popular among democratic voters has become increasingly popular among republican voters as they grew frustrated with the seemingly never ending costly commitments overseas it is ironic indeed that politicians in congress are unified in favor of such a conflict just as regular voters of both parties are unified against them in a twitter message of his own mr trump declared fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years usa should never have been in middle east and in a tone ripe for one of his campaign mega rallies he added the stupid endless wars for us are ending it is also true that the kurds have been valuable allies in not only syria but also elsewhere throughout our nearly two decade military campaign through the middle east and to be sure mr trump s decision to desert the kurds will undoubtedly lead to the death of many kurds including innocent civilians women and children moreover mr trump s decision to withdraw from syria will almost certainly weaken the civilized world s campaign against radical islamic terrorism and embolden those who wish to destroy the civilized world despite ms cheney s understandable hand wringing over the regrettable situation with the kurds in syria she and her suddenly unified fellow legislators in congress hold the answer to this constitutional standoff and it is a fairly simple solution if congress is so adamant that u s forces should be fighting in the syrian civil war then congress should vote to declare war as it stands today u s forces are deployed in syria on legally and constitutionally shaky grounds in the days after the 9 11 terrorists attacks congress approved an authorization of use of military force which allowed the president to deploy troops against those responsible for 9 11 as well as any associated forces in the two decades since presidents have used this authorization as a shortcut to avoid going through congress to get approval for military action abroad as a result the united states today is engaged in 80 countries across six continents fighting terrorism and as evidenced by mr trump s campaign and 2016 victory voters are tired of it oddly members of congress such as ms cheney who are urging president trump to remain in syria are essentially committing constitutional suicide by working to eliminate their own authority in the process of sending troops into battle overseas that is a self defeating motive that even the founders could not imagine and who knows having the debate on the floor of the house of representatives and the united states senate just might persuade american voters to turn in favor of such foreign military adventurism regardless such a declaration of war would surely give president trump all the cover he needs to keep the united states entangled in syria s civil war and fighting alongside
