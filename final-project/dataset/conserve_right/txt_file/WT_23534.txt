tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn brookfield wis ap carol evans approves of donald trump s immigration policy she gives him credit for the strong economy but the republican from the affluent milwaukee suburbs of waukesha county a gop bedrock in the state just can t commit to voting for the president next year like she did in 2016 i just don t like the way he talks about other people evans a 79 year old retired data entry supervisor said recently as she walked through a shopping mall in brookfield wisconsin days after trump fired off a racist tweet at democratic congresswomen the president s recent return to racial politics may be aimed at rallying his base of white working class voters across rural america but the risks of the strategy are glaring in conversations with women like evans top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens many professional suburban women a critical voting bloc in the 2020 election recoil at the abrasive divisive rhetoric exposing the president to a potential wave of opposition in key battlegrounds across the country in more than three dozen interviews by the associated press with women in critical suburbs nearly all expressed dismay or worse at trump s racially polarizing insults and what was often described as unpresidential treatment of people even some who gave trump credit for the economy or backed his crackdown on immigration acknowledged they were troubled or uncomfortable lining up behind the president the interviews in suburbs outside philadelphia milwaukee detroit and denver are a warning light for the republican president s reelection campaign trump did not win a majority of female voters in 2016 but he won enough notably winning white women by a roughly 10 percentage point margin according to the american national election studies survey to help him eke out victories across the rust belt and take the white house since then there are few signs trump has expanded his support among women the 2018 midterms amounted to a strong showing of opposition among women in the suburbs registering in unprecedented turnout overall a democratic house and a record number of women elected in statehouses across the country a continuing trend of women voting against republicans could prove exceedingly difficult for trump to overcome in his 2020 reelection bid it s one of the more serious problems that the republicans face said g terry madonna a pollster and director of the center for politics and public affairs at franklin and marshall college in pennsylvania in the detroit suburb of novi where democrat hillary clinton narrowly beat trump in 2016 pet store worker emily west says she probably would have cast her ballot for trump if she had voted in 2016 now she s primed to vote against him it was mainly when he got into office when my opinion started changing said west 26 just the way he treats people west spoke days after trump fired off a tweet calling on four democratic congresswomen of color to go back to their home countries even though three of the four were born in the united states trump s supporters later turned send her back into a rally cry aimed at the one foreign born member of the group rep ilhan omar of minnesota who arrived in the u s as a child refugee from somalia over the weekend trump picked up another racial trope using his twitter feed to attack democratic rep elijah e cummings and his majority black baltimore district by calling it a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess where no human being would want to live pollsters say it is difficult to measure whether female voters will count trump s behavior against him more than their male counterparts will in 2020 but interviews with women reveal a clear discomfort with trump s character it emerged again and again in the ap s interviews and was a consistent objection cited by women across the political spectrum i did not think it was going to be as bad as it is definitely narcissism and sexism but i did not think it was going to be as bad as it is said kathy barnes while shopping in the denver suburb of conservative leaning lone tree i am just ashamed to be an american right now barnes a 55 year old former insurance broker left the democratic party years ago because she was open to voting republican but now she is one of the reasons that colorado once a competitive swing state has been slipping away from the gop in novi michigan yael telgheder 36 says she tends to vote democratic and reluctantly voted for clinton in 2016 even though i didn t like either by the way asked about trump the database manager lowers her voice i don t think i should say those words in front of my daughter she said her 3 year old next to her to be honest there are certain things that he s a businessman so i understand the reasons behind them but all of the disrespect and lies and stuff like that it s just too much for me such women are an electoral threat to the president in large part because women outnumber and outvote men noted kelly dittmar a political science professor and a scholar at the center for american women and politics at rutgers university they are especially vital because they are base voters for democrats they vote for democrats in larger numbers than men but for republicans they are also important because they have tended to be a larger proportion of swing voters dittmar said the trump campaign has tried to shore up their support it launched its women for trump coalition in suburban philadelphia this summer drawing hundreds of women to see trump s daughter in law lara trump and others to promote the message that trump supports women s issues and a strong economy erin perrine the campaign s deputy communications director said the campaign sees the philadelphia suburbs as a place it may pick up support trump s tweet at the so called squad of democratic congresswomen along with interviews in politically divided bucks county
