 philadelphia it was fine the dnc s tuesdayagenda featuredexactly one major primetimeheadliner former president bill clinton who set out to build an emotionally rooted case on behalf of his wife whom their party had nominated for the presidency hours earlier in 2012 i remember sitting in the arenarafters in charlotte watching with helpless frustration and dismay as our 42nd president articulated the most compelling if fact challenged argument for barack obama s re election that i d seen to date he was masterful weaving a plausible sounding story in which republicans were ridiculed as howling partisans blinded by resentful and unrealistic expectations of his tale s heroic protagonist he went full policy wonk at times somehow pulling it off he made people believe that obama and companywere the adults trying to fix awful inherited problems while the gop shrieked in nihilistic protest i recall the sinking intuitive feeling that the race which was absolutely losable for obama at that point had shifted with one speech iawarded him a b in my postgame analysis which was wishful thinking the thrust of clinton s argument went largely unrefuted for weeks with the glorious and fleeting exception of that first presidential debate in denver bill clinton really didhelpobama win period and romney knew it as evidenced bythis memorableone liner from his pre election alfred e smith dinner comedy routine the best jokes have at least a kernel of truth to them tonight bill clinton strode into the spotlight once again this time to work his magic on behalf of his wife he did well i think but didn t alter the trajectory of the race that s not to say that hillary won t get a boost out of philadelphia she very probably will as trump did after cleveland but that was not a lightning strike address it wasn t eventhe best speech of the first half of the convention still it was pretty clear what he was trying to do before the big address megyn kelly asked me if i thought bill would seek to rescue hillary s drowninghonesty numbers which aredeservedly andtrulyawful my reply guypbenson can billclinton do anything to help rehabilitate her trustworthiness numbers i don t think he can kellyfile he didn t really even try instead he set to work chipping away at her personal favorability gap which is also aserious problem reality check hillary clinton s unfavorable ratings cnn 55 gallup 57 cbs 56 clinton painted a portrait of a technocratic workhorse committees task forces who genuinely cares about people and has channeled those sentiments into a lifetime of tireless public service that was the whole point of his at times meandering reminiscences about their early life together and putting a human face on a woman seen by many as power hungry and calculatingis preciselywhy he devotedquite a lot of time to describing hillary as a mother i don t think talking about hillary s water breaking was simply tossed in casually along the same lines chelsea will undoubtedly lay the grandma color on thick onthursday night the former president traced his timeline up into the present day skipping certain unhelpful bits like the year 1998 andadorning hillary s tenure at the state department with the most impressive sounding achievement language he could summon his only partisan shots were a brief jab about mocking the disabled and the suggestion that everything at the rnc last week was made up in fairness he is something of an expert on the subject of making things up he didn t need to go uber partisan as he did four years ago because his objectives were different this time bill clinton can read a poll as well as anyone else he knows thatmost people already dislike donald trump this was about boosting hillary s very slight and narrowing favorability advantage not trying to drive trump s stratospheric unfavorability numbers any higher his wife he said is serious and committed the real deal believe him he s witnessed it for decades firsthand was the speech welcomed rapturously in the hall yes they love him here did it play well on television i bet it did it helped her was it a game changing performance that s likely to permanently alter people s perceptions of hillary clinton i doubt it she is still the sameflawed unlikable dishonest ethically unfit candidate she was this morning and ifrumors and vows are to be believed more embarrassments and ethical imbroglios may lie ahead for her bill clinton hasn t lost his touch as a marvelous political communicator but there s only so much he could work with here his effort was admirable and solid nonetheless but isuspect it didn t deliver the memorable politicaljuice that his 2012 outing did onward to day three alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for
