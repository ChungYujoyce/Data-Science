between the two countries and china s increasing clout will render russia a junior partner to the chinese on the influence front russia recently joined china in proposing a halt to u s military exercises in south korea as part of beijing s bid to resolve the north korean nuclear crisis the trump administration has rejected the deal as undermining the security of south korea and american troops stationed there the report did not provide details of the growing military ties but a separate report published in march by the congressional u s china economic and security review commission

and political influence operations and electronic warfare targeting the united states according to a navy information warfare specialist this is a geoeconomic and geoinformational struggle between the united states and china says lt cmdr robert jake bebber a former cyber command cryptological warfare officer now assigned to carrier strike group 12 it is critical to recognize that china leverages the american system and its values legally probably more so than illegally to constrain the u s response cloud american understanding and co opt key american institutions allies and assets cmdr bebber said in a recent series of articles in the journal of the center for international maritime security in many ways the prc approach being waged today is being hidden by their ability to work within and through our open liberal economic and political system while supplemented with cyber enabled covert action such as the opm hack chinese cyberespionage has been blamed for the theft of 22 million records from the office of personnel management u s intelligence officials say the hack provided beijing with a windfall of information to use in intelligence agent recruitment and future cyberoperations cmdr bebber notes that china s creation of a new military unit called the strategic support force ssf is an umbrella for improving psychological warfare in the information sphere along with increased space cyberspace and the electronic warfare the pla s information warfare strategy calls for its information warfare forces to form into ad hoc information operations groups at the strategic operational and tactical levels and the establishment of the ssf will save time and enable better coordination and integration into joint forces he said china appears to be adopting the u s view of seeking information dominance in conducting joint warfare and chinese military writings call for attacking enemy information infrastructures to weaken the ability to retaliate in a future conflict with china we should expect to see full scope network operations worldwide in pursuit of their interests including in the american homeland he warns the u s must evaluate how it is postured as a nation and whether it is prepared to fight and defend its information space to include critical infrastructure networks strategic resources economic arrangements and the industries that mold and shape public understanding attitude and opinion cmdr bebber said for china information warfare is a zero sum competition with a clear winner and loser china intends to be the winner and it believes that the longer it can mask the true nature of that competition and keep america wedded to its own view of the competition as a positive sum game it will enjoy significant leverage within the american led system and retain strategic advantage cmdr bebber said nsa security faulted the national security agency has failed to tighten its security against insider threats to its data and equipment despite the devastating compromise of its secrets in the case of renegade contractor edward snowden a declassified nsa inspector general report looked into the electronic intelligence agency s secure the net initiatives at four locations the fort meade headquarters an nsa facility in san antonio the nsa utah data storage center and a north carolina state university laboratory nsa s actions to implement secure the net initiatives did not fully decrease the risk of insider threats or the ability of insiders to exfiltrate data the partially declassified ig report states nsa continues to be hit with security lapses in june reality winner an nsa contractor working at a security agency center in georgia was arrested for improperly sharing a classified nsa document with the anti secrecy website the intercept last august a hacker group known as the shadow brokers revealed that it had obtained secret nsa hacking tools that were sold off and were used in a global ransomware attack in may an nsa intelligence contractor harold t martin iii also was charged with mishandling some 50 terabytes of nsa data the same month the security audit was carried out in response to the snowden leaks in june 2013 that involved the loss of 1 5 million sensitive or classified documents the report said the report dated august 2016 and made public in june also faulted the agency for lacking a comprehensive strategy and plan to implement better security controls nsa was evaluating its security when snowden fled to hong kong with the documents after the theft some steps were taken to protect infrastructure systems and data against insider threats forty secure the net initiatives were launched in june 2013 and the ig looked into seven of those including a new system for system administrators assessing the numbers of system administrators requiring two person access controls to data centers and machine rooms using two stage authentication for log ins and increasing oversight of nsa users the recommendations of the ig were heavily redacted but included joint efforts by nsa s director of the technology directorate to work with the security and counterintelligence director to deal with insider threats the nsa was also directed to develop a strategy to deal with insider threats contact bill g
