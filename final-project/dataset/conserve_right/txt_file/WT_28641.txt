tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn president trump s twitter account upended the 2020 census on wednesday with government lawyers scrambling to figure out how to reverse themselves and add a citizenship question into next year s count just a day after they d told courts it wasn t going to happen we at the department of justice have been instructed to examine whether

this isn t going to be quick gop vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid judge george jarrod hazel gave the department until friday to make up its mind saying either it would need to promise no citizenship question will appear on the 2020 census or else it will need to explain what the next steps are as the administration tries a last ditch effort to get it added back in joshua gardner another government lawyer had told judge hazel on tuesday that the question was out he based that on the decisions of his own department and the commerce department where secretary wilbur ross waved the white flag and said the 2020 questionnaire was being printed sans the citizenship question mr trump apparently wasn t consulted the news reports about the department of commerce dropping its quest to put the citizenship question on the census is incorrect or to state it differently fake we are absolutely moving forward as we must because of the importance of the answer to this question the president tweeted wednesday morning mr gardner who was on vacation but dialed in for a telephone appearance with judge hazel wednesday afternoon said he had no idea where things stood the tweet this morning was the first i had heard of the president s position on this issue just like the plaintiffs and your honor mr gardner said obviously as you can imagine i am doing my absolute best to figure out what s going on he even told the judge he d consulted with the census bureau and officials there were already printing the questionnaire without the question and that process has not stopped judge hazel lamented that he didn t pin the government down more cleanly tuesday when mr gardner had first said the citizenship question was off the menu the president s

followed all the correct procedures and that it can be done in time the justice department had tried to take a shortcut asking the supreme court to overturn the blockades and approve the question but in a 5 4 decision last week the justices ruled that the administration cut too many corners asking about citizenship is legal and indeed has been done many times in the past however chief justice john g roberts jr said the administration s explanation for why it wanted to do so now was contrived the court remanded the case back down the chain saying the commerce department could attempt a do over but the ruling came three days before the department s deadline for finalizing the questions which had to happen by sunday in order for the forms to be printed in time to be sent out next year opponents of the question argue it would scare people away and provide an inaccurate count the administration says it wants the information to better enforce voting rights laws though evidence has emerged that officials were also hearing from gop strategists who said the question could help maximize republican political power in the next round of redistricting mr trump first signaled defiance of his administration s decision tuesday night on twitter where he called the justices decision a very sad time for america he said he d asked the justice and commerce departments to do whatever is necessary to bring this most vital of questions and this very important case to a successful conclusion usa usa usa but it wasn t until the wednesday tweet that declared he was absolutely moving
