shrill pace a surprise headline has surfaced trump approval climbs to highest level of 2019 amid impeachment inquiry yes a new poll reveals all despite the political drama unfolding in several sectors

it is approaching the president s highest mark with hill harrisx poll which was 51 in august 2018 trump s disapproval rating meanwhile dropped to 51 which marks his lowest level so far this year the pollster said why they still love trump the aforementioned poll is among several which reveal either hidden support for president trump or strong disapproval of impeaching him or even an inquiry into

motivation is simple they whipped up their base into such a delusional frenzy during the russia investigation they have to keep the narrative going at all costs house speaker nancy pelosi faces a rebellion from her caucus if she doesn t go along with it clearly this is going to blow up in democrats faces in fact the best thing that can happen for president trump is for democrats in the house to vote to impeach mr krumholz says then trump can talk about democrats obsessing over impeachment instead of a new trade deal with mexico and canada which would help farmers and factory workers
