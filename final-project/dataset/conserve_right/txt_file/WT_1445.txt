apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion george santayana was right because nobody has learned anything in the past three years we are doomed to repeat the 2016 election over and over again today s edition of this never ending saga involves hillary clinton attacking sen bernie sanders her old primary rival and one of the leading candidates to take on donald trump later this year the shots appeared in the pages of the hollywood reporter you see the geniuses in the entertainment industry have determined that what the general public is clamoring for is a new four hour documentary about mrs clinton and she gave an interview to the venerable entertainment publication to promote it we can tell it s a hard hitting documentary by the fact that the subject it focuses on is out promoting it in the interview the reporter notes that in the forthcoming documentary mrs clinton says of mr sanders he was in congress for years he had one senator support him nobody likes him nobody wants to work with him he got nothing done he was a career politician it s all just baloney and i feel so bad that people got sucked into it yes hillary clinton attacked bernie sanders for being a career politician top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens the magazine asked ifshe still believes this to be true yes she says before adding i will say however that it s not only him it s the culture around him it s his leadership team it s his prominent supporters it s his online bernie bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors particularly the women and i really hope people are paying attention to that because it should be worrisome that he has permitted this culture not only permitted he seems to really be very much supporting it mrs clinton s missive against mr sanders and his supporters can only hurt the democrats chances against mr trump later this year for one she has added an element of conflict to the democratic primary that will only inflame internal strife and even worse for the democrats mr sanders has a real shot at winning the party s nomination and mrs clinton s anti endorsement can only hurt his prospects down the road they may even show up in a republican ad at some point so why would mrs clinton do this there can be no doubting she hates president trump and thinks him unfit for the presidency but perhaps on a subconscious level i suspect she wants mr trump to be re elected if the democrats lose to mr trump again after all her 2016 performance will be less of an indictme
