mainland china to a news app that extensively covered the anti government demonstrations and it has made it harder to find an emoji representing the taiwanese national flag the tech company s latest acts of capitulation to china s ruling communist party have alienated some hong kong consumers and angered democracy activists around the world but the truth is few u s companies have as much of their business tethered to china as apple that s the price you pay if you want to be in the market said matt schrader a china analyst for the alliance for securing democracy at the german marshall fund you

chinese telecommunications equipment giant apple ceo tim cook has spent much of the past year walking a thin line trying to prod a truce between the u s and china while also trying to protect his company s interests his efforts so far have largely paid off helping to shield the iphone from being hit by tariffs in either the u s or china but that could change in mid december when the trump administration has promised to expand import duties on more consumer electronics with the specter of those tariffs apple has even more of an incentive to placate china s government and avoid provoking beijing in a worst case scenario analysts have estimated retaliatory action from china could cut apple s profit 10 to 20 that would translate into a loss of 6 billion to 12 billion in a single year based on apple s profits last year apple defended its decision thursday to pull the police tracking hkmap live from its online app store for some people in hong kong the app was a handy tool that
