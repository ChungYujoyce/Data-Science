apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic an ethanol producer had a warning for president trump wednesday about the political cost of his administration s policies that are causing losses and anger in farm country at the nation s largest outdoor farm show in decatur illinois marquis energy ceo mark marquis told agriculture secretary sonny perdue that some of the administration s proposed fixes to boost ethanol demand aren t likely to quell the uproar among mr trump s base over the environmental protection agency s exemptions to small refineries from blending the biofuel i don t think that when you waive 31 small refinery exemptions that just some flex fuel vehicles or some infrastructure money is going to correct the problem and keep agriculture squarely behind the president where i think he needs to have them in order to be reelected mr marquis said i know he needs wisconsin and iowa top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state mr perdue said the president will announce a plan soon to boost demand for biofuels hoping to ease the latest blow to farmers who have been struggling from the impact of the president s trade war with china we re working really hard to mitigate that as much as possible mr perdue said at the farm progress show i don t want to steal the president s thunder on that i think he really wants to announce it himself but i think we ll have better news on the renewable fuel standard he said the agriculture department has proposals for strengthening infrastructure to allow greater use of e15 a higher ethanol blend of gasoline that had been barred during the summer mr trump lifted the restriction this year the president is trying to balance the needs of the ethanol and oil industries as his reelection approaches but farmers already were feeling the loss of chinese markets for their corn soybeans and pork from the u s tariff war with beijing which prompted the administration to provide 28 billion in bailouts over two years mr trump has continually praised farmers and ranchers as great patriots who are willingly enduring the lost markets and declining crop prices as he seeks to force china to renegotiate fair trade terms for the u s but there are increasing signs their patience is running out a farm journal pulse survey of 1 153 farmers last week showed that 71 approve of the job mr trump is doing down from 79 in july in the poll 43 strongly approved of the president down 10 points from the previous month illinois farm bureau president rich guebert said farmers are under stressful times in the midwest with commodity prices falling corn which peaked at 8 per bushel in 2012 was at about 3 50 this week we really need some quick wins to give us a light at the end of the tunnel mr guebert told mr perdue the agriculture secretary replied economically the president is well aware that we re in a long term slump and there s a lot of stress the renewable fuel standard requires refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund other refiners that can the administration has greatly expanded waivers for refiners and granted the 31 exemptions this month the administration has issued 85 ethanol waivers for refineries since mr trump took office resulting in an estimated loss of 4 billion gallons of renewable fuel the industry says the exemptions are causing 15 ethanol plants to close nationwide iowa gov kim reynolds a republican recently spoke with mr trump about the issue i m just not sure that he fully understood maybe the ramifications of what that means she told reporters this week i would say that he has a pretty good idea now of what those ramifications entail the latest waivers for refineries are expected to reduce demand for ethanol by 1 4 billion gallons which contributes to less demand for corn which also affects prices our wisconsin plants have recently curtailed some production because of the difficult margin environment so we re buying less corn up there mr marquis said the basis price of corn will be dropping in central wisconsin that s unfortunate trade tensions flared again late last week when mr trump and beijing announced escalating retaliatory tariffs and the president said he would order u s companies to leave china farmer lin warfel of illinois expressed frustration about the difficulty for growers to find out how the trade war is progressing most of us don t follow tweets he told mr perdue what s happening between our president and the leader of china has great impact on us here in illinois and it s really difficult to get good information about what s happening we try to follow hard information he asked the agriculture secretary can you just direct us on how to get accurate information as far as the tariffs us and china mr perdue replied to laughter i was hoping you could tell me the secretary said he believes that mr trump and chinese president xi jinping had confidential conversations last weekend that even xi s team didn t know about the president is very much a personal relationship kind of trader and negotiator mr perdue said and i know that he wants a deal done he s not going to capitulate to the things that china s been doing stealing intellectual property and all that over the years he s going to hold that up very strong there but i think it will get done i just can t tell you when mr perdue who said conditions will improve if democrats in congress approve the u s mexico canada trade deal told farmers that he has explained to the president why they don t want bailouts the president said aren t people happy with this 16 billion mr perdue recounted and i said mr president these are growers think of them as builders they want to produce things it s in their dna to grow and sell stuff and that s what they want to do and i used this example with him i said you think about it if you saw a beautiful area you want to put a resort in and you did all this preparation to build a resort and the community came and said no we re not going to let you do that we ll pay you not to do that that s somewhat helpful but it s not very fulfilling and i think he kind of understood that mr marquis who represents about 100 ethanol facilities accused the government of betraying ethanol producers by retreating from a promise more than 10 years ago to increase the biofuel blending rate until 2022 he blamed the epa for being beholden to the petroleum industry now when we get 10 years into it we re going to head downhill because of these small refinery exemptions and not reallocating them back into the rest of the refining market mr marquis said it feels like a double cross to us when you have a situation where you know you get oil guys with the epa and they re administering the renewable fuel standard it s difficult so we d like to see those ethanol gallons reallocated mr perdue replied i ve heard that before he said he held a meeting with epa administrator andrew wheeler and energy secretary rick perry on the maximum amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline and that the so called blend wall really affects a lot of policy we have to come to an
