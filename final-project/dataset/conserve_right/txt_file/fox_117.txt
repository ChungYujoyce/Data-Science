white house economic advisor only on fox news sunday then trump the democrats have become an anti israel party they become an anti jewish party wallace democrats divided over how to handle a congresswoman aposs comments about support for israel rep nancy pelosi d calif speaker of the house i do not believe that she understood the full weight of her words wallace we aposll ask whether the party can come back together plus rep devin nunes r calif they met with cohen they clearly were trying to devise how they aposre going to roll out a new narrative wallace plus michael cohen coached by

wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington president trump is set to unveil his 2020 budget tomorrow amid a growing federal deficit and an economy that may be showing signs of slowing down in a moment we aposll talk with white house chief economic advisor larry kudlow about that and prospects for a trade deal with china but first the other fights on capitol hill the controversy over whether michael has lied to congress again and democrats still divided up after passing a resolution responding to congresswoman ilhan omar aposs comments on israel here aposs chief congressional correspondent mike emanuel begin videotape unidentified male the resolution is agreed to and without objection the motion to reconsider is laid on the table mike emanuel chief congressional correspondent democrats expanded the measure to condemn anti semitism islamophobia racism and other forms of bigotry and only indirectly references congresswoman ilhan omar rep liz cheney r wy house republican conference chair this resolution really ended up really being an effort to protect her and it was completely watered down emanuel the controversy taking attention away from democrats apos passing of a massive election reform bill pelosi let us look to the senate and say when we pass this bill it aposs not just what happens on this floor it aposs the message it sends to the american people emanuel senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said that the bill is dead on arrival meanwhile house republicans are questioning democratic staff spending hours with michael cohen prior to his testimony last week some republicans charge it was an effort to coach a witness while democrats say it was normal preparation and there were more questions about whether cohen who is slated to begin a three year prison sentence in may for crimes including lying to congress lied again michael cohen former trump attorney i have never asked for nor would i accept a pardon from president trump trump it aposs a stone cold lie and he lied about a lot of things but when he lied about the pardon that was really a lie emanuel and in a pair of weak economic reports the u s trade deficit and goods reached its highest level last year as the u s imported a record number of products including from china undermining the president aposs promise to cut the imbalance and bring back jobs in february the u s added just 20 000 new jobs the fewest in nearly a year and a half chris end videotape wallace mike thank you joining us now president trump aposs top white house economic advisor larry kudlow larry welcome back to fox news sunday larry kudlow white house chief economic adviser thank you wallace all right the president sends a new budget to congress tomorrow that will reportedly call for stiff domestic spending cuts in environmental programs transportation antipoverty programs at the same time that it aposs calling for a big increase in defense spending and you aposve still got those tax cuts why do that on the domestic side kudlow why not i mean if you want to deal with budget deficits you aposve got rapid growth which means keep the tax cuts in place we believe the 3 percent growth rate of 2018 will continue in 2019 and beyond 2020 and so forth i think the other element is always to limit spending and the president is proposing roughly a 5 percent across the board reduction in domestic spending accounts it will be a tough budget we are doing our own caps this year and i think it aposs long overdue some of these recent budgets have not been favorable toward spending so i think it aposs exactly the right prescription wallace all right you say that you aposre going to have a 5 percent domestic spending cuts on the other hand reportedly you aposre going to ask for another 8 6 billion from dhs homeland security and the pentagon to build a wall so there aposs going to be another budget fight over the wall kudlow well i suppose there will be i would just say that the whole issue of the wall and border security is of paramount importance we have a crisis down there i think the president has made that case very effectively it aposs a crisis of economics it aposs a crisis of crime and drugs it aposs a crisis of humanity we have to be much tougher and have more constructive immigration policy which we will be developing over a period of time so yes he aposs going to stay with us while and he aposs going to stay with the border security and i think it aposs essential wallace ok here aposs the problem with this you talk about balancing the budget and the way you aposre going to do it is by cutting 5 percent in all domestic spending but you know that if you take entitlements off the table that you just can apost get enough from domestic discretionary spending to cut the budget and your new budget is a case in point traditionally republican presidents have said we are going to balance the budget and the budget they projected out that it aposs going to balance the budget in ten years your new budget doesn apost balance the budget until 15 years until the 2030s and the question i have is you and i have known each other a long time when i covered you in the reagan years you cared and you thought that deficits and debt matter what happened kudlow not overwhelmingly so by the way during the reagan years look i don apost think i don apost think good growth policies have to obsess necessarily about the budget deficits and so forth look chris my view and i believe the view of the administration we are going to point a study guide path towards lower federal spending and federal borrowing as a share of the economy as a share of gdp that lowers the burden wallace the deficit increased by an enormous amount in the first few months of this fiscal year i think 70 percent kudlow we are going to run i think about 4 1 2 to percent of gdp that aposs a very modest number compared to even the recent past and with our wallace it could be close to a trillion dollars kudlow perhaps so but the economy is 20 trillion and net worth today household net worth is about 100 trillion so i don apost think that aposs a burden on the economy and i think all the incoming data look here aposs something let aposs go to the financial markets you have a 10 year treasury bond right now that aposs about 2 60 percent 2 63 i think at the close on friday if the markets were overwhelmingly worried about our budgets and our spending and our deficits you would see that interest rate rise and be a greater penalty i don apost see it right now and again long run we do want to reduce the burden of spending and borrowing absolutely but always as a share of gdp wallace ok kudlow i put that that aposs the same policies that aposs the same approach we had during the reagan years wallace ok let aposs talk about something the markets were worried about a friend and that aposs the fact that you got a bad jobs report and let aposs take a look at it only 20 000 jobs added in february the projection had been 180 000 jobs good news wages rose 3 4 percent which was the fastest in almost ten years question are we reaching reaching full employment weather just aren apost going to be that many people who want jobs because they already have jobs kudlow well let me say on that number on friday the payroll numbers from the establishment survey was only 20 000 a very fluky number it has a lot to do with the government shutdown and the timing of jobs wallace you didn apost say that when her 330 000 jobs a month before kudlow well we didn apost have the shutdown issue the month before wallace but my point is the number was the number and you kudlow and the household survey from which unemployment is derived 255 000 so that aposs a big home run the unemployment rate fell from 4 percent to 3 8 which is very very important you noted correctly wages are up 3 4 percent that aposs a terrific sign and what aposs happening as wages have been rising people are coming out moving back into the labor force they aposre now only coming off unemployment to work at the higher wage rates but they aposre actually sort of coming out of the woodwork people who were not part of the labor force are now coming back and i think is very important participation rates are very high and that aposs a signal that we still have lots of labor resources by the way the biggest category of improvement people coming back to work and supplying the labor women across the board and i think that aposs very wallace that was a great number this month the other concern is that after ten years of growth is the economy slowing down i want to put up some numbers on this growth in 2018 went from 4 2 percent in the second quarter you can see down in his third quarter and all the way down to 2 6 percent in the fourth quarter and with the economies in europe and china slowing there is a growing consensus among experts you aposre not going to make 2 percent for the first quarter this year do you agree with that that you aposre going to be in the ones for the first quarter of 2019 kudlow i aposm not going to score it just yet i aposll take the over on that forecast as i have as i generally do by the way wallace i was going to say kudlow i would just say as long as we keep our policies intact low tax rates for individuals and businesses across the board deregulation lighten the paperwork burden let small businesses breathe and get a good rate of return the president has ended the war on business the president has provided incentives for economic growth we aposve opened up the energy sector our policies are strong and i think the growth rates this coming year will exceed these estimates just as they had last year in 2018 wallace the fed says 2 3 percent this year you and the president say 3 percent growth as far as the eye can see kudlow yes wallace the fed says 2 3 percent kudlow but we aposll see we had this we had this conflict last year and the president was right the fed was wrong my colleague cea chair kevin hassett is strongly endorsing his forecast wallace the council of economic advisors kudlow indeed a good friend of mine and i aposm in kevin aposs camp and again the investment incentives are so strong that i think they aposre being underrated can i just get one number in wallace all right then i want to move to trade deficit kudlow yes sir productivity output per hour which is in a good market capitalist economy democrats take note productivity is the center of it ok one point eight percent increase in product i couldn apost help myself 1 8 percent increase in productivity that aposs the highest number in many years we aposve gone from zero to nearly 2 percent so i aposm going to argue growth and jobs will continue to expand wallace you also got some bad news this week on the trade deficit here aposs what president trump said last june begin video clip trump we have massive trade deficits with almost every country we will straighten that out and i aposll tell you what it aposs what i do it won apost even be hard end video clip wallace he says it won apost even be hard but despite his tough policies and tariffs the trade deficit in goods worldwide yet last year was 891 billion that aposs the biggest trade deficit worldwide in u s history and despite our trade war with china the deficit and goods there hit a record 419 billion some experts say the problem is if you just can apost tariff away deficits that the real issue is macro economics and to a degree what they aposre saying is that you are a victim of your own success the tax cuts gave people more disposable income they spent that buying more foreign goods rising interest rates strengthen the dollar that made u s exports more expensive in foreign countries made imports into this country u s imports cheaper and basically what they aposre saying is that the president has it backwards trade deficits are not the sign of a weak economy they aposre the part of the byproduct of a strong economy kudlow well a couple things first of all the president aposs trade former policies which in my judgment are succeeding better than anyone thought he aposs really talking about free fair and reciprocal trade among nations and we aposve accomplished the u s mca the so called nafta 2 0 we aposre getting closer we aposll make a lot of headway on the china trade deal perhaps we aposll talk about it in another minute we are negotiating with europe and we aposre talking and negotiating with japan so i think his trade policies are succeeding he aposs been tough and sometimes he will use tariffs something i aposve learned that will bring people to the table second point on a trade deficit per se chris i don apost think it aposs either good or bad ok your point is well taken you have incentives for investments and economic growth the u s is bound to have a trade deficit in goods with the rest of the world because we are growing much faster than they are growing and so we are buying more of their goods with respect to europe for example almost flat on its back near recession we are the only demand stimulus they have so that aposs yes on the other hand we have trade surplus on services and we have a surplus on net investment income coming into the usa wallace i got kudlow i don apost want to get too hung up on that it aposs neither good nor bad it just is but we have to have tough reciprocal trading policies with our neighbors wallace ok finally china as you predicted here is the president about in january about a trade deal with china and a much less optimistic assessment this week take a look begin video clip trump we aposre going to have a great trade deal with china if it all works out and we look forward to it it aposs going to be great for both countries yes i aposm confident but if we don apost make a very good deal for our country i wouldn apost make a deal if this isn apost a great deal i won apost make a deal end video clip wallace so let aposs look the chinese have reportedly removed a trip to mar a lago for a signing ceremony in march kudlow no you can apost cancel something that wasn apost scheduled that aposs not true wallace supposedly according to the reports that it aposs on xi aposs schedule and it aposs now been taken off number one number two the key enforcement issue enforcing what the chinese are going to represent ph has not been hammered out and three the chinese are reportedly concerned that if there is a summit with xi that the president if he doesn apost like the deal will walk away like he did with kim in vietnam simple question how much trouble is a trade deal with china in kudlow i think we aposre making great progress look as the president said across the board the deal has to be good for the united states and for our workers and our farmers and our manufacturers it aposs got to be good it aposs got to be fair and reciprocal and it has to be enforceable that aposs an important point secondly we made great headway when the chinese were here two weeks ago in the past week we aposve been in communications with them every day by teleconferencing and so forth working out some of the difficult final points i think that aposs where we are in the successful negotiations i don apost want to predict it aposs up to the president and not to me but i think the headway has been good this morning headline china has accepted our currency proposals to have stable currencies and transparent interventions wallace all right kudlow so that they won apost devalue wallace i aposm running out of time a simple question will there be a signing ceremony between the two leaders either in march or april kudlow i will play that from the optimistic side i will take the over on that which is with economic growth wallace over meaning kudlow over meaning good yes positive wallace ok sometime either this month or next kudlow bullish laughter wallace all right thank you thanks for your time it aposs always fun to talk to you kudlow but it has to be a good deal it has to be a good deal wallace and we aposll watch the roll out of the president aposs budget tomorrow thank you sir kudlow thanks chris i appreciate it up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss new accusations of lying to congress by former trump fixer michael cohen commercial break begin video clip trump michael cohen lied about the pardon that was a stone cold lie and he aposs lied about a lot of things but when he lied about the pardon that was really a lie end video clip wallace president trump on friday reacting to former fixer michael cohen aposs sworn testimony to congress he never sought a pardon for several crimes he pleaded guilty to committing and it aposs time now for our sunday group former speaker of the house newt gingrich who has a new podcast called newt aposs world columnist for the hill juan williams jonathan swan who covers the white house for axios and shelby holliday of the wall street journal well speaker gingrich let me start with you did michael cohen lie to congress when he said quote he never asked for a pardon for president trump and if he did what should congress do about it newt gingrich r former speaker of the house well chris first of all who knows i mean this guy has routinely lied he aposs been convicted of lying he probably lied his own lawyer said oh yes he did apply for a pardon but that was before i was his lawyer the lawyer who by the way is hillary clinton aposs close friend i mean cohen is just a circus and ok probably technically they ought to go after him on the grounds of perjury but this guy is pathetic he aposs already been convicted he aposs already going to go to jail i don apost know if you need an extra pound of flesh he aposs a fool he shouldn apost be on the national stage wallace ok strong letter to follow juan if cohen lied and i aposm going to be less equivocal about it than the speaker is it sure looked like he lied does it discredit everything else he said in those hours of testimony about donald trump juan williams political analyst no because he freely admits to having lied he pled guilty so this becomes a matter of documentation you don apost have to believe his words you can say the man is a liar but in black and white we have documentation in terms of checks with donald trump aposs ekg signature permanently displayed and we also have tape recordings and of course you can go with the american people the american people overwhelmingly say they believe cohen not trump in terms of the recent testimony and i think the reason for that is that they see him now as having turned and he has the information he was trump aposs fixer he aposs the inside guy and he aposs really subjected to tremendous pressure if it aposs found that he lied again wallace jonathan let me pick up on this because you aposve got good sources in the white house how upset are they about what michael cohen told the house oversight committee and the kind of breadcrumbs he laid out to further investigations jonathan swan national political reporter axios the thing that disturbs them the most is when he gives inside information about the trump organization and seems to lead investigators down the path so when he said didn apost pick up as much attention as other things he said but when alexandria ocasio cortez was questioning him at the end of the testimony and she said to your knowledge did the trump organization commit insurance fraud you know did they inflate assets and he said yes and he said you should talk to allen weisselberg and you know he names another executive he had no evidence of that by the way but you are now hearing that the house was going to look into this and followed his lead so that aposs the thing that irritates and the most just to pick up on juan aposs point the thing i found interesting about this before testimony this is his redemption hurry and he puts up a hand i aposm going to tell the truth there are two things as far as i can tell that he lied about there was the pardon and that aposs a trivial lie but i know for my own reporting he also lied about not wanting to join the white house he desperately wanted to do on the white house and was making a real effort for it so i just for the life of me can apost understand this was the redemption hearing and yes i agree with his documents you can prove it but anything that he says that aposs not supported by documentation documentary evidence and less is getting his tongue notarized i aposm not going to take it to the bank laughter wallace all right good line then there is another member of the trump camp at least former member his former campaign chairman paul manafort who this week was sentenced to 47 months in prison and here was the president aposs reaction to that begin video clip trump i feel very badly for paul manafort i think it aposs been a very very tough time for him but if you notice both his lawyer a highly respected man and a very highly respected judge the judge said there was no collusion with russia end video clip wallace now shelby we aposve got to correct that because the judge said that there was no that trial that he specifically heard was not about collusion with russia he didn apost give the president a clean bill of health when it came to collusion with russia and manafort faces another judge this week shelby holliday the wall street journal he faces another tough judge and she could sentence him to ten years that could be a concurrent sentence so he could be looking at a total of 14 years in prison a lot of the president aposs supporters want him to pardon paul manafort but i think it aposs worth looking back in 2016 we are talking about the president aposs campaign chairman at the time overseeing a convention in which one day an entire day was dedicated to the theme of law and order and president trump supporters love it they love it that he was a law and order candidate now fast forward to where we are today paul manafort has pleaded guilty or been convicted of crimes spanning more than a decade including bank fraud money laundering witness tampering conspiracy against the united states working here on behalf of a foreign power illegally wallace now the trump people would say but all of this happened before he got into the trump camp holliday they would say that but i do think to say that it aposs not collusion is like saying just because it aposs manslaughter doesn apost matter it wasn apost premeditated murder i mean collusion is a ten on the scale of 1 to 10 but he committed a vast array of crimes and i think when you i do think the president aposs supporters think it would be easy for them to pardon him i don apost think it would be as easy as a calculation wallace all right let me pick up with you jonathan on that do you think from what you hear that the president will at some point pardon paul manafort and as somebody i will say it with maybe the best sources in town when is the robert mueller report going to finally get released because we have had so many people report it aposs coming this way it aposs coming this weekend i actually i think maybe you stole a line from me i keep using the same line as larry kudlow take the over swan yes well i have to disappoint you on both scores chris i have no idea when the president will pardon paul manafort people close to a belief you certainly won apost do anything before the reelection so it would be second term if it happen as for the mueller report the trump lawyers don apost know when it aposs coming out the defense attorneys representing key witnesses don apost know when it aposs coming out they are all reading the same tea leaves that we are which is people who are working with mueller or going back to their old jobs the grand jury has been an active and no substantive questions are going to the white house so it aposs soon it aposs imminent but is it tomorrow is a three weeks i have no idea williams a better question might be will we ever see it even if it aposs released will bill barr the current attorney general release the report because he aposs under no obligation to do so and what does that mean then when we get an edited version in which we say well the presidents people say there aposs no collusion nothing happened except process crimes like lying and obstruction and they will try to spin this i think this is dangerous it should be released to the american people wallace speaker let me have you in the excitement with exactly that point because under the regulations the report is confidential it goes from mueller to barr the new attorney general bill barr and he decides what to release just as a matter of public policy do you think he should release as much as he can without giving up any gingrich exactly except for classification or people who are totally innocent but we had named in passing you ought to release the whole report i mean in the end this is the american people who aposve got to decide the american people ought to have complete access and there aposs no really good valid reason except for classification and in the case of some innocent people who just named in passing but in fact aren apost in any way involved wallace all right panel we have to take a break here up next we aposll ask democratic congresswoman katie hill vice chair of the house oversight committee whether michael cohen lied to that panel and about splits already in the new democratic house majority commercial break wallace coming up a new congresswoman aposs comments rock democratic leaders begin video clip sen chuck schumer d n y minority leader what congresswoman omar said i thought was wrong and hurtful end video clip wallace we aposll ask one of her house freshman colleagues how the rhetoric is distracting democrats next commercial break wallace this week house democrats struggled over how to deal with comments about support for israel made by congresswoman ilhan omar the controversy tested democrats apos unity and exposed divisions between the party aposs older and younger lawmakers joining us now california congresswoman katie hill a freshman liaison to house democratic leaders congresswoman welcome to fox news sunday rep katie hill d calif thanks for having me i aposm excited to be here wallace thank you house democrats as i say spent much of last week arguing about omar aposs comments about why people support israel and finally passing a resolution condemning not only anti semitism but all forms of hate and here was president trump aposs reaction begin video clip trump i thought yesterday aposs vote by the house was disgraceful because it aposs become the democrats have become an anti israel party they aposve become an anti jewish party end video clip wallace does the president have a point here given the fact that the whole debate was about omar aposs comments that seemed to question why some americans support israel and was viewed by some of your colleagues is anti semitic and yet the resolution that was finally passed doesn apost even mention her hill no i don apost think that there aposs any validity to what he aposs saying a first of all it was a completely bipartisan resolution all but 23 members of congress all the 23 that voted against it were all republican it was it was completely supported so it was something that you know if you aposre going to call if you aposre going call something you aposre going to call it something that aposs you know bigoted whether it aposs anti semitic or anything else then we should we should say that this all of this is unacceptable and that aposs what we did and that was that was really what the debate was about was you know if we aposre going to condemn one sort of behavior then you know why should we isolated it to one group we should we should condemn all forms wallace you say that you and you i should say that you come from a purple district in california and for 40 of the last 50 years has been represented by republicans so this is a very swing district you say that you came to washington not to engage in partisan bickering but to get things done but but i want to look briefly and we aposll move on at congresswoman omar and the degree to which she has distracted democrats first she said this about congressional support for israel it aposs all about the benjamins baby and she later questioned why it is ok for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country now she aposs gone after barack obama saying president trump aposs policies are bad but many of the people who came before him also had really bad policies they were just more polished than he was i know that democrats have passed some bills in the time you aposve you aposve been here you passed an a major election reform bill this week last week you passed a gun control bill but you aposve got to admit that there aposs your spending it aposs not just the media you guys are spending a lot of time having to deal with congresswoman omar and tlaib and ocasio cortez hill yes i think that we really want to stay focused on our agenda there aposs always going to be distractions we it aposs 435 people who are really their own boss they aposre able to say whatever they want in the world of social media it aposs something where you can apost control people aposs speech each person has their own priorities and their own opinions and we have elected a lot of strong strong willed and very opinionated people so i think what we have to figure out how to do is to say ok this isn apost the views of everybody in congress these are not the priorities of the entire caucus but how do we maintain focus on our agenda as a whole and you know demonstrate that this is not this is not indicative of of what our agenda is completely wallace all right you are a vice chair of the house oversight committee and here aposs what the chairman elijah cummings said at the start of the cohen hearing week before last begin video clip rep elijah cummings d md i said to mr cohen that if he came in here and lied i would nail him to the cross didn apost i did i tell you that michael cohen president trump aposs former attorney yes you yes you do more than once end video clip wallace in that hearing michael cohen made this categorical statement begin video clip cohen i have never asked for nor would i accept a pardon from president trump end video clip wallace but now cohen aposs lawyer lanny davis says this he cohen directed his attorney his prior attorney to explore possibilities of a pardon at one point with trump lawyer rudy giuliani as well as other lawyers advising president trump question did michael cohen lie to your committee and do you support referring cohen to the justice department for committing perjury hill so i i don apost know if he lied or not i think that this is mr cummings chairman cummings is incredibly deliberate i know that he aposs reviewing the entire testimony all the transcripts with mr jordan who is also is going to make sure that this that we get to the bottom of this to whatever extent it aposs possible wallace let me just ask how can you say you aposre not sure whether he lied he said i never asked for a pardon and his lawyer says he directed his lawyer to talk about a pardon hill yes again you know i don apost know how that went down exactly i don apost know if you know if lanny davis heard something look probably yes i would imagine that in the in you know the panic that was going on when you aposre about to go down right that you aposre going to say that yes we aposll figure out whatever you can do so probably and i and i imagine that that chairman cummings will end up referring him that aposs just my just my guess when he says when chairman cummings says something like i aposm going to nail you to the cross he means it i mean i aposve seen him in action and he aposs he is not going to to let this go so yes wallace the house judiciary committee not your committee the judiciary committee sent documents last week document requests last week to 81 people and entities asking for information about everything from hush money payments to potential insurance fraud as someone who says that you didn apost come to washington for partisan bickering as i just pointed out one is this a fishing expedition when you aposre sending information on all these things to 81 different people and entities and again aren apost you almost ensuring that the next year two years are going to be involved with these hearings that don apost actually i mean i understand oversight but that don apost get things done for the american people hill well i think that we aposre capable of working on many things at once the issue is that for two years congress didn apost perform oversight of the executive branch and we aposre constitutionally mandated to do so so the republicans while they were in charge simply just didn apost do it and despite the fact that we saw so many red flags of different different crimes that could have been committed different issues that we really needed to be providing oversight on and they just simply pushed it under the rug they didn apost do any kind of investigations whereas under the obama administration just under for the tax for the irs investigation 1 3 million documents were provided 1 3 million and that was under republican request and the white house they cooperated so i think it aposs really disingenuous to say oh 81 were requested and this is some big deal this is just total partisanship it aposs not true it aposs that we have to make up for two years of a lack of investigation and a lack of oversight wallace as you sit here right now do you feel that you have seen hard evidence that donald trump either in the campaign or as president committed a crime and if so a crime that rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors for impeachment hill i believe that i have seen enough that makes me feel like we need to continue down this path i don apost feel like there is enough of i feel like impeachment is as much of a political process as it is anything else and i think that we have to make sure that we are providing all of the information airing it all out so that the public can feel with as much certainty as as you know members of congress that that that aposs the case and that we need to continue down this path so i i really think that this is about getting to the truth about showing it to the american people and then we go from there but at the end of the day if if people you know the citizens of the united states don apost believe that it has risen to that level then we can apost go anywhere so so really it aposs about exposing the truth and it aposs about getting to the bottom of this and it aposs about asking the questions of is this the kind of government is this the kind of leadership that we want to see is this ok is this the kind of state that we want to leave our democracy and to our to our children and and right now i just don apost believe that it is that aposs why i ran for congress that aposs why so many of my colleagues ran for congress and i frankly think that that aposs why we were elected wallace finally i got about a minute left in case you haven apost noticed you aposre on fox news right here hill i am wallace as you well know this week the dnc chair tom perez announced that they are not going to give any of the 12 scheduled democratic primary debates over the next year to fox news what do you think of that decision hill well i think it aposs the democratic primary and i think we know that there are basically no democrats who watch fox news so to me that aposs pretty fair wallace that aposs not true actually hill well wallace i mean hill i don apost know any wallace there are a lot of democrats that watch fox news and a lot of independents who watch fox news hill certainly independents yes but most mostly there aposs it aposs become more and more partisan and that aposs unfortunate i aposm here because i do represent a purple district and it aposs turning out that more and more of my clothes are purple i don apost know what happened with that but but a you know i think that i think that there is not a feeling right now that there aposs a lack of bias and i aposm hoping that we can change that i feel like you aposre treating me with without bias and i appreciate that and i think that this is something that we have to change you know i personally don apost think it helps when we aposre saying we aposre not going to have any of the debates on fox news i can apost i don apost know how much of that was driven by the candidates how much of it was driven by the party you know i aposd i aposd like to see all of that change i want to see the media become as unbiased as possible but you know i don apost know that we aposre in that state right now which is really unfortunate wallace congresswoman hill thank you hill thank you i appreciate you having me wallace thanks for coming in today please come back hill absolutely thanks so much wallace you aposre always welcome on fox news hill i will come back wallace good up next the democratic national committee announces it will bar fox news from hosting any of the 2020 presidential debates what would you like to ask the panel about that decision just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip tom perez chairman democratic national committee i do not have the confidence that we need to take such an important part of the nomination process these debates and and trust them to folks who at the top levels are consulting donald trump before they do anything end video clip wallace well that aposs dnc chair tom perez making it official fox news is out excluded from hosting any of the 12 democratic primary debates over the next year and we aposre back now with the panel well as i was preparing for this panel jonathan i realize you aposre the only one here who has no ties either to fox news or to the murdoch aposs so i aposm going to let you start jonathan swan national political reporter axios rupert aposs australian though so wallace yes it aposs and you aposre both australian right swan yes sir wallace so here aposs the question what do you think of the dnc move both as practical politics and on the merit and i i seriously say what you think don apost worry about hurting our feelings swan sure well i wasn apost surprised by it it showed to me that he i mean i expected that he might do something like this wallace he tom perez swan tom perez the dnc chairman we aposve seen since the 2016 election the democratic activist and the primary voters it aposs not just fox they aposve rail against they aposve rail against the new york times for publishing the hillary e mails they blamed you know i see some of my competitors at the new york times getting blamed for donald trump this day we saw the backlash when cnn hired sarah iska florez ph from the justice department they aposve now changed her role so the decision didn apost surprise me what i thought was disingenuous was his explanation he said you know we wanted to see if we could expand the you know we want to reach out to all voters and then he said but you know this new yorker story came out that changed everything the idea that it was a secret that there are certain anchors on your network sean hannity would be one that i name that are very very close to the president and that you could say you know he went on stage at a rally you could say he aposs an extension the administration this was not changed there were no material facts in that new yorker story that changed anything we already knew and sean hannity aposs not moderating the debate so to me it was just a political decision that he made to satisfy his activists wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on the dnc decision to exclude fox from any of the debates we got this on twitter from royce van blaricome what message should this sent to the public at large when the number one leading news network by far for quite some time is denied a debate by an entire political party because that party believes it cannot be treated fairly by that network what does that say and speak to juan a pretty good question what aposs your answer juan williams political analyst well i think that the what we have to deal with is we aposre living in a time when the people who are trump supporters tend to watch fox people who are antagonist towards the president tend to watch cnn or msnbc the audiences are divided i think the base the democratic base wants nothing to do with fox because of the strident pro trump voices in the prime time hour but you know i aposm going to answer this very personally chris and i think you could as well i aposm a democrat and i worked at fox for 23 years i think nobody tells me what to say here i think it aposs very important that democrats penetrate the bubble if you will on the right and speak truth as well as it can be spoken i think the debate to pick up on jonathan aposs point would be moderated by real journalists i aposm not you aposre my friend but i aposm not saying this because you aposre my friend i think you aposre a real journalist i think martha maccallum dana perino i think i aposm a real journalist bret baier those are real people who i think would conduct a fair debate newt gingrich who aposs sitting here with me newt gingrich and i have been in a fox debate and newt has attacked me and i aposve gone at newt i think that it aposs you can do this but keep in mind fox is the most watched cable channel so we aposre going to reach a lot of independent what i call reagan democrats in the rust belt who i think might respond to the democratic message and i think it aposs going to be very important wallace let me let me pick up on that with you speaker gingrich as a matter of practical politics is did tom perez the dnc chair make a smart move if only because he is bowing to the will of a large and perhaps the most vocal part of his base newt gingrich former house speaker let me just point out even though i used to work for fox before i ran i got hammered by both you guys in debates so i think i wallace do we really want to go back to ames iowa and how you went after me gingrich no no no no no i aposm just saying i can i can attest that you guys will be professional and will go after any weakness in either party but but the bigger issue here is here aposs the number one cable news channel so its reach is bigger than the others and if you want to be competitive let aposs take some examples wisconsin michigan ohio pennsylvania and you don apost want to be on fox you aposre just giving you can only go so far with with the blue states on the coast on msnbc and cnn i think it aposs a major mistake to say we aposre now going to shrink as a party because we aposre afraid to be on fox and that aposs what he said shelby holliday the wall street journal well i wallace all right let me i aposm going to switch shelby to another subject holliday all right wallace i sort of like enough about us now now what about me i want to turn to the controversy over congresswoman omar this week and her statements about why people in this country and particularly people members of congress support israel this consumed a lot of oxygen on capitol hill this week take a look begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif house speaker i feel confident that her words were not based on any anti semitic attitude but that she didn apost have a full appreciation of how they landed on other people where this these words have a history sen mitch mcconnell r ky majority leader support for israel isn apost about the benjamins it aposs about the hearts and minds of the american people end video clip wallace i asked congresswoman hill about this how disruptive do you think this fight with omar with tlaib with ocasio cortez how disruptive is it for house democrats holliday it was a major distraction for them certainly heard a lot of not just nancy pelosi but i heard a lot of democratic candidates for president asked about this on the campaign trail these are not questions they want to be answering at this point democrats wanted to focus on their big campaign finance reform bill this week they didn apost have an opportunity to do that it sucked all of the oxygen out of the room but i also think at the end of the day when this bill passed or when this resolution passed and it condemned all hate that may have been a mistake because it allowed congresswoman omar to claim victory she went out on twitter and said this is a great day islamophobia has been condemned this was a great step this was great progress and at the end of the day the resolution seemed to backfire a little bit because what they wanted to condemn was ultimately celebrated by the person who made those comments wallace speaker gingrich we aposve got about a minute left you were in this job as speaker did you have times i was trying to remember when you were speaker where you had members that would go off on their own and would destruct disrupt or gingrich well sure yes occasionally occasionally you didn apost and occasionally you tried to handle it but what what wallace and how did you deal with them gingrich well not always successfully i mean i mean individually elected members who are willing to be tough have access to the media they can be important in their own way we aposre in a we aposre in a different era than the sam rayburn era but what i what i will say what inaudible this week not just on this but a whole range of issues is that you have in the three top democrats people who are grandparents and so these folks are all almost 80 years old and now you have people in their 20s coming and and looking around and going wait you aposre the people who failed and i think pelosi aposs going to have a very hard time getting moral authority over her younger members wallace thank you panel see you next sunday i don apost know she seems these those leaders seem young and vigorous to me up next our power player of the week iron man cal ripken on the challenge of living up to the family legacy commercial break wallace i had a special experience this week i want to share with you begin videotape wallace voice over i did a fundraising event at st john aposs college in annapolis a liberal arts school that has taught the great book since 1696 it was a conversation with cal ripken baseball aposs iron man who broke lou gehrig aposs record for consecutive games played our discussion turned to one of the few things the hall of famer and i have in common we both went into our dad aposs business cal sr was a minor league coach who eventually managed his son for the baltimore orioles and cal aposs son ryan now plays for the orioles in the minors cal ripken jr baseball hall of famer i chose to go into the same business as as my dad and i know that my son chose to go into the same business as me and i think he aposs got it really really bad what were some of the challenges that you had to deal with by having the last name wallace wallace well it is you know it aposs hard to say that it aposs a problem but it is a problem i mean it aposs a nice problem in the sense that you aposre exposed to the business on the other hand you labor and i maybe i had this more than you i think maybe in a sense i aposm more like ryan than you were ripken right wallace because my father was a superstar and you know sometimes people call you mike instead of chris and that kind of or whatever and and and at one point i mean i i certainly dealt with it and at one point and it was well into my career i remember saying to myself you know what you aposre probably never going to be mike wallace but neither is anybody else and from that minute on i was ok with it ripken my son and i aposve tried to i can apost protect him from the last name the expectations have been great you know his whole time when he was 12 years old i aposd go to a tournament in minnesota and i aposd go over there to watch him and i aposm just sitting in the stands watching him play baseball and all the other kids from the other fields come up and then they you can hear them they go ok which one is he you know and then so he aposll go out there and he aposll pop up or do something else and they aposll go he aposs not that good and then they aposll kind of walk away so there was this feeling that happened all the time and so the hard part was i aposm trying to say be you don apost don apost be me you know don apost try to be me you aposre a big tall left handed hitting first baseman you have a certain set of skills but i aposm trying to get that point across to him but it doesn apost resonate and so that aposs why i aposm really interested how did you just turn the screw and say ok i aposm not i aposll just be me wallace thirty years of therapy no no that aposs not true you match yourself against an impossible standard if you sit there and say well am i going to be as good as cal ripken or am i going to be as good as mike wallace and you know as you say part of it is just live your life but part of it is also to realize the standard which you aposre comparing yourself to is alm
