 havingevidently failed to help recruit a serious third party challenger to theextraordinarily weak trump hillary dichotomy former gop nominee mitt romney isfacing increasingpressure totake the plunge himself click through and read those pieces and you ll find cogent earnestsupplications from conservatives who are horrified by trump and whose interest is piquedby a recent raft ofpolling data suggesting that the votingpublic may be ripe for a mainstream independent presidential bid we ll take a look at some of that data shortly but let s start with some hard reality a control f search for the word deadline within those three hyperlinkedanalyses turns up a sum total of zero references here s whythat omission matters i understand that the nevertrump third party theory rests on the idea that a romneyesque figure could peel off just enough electoral votes to deny both trump and clinton the270 electoral votes required to secure the presidency according to the constitution this scenario would send the decision into the republican held house of representatives so the texas deadline expiring isn t a deal breaker theoretically becausethe goal would be for anindependent ticket to carry say a handful of states in the midwest and mountain west as implausible as this scheme may sound and it sounds exceedingly implausible it s not technically impossible especially when you take a gander atnumbers like this hypothetical three way race if romney were to jump in pic twitter com jbtz1jzevf and amongindependent voters romney virtually ties hillary among independents with trump leading the demo pic twitter com n5hxjs9tko these data points come to us via the washington post abc news surveywe wrote about yesterday which also found that a sizable 44 percent contingent of registered voters would consider a third party candidate for what it s worth nbc wsj asked the same question with nearly the same result romney who enjoys strong name recognition based on the last campaign is already well above the polling threshold required to secure a spot in the general election presidential debates libertarian gary johnson and hiswould be running mate havecracked double digits in another poll wapo s hypothetical three way pollonce again demonstrates how weak and disliked hillary clinton is trump and romney s combined backing wouldsurpass her level of supportby 20 points yet splitting the anti clinton vote seriouslyrisks allowing her to win the presidency with a small plurality of the popular vote that s why the republican party iscircling the wagons including capitulations fromevenstaunch trump resisters like sen lindsey graham still given the public s longstanding anddeep seated antipathy toward both trump and clinton it s not hard to see why a guy like romney might be tempted to jump in with a splash make a focused appeal to voters and see what happens he could probably convincingly present himself as a center right politician with whom many voters might have disagreements but who is nevertheless qualified dignified and neither a reckless ignorant demagogue nor aserially deceitfulcrook not a terrible pitch but while some right leaning trump criticsmight leap at the opportunity to cast a ballot for romney over the other two alternatives a credible case that he could actually prevail remains elusive worse the reasonable fear that he d guarantee a hillary presidency is likely toworry even those who arestrongly sympathetic to his cause elections have been held a decisive plurality of gop voters have spoken and avast majority of the party appears to be reconciling itself to the resulting determination principled holdouts will still have other options in november e g the aforementioned johnson weld duo but tossing another non democrat option into the fray really doesfeel like an assist to clinton at this stage on a personal level trumpismdoes not represent me in virtually any way and i plan to cast a ballot against both trump and clinton in november but it s simply a fact that for better or worse therepublican party is the only viable vehicle for defeating the left in modern american politics and the republican party s voters have seen fit to make donald trump their standard bearer this year my inclination is that it s time to allow trumpism to sink or swim on its own as enticing as a romney gambit might be for those of us who cannot fully make peace with trump as the nominee why hand trump s hardcore base a ready made excuse if he loses and why do anything to actively assisthillary clinton however for a window into why nevertrump efforts nevertheless persist in some righty quarters i ll leave you with further evidence that both major party nominees are deeply invested in thesamesordid system andshare many of the
