media watchdog brent bozell strategist ginni thomas tea party maven jenny beth martin longtime political guru richard viguerie and 30 other conservative leaders formally advised the president that former virginia attorney general ken cuccinelli is the ideal choice he s perfect to carry out trump s agenda at dhs he has synergy with trump as a no nonsense immigration hawk like trump cuccinelli is a strong law and order republican yet both showed wisdom leading the charge to pass and enact the bipartisan landmark criminal justice reform bill mr viguerie wrote in an op ed for the hill cuccinelli has the ability to clearly articulate conservative positions even in a liberal dominated television environment as a cnn analyst cuccinelli was always outnumbered but he never backed off articulating the principled conservative side of things he knows how to run an agency and carry out policy as a superb constitutional attorney cuccinelli easily articulates the bases of the correct positions on

media establishments but that is particularly why cuccinelli is a perfect fit for trump both understand the value and importance of being disruptors and both are seen as threats to the swamp it s part of their charm mr viguerie noted forget the trigger warnings they are a favored form of virtue signaling among college professors and feminists who insist certain images or statements should be accompanied by a cautionary statement trigger warnings that alert people to potentially sensitive content are increasingly popular especially on college campuses but research suggests that they have minimal impact on how people actually respond to content our findings suggest that these warnings though well intended are not helpful says mevagh sanson a psychology scholar at victoria university of wellington new zealand it s possible that they function the way they re meant to helping people to manage their emotional responses and reduce their symptoms of distress but it s also possible trigger warnings could have the opposite effect influencing people s expectations and experiences in ways that exacerbate their distress notes ms sanson who gauged reactions of 1 394 people exposed to test trigger warnings their repeated use encourages people to avoid negative material and we already know that avoidance helps to maintain disorders such as ptsd trigger warnings might also communicate to people that they re fragile and coax them to interpret ordinary emotional responses as extraordinary signals of danger says ms sanson whose research was published in clinical psychological science
