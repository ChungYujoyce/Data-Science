opportunity for the american people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves but also to learn firsthand about the facts of the president aposs misconduct donald trump president they aposve gone out of their way to find the people that hate president trump the most wallace after weeks of closed door testimony lawmakers will question witnesses in public about whether the president abused his office to get oppo research from ukraine we aposll ask two members of the committee leading inquiry republican will hurd a moderate whose actions will be watched closely by other members of his party and democrat sean patrick maloney then former new york city mayor and billionaire businessman michael bloomberg weighs a late entry into the democratic race for president trump he aposs not going to do well but i think he aposs going to hurt biden actually little michael will fail wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel how bloomberg aposs possible move could reshape the democratic campaign and our power player of the week the iconic horse drawn caisson performing a solemn duty honoring our nation aposs fallen veterans all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington the house democratic effort to impeach president trump moves into a key new phase this week public hearings in which career government officials will testify on camera about how president trump pressured ukraine to investigate his political rivals the big question will this change the dynamic of the inquiry that so far has remained strictly partisan in a moment we aposll speak with two members of the house intelligence committee that will hold the made for tv hearings republican will hurd and democrat sean patrick maloney but first let aposs bring in ellison barber who has the latest from the white house ellison ellison barber correspondent chris one of the first witnesses we expect to hear from this week is a career diplomat who testified behind closed doors it was his understanding that everything military aid and an oval office visit was contingent on ukraine investigating the bidens in 2016 begin videotape barber the 45th president cheered at the game of the century hours before the start of the week that could turn his political future upside down three public hearings are set to take place on two different dates on wednesday the house intelligence committee will hear from a top u s diplomat in ukraine and a top state department official on friday the former ambassador to ukraine house democrats released their closed door testimonies this week william taylor aposs arguably the most explosive the career the diplomat testified it was his clear understanding security assistance money would not come until the president of ukraine committed to pursue the investigations president trump wanted president trump continues to call the inquiry trump the witch hunt continues barber but claims his party is on the same page trump the republicans have never been so united barber congressional republicans want to hear from at least 14 witnesses including former vice president joe biden aposs son hunter and the whistle blower whose complaint help initiate the impeachment inquiry chairman adam schiff responding with a warning the committee will not serve as vehicles to carry out sham investigations into the bidens or debunked conspiracies about 2016 end videotape barber rules approved by the house essentially give democrats veto power here it witnesses must be approved by the chairman of the intelligence committee or the full committee chris wallace ellison barber reporting from the white house ellison thank you barber you bet wallace joining me now congressman will hurd a republican member of the house intel committee that will conduct those public hearings this week congressman hurd the top republican on house intel devin nunes says that he would like to call the whistle blower the unnamed whistle blower to testify in public in these hearings and here aposs what president trump has to say about the whistle blower begin video clip donald trump president the whistle blower is a disgrace to our country a disgrace and the whistle blower because of that should be revealed end video clip wallace now the whistle blower reportedly works for the cia where you worked for almost a decade should his identity be revealed should be he called to testify in public rep will hurd r tx i think we should be protecting the identity of the whistle blower i aposve said that from the very beginning because how we treat this whistle blower will impact whistle blowers in the future having this whistle blower law on the books is important it aposs an important checks and balance not only in the intelligence committee but our government but what i do would like to see happen is for adam schiff chairman schiff the chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence to answer questions about what was his engagement with the whistle blower before the information his ph the whistle blower aposs allegations were transmitted to the to congress he has misled the american public earlier in the year on what he knew about or the contact that he had with the whistle blower so if you want to protect the identity of the whistle blower i think it aposs important for chairman schiff to answer questions about his interactions with them ph wallace what to think about as the republicans are seeking calling hunter biden the vice president the former vice president aposs son as a witness hurd i would love to hear from hunter biden i would love to hear from other americans that served on the board of burisma i aposm curious to know of someone who doesn apost have any experience in ukraine nor experience in a natural gas company becomes ph on the board of a natural gas company in ukraine you know this is we also need to hear and understand the corruption we know corruption in the ukraine is an issue and ambassador taylor has said that in his testimony dr hill has said that in her testimony this is something that was a concern even in this current new administration in ukraine so hearing from people that can help provide insights into that since that is you know central to this conversation would be would be valuable wallace now congressman schiff responded last night to the gop witness list that had been offered by chairman nunes and here aposs what schiff said the intel committee will not be used quote to carry out the same sham investigations into the bidens and 2016 that the president wanted ukraine to conduct given that response congressman hurd what does that say about the fairness of a process that the democrats are running and holding these hearings hurd unfortunately chris this has been a partisan exercise from the very beginning when one piece of information comes people that don apost like the president say oh this is an example for impeachment people that support the president say this is a you know evidence of an exoneration i think we should just turn over every rock and pursue every lead to ultimately get to the truth and it aposs unfortunate that the democrats on the committee and the democrats in the house have created this partisan exercise in a normal hearing the minority the folks that are not in power have the ability to offer a witness we can apost do that in this case under previous impeachment inquiries the minority and the president has had the opportunity to call witnesses be involved you the majority of the house permanent select committee on intelligence and chairman schiff has prevented some of the lawyers for the administration to come in and be there with the folks that were that were testifying that aposs not a fair process if we aposre interested in trying to uncover the truth then let aposs not let aposs not put our thumb on the scale but unfortunately that aposs what this process has been and what aposs even crazier is there trying to have this completed by the end of the year and i think we only have 16 or 17 legislative days left in the year half of those days are what aposs called fly in fly out days where people are coming in from their location so to try to get that try to pass nafta to fund the government to try to do all that in that short period of time i think that aposs next to impossible wallace you you talk about the extreme partisanship maybe on both sides republicans and democrats you are not while you aposre supportive of the president you are not a party line supportive you oppose some of his policies for instance constructing the border wall you aposve opposed and have spoken out against some of his language during his time in office for you what specifically do you want to learn from these hearings hurd so i think talk about impeachment has been premature i think impeachment is one of the most important and consequential things a member of congress can do and i think there aposs 535 different opinions on what impeachment is to evaluate to evaluate that question i think it aposs a violation of the law so i want to see does this establish a criminal intent and yes for me i agree when i agree i disagree when i disagree and having spent nine and a half years as an undercover officer in the cia i was a guy in the back alleys collecting intelligence i also did this to embassies i know how embassies work and the fact that ukrainian officials weren apost contacting their u s counterparts until august 29th when they read in i believe it was a political article about aid being withheld that was the first time that any ukrainian had contacted a state department or government official about this that was more than a month after the july 25th phone call between the president and president zelensky wallace so crosstalk hurd what do i want to see wallace go ahead sir hurd go ahead chris wallace no you go ahead hurd what what i want to see is their inability to establish criminal intent do the ukrainians know that this you know this was some kind of a quid pro quo you know when you look at our relationship between the u s and ukraine over the last three years there aposs been no more aid going to ukraine this year than in this administration than the previous administration ukraine is an important partner wallace let me ask you specifically though about this because there seem to be two issues that were part of the quid pro quo one was military aid one was the meeting that the ukrainians very much wanted between their president zelensky and president trump all three of the witnesses that are going to testify this week you see them up there william taylor george kent marie yovanovitch all career foreign service officers said there was a clear connection between support for ukraine at various forms of the u s support for ukraine and ukraine investigating the democrats if you are satisfied that that is true that there was this connection this nexus is that an impeachable offense hurd well i don apost know if it was necessarily investigate the democrats right i think it was investigation of corruption and so people have made assumption of what is wallace forgive me sir but specifically hurd sure wallace what president trump said on that july 25th phone call was investigate the democratic role in the 2016 election whether they were involved in hacking the dnc server and also specifically the bidens and burisma hurd well on the 2016 elections now some of that information was based on what has been kind of fringe thinking but back when even democrats start investigating the russian involvement on 2016 elections there was a ukraine nexus and so trying to get to the bottom of that is that a violation of the law now was that an understanding based on debunked information yes but is that a violation of the law i don apost think so you mentioned of the bidens crosstalk wallace but specifically sir the question is if there was a quid pro quo u s aid for ukraine was going to depend on their doing these investigations of political rivals of the president is that an impeachable offense hurd i think if you aposre trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign is not something a president or any official should be doing i think everybody has most republicans have said that that would be a violation of the law wallace so that in your view if that were established to your satisfaction if i repeat that would be an impeachable offense hurd i believe that aposs something that would make it make it have to truly consider whether impeachment is the right tool or not wallace and we will see what happens this week and whether or not it persuades you congressman hurd thank you so much thanks for your time good to talk with you sir hurd thank you chris wallace up next we aposll get reaction from a democrat on the intelligence committee about what some say is his party aposs timetable to impeach the president before the end of the year commercial break wallace house republicans have complained for weeks about democrats interviewing key witnesses in the impeachment probe behind closed doors well now the public hearings are about to start the gop is still complaining let aposs bring in congressman sean patrick maloney of new york a democrat on the intelligence committee congressman as i discussed with congressman hurd republicans have now put out their written list of witnesses it includes hunter biden the unnamed whistle blower and nellie ohr who folks may remember she worked for fusion gps which sought information from sources in ukraine in 2016 and put up the steele dossier will democrats agree to call any of these witnesses and if you don apost what does that say about the fairness of this entire proceeding rep sean patrick maloney d n y well i can apost speak for the chairman but what i can tell you is that i think we will end up calling some of the witnesses on that list and here aposs my test my test is do these witnesses have important information knowledge or evidence about the president aposs conduct and if it passes that test then we should call them sure wallace so let aposs ask specifically hunter biden nellie ohr the unnamed whistle blower do any of them pass that test and therefore should be called maloney the first two no the third one you aposve just heard congressman hurd give a very eloquent explanation of why we don apost force the revelation of a whistle blower aposs identity so no in all three cases but for different reasons wallace well i mean let aposs let aposs focus on hunter biden hunter biden is at the center of this there are allegations of corruption you know there certainly are questions why a fellow named hunter biden would get a big job in ukraine when his father was then the vice president and conducting relations with ukraine isn apost that a fair person to talk to maloney well let me ask you mr wallace what information mr biden hunter biden a private citizen who was broke no laws by serving on the board of directors would have about the president aposs withholding of military aid to ukraine in other words he has no knowledge of what the president did or didn apost do here that is the subject of the impeachment inquiry there are certainly questions of course and many people have asked them but it aposs not relevant to this week aposs hearings wallace so you know i don apost have the list right in front of me but you obviously saw it you aposre a member of the committee which member of the republican potential witnesses would you agree to call maloney again there are witnesses on the republican list who have been interviewed in depositions already and of course those transcripts are going to be released fully and so i would expect the witnesses who have been interviewed because they have material information would be likely called in public but again those are not crosstalk wallace for instance kurt volker who was a special emissary to ukraine maloney mr volker testified for the committee so did mr morrison those witnesses are on the list mr hale is similarly a witness who aposs been interviewed is on the list those are the witnesses i have in mind but again this is not my decision i can apost speak for the chairman but those witnesses do have material information about the president aposs conduct in this case that aposs the proper focus of this inquiry and if i could just say chris you know i hope your viewers will keep an open mind you know this is veterans day weekend god bless all who serve and where the country aposs uniform as my dad did as my grandfather did you know these are also military veterans ambassador taylor was an infantry officer with 101st airborne division in vietnam served in combat wallace right maloney west point graduate lieutenant colonel vindman earned a purple heart in iraq these are these are veterans and credible witnesses i hope people will keep an open mind and hear their testimony unfiltered and read the transcript by all means they are all coming out in public wallace all right let aposs talk about another apparently non witness at this point and that his national security advisor former national security advisor john bolton here is what his lawyer wrote this week to the committee bolton was involved according to his lawyer in many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far continuing the quote if the house chooses not to pursue through subpoena the testimony of ambassador bolton let the record be clear that is the house aposs decision isn apost congressman isn apost john bolton perhaps the best witness other than the president as to what was going on inside the oval office and why on earth wouldn apost you wait to see what he has to say maloney we have we have invited ambassador bolton to appear and that sounds like a nervous lawyer to me because they are they are refusing to honor a legal request to provide relevant testimony wallace wait wait wait maloney excuse me crosstalk wallace wait a minute let me just wait a minute but the point is he has gone to a judge and said you tell us i got an order from the white house i got an order from congress you tell me what to do maloney right mr wallace that aposs not how it works you show up and you respond to a subpoena or you go to a judge and get it quashed or you show up and you invoke a legitimate privilege and refused to answer a particular question it is unprecedented to say you congress go to a judge and tell me to appear that aposs not how it works and ambassador bolton is a better lawyer than that he knows that personally wallace wait that isn apost what they aposre doing they aposre not saying congress go to the judge they are going to the judge that aposs what they did with charles kupperman another one of the clients who was an assistant to a deputy to bolton and bolton they are going to the judge and they aposre saying judge we aposve got these competing claims you tell us what to do they aposre not asking the house to do anything maloney mr wallace i agree with you that he has important information and we would love to hear from ambassador bolton i think the public deserves to hear from ambassador bolton who remember call this a drug deal and wanted nothing to do with it who instructed his subordinates to report this conversations to the lawyers at the white house because he knew they were improper ambassador bolton does have important information i don apost understand why the white house has instructed him not to cooperate you should ask them wallace yes i guess what i aposm saying is this is an impeachment this isn apost just oversight this is the potential impeachment of the president of the united states there is going to be a court hearing in early december charles kupperman the deputy to bolton and bolton now would be part of that suit why not wait we aposre talking about a month exactly a month to find out what a judge says why wouldn apost when you aposre talking about the impeachment of the president why wouldn apost the house intelligence committee be willing to wait to find out such key evidence maloney again we would love to have mr bolton aposs evidence there aposs nothing preventing him from giving it but remember oh and by the way any notion that that aposs going to be favorable to the president i think is debunked by everything in the public domain already ambassador bolton called this a drug deal i aposm not sure the president will want to hear from ambassador bolton but we sure do but here aposs the point the point is do we have sufficient evidence from credible witnesses that we aposre going to present in public testimony to move forward with an inquiry which may result in a referral to the senate where there will be a trial where witnesses like ambassador bolton will have an opportunity again to provide the information they know i encourage them to do it now i encourage them to do it then and i don apost think it will be favorable to the president it is ambassador bolton who saw clearly how abusive and inappropriate the president aposs conduct was wallace you know he aposs not going to be testify because you guys have a timetable that you want to get this done by the end of the year let me ask you a couple questions to finish this up president trump now says that he is going to release the transcript of a phone call not the july 25th a phone call that we aposve already seen but an earlier phone call in april just after president zelensky was inaugurated between the two presidents what value does not transcript have for your committee and your investigation maloney well i don apost know of any evidence that would be relevant from the first phone call except that it was a routine phone call to congratulate the president if the president wants to release it that aposs fine i don apost think it aposs relevant to this investigation wallace let aposs turn to the public hearings this week you aposve got three witnesses testifying we aposve already seen the transcripts of their interviews people know what they aposre going to say is the argument that you aposre basically people are going to read the book but they aposre going to see the movie because that didn apost work out very well in the robert mueller testimony maloney well mr wallace the point is that the republicans have been demanding for weeks that the public be able to see this testimony so you know they should take yes for an answer i think it aposs very important that the public be able to judge for itself and i really encourage your viewers to just watch the hearings read the transcripts or watch it live and make up your own minds you won apost have any filter you won apost have the press or politicians in the way you aposll have witnesses giving opening statements and these are military veterans these are career nonpartisan civil servants the first witness ambassador bill taylor crosstalk maloney excuse me is an appointee of a republican president who serve this country in the military i think we should give him a chance crosstalk wallace sir you aposve already made that point and i would like to get i aposm running out of time i aposd like to get one last question in if i might here aposs what president trump says about all those witnesses take a look begin video clip trump the testimony has all been fine i mean for the most part i never even heard of these people i have no idea who they are it seems that nobody has any first hand knowledge there is no firsthand knowledge end video clip wallace the president does have a point none of these officials actually talked to the president when we think back to john dean with richard nixon he took us into the oval office he told what he told the president and what the president told him as the president says all of the information we aposre going to hear this week is secondhand is that enough to impeach a president maloney well mr wallace if you aposre talking about this week but of course there witnesses like ambassador sondland who spoke directly to the president there are other witnesses who have refused to cooperate by the way the state department has refused to produce all the notes and corroborating evidence but there are absolutely direct witnesses to the president aposs phone call lieutenant colonel vindman was on the call and went immediately to the embassy legal department because he knew it was wrong what he heard that aposs a military veteran there are a lot of people with direct knowledge and it aposs honestly if i can say it is heartbreaking to hear the president any american president deride an important process where reliable witnesses are giving information it aposs also heartbreaking to realize once you see this evidence that any american president would engage in misconduct you know it gives me no pleasure to tell you the american president has abused his office and he should be accountable wallace well as you say people are going to get to see for themselves this week congressman maloney thank you thanks for joining us and of course fox news will cover the hearings this week live maloney thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss whether anything will change now that the public will hear from these witnesses themselves commercial break wallace coming up democratic front runner joe biden reacts to michael bloomberg looking at a run for the white house begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate in terms of he aposs running because of me the last polls i looked at i aposm pretty far ahead end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel how a bloomberg campaign would shake up the democratic race that aposs next commercial break begin video clip rep adam schiff d calif those open hearings will be an opportunity for the american people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves but also to learn firsthand about the facts of the president aposs misconduct rep mark meadows r n c as we are more testimony in fact the testimony that we aposre hearing today it aposs actually getting easier to defend the president end video clip wallace house intelligence committee chair adam schiff and republican congressman mark meadows setting very different expectations for this week aposs public impeachment hearings and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and senator mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff josh holmes congresswoman edwards let me start with you what do you expect these public hearings to accomplish we know what these witnesses are going to say they we they their opening statements were leaked their full hours long transcripts have been have been put out there for anybody who aposs interested to read they aposve been widely covered it doesn apost seem to have moved anybody i mean the democrats are foursquare in favor of impeachment and there doesn apost seem to have been a single vote that aposs been swayed so far at least by house republicans in favor of impeachment so what aposs the point donna edwards former congresswoman d md well i mean now it aposs time for the american people to see the evidence i mean let aposs admit it even i aposve read some of the transcripts but haven apost read all of them and i think for the american people to be able to see these witnesses to know their you know their backgrounds and that they are public servants and that they have a sense of duty coming before the committee and i think that that will be really compelling and you know maybe it aposs not about swaying individual members of congress right now but it aposs about making sure that the american people put it out there because congress are followers right they aposll follow the public and i think that it aposs really important for the american people to hear the lawlessness and the unconstitutional behavior of the president of the united states wallace karl let aposs talk about the what we aposre going to hear in terms of the testimony this week you worked in a white house we aposre going to hear from three career foreign service officers one of them william taylor a military veteran has served presidents since 1985 ronald reagan they aposre going to talk about an off the books foreign policy they aposre going to talk about an ambassador marie yovanovitch who was smeared and recalled because of comments that were being made a campaign being run by rudy giuliani allegedly they aposre going to hear about a link between u s support for ukraine and ukraine conducting investigations of the president aposs political rivals obviously there aposs another side to the story but that story does it bother you karl rove contributor well as somebody who served in the white house it does bother me yes but on the other hand there is constant friction between the state department and an administration we saw this during the iraq war where we had the people in the state department leaking against the administration aposs policy but look that aposs going to be the sideshow the thing that aposs going to happen when we have this testimony is is that the republicans are going to be able to ask questions think about where we aposve been we have selective leaks of what of what these people said which is done to spin it as much as possible against the president then we have their entire transcripts which most people don apost read now we aposre going to have televised hearings in which they aposre going to be able to say their piece and it aposs going to have an impact but there also going to be questioned and the questioning is going to get to you know we have a quid military aid and assistance for ukraine and we have a quo and that quo is investigative the bidens and any other american involved in corruption but so far we don apost have the pro the for that is to say that what we know today is is that the ukrainians were never aware of a delay in their aid until they were given the aid and told that it had been delayed and we never had that grant of the aid predicated upon them making a commitment to investigate joe biden and we aposre and the failure of the democrats schiff aposs statement last night was very problematic because the american people are going to want to hear about joe biden and hunter biden and devon archer ph and this stinky situation involving burisma and if the democrats say we aposre not going to allow you to have those people called it aposs just going to simply add to the impression that this is a partisan witch hunt wallace mo mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics and public service ambassador sondland did revise his testimony to say he did inform the ukrainians that the aid would likely be contingent on this so that aposs that aposs about where we are on that point look ultimately i agree with the congresswoman that now the american people get to see this stuff and if you think about this politically and what actually you know based on the very few precedents we have in american history on this looking back on richard nixon republicans were with him republican voters were with him up until the very end the day he left the polling show that about 30 percent of republicans thought he should be removed from office but that 30 percent was a significant number because that aposs what put a lot of pressure on the republican members of the senate when barry goldwater finally broke with the president and went to him and said mr president you know i aposve been your guy but it aposs become unsustainable for us right now you don apost see that kind of breaking from republican voters so the question becomes do these hearings as the congresswoman was saying begin to mobilize and catalyze republican voters we know it aposs doing it for democrats and we know it aposs doing it for independent voters wallace but here aposs the question i have and let me bring in josh on this because i understand that you know we pay much more attention to the leaks we pay much more attention to the transcripts than most people do but they are out there and they have been widely reported they aposve been the lead on the evening news they aposve been on the front page of the papers and so far josh it hasn apost moved a single republican vote josh holmes former chief of staff to sen mitch mcconnell nor has it moved the republican primary electorate i mean i think mo you have a good point there and what ultimately did in nixon was his party basically beginning to turn on him if you look at the american people right now in particular the republican primary electorate not only are they not moving away from the president it aposs heartening i mean you aposve got numbers in 85 plus in terms of their view of this being a quote unquote witch hunt so i look we aposre a long way away from republicans moving away from president trump and embracing an impeachment inquiry my guess is an open hearing in the house will only serve to exacerbate that i don apost think there aposs any chance that this is going to come off looking like a fair hearing or something that the president has had basically his say in wallace i mean that is the concern i mean that it hasn apost moved the needle and we aposve gotten a lot of information so far i don apost i mean i understand a tv well i don apost know if i understand because we everybody kept saying you know they won apost read the book they aposll watch the movie and the mueller hearing turned out to be a disaster for democrats i think we would agree so let aposs assume that this is more effective than robert mueller as a as a witness does it really move the needle because it hasn apost so far congresswoman edwards well look this is actually very different kinds of behavior even than what we saw in the mueller report i mean we have a president of the united states who withheld aid from an ally who was you know on the front lines against our chief adversary and i think when the american people here that it wasn apost this isn apost about 2016 this is about what is happening right now in 2020 prospectively for the 2020 election and i think that these witnesses are going to make all the difference i mean when you look at a lieutenant colonel vindman for example you know he aposll be there and he aposll be in his dress blues and you know fully decorated raising his hand saying that he aposs telling the truth i defy republicans to challenge on that they are not challenging on the substance they are challenging on process and that is a loser argument wallace all right you get the final word rove process matters fairness matters that aposs why nixon went down because the process was fair this is not fair they won apost allow the they aposve got allowed the president any of the rights granted to president clinton during his impeachment or any of the rights granted to president nixon during his impeachment and i love the fact i love the fact that the democrats are now decrying the president aposs decision not to move aid lethal aid rapidly to ukraine after all the previous administration a democratic administration did nothing to send lethal aid to ukraine and the nonlethal aid they refused to fly into ukraine on c 130s because they didn apost want u s military presence in ukraine so they drop them off in poland and citizens had to take that nonlethal aid and put it in the back of their little vehicles and trucks and convey it to ukraine wallace ok rove so this president at least had the guts to give the ukrainians the lethal aid needed to stave off the russian attempts to subvert that country wallace well i think this is probably going to end up being a game changer and we aposre it will be a bipartisan game changer panel we have to take a break here when we come back former new york city mayor michael bloomberg looks ready to make a late entry into the 2020 democratic race can he win the nomination plus what would you like to ask the panel about the impact of a bloomberg candidacy just go to facebook or twitter at fox news sunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip michael bloomberg d presidential candidate i aposm a new yorker and i know a con when i see one donald trump president there aposs nobody i aposd rather run against the little michael sen bernie sanders i vt d presidential candidate tonight we say to michael bloomberg and other billionaires sorry you ain apost gonna buy this election end video clip wallace well former new york city mayor michael bloomberg getting pretty strong push back from both president trump and democratic candidate bernie sanders on a possible run for the white house and we aposre back now with the panel mo let me start with you does michael bloomberg have a realistic path to the democratic nomination and what do you think of what his strategists say if he does get in and it seems likely will his plan skip the first four skip iowa skip new hampshire and basically begin your campaign on super tuesday in early march elleithee yes look it aposs an uphill climb i would think for for mayor bloomberg and there aposs no evidence we aposve never seen anyone who has successfully tried to skip the early states and go on to win the nomination not at least in the modern era we aposve seen candidates who have tried to skip a state skip iowa and go straight to new hampshire skip new hampshire and so to south carolina wallace rudy giuliani wanted to skip them all and go to florida that doesn apost work out so well elleithee right it just doesn apost it doesn apost work out so well but i think what bloomberg is hoping here is that he can position himself to be sort of the moderate aposs last line of defense against the elizabeth warren bernie sanders wing of the party that if biden stumbles and is falling behind wallace and right now he aposs in fourth place in iowa and and not leading in new hampshire either elleithee and that whoever sort of stumbles out of those early states is going to be spent in terms of resources and organization and those later states to his credit are sort of more air war states than they are ground game states he aposs got the money to invest heavily in advertising that he can be the guy who can sort of be the moderates apos last line of defense i think i aposm a little skeptical that it works but it is a strategy that you know that if biden stumbles it looks like he aposs going to you know try to put himself in position to execute wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on the possibility that michael bloomberg will get into this race we got this on facebook from brad yates he writes how does bloomberg aposs stance on corporations stand against the current democrat party aposs push toward socialism congressman edwards how do you answer brad basically on the on the question is he just way too far to the right for this current democratic party edwards well i think that i mean i think that aposs a reasonable question but look there aposs no push toward socialism in the democratic party but i do think that there is an understandable concern about income inequality and the a michael bloomberg candidacy actually puts that front and center and the question of are we going to allow 749 billionaires to control all of the wealth of 60 percent the bottom 60 percent of americans and i think that aposs a legitimate debate for democrats to have we aposve been having that in our within our party wallace how about the argument that billionaires like bill gates like michael bloomberg create enormous wealth and tremendous job opportunity and that that aposs actually what kind of feeds the bulldog edwards absolutely they do and i worked for a corporation early in my career and i think that that is important but the question is how do you pay your fair share to make certain that other americans can aspire to their highest dreams too creating that wealth but also creating other opportunities for other americans i think that is a front and center debate of the democratic party and i think michael bloomberg aposs candidacy puts it right there in the middle and you know i aposm looking forward to the debate because i think we aposve been engaged in this conversation for a long time and it aposs going to be important for any democrat who wins in the democratic primary to be able to unite the party and i aposm really not sure that a michael bloomberg is a candidate that can come and unite all of the factions of the democratic party wallace all right let aposs turn to the elections that were held this last tuesday night which were very interesting where democrats took control of the virginia legislature for the first time in a quarter century and also it appears although the republican governor of kentucky still won apost concede it appears that the democrats have won the governor aposs seat in kentucky president trump talked in kentucky campaigning for the republican governor the night before here aposs what he said begin video clip trump you aposve got to vote because if you lose it sends a really bad message and if you lose they aposre going to say trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world end video clip wallace so karl how worried should the president and republicans be not so much about those specific results and those specific races but what you saw and you saw it in 2018 and you saw it again here the suburbs the suburbs in virginia the suburbs in kentucky the suburbs in pennsylvania around philadelphia this continuing move away from a republican party to the democrats rove yes and look all suburbs are not the same you mentioned kentucky in kentucky you had a very wallace you brought your whiteboard rove i brought the whiteboard for the first time appearance on fox news sunday in the governor aposs race the republican got 48 8 percent of the vote right below him on the ballot is a fresh first time candidate african american republican candidate for attorney general who gets 57 8 percent of the vote and 75 000 votes ahead of the guy above him on the ballot runs nine points ahead of him the rest of the ticket for agriculture commissioner auditor secretary of state and treasurer wallace my goodness this is kentucky it aposs a pretty red state rove i understand i understand but the point is is that in the suburbs those candidates run 11 to 12 points ahead of the republican candidate for governor and for the first time in the modern era the republicans take all those down ballot offices which says if you aposve got good candidates who make an appeal they can carry the republican suburbs wallace ok rove but warning negative southeast pennsylvania montgomery bucks ph delaware and chester republican strongholds the democrats took delaware county for the first time the county council is 5 0 democrat first time they aposve had a majority on the county council since the civil war and then in virginia we aposve known about northern virginia fading away from the republicans in this election it was the richmond suburbs of henrico ph and chesterfields ph the republicans have got a problem in the suburbs and kentucky says if you right run the right kind of campaign and have the right kind of democrat you can win but inaudible a problem wallace i want to i want to bring josh in there aposs the continuing fallout from elizabeth warren aposs continuing plans spending taxing trillions of dollars and there was blowback this week from two relatively surprising sources take a look begin video clip bill gates co founder microsoft when you say i should pay a hundred billion ok then i aposm starting to do a little math about what i have left over jamie dimon chairman and ceo jp morgan chase i don apost like vilifying anybody i you know i think we should applaud successful people end video clip wallace josh bill gates and jamie dimon who aposs the ceo of jp morgan are certainly rich but they are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination what does that say to you i mean obviously they aposre two billionaires who are i guess dimon aposs not a billionaire but two rich guys what does that say to you about their problems that elizabeth warren will have with her tax and spend policies in a general election holmes i think the best sign that elizabeth warren has a real problem with sort of your center left democratic constituency is the fact that we started this segment talking about michael bloomberg i mean michael bloomberg said back in february that as long as joe biden is in this race and feels like he aposs got a comfortable hold on the nomination he aposs not interested in running but if the democratic party looks like it aposs auguring towards nominating somebody who aposs in that sort of left wing sort of more extreme category wallace but we should point out michael bloomberg aposs another billionaire holmes sure absolutely but here aposs the here aposs the point the point is is that joe this all says a lot more about joe biden then it says about anything else joe biden is now in a place where he has lost his hold on the democratic primary electorate and the democratic primary electorate is looking for an elizabeth warren that aposs what you know with all due respect to bill gates wallace inaudible elizabeth warren or holmes no no with all with all due respect to bill gates and all the other billionaires who have critiques about where the democratic party is the democratic primary electorate is saying loud and clear for anybody who will listen we like elizabeth warren we like bernie sanders we have had five or six candidates try the center rode here and we have run them out of town in this in this primary electorate elleithee you aposve got biden and buttigieg edwards joe biden elleithee are are doing about as well combined as warren and sanders are doing combined holmes well he aposs look he aposs lost rove one aposs at seven and one aposs at 20 elleithee the moderates rove and the other two are at 18 and 22 elleithee not in iowa in iowa those four are clustered very closely together look in 2018 more center left democrats won congressional primaries than far left democrats won congressional primaries with a primary inaudible holmes but it aposs not happening in the 2020 cycle and i aposve got to tell you people rove there aposs a lot more far left democrats won primaries in 2020 than won in 2018 or 2016 elleithee we aposll see edwards this hasn apost shaken out yet so i mean it hasn apost shaken out at all and everything aposs still inaudible wallace so the battle continues thank you all panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the dedication it takes to escort the nation aposs bravest to their final resting place commercial break wallace on this veterans day
