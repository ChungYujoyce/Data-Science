military crackdown on the pro democracy movement he was forced to stay there for 13 months while the countries discussed his fate chen s case is more complicated because his wife and daughter are still in shandong fu said chen s case should be handled through negotiations like fang s and that his family should not suffer any reprisals the odds are that it will be a long negotiation and a stalemate for a time said jerome cohen a chinese law expert at new york university china has some cards to play starting with chen s wife and children plus the accomplices to his escape china s media
