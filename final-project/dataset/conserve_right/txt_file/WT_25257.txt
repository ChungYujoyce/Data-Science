and his chaotic tenure yet are old enough to remember and still take sides in the ideological clash of the cold war said pollster john zogby this is clearly an effort on his part to try to move beyond the base and to go where the democrats aren t going mr zogby said those democrats are trying to re create the obama coalition of youths minorities and women leaving mr trump room to rally everyone else and to try to peel off some of the democratic coalition who might not be able to define socialism exactly but know they don t want it grabbing a foothold in america ideas such as a government run
