apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the new virus from china has the world on edge because it s a close cousin to viruses that killed hundreds in separate outbreaks while it s too early to tell if this latest threat will prove as deadly health authorities are drawing on lessons from that grim past what s the link the new virus comes from a large family of coronaviruses some causing nothing worse than a cold but in late 2002 a coronavirus named sars erupted in southern china causing a severe pneumonia that rapidly spread to other countries it infected more than 8 000 people and killed 774 and then it disappeared thanks to public health measures top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk in 2012 another coronavirus dubbed mers began sickening people in saudi arabia it s still hanging around causing small numbers of infections each year the world health organization has counted nearly 2 500 cases of mers in the middle east and beyond and more than 850 deaths so far deaths from the new virus have been a small fraction of the roughly 1 300 confirmed infections most of those cases in china where do these viruses come from sars and mers came from animals and this newest virus almost certainly did too the first people infected visited or worked at a seafood market in the chinese city of wuhan sars initially was traced to civet cats sold in a live animal market but later scientists decided it probably originated in bats that infected the civets people can catch mers from infected camels although again bats likely first spread that coronavirus to camels that animal to human jump is a huge concern for all kinds of viruses every so often new strains of bird flu make the jump from asian live poultry markets to people for example these wildlife markets are a risk said dr ian lipkin of columbia university who assisted the who and china during the sars outbreak and advises saudi arabia about mers how similar are they experts can t yet tell whether the new virus called 2019 ncov it stands for novel coronavirus is more like sars or mers genetically they re all closely related but they really are different viruses said dr anthony fauci infectious diseases chief at the u s national institutes of health one indication of a virus danger is how easily it spreads from person to person unlike sars it looks like it doesn t transmit through the air very easily and probably transmits through close contact said dr david heymann who headed who s global response to sars and while it s too soon to be sure heymann said the new virus appears most dangerous to older adults who have other health problems complicating matters if this new virus is fairly mild it may be harder to stem the spread that s because people who aren t sick enough to see a doctor and thus don t learn they should be isolated could keep spreading it noted neil ferguson of imperial college london who has consulted for who nor is there any way to know yet how often people become infected but show no obvious symptoms we may see more mild cases as the surveillance intensifies who spokesman tarik jasarevic said friday in geneva so the issue is not so much really numbers that we know will go up it s flu season in the northern hemisphere how will people know the difference since symptoms are similar fever cough and in more severe cases shortness of breath or pneumonia it ll take a medical test to tell there is one but health authorities in china the u s and elsewhere are working to make it more widely available given that it is flu season in china too it s all the more impressive that they were able to recognize this outbreak quickly dr brian garibaldi of johns hopkins university said precautions that hospitals often use for flu season and for other infectious diseases should help for this too garibaldi added for example in many u s hospitals people are given masks if they arrive with a fever and cough during flu season and a legacy of the 2014 west africa ebola outbreak which also resulted in infected travelers is that doctors and hospitals are supposed to ask about recent foreign trips hunting vaccines while there is no vaccine or specific treatment for sars or mers fauci said it is technically possible to create a vaccine against this new virus nih did develop a potential vaccine candidate for sars it proved safe in a small first step study in people but never was tested further because by then the outbreak was ending this time around scientists have more of a head start just weeks after the first unusual pneumonias were reported chinese scientists mapped the genes of the viral suspect and shared them with world health authorities now nih is among several groups working to create a vaccine for the new virus using newer and faster technology than was available during sars fauci hopes to begin first step safety tests in about three months but something ready for real world use would take far longer the
