apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the media are pathetic but that doesn t mean they can t hit an all time low yet again take sharpiegate yes every little thing in washington eventually gets a gate suffix no matter how insignificant as hurricane dorian moved across the caribbean last month very early forecasts showed the possibly category 5 storm might hit florida hard in what are called spaghetti models a couple of dozen lines showing projections for where a given tropical storm or hurricane might go one showed dorian crossing florida and moving into the gulf of mexico before doubling back across the state several showed the path crossing over into parts of alabama top stories cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey the storm was still hundreds of miles east of puerto rico so the models were virtually meaningless president trump and acting homeland security secretary kevin k mcaleenan updated the media on dorian in an oval office briefing mr trump held up a map from the national hurricane center that showed the cone of the storm but on the edge drawn in black magic marker was another smaller half circle that extended the cone into the florida panhandle and alabama then the real hurricane descended on washington the media declaring that mr trump had falsely claimed that the hurricane was going to hit alabama at one point the washington post cited an unnamed source saying mr trump himself had drawn the half circle on the big map asserting that mr trump is known to use sharpies the scandal quickly became sharpiegate day after day the media penned pieces on how mr trump had said alabama was ground zero for dorian by sept 5 day 7 of the biggest story in washington mr trump took to twitter to defend himself in the early days of the hurricane when it was predicted that dorian would go through miami or west palm beach even before it reached the bahamas certain models strongly suggested that alabama georgia would be hit as it made its way through florida to the gulf mr trump tweeted mr trump followed up by tweeting alabama was going to be hit or grazed and then hurricane dorian took a different path up along the east coast the fake news knows this very well that s why they re the fake news on and on the major scandal went it got stupider and stupider sure but on it went nevertheless before we move on with the story of the century let s stop and point out that huge hurricanes which dorian certainly was often have major rain and wind bands that stretch for hundreds of miles based on the very early projection had dorian come straight into florida alabama would surely had been affected if not by hurricane force winds at least by heavy rain and possible flooding doubt that think back to hurricane irene in 2011 the media spent days breathlessly saying the huge storm was projected to directly hit new york city it didn t but it did hit vermont hard almost every river and stream in vermont flooded and many of the historic covered bridged were damaged or destroyed hurricanes affect areas hundreds of miles from where they make landfall case closed by sept 7 the whole story started to change the national oceanic and atmospheric administration issued a statement from an unidentified spokesman stating that information provided by noaa and the national hurricane center to the president had demonstrated that tropical storm force winds from hurricane dorian could impact alabama the associated press reported the advisories were dated from last wednesday aug 28 through monday the statement read parts of alabama were covered usually with 5 to 10 chances between aug 27 and sept 3 maps on aug 30 grew to cover far more of alabama but for only 12 hours and the highest percentage hit 20 to 30 before quickly shrinking back down the ap said and there you go at least for some period of time the storm or its remnants or its outer bands or something was expected to affect alabama mr trump wasn t wrong but the media just couldn t let it go and they sought out people who would say so people are used to the president saying things that aren t true but this alabama stuff is another story sources told the heavily liberal site the independent in a piece headlined trump is in severe mental decline concerns raised over president s health no one knows what to expect from him anymore one former white house official told business insider speaking anonymously then britain s daily mail tabloid got into the act workers in the national weather service are shocked stunned and irate at their bosses in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration for backing trump up and claiming that he was right to say hurricane dorian was headed for alabama but now two weeks later and long after dorian came and went the story is finally losing wind only to be replaced by this from the new york times trump had deal with scotland airport that sent flight crews to his resort get ready for a week of resortgate and more idiocy from america s media joseph curl covered the white house and politics for a decade for the washington times he can be reached at emailprotected and on twitter j
