by reporting to the inspector general for the intelligence community that trump had urged the investigations on a july phone call with zelenskiy schiff told abc s this week that his panel had reached agreement to hear from the whistleblower who would testify very soon schiff said the exact date would depend in part on how quickly acting director of national intelligence joseph maguire completes the security clearance process for the whistleblower s lawyers we ll keep obviously riding shotgun to make sure the acting director doesn t delay in that clearance process schiff said the complaint

t cooperate with schiff but if trump decides that he wants me to testify of course i ll testify schiff says he hasn t decided whether he wants to hear from giuliani democrats say they hope to finish

2016 election since president trump took office said house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif slower senate if the house votes to approve charges against trump the republican led senate would then hold a trial some senate republicans have expressed concerns about trump s interactions with ukraine but there are few signs that there would be enough discontent to convict the president who still has strong support in the gop ranks if trump were impeached it would take a two thirds vote in the senate to convict him and remove him from office a memorandum from senate republicans circulated over the weekend acknowledged it would be hard for republican majority leader mitch mcconnell to block an impeachment trial but he could deflect any house approved impeachment articles to a committee the
