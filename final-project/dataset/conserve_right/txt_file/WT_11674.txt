apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap the blind chinese lawyer at the center of a diplomatic storm between washington and beijing is a taboo topic in each capital neither side wants the biggest human rights issue between the two since tiananmen square to disrupt high level strategic and economic talks set to begin on thursday the obama administration and chinese officials have signaled that the global economy north korea iran and sudan issues in which millions of lives are at stake have become far more important in u s chinese relations thus both refuse to admit anything is amiss as high profile dissident chen guangcheng is believed to be sheltering with u s diplomats in china officials in both countries consider mr guangcheng invisible i have nothing for you on anything having to do with that matter state department spokeswoman victoria nuland responded repeatedly to reporters questions on the subject on monday although she confirmed that the top u s diplomat for asia kurt campbell is in beijing to prepare for the fourth round of the strategic and economic dialogue she refused to say if he was discussing mr chen and pointedly refused to even utter his name mr campbell arrived in beijing early sunday at least a day ahead of schedule and according to activists is in intensive discussions with the chinese to resolve the chen matter before secretary of state hillary rodham clinton and treasury secretary timothy f geithner get there but ms nuland said the meetings will go on as planned both sides want to solve this in a low key manner and they do not want this to dominate other issues in the strategic and economic dialogue so that s why they are working hard to find a speedy solution said bob fu of the texas based rights group chinaaid which was involved in mr chen s escape from house arrest last week and his subsequent arrival into the protection of u s diplomats in beijing despite the silence the handling of his case the most serious u s china rights crisis since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre and the most serious overall since an american spy plane was forced to land on china s hainan island in 2001 will have profound ramifications on both sides of the pacific mr obama s options are limited facing a tough fight for re election in november he cannot afford to ignore the situation doing nothing to help a visually impaired self taught lawyer who has fought against forced abortions and corruption in china would open mr obama up to attacks from his presumed republican opponent mitt romney it also would draw intense criticism from the human rights community in the united states one of his core constituencies but at the same time pressing the issue too hard may prompt a backlash from china on which the u s is increasingly reliant for foreign capital and support as it seeks to lead the global economic recovery deal with north korea and iran s nuclear programs and prevent a potential war between sudan and south sudan the key to resolving the situation may well rest with an aging cadre at the top of china s communist party who either could promise protection for mr chen and his family in china or could allow him to leave the country possibly even to hong kong or macao as they prepare for their own leadership transition later this year mr chen prefers to stay in china if he and his family s safety can be guaranteed in the current environment in china that might not be possible so a viable solution is to have him and his family come to the u s mr fu said a face saving option may be to let mr chen and his family come to the u s for medical treatment he said the ouster of powerful politician bo xilai following a deputy s visit to the u s consulate in chengdu in february already has laid bare some of the party s dirty laundry ahead the changes and the chinese will be loath to lose more face over mr chen whose case was raised repeatedly by american officials including mrs clinton herself until the information blackout began last week human rights has been a distasteful issue for beijing for decades and it has criticized the u s approach as lecturing mrs clinton made waves on her first trip abroad as secretary of state when she said that human rights could not dominate the entire agenda with china at the expense of other pressing issues her comments drew fire at the time but the relationship clearly has evolved as global priorities have shifted while china in the 1990s was in need of foreign investment and diplomatic partners and was willing to send jailed dissidents into exile to get them beijing sees little need for such concessions now with its diplomatic clout and coffers bulging with foreign exchange as the first and second largest economies respectively the u s and china have intertwining interests and as the reigning superpower and burgeoning world power they are frequently jostling for advantage across the
