r lindsey graham joins fox news sunday to discuss pompeo s talks with north korea trump s upcoming summit with putin and the looming battle over a new supreme court nomination this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday july 8 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated dana perino host i aposm dana perino in for chris wallace president trump prepares to announce his supreme court nominee before he heads to the nato summit where he faces rising tensions with european allies begin videotape donald trump president of the united states i aposm going to tell nato you aposve got to start paying your bills the united states is not going to take care of everything perino plus the divide with europe over terrorists withdraw of the iran nuke deal and improved relations with russia trump i aposm meeting with president putin next week and getting along with other countries is a good thing it aposs not a bad thing it aposs a good thing perino we aposll preview the summit in brussels and helsinki with kay bailey hutchison u s ambassador to nato then as a list of possible replacements for justice anthony kennedy narrows the senate awaits president trump aposs supreme court announcement trump if you tune in monday at 9 00 i think you aposre going to be extremely happy with this pick ph right perino we aposll discuss president trump aposs possible picks and handicapped their chances of getting confirmed with republican senator lindsey graham it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive and we aposll ask ilyse hogue president of naral pro choice america with the vacancy means for the future of roe v wade plus mike pompeo secretary of state we had many hours of productive conversations these are complicated issues but we aposve made progress on almost all of the central issues perino north korea takes issue with the latest round of talks following the first formal meeting since the singapore summit we aposll ask our sunday panel what it means for getting rid of nukes on the korean peninsula all right now on fox news sunday end videotape perino and hello again from fox news in washington president trump is gearing up for a high stakes trip to europe this week which includes a likely tense summit with nato allies and potential concessions to russia in a face to face meeting with vladimir putin but first he aposll announce his supreme court pick a move that could reshape the high court for decades to come kevin corke is live at the white house with the latest kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent dana white house sources insist this will not be a nomination by committee or by congressional lawmaker input this will fall on the president and the president alone but that hasn apost stopped competing voices on both sides of the political spectrum from trying to influence his choice begin videotape corke jurists believed to be in the president aposs final four are thought to be safely conservative but there aposs increasing pressure on mr trump to nominate someone who won apost draw the ire of pro choice republican senators that could complicate judge amy coney barrett whose catholic faith has led some critics to opine without evidence that she aposd vote to overturn roe v wade but selecting a judge with a fairly limited paper trail just to avoid a fight in the senate is risky such was the case with david souter former justice who despite being nominated by a conservative president george h w bush proved to be anything but trump in choosing justice kennedy aposs replacement my greatest responsibility is to select a justice who will faithfully interpret the constitution as written corke monday aposs pending supreme court announcement comes just ahead of the president aposs trip to europe for the nato summit and a pair of bilateral meetings with britain aposs theresa may and russian president vladimir putin the latter of which could prove pivotal in shaping mr trump aposs vision of u s russian and u s european relations this as the president aposs top diplomat secretary of state mike pompeo sailed into decidedly choppy waters in his ongoing bid to get pyongyang to give up its nuclear ambitions with the north describing the u s aposs tone in the latest talks as regrettable and gangster like pompeo we had good faith productive conversations which will continue in the days and weeks ahead in the meantime sanctions remain in place end videotape corke meanwhile the president aposs top diplomat mike pompeo not only sailed into choppy waters he is a way as there are new developments on this conversation between the president and bob mueller have you heard about this the special counsel now getting new conditions set by rudy giuliani who told the new york times he aposd have to see how the basis of that sit down would go dana so that the trump team could assess the mueller team aposs objectivity very interesting indeed dana perino indeed kevin corke thank you reporting from the white house we appreciate it and joining me now from brussels the u s ambassador to nato kay bailey hutchison ambassador hutchison listen to what president trump said about nato on thursday begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i aposm going to tell nato you aposve got to start paying your bills the united states is not going to take care of everything and we aposre the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing end video clip perino and then the washington post reported trump for his part frequently tells european leaders how much he dislikes the e u and how it is worse than china ambassador hutchison what do you make of those comments and is it possible for the president to convey a sense of cooperation because there has been significant progress that nato has made kay bailey hutchison u s ambassador to nato nato really is making progress and they are doing it really at president trump aposs insistence and i think that it aposs very clear and he aposs been very direct about the europeans needing to do more for their own security you know dana i aposve worked for probably three presidents all of whom have said the same thing now i think for the first time we are releasing the europeans actually start going in the right direction every ally is now increasing defense spending we aposve had the largest increase in defense spending since the cold war and in the year and a half since president trump has been in office it has doubled since 2014 so i think he is making an impact and i think that the europeans including chancellor merkel just recently who has said we are going to do more it we need to do more it aposs the right thing to do and she is encouraging her bundestag her parliament to increase the defense budget so that we will be more fit for purpose in nato for the fights that we want to deter perino do you anticipate that there might be any additional conversations within the nato meeting about the tensions regarding trade and tariff hutchison one thing i will say is that in all of the disagreements that we have seen at the g7 and with allies with whom we are now having trade talks and negotiations and tariffs that has not come up in the nato context our diplomats are professional and they are staying on our nato issues where we are 100 percent allied perino you said recently that nato aposs main concern now is russia that the u s has beefed up its troops in nato countries that are next to russia like the baltics and poland the president reportedly has said crimea should go to the russians since most people there speak russian does that concern allies like those in the baltic states and is it still the position of the united states that our nato allies have reason to be concerned about threats from russia hutchison oh i think definitely we are hardening our defenses as a deterrence against the invasion of any outside influence it is most certainly russia which has had much maligned influence that has been an attempt to destabilize our alliance and our allies it aposs also counterterrorism we have a major effort and it was president trump aposs request that we prioritize at nato more in the counterterrorism area which we are doing and i think it aposs very important that we support the ukraine and the illegal invasion of crimea and the also still tensioned area in eastern ukraine ukraine is trying very hard to be a strong and sovereign nation and nato is committed to helping them do that with the reforms that they are seeking so i do think that we are allied in that and i know that all of us in the united states is right there too want to assure that we have the mutual defense against any kind of malign influence that russia might attempt and most certainly the export of terrorism from afghanistan and other countries that is in our interest to do perino let me ask you about another nato ally and that is turkey tomorrow president erdogan is going to be sworn in he will continue his 15 year rule he now has expanded powers because of that election russian prime minister dmitry medvedev is going to attend the inauguration our u s ambassador post to turkey is still open we have charge there do you have any concern that russia is trying to flip turkey hutchison oh yes i do think russia is trying to flip turkey they are trying to flip many of our allies they want to destabilize the strongest defense alliance and a history of the world and that is nato and every effort that we can make that strengthens our alliance as well as the partners that we have is very helpful very productive and very necessary and turkey is one of our alliance aposs most strong members they are a framework nation helping us in afghanistan they have been an ally for a long time and we will continue to work with them and we know that russia is trying to move into that but they are strong and they are a nato strong member perino i know that turkey is thinking about or trying to explore the idea of purchasing an s 400 system that aposs an antiaircraft system that russia builds and that the united states is opposed to that do you think that president trump will address this with erdogan at the meeting this week hutchison dana president trump has addressed it with president erdogan we have addressed it at every level we are very much against that because it will affect the interoperability of our nato forces in turkey we can apost have a russian built defense system with f35s going into turkey so we are working with turkey in every way not to put this russian system in the middle of their country when they are such a strong ally of nato as well as the united states perino let me ask you about germany you aposve said that there is no discussion regarding u s troop withdrawal from germany but i understand the pentagon is undertaking a cost analysis of the 35 000 u s troops that we have there how do you describe within nato or even to the president the rationale for keeping u s troops in germany hutchison well the u s troops in germany which there are in the neighborhood of 30 000 are there for many purposes part of which of course is our ally germany but also they are a forward basing presence they are hospital focus for us that helps when we have injured soldiers that need immediate care they fly to germany they are a basing operation and they aposre going to be part of our military mobility in nato so of course we want to make sure that we are getting help with the cost of troops in germany when it is in our interest to have them that is a negotiation that we always have with countries where we have basing but i will say that germany has been a very solid partner in having our troops there and it has a long standing support basing both for us as well as for germany perino and let me ask you about poland i understand poland is lobbying for more permanent presence possibly the baltic states as well is the united states considering that putting our troops there in poland hutchison well we do have troops in poland it is a rotating force part of our enhanced forward presence and we have a great relationship with another great ally of ours in nato poland and they have offered permanent basing certainly we look at all offers made like that but no decision is being made right now but looking at it yes in fact congress has asked that our defense department look at the cost involved in new basing of any kind wherever it might be perino all right ambassador hutchison thank you for joining us today i hope you have a good meeting this week hutchison thank you dana it aposs great to be with you and glad that you have the sunday show while chris is gone perino thank you so much all right up next secretary of state mike pompeo praises progress on his first trip to pyongyang since the singapore summit but the north koreans strike a different tone senator lindsey graham joins us next commercial break perino north korea is accusing the u s of making gangster like demands and the most recent round of talks since the singapore summit between president trump and kim jong un secretary of state mike pompeo who just wrapped up two days of meetings in pyongyang maintained his visit produced results but said sanctions would remain for now joining me from clemson south carolina republican senator lindsey graham just back from a trip so we aposre glad to have you here if we could start with north korea the obvious improvement in relations because you have kim jong un used to say that president trump was a dotard now he aposs actually engaging on policy but it probably doesn apost surprise you that much that the north koreans issued a statement yesterday saying that the meeting was regrettable saying they were robber like and really pouring cold water on it what do you think of it sen lindsey graham r south carolina senate armed services committee i see china aposs hands all over this we are in a fight with china we buy 500 billion worth of goods from the chinese they buy 100 billion from us they cheat and president trump wants to change the economic relationship with china so if i were president trump i would not let china use north korea to back me off of the trade dispute we aposve got more bullets than they do when it comes to trade we sell them 100 billion they sell is 500 billion we can hurt them more than they will hurt us and all we aposre looking for is for them to stop cheating when it comes to trade there aposs no doubt in my mind that it aposs the chinese pulling a north koreans back and to our north korean friends can apost say the word friend yet you asked pompeo did he sleep well if you knew what i knew about what we could do to the leadership of north korea you wouldn apost sleep very well perino i thought that was i actually really enjoyed reading about that exchange where the north korean general asking mike pompeo twice surely you couldn apost have slept well last night and our secretary of state said oh i slept just fine meanwhile president trump will meet one on one with vladimir putin in helsinki next monday bloomberg reports the kremlin is working with the u s to have a deal that the president will except they say putin has agreed in principle to u s and israeli demands that iranian backed forces in southern syria be kept away from israel aposs border replaced with troops loyal to the government and damascus that aposs according to two kremlin advisers would you recommend the president agreed to that deal graham given russia aposs behavior absolutely not russia was supposed to make sure that assad had no chemical weapons the last thing you can rely upon is the russians to take care of american israeli interests there is ideal to be had in syria our troops in northeastern syria working with the syrian democratic forces arabs and kurds have demolished isis and if we stay there we have about 2 000 troops isis won apost come back if we stay in northeastern syria iran can apost march from tehran to beirut i don apost trust the russians to implement any agreement when it comes to the iranians but there is a way to break iran from russia away from iran but no way can it be achieved about us staying there our presence in northeastern syria is an insurance policy against assad taking over syria and isis coming back and the iranians owning the whole region perino how do you balance the cooperation that we need with russia right now on something with the concerns that we have with russia on many other fronts and how would you recommend president trump approach that meeting next monday in helsinki it will be his first one on one with putin graham well first when putin denies that he was involved in our election in 2016 reject the denial challenge him don apost let him deny the obvious they are still trying to disrupt the 2018 election cycle when it comes to syria we need to be partnering with turkey to make sure that we can maintain the presence in northeastern syria at the end of the day iran is a weak economy they aposve got problems in their own backyard what we need to do is partner with turkey and russia and break iran away iran has a different reason for being in syria than most everybody else israel cannot tolerate hezbollah and iranian presence in syria if you leave assad in power the arabs will never accept him nor will the syrian people there aposs a way to get russia pulled away from iran but we aposve got to have a presence in iraq and syria to be successful in 2007 we lost 900 soldiers fighting in iraq and the last three and a half years we have lost 14 president trump has done a good job of destroying isis and countering iran our soldiers in iraq and syria are insurance policies against iran domination and the rise of isis if we keep this configuration in place we aposve got some leverage regarding russia and iran perino you mentioned turkey i wanted to ask you about that you were just on a trip we spoke to the president erdogan graham yes perino he is going to be inaugurated for i think the fourth term tomorrow and while turkey has been somewhat helpful in syria as you mentioned and ambassador hutchison just said are you concerned that turkey is an ally adrift and is there a strategy to get them back on track graham yes they are definitely an ally adrift but there aposs a new chapter in turkish history erdogan won big and he aposs going to have a long time to serve in turkey and we need to come to grips with that we need to push him when it comes to the way they treat the press and some human rights abuses they have americans in captivity for no good reason but having said that we need to assure turkey that the kurdish forces we are partnered with in syria will not present a threat to turkey that aposs a legitimate concern turkey has no interest in iran dominating damascus at the end of the day their economy is better off hooked up with us versus russia and iran they are a nato ally so i came away from my meeting somewhat encouraged that we can start over with president erdogan in a win win fashion securing the northeastern part of syria in fashion acceptable to turkey and they can be a better ally when it comes to pushing back against iran and isis perino did you talk to president erdogan about this idea that they would want to buy and s400 antiaircraft system graham yes perino and do you think that he wants to go forward with it and if he does will the congress vote to put sanctions on turkey since that aposs allowed under the russian sanctions act graham we aposre not going to sell turkey the f35 our most advanced fighter and allow them to buy the most advanced soviet antiaircraft system it will just be a matter of time before the s 400 would be used in a fashion to undermine the f35 they have to pick i would like them to buy the patriot missile battery made by the united states and our partners they are a nato partner they need to release pastor brunson who has been held in my view way too long very much illegally but you aposve got to remember that president erdogan was under siege two years ago there was an armed coup i left that meeting believing that we can do business with erdogan you can apost have the s 400 we aposll find a substitute for that if you release the prisoners that are caught up in the coup that helps us enormously there aposs a win win situation in northeastern syria i think turkey understands their future is better with the west economically and i aposd like to do a free trade agreement one day with turkey when they get their house in order and that would neuter russia and iran aposs influence vis a vis turkey better than anything i could think of perino i wanted to bring up pastor andrew brunson i think we have a photo of him here he aposs been held for two years this is of great concern to the president and the vice president did you get any indication that he will be able to come home soon graham i met with him here aposs what was interesting president erdogan met with senator shaheen and myself the next day he let us go see pastor brunson who is doing well physically but has been in jail now way too long he aposs lived in turkey for 24 years he has nothing to do with the coup when it comes to what happened in 2016 he got caught up in a net and he is not a threat to the people of turkey that is the defining issue between us and turkey but i aposm encouraged i don apost believe he would let us go see pastor brunson if they were not looking for a way to end this and they have some other embassy personnel in turkish prison and we need to get this issue behind us i left turkey thinking that this new after erdogan aposs election we aposve got a chance to do business with him better than in the past and i hope he aposll take it because we need turkey and they need us perino sounds like a worthwhile trip let me ask you one question back on domestic policy the timing of the supreme court nomination seems to not be better for republicans you aposre on the judiciary committee you aposve been around before for supreme court nominations how much different like this one be and do you feel confident that the republicans will be able to confirm one of president trump aposs nominees before the midterms graham i think i aposve got two words and i heard supreme court and confidence so we aposve got a technical problem but here aposs my answer republicans are holding four lottery tickets and all of them are winners if you are a conservative republican the four people named particularly thomas hardiman i aposm glad he is on the list are all winners and every republican should embrace these picks here aposs the truth donald trump could nominate george washington or john marshall and they couldn apost get through it may be a handful of democrats will vote for a trump pick because they have to politically i aposve never seen at this dysfunctional there aposs nobody that president trump could nominate from a conservative bent that will get many democratic votes but this is a nightmare for red state democrats to oppose a highly qualified nominee and all four of these people are highly qualified been on the court know what they are doing mainstream judges so red state democrats are going to have a very hard decision and i hope every republican will rally behind these picks because they are all outstanding perino all right senator graham thank you for reading my mind since you couldn apost hear me and for joining us today it aposs always good to talk to you sir graham thank you perino up next what could a conservative replacement for justice kennedy mean for roe v wade ilyse hogue president of naral pro choice america joins us when we come back commercial break perino coming up secretary of state mike pompeo downplays north korea aposs accusation of gangster like demands by the u s begin video clip pompeo we had good faith productive conversations which will continue in the meantime sanctions remain in place end video clip perino we aposll ask our sunday panel about the current state of negotiations coming up commercial break perino the president is set to announce his nominee for the supreme court monday at 9 00 p m eastern and much of the focus has been on how a new justice could join with the high court aposs conservative bloc to overrule the court aposs roe vs wade decision joining me now is ilyse hogue he aposs president of naral pro choice america an organization working to keep abortion legal and assessable thank you for being here with me take a listen to leonard leo last week on fox news sunday he aposs currently on leave from the federalist society and he put together the supreme court list for president trump begin video clip leonard leo trump adviser on judicial selection i don apost think at the end of the day it aposs about roe v wade it aposs about it aposs about having judges on the court who are going to interpret the constitution the way it aposs written and part of interpreting the constitution is taking into account major precedents and that aposs going to happen end video clip perino ilyse conservative say the concern about roe v wade is more of a scare tactic than reality how do you see it ilyse hogue naral pro choice america president you know we take the president at his word he aposs the president of the united states and he is certainly the first major party nominee who went on to be president to put a litmus test on supreme court justices and that was to actually overturn roe v wade so we believe him he aposs got a vice president who committed to you know throw roe on an ash heap of history so we think that aposs the mind set that many americans are actually going into this with because it was such a vocal talking point for him and the we also know that the backpedaling that aposs happening now from people who have long been critics of roe v wade is partially because they know what we know which is most american people actually regardless of how they feel personally about abortion believe that legal access is core to our country aposs precedence ph perino in fact i have some polls and i think that we could put them up here public opinion certainly has shifted since 1973 it aposs been 45 years and 67 percent of americans say they do not want to see roe v wade overturned though there is some variation by degrees in another poll 50 percent say it should be legal under certain circumstances 18 percent say it should not be legal at all so if with 68 percent of people saying some or no all restrictions or some restrictions how do you plan to go forward and is it a situation where you might let the states decide if there is this public opinion change hogue mmm yes thank you dana i aposm from texas and so i aposm very familiar with what happens when the state decides it aposs you know similar to other freedoms and protections of people we aposve seen in this country without a federal guideline that affirms the fact that roe should be legal many states already have decided that abortion should be criminalized in fact there are states with laws on the books right now that would make abortion the criminal act the minute roe falls and that makes women and doctors criminals and so we think that the federal protection is necessary we also know that that number of people who say in some circumstances of course right it aposs a complicated issue but when you poke ph out a little bit further what we find is that people are very very uncomfortable sitting in judgment every individual has a story and that most people are compassionate and recognize that allowing people to make their own decisions about their families is that compassionate and healthy choice perino so back to the supreme court nomination i take your point that what president trump said in the campaign and then what he says now is that he aposs not going to ask the people that he aposs interviewed for this possible position but i want you to listen to two recent supreme court nominees and how they answered questions in senate hearing about roe v wade begin video clip unidentified male can you tell me whether roe was decided correctly justice neil gorsuch supreme court senator again i would tell you that roe vs wade decided in 1973 is the precedent in the united states supreme court it has been reaffirmed unidentified male in your opinion is roe settled law justice sonia sotomayor supreme court the court aposs decision in planned parenthood versus casey reaffirmed the core holding of roe that is the precedent that the court and settled in terms of the holding of the court end video clip perino so those two seem very similar to me they aposre different from the ideological perspective and if the new nominee actually were to answer it in that way would that be satisfactory to you hogue because president trump changed the rules of the game when he put a litmus test on the supreme court nominee we think that there is actually we need an affirmative declaration right we need and i think even susan collins said this when she said she needs to see a nominees demonstrate their commitment to upholding roe vs wade and keeping abortion legal perino but even ruth bader ginsburg said in her hearing that she shouldn apost be asked that she would never answer that because she would it aposs a hypothetical that she wouldn apost answer hogue yes and actually dana she did answer that she declared affirmatively that she believed that roe should be upheld but she was speaking to what we now call the ginsburg rule was speculation on future cases that had not yet come before the court so we believe that actually what ruth bader ginsburg and we have the clips said is in fact perfect which is that women should be afforded this right to privacy to make their own decision it was decided in griswold it was decided in roe and it is absolutely what most americans want perino so i want to have people take a look at the ad that you have created this is a full page ad i think it aposs running in many of the cities all across maine because of pressure that you want to put on senator susan collins what other strategies and tactics are you going to try to use and what at the end of the day there will probably be a vote how do you think it will go hogue we are really trying to channel our members and the flood of calls we aposre getting into our office from people who aren apost even our members into the senator aposs ear which is basically to take president trump at his word don apost vote to put someone on the court that will but roe overturn roe and criminalize abortion and we think that aposs a very compelling message for folks do we think susan collins is the only person that needs to hear it absolutely not i mean i think this is a real be careful what you wish for a moment for republicans who have spent decades being able to campaign against abortion but are reading the same polls that we aposre reading which is why you have leonard leo backing off which is most americans actually really support this rule ph perino so what about red state senate democrats who are up for re election will you be trying to you know run ads in their states as well hogue yes i mean absolutely i think you aposre going to see a lot of constituents talking to their senators over the next couple of months and that includes democrats and republicans we don apost actually see this as a partisan issue we see it as an issue of constitutional human rights and i think that when they hear from their constituents and when they look at the numbers in their states be it on criminalizing abortion or on you know health care which has become very popular i think these senators are going to have to really do their job and listen to their constituents perino or or to may try to pass other laws because if the supreme court justices can apost find that in the constitution they would probably look to congress as well hogue absolutely they aposre they aposre going to have some tough decisions to make perino right ilyse hogue thank you for being with us today we appreciate it hogue thank you dana perino and all eyes will be on the president aposs announcement that aposs tomorrow night 9 00 p m up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to preview that selection and what the president hopes to achieve in his upcoming summit overseas commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i aposve spent the last three days interviewing and thinking about supreme court justices such an important decision and we aposre going to give you a great one we aposre going to announce it on monday end video clip perino president trump building suspense for the announcement of his second supreme court pick in two years and it aposs time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume columnist for the hill juan williams fox news correspondent gillian turner and former republican congressman jason chaffetz brit it aposs a pleasure to have you here today and wanted to ask you about senator mitch mcconnell he aposs taking a bum rap right for being this obstructionist but don apost the democrats deserve some of the blame for the polarization on judges if you go back to bork all the way through harry reid getting rid of the filibuster in 2013 brit hume fox news senior political analyst it has been hardball politics on supreme court nominations at least since bork and arguably you can go back before that and that is a function of the fact that the supreme court has been the source and the other courts as well of so many of the victories that the left has claimed on policy for decades now and a result of that had been of course is there aposs this huge premium now on the supreme court nominees and everybody on in the political branches has pulled out all the stops to see that they can get their nominees confirmed or in the case of some blocked and that aposs where we are and that is what mitch mcconnell has dealt with that aposs what harry reid was trying to deal with but when you get down to it it is hardball politics all the way and has been for the longest time perino and juan conservatives have been galvanized around judicial issues for a really longest time democrats not so much look at what brian fallon who is now with demand justice said in the washington post yesterday he said if trump succeeds in this confirmation fight progressives will learn the hard way of the importance of the courts it aposs unfortunate it might take that for the left to realize the courts are an institution worth fighting for is the concern about a rightward shift in the court about to change that juan williams fox news political analyst i think so i think even now you can see that the perception of a court and i think that aposs largely at stake here because you are going from justice kennedy who was a swing vote he aposs like a guy standing in the middle of the road especially on social issues certainly a conservative but when it came to social issues i aposm thinking here in specific of abortion rights i aposm thinking of gay rights justice kennedy was open to this discussion and i think the public could see that while he could be persuaded one way or another the potential here is for a very conservative justice to be put in place by president trump that would really say to the public no the court really is a rubber stamp for a conservative social agenda and i think that would be not only harmful in terms of public perception of the court which people want to trust but i think it would suggested that to your point liberals or democrats have to would suddenly realize they have to get as activated on this issue as conservatives have been in the past remember the list that president trump is choosing from is basically set by the federalist society you had leonard leo a clip from him on earlier he aposs a key player in this there is no such person on the left perino and jason as the midterms approach i wondered what you thought about the energy around this so it could be that democrats decide to turn out to vote but conservatives turn out to vote in this case as well but a lot of this attention will be on the senate do the senate house republicans run any risk of losing some focus and energy in that regard jason chaffetz former u s congressman r ut i think the enthusiasm gap goes the republican aposs direction one of the best things that donald trump did is put out that list of 20 plus nominees before he was elected and that gave a lot of enthusiasm to a very conservative base that knew that the court has made critical decisions and republicans notoriously have made mistakes in this in the past they aposve put up some nominees who didn apost turn out to be quite so conservative so even though it aposs a house seat they don apost get a vote it aposs the same base of voters that gets enthusiastic and actually shows up to vote even in a midterm election perino well we aposre going to continue to follow this obviously i just want to ask any of you advice you would give to the senate democrats who are running for re election vote early with the president or wait and see if schumer presses them to not vote hume i think the key for them is what the two potential republican no votes do if collins and murkowski break against the nominee that will give political cover to democrats who were in tight re election races to possibly do the same if the republicans hold then i think the heat is really on those people to seat ph trump aposs picks ph perino yes and then you can see like a 54 hume yes you aposd probably get some extra votes as was the case with gorsuch williams but i would add that i think the democratic base that we were just talking about for the first time being activated on this issue is pretty intense so you get someone like senator i think senator hirono of hawaii who said she aposs going to vote against every trump nominee for any court as a result of this vote hume but she can she can do that because she aposs from hawaii which is a which is an absolutely outright blue state perino right williams right but i aposm saying perino but you can apost do that from indiana williams even for red state democrats and here we aposre talking about like joe donnelly in indiana right hume a little bit williams i think that right now the previous vote on a supreme court from a trump nominee ok you guys go ahead we understand said the democratic base said democratic leadership like inaudible perino right i see what you mean williams on this one i don apost think that holds perino they aposre not gillian turner fox news correspondent there are no safe bets in this go round williams right turner there aposs there aposs going to be a fight from dems no matter which of the three or four depending on how you aposre looking at it there aposs no perino it aposs going to be an interesting summer haven apost they all been the last three years turner all right gillian i aposm going to turn to north korea with you on secretary pompeo gets back yesterday he says look i slept very well there aposs progress do you see the north koreans coming forward and saying it aposs regrettable they treat us like gangsters as just a bump in the road or a derailment of the process turner i was thinking it aposs interesting you asked me that question because in my mind earlier what i was thinking to myself is ok is this is this a bump in the road or does this constitute a crisis and i don apost think anybody knows the answer yet i don apost think the administration i don apost think secretary pompeo knows the answer yet and not because he aposs not knowledgeable but because i don apost think it aposs going to take another few weeks for that to become apparent but one thing the administration is doing now is really circling the wagons everybody from secretary pompeo the president heather nauert the state department spokesperson to ambassador john bolton now national security adviser they aposve got a message and the message is to stay cool calm and collected in the face of this whatever whether it aposs a bump in the road or a crisis and to emphasize that it aposs a process and the process is ongoing and the process is on track the first thing that secretary pompeo said yesterday when asked about the foreign ministry comments from the north koreans was they can say whatever basically they can say whatever they want to the press but the process is ongoing look we aposve already got our next meeting set up perino yes yes turner it aposs on july 12th so this is going forward hume somewhere along the way early in this process mike pompeo aposs over there and he aposs talking to these north korean leaders and he get the idea that something is really different this time he may be right he may be wrong so we get we move forward we get to this point the north koreans come out with all of this bluster pompeo seems serene about the whole thing so the question it seems to me the way to access this is who do believe do you believe these north korean spokesman or do you believe mike pompeo in this case in terms of how this meeting went i aposd be inclined to believe pompeo which is by no means to say that all of this is going to end very well and they will denuclearize turner right hume i think that still remains a long shot perino i think they aposre very clear eyed about what they aposre dealing with juan let me ask you about another meeting happening this week president trump will go to a nato meeting and then he aposll have a one on one meeting with putin what do you think the president wants to accomplish in that meeting williams well with putin i think syria aposs the number one issue dana and the question is about how the russians play a role in the middle east are they in fact in linked inevitably with iran and you heard some of this from senator graham in your earlier interview where the idea is that you have to be quite clear with president putin that the united states sees him as an antagonist and someone who aposs stirring the pot and indirectly supporting iran aposs support of terrorist organizations throughout the middle east so this is not in our interest the question is how do you get him how do you break that linkage i think that aposs what senator graham was coming to making it clear to them and the second part of it and i was surprised to hear senator graham say this you aposve got to be quite direct with them about interference in our elections and we can apost get president trump yet to say directly hey putin stop it perino we aposll see what he says what did you make of the questions about turkey and what the congress might do the frustration as i understand it on the hill is very high chaffetz no it is because look on the one one hand we aposve delivered i believe it aposs two f 35 aposs on their way to nearly 100 but at the same time turkey is now signaling that they may want to purchase those s 400s which is with you know the interoperability in interacting with our nato allies is pivotal to this so erdogan is going to be there for a long time i aposm glad senator lindsey graham was there but this all comes it aposs multidimensional chess here and going back to juan aposs point i want to make this really quickly about about putin i do think donald trump is right the president needs to have a good working relationship but people on both sides of the aisle want to see president trump take a much tougher stance with vladimir putin and say you can apost meddle with our elections you can apost be doing what you aposre doing in syria and we are going to stand our ground and right now you aposve all you aposve seen from donald trump is acquiescing to putin and saying well you know you can take crimea because you know they speak russian that makes no sense to a lot of us perino brit presidents go on foreign trips they usually it aposs high stakes my theory is there aposs always something happening at home that then you have to try to deal with so you aposre working overtime but how important is this trip for president trump at this point in his presidency hume well it aposs a big deal both for the first part of the trip and for the putin visit all eyes will be on the putin visit because of the suspicion held to this day in many quarters that he really has a has a has a desire to really snuggle up to putin and permit and he thinks putin can be a great ally and partner of his i aposve i aposve long thought that aposs fanciful but i think he believes that perino right hume and and his behavior toward putin on this and the body language and all of it is going to be very interesting to watch and the other thing of course is will he have a smooth and harmonious meeting with the with the allies ahead of that that aposs an open question so it aposs a big deal perino gillian we have 30 seconds left what do you think on that point do you think that this i think my i believe that it will probably be smoother than we think but who knows turner same issues are on the table as the last as the same the last time we have this conversation a year ago it aposs the syrian civil war like juan said it aposs election interference cyber warfare and start two ph perino all right turner those are the issues they aposve got to talk about perino well thanks panel we aposll see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the rising star in the republican party bringing new ideas and leadership to congress commercial break perino millennials have become the largest segment of our workforce and are becoming the largest segment of u s voters and while they are very negative about washington as we told you last november one of their own is trying to change that here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape rep elise stefanik r new york no i wasn apost scared i wanted to get some accomplishments under my belt chris wallace fox anchor voice over that aposs elise stefanik explaining why she turned me down for a power player profile three years ago when at age 30 she became the youngest woman ever elected to congress stefanik i wanted to make sure that my first impression to my colleagues is that i am a workhorse i invest myself in learning about the policy issues and i add substantive ideas to the discussion i rise today in strong support of the conference report for the national defense authorization act wallace representing fort drum in upstate new york stefanik is a member of the house intelligence and armed services committees and as a republican she wrote a change to obamacare that president obama signed barack obama former u s president there you go stefanik i wrote and passed the largest fix to our health care law and my first term we need a new direction wallace running on the slogan new ideas and new leadership stefanik campaigned on people aposs frustration with congress stefanik i would ask every group that i met with raise your hand if you think washington is broken every hand would go up wallace part of her answer use technology and transparency to make congress more accountable stefanik i use the example of posting votes on facebook that aposs using a new tool to reach out directly to constituents and hear back from them on every single vote that something every member should be doing wallace on camera is there any pinch me quality of that you are a united states congresswoman stefanik there are pinch me moments every day when i walk in and see the capitol dome wallace voice over stefanik started in politics a while ago stefanik i ran for student council secretary in sixth grade and i ran on the platform of bringing a snack machine and that is very popular among wallace on camera i was going to say i figure you won stefanik i won wallace voice over she worked two years in the bush 43 white house on domestic policy stefanik and that aposs the approach i aposll bring to washington wallace then in 2014 she ran for congress wallace on camera how much pushback did you get you aposre too young you aposre too inexperienced stefanik i got a lot of pushback initially very few people took me seriously paul ryan actually was one of the individuals that encouraged me and gave me great advice you have two ears and one mouth use it in that ratio listen to what voters concerns are wallace voice over stefanik won her swing district by 22 points and in 2016 was re elected by 35 points wallace on camera is it true that when he first got here you got stopped a lot stefanik i did and i still get stopped about once a month going back and forth to the floor to vote and if i wasn apost wearing my pen there would be many votes that i would have missed wallace voice over stefanik is not just young she aposs a maverick often bucking the party line she voted against the gop tax bill in november because it eliminates the state and local income tax deduction important to new yorkers and that aposs not all stefanik i aposve introduced the republican resolution that climate change is happening and we need to find a solution wallace while stefanik has had an impressive start in congress she doesn apost plan to be there forever stefanik i do think institutionally congress benefits from having a churn of new members and new ideas so i don apost see myself being here for 25 30 years wallace on camera but maybe 15 or 20 stefanik i don apost know i aposm thinking you know every two year cycle i need to go out there and make sure that i continue to earn the support from my constituents end videotape perino now stefanik is trying to get more women to run for congress as the head of recruitment at the nrcc she
