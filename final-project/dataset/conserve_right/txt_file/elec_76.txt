perspective https www youtube com watch v yuj5oi fgka it s like we re testing the proposition that candidates themselves don t matter that the only thing that matters is their party affiliation that s my take on why the dems nominated hillary the 2012 election gave them the numbers that showed romney was off by a few points on his 47 remark and the dems had a permanent ruling coalition hillary didn t actually have to be a candidate somebody that could appeal to cross overs moderates or independents in order to win in the general since the dem primary was the de facto presidential election the dems didn t nominate hillary for her electability they nominated her for her governability she knows the game and the players she knows where the bodies are buried and which closets have skeletons she knows who can be bought and sold and she knows their price she can hit the ground running and get things done from day one bernie was a threat to that because he was coming up with these crazy appealing ideas that had zero chance of getting implemented when the dems didn t care about appealing ideas because they don t need appealing ideas to get elected bernie s some sort of idealist who has absolutely no connections and no juice at the highest levels no more so than donald trump or gary johnson all your ideas may be great but how you gonna implement them when the only way to get the real ptb on your side is to know exactly whose balls you gotta squeeze and whose balls you gotta stroke to get some action out of them you think those crooks give a rat s ass about good ideas all they wanna know is what s in it for me and they want that answer in the form of a number dollars or votes it s very much like the italian mafia from what i have read it is worth noting that no small number of the 47 are republicans or republican leaning and no small number of the 53 are democrats or democrat leaning paying taxes doesn t automatically make you want to lower them any more than not paying taxes makes you automatically want to raise them incentives are statistically powerful but not deterministic also individuals have more and other incentives in their lives besides taxes i m sure you know this but your analysis seems kind of simplistic and the federal income tax is far from the only tax the 47 pay plenty of taxes just not federal income taxes and taxes hurt worse when you re poor someone who s already struggling with property tax sales tax gas tax excise taxes etc reacts with mild hostility when they get told well you don t currently pay any taxes to us so we re just gonna fix that little oversight good points also voter turnout rates rise as income does so even if 47 of the potential electorate doesn t pay income taxes that percentage is lower for the actual electorate the dems nominated hillary leaving aside all the leverage she has in hte party for one reason her vagina they are too far gone in identity politics to nominate a white male to lead the ticket unless there is practically no one else available they are counting on her to bring in new crossover female voters like obama brought in new crossover minority voters that s it imo they now have a formula and the head of the ticket has to be a minority or a woman the formula is driven by their identity politics and by an electoral calculation all the leverage she has in hte party i assume you meant all the leverage she has in hate party i don t think that s a reasonable conclusion to draw from the 2012 election obama was far from a worst case candidate for the democrats and romney wasn t a best case candidate for the gop either and while it wasn t a nailbiter it was fairly close by historical standards not too many presidents have won reelection more narrowly than obama did and this cycle i think hillary was very vulnerable to republican candidates other than trump kasich was killing her in hypothetical general election matchups and rubio was beating her as well even at the same time she was up big on trump i think rand would have had a good chance as well if he had won the nomination maybe cruz if he generated high turnout or perhaps even jeb if he got past his last name well trump may be uniquely horrible but you re fooling yourself thinking the media wouldn t have seen to it that everybody heard whoever the gop nominated was literally worse than hitler heck whitebread moderate rino mitt romney got slagged for once having a pet carrier on his car so did we when i was a kid suggesting his campaign could write off about 47 of the electorate because there was no way they were voting for him no matter what which is true the free shit brigade only votes for free shit and answering the question of how many women he d appoint to high positions by mentioning that he had binders full of good candidates and the media did their like with a cloth thing by pretending he meant he kept women in a binder and that along with candy crowley helping out obama at the debate was enough to fix in the liv s minds that mitt was a monster you don t need to fool all of the people all of the time when some of the people some of the time gets the job done just fine i agree that the media would demonize the gop nominee regardless but that has little to do with what romney said in the 47 comment and it doesn t mean the democrats have a guaranteed spot in the white house despite all his flaws and controversies trump was almost tied with clinton before the first debate i think it s crazy to think that no other candidate could have done better than that and wouldn t have crashed and burned from the debates and the latest scandals suggesting his campaign could write off about 47 of the electorate because there was no way they were voting for him no matter what which is true the free shit brigade only votes for free shit this isn t true no matter how many times romney you or anyone else says it not paying income tax doesn t mean you vote democrat and paying income tax doesn t mean there s a 90 chance you vote republican that binary distinction doesn t automatically determine your opinion on tax policy and yes people do vote for reasons other than taxes it baffles me why some libertarians of all people attach so much moral worth to a person based on whether or not the us federal government decides they owe them money the 47 number doesn t even apply to the voting electorate because people with higher incomes have much higher turnout rates than people with lower incomes do romney there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what all right there are 47 percent who are with him who are dependent upon government who believe that they are victims who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them who believe that they are entitled to health care to food to housing to you name it that that s an entitlement and the government should give it to them and they will vote for this president no matter what that s how romney started off that comment 47 of the electorate ain t voting for me no matter what so why bother wasting my time trying to get them to vote for me how is that not just good common sense why would you spend a lot of time trying to get hard core dems to vote for you you don t have a right to food and housing and medical care or college or a job or anything else the left keeps pushing as human rights they ain t rights as long as somebody else has to provide them but 47 of the electorate thinks it s the governments job to provide them with free shit and hillary s got that 47 locked up or would have if the gop weren t running a democrat promising free shit too he got the 47 figure based on the of filers who don t pay income tax he may be right that there are some people in the electorate are like that but that doesn t mean his assertion that it s 47 based on the number that don t pay income tax is accurate i think the actual point is a bit different than the one you are arguing against if a candidate says they will cut entitlements they will almost certainly lose most of the votes of the people dependent on those entitlements and as you know it is almost political suicide to even say that you will look into the possibility of making them more efficient the msm immediately brings out the starving kids and old people wailing and gnashing of teeth however both clinton and trump know what to do just promise to spend more and more but you are right it is not about income or taxes as much as people want their free stuff or even their social security that they think they ve earned gillespie have you not seen this in all governments and corporations involved in the arms deals approved by clinton s state department have delivered between 54 million and 141 million to the clinton foundation as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to the clinton family according to foundation and state department records hillary clinton oversaw us arms deals to clinton foundation donors mother jones http www motherjones com pol arms deals hillary s lying is the least of her problems i wish hillary were merely a liar she took money from foreign governments while she was secretary of state lying who cares about lying when the truths she says are so vile why can t trump just run that as an ad i wonder go with it as the single message for a few cycles jam it up the msm s ass she and her family took in around 100mm from from companies and governments that needed and got hillary s approval for deals who cares about the details what else do you need to know to know this woman should not be allowed anywhere near the presidency and if they insist that it was ok because it went to the foundation then pivot to that what the hell has the foundation accomplished with all this money sadly i think its too late in the game for this ploy but it might be the best one he has left in a lot of industries there are strict rules governing acceptance of gifts services etc in order to avoid appearances of corruption conflicts of interest unethical behavior etc even if in many cases there might not be actual corrupt or unethical behavior involved even if the foundation donations were unrelated didn t benefit the donors or the clintons personally etc it still creates terrible appearances and it says a lot that a sitting secretary of state doesn t give a shit about that it s so awful nobody may have thought to make a law against it they just thought the world would never get so insane that a secretary of state who took money from foreign governments could ever be elected president that s the true meaning of the word unconscionable there are laws they just only apply to the little people a mid level bureaucrat would be raked over the coals fired and possibly even jailed if they so much as accepted a box of donuts from a contractor that could stand to benefit from that bureaucrat s decisions mid level bureaucrats literally lay awake nights worrying about that kind of thing what about the cash payments to family members chelsea got a 600 000 deal to do one one hour segment for msnbc back when msnbc was owned by ge and ge 1 had defense contracts to foreign governments pending for hillary s approval and 2 ge according to that link had already given hillary a million through the foundation just weeks before having their sales approved hammer home the cash payments to hillary s family they ve all been reported through both the foundation documents and the publicly available reports of the state department itself a bank robbery is still a bank robbery even if it s done unmasked and in broad daylight and taking money from foreign governments while secretary of state is still taking money from foreign governments while secretary of state even if it s done in broad daylight and reported by the state department i don t know why trump doesn t articulate this stuff better either except his campaign is not well funded for advertising still he should begin and end every speech with this hillary took money from foreign governments while she was the secretary of state hillargo delenda est hrc s first name derives from the latin hilarius and would end in a in the feminine nominative singular case so hilaria delenda est kevin r calling on his inner john cleese romanes eunt domes bo rrrring how you gonna fit that on a bumpersticker or into an eight second sound bite ain t nobody got time for all that so the media will just pass over it with a quick reminder that anything bad you hear about clinton is just lies and propaganda spread by the russians in an attempt to influence the election and did we mention the 412 times we told you about the time trump said something crazy let s look at the video one more time bumper sticker not seeing it eight second sound bite what s wrong with hillary clinton approved arms deals while she was secretary of state after being paid tens of millions of dollars by foreign governments and gunrunners well i can see you have no future in the news biz if you can t come up with a convenient excuse not to cover any negative news of hillary in fact it almost looks like you re deliberately trying to be fair and balanced and that sort of nonsense will get you nowhere fast i have been on the fence for quite a while the first presidential election since i was old enough to vote that i was unsure of what i was going to do this late but i have fucking had it with hillary i am voting for fucking trump and i don t give a fuck fuck that corrupt lying treasonous fucking hag trump is an ass and a boor and nowhere close to a libertarian but at this point i think i would vote for fucking genghis khan to keep that bitch out of the white house yep fuck her and the entire lot of enabling whore media my thoughts exactly it s not about supporting trump it s about punishing a corrupt politician and a corrupt media donald trump may not deserve to win but hillary and her media allies certainly deserve to lose if that means holding my nose and voting trump then so be it to put it another way trump may not be the president we deserve but he is the giant fuck you the media and the elites need the mammal with the hair is exactly what you stoooooopid insipid bi ped meat popcicles deserve at some point you ll recognize that it s not a trump problem it s a gop problem their electorate put him there and continue to defend him so do the supposed libertarian commenters here he is unhinged listen to his rally today and the gop electorate put him there and will vote for him actually many of the libertarian commenters here sound like they will vote for him i know the conspiracy theorists here think democrats put him there which is laughable you all hung your hat with the gop see rand paul you deserve him cool story bro yes it was all due to the gop electorate there was nothing else operating there nothing at all they voted for him are you suggesting democrats made them do it note the constant complaints from the clinton camp about all the free publicity trump gets from the media and how much that helps him all by itself trump barely campaigned at all he didn t spend any money to speak of the republican establishment and media were entirely against him and did not take him seriously he could have been completely ignored and he would now be a half remembered joke from last year yet the dominant media outlets which we now know with absolute certainty were taking direction from the clinton campaign gave trump hundreds of millions of dollars worth of free publicity and as ken notes below a pretty small percentage of registered republicans actually supported trump so the narrative that trump is 100 an outgrowth of the republican base and was in no way pumped up by democrat operatives in the media is pretty weak tea i still think it s weak sauce to push the blame elsewhere and if you read the memo you see that they want to promote the extreme candidates because they believe them to actually be the mainstream of the party also this memo was before trump announced he was running and before all the controversies of this cycle the main reasons at that time that he d be viewed as an extreme candidate who they d want to face were his birtherism activities which were in line with what a huge part if not a majority of the gop base believed and his general reputation as at best an eccentric reality tv star billionaire with no political experience i don t think the media just covered trump to help clinton he was fantastic for ratings he attracted attention that other candidates just didn t they could have covered him all they want but if republican voters weren t interested in what he was selling it would have had limited effectiveness agreed it s not nearly as simple as either proposition i e to dismiss as laughable the idea that the democrats and the media had anything to do with helping trump into his position or to claim that the democrats and the media are the only reason trump was successful his supporters obviously support him and have to take primary responsibility for him that s just a given believe me i m no fan of the gop and rarely will rise to defend them what i m reacting too is jackand s assertion that people here supported rand paul rand paul is a republican the republican electorate nominated trump so therefore we are somehow responsible for trump as part of this republican electorate whose fault trump is i was snarkily raising the point that if anything his people had more of a hand in creating trump than we did yeah i agree that jackand s point about rand paul was stupid as ken ignores below when the gop race came down to just 2 or 3 candidates trump still won and fairly easily and he gains right now nearly 70 popularity among republicans your defense of the gop is duly noted on this libertarian website he gains right now nearly 70 popularity among republicans among those who are left yes your defense of the gop is duly noted on this libertarian website why are you keeping some kind of list for future gulags when did i defend the gop i pointed out that the democratic party assisted in bringing us their awful awful candidate how is that a defense of the gop by the way ken has yet said how many democrats voted for trump in the open primaries do you know this country is divided fairly equally in thirds dems reps and independents which includes libertarians when ken says open primaries went for a trump he assumes dems did that i could assume independents did that including libertarians in fact i don t know any dems voting for a trump reading these pages there are plenty libertarians voting for a trump see bear above he won 13 of 16 states with open primaries he lost as many as he won in closed primaries that might be dismissed if trump were championing traditional republican causes but he wasn t going big on fiscal conservatism or prayer in public schools trump was championing traditional democrat causes like anti free trade and the immigrants terk er jerbs meanwhile it isn t surprising to see traditional blue collar democrats fleeing the progressive leadership of the democratic party after all the progressives have been demonizing blue collar whites for being homophobic for being christian stupid for being unreceptive to global warming racist for being white islamophobic etc for the past eight years after eight years of being demonized by progressives why wouldn t white blue collar middle class voters flee the democratic party and cling to trump in the primaries let me know how many dems crossed over and voted for trump until then you re guessing and i could make just as valid a guess and say independents like libertarians crossed over and voted for him but guess what u wouldn t do that because it s fantasy it s republicans who own him lock stock and barrel that s an interesting question if trump winning the primaries is somehow indicative of some issue in the republican party which issue is it did republicans flock to trump because of his stated opposition to the iraq war trump ran as a democrat on every issue but political correctness which isn t really an issue he won in the primaries as a coalition of republicans who are disgusted by political correctness and people who have traditionally been democrats and in many cases remain registered democrats he sure as hell didn t win by campaigning on traditional republican issues so why would i think there s anything especially republican about him trump is to the left of bill clinton even if trump did run as a democrat he got elected as the republican nominee so it reflects on republicans that s also an exaggeration for a few reasons trump did propose tax cuts and some other aspects of his economic plan were in line with normal republican policy though others weren t he at least paid lip service on abortion and gay marriage even if they weren t big issues for him his immigration policy is much more in line with standard republican or conservative views these days than democratic or liberal views and even on free trade republicans today have a less positive view of it than democrats do there has long been a segment of the right that s pro protectionism and the republican party was for a long time from the mid 1800s to the mid 1900s it s not uniquely a left wing position even if trump did run as a democrat he got elected as the republican nominee so it reflects on republicans in what way uh he was elected by republican voters and he was put up for nomination by the republican party and won because republican voters voted for him and yet channeling flip wilson the devil made them do it trump won because registered democrats voted for him he won 13 of 16 states with open primaries because those were the states where democrats could vote for him of the 3 open primaries he lost two of them were lost to his rivals home states he lost to kasich in ohio and he lost to cruz in texas trump did especially well in open primary rust belt states like michigan illinois and indiana trump won in democratic strongholds with open primaries like vermont and massachusetts average people may think of themselves as republican because they like trump and despise hillary but if they voted for obama kerry gore and bill clinton and they re still registered as democrats they re just talking about how they see themselves at the moment in relation to the republican candidate it might be different if they were changing their minds about free trade and immigration but when they vote for trump they re keeping their union mentality on all those issues dey terk er jerbs trump lost in states with closed primaries trump did not run on republican issues trump ran on democrat issues trump won big in states with open primaries all the data we have shows the wind blowing in the same direction polling requires people to self report their party identification we have secret ballots in this country if you won t see the truth unless we check every voter s registration card and follow every one of them individually into the voting booth with a camera then you re just being willfully blind the inference from the facts we have are plain as day you just don t like what they say for whatever reason ken are you ever going to acknowledge the point i made that this article you link was written in the middle of the primaries and that trump s best performances were in mostly closed primaries in the northeast in april and that this supports my notion that the open closed disparity early in the primaries was from geographic differences in the states that have open and closed contests trump dominated both open and closed contests in the northeast and the south these states mostly had open contests in the first half of the race but he won southern states other than texas cruz s home state with closed primaries and in april he crushed northeastern states with closed primaries he is the guy who says climate change is a hoax the guy who says anyone muslim should be banned a wall should be built women should be punished for abortions who wants tax cuts for the rich and corporations i could go on that guy even if non republicans provided the winning margin it s on the republicans in those states for opening their primaries to others even if opening the republican primaries up to registered democrats was a mistake trump s winning the primaries on the backs of disaffected democrats still doesn t tell us much about the larger republican party if anything it tells us about what s happening in the democratic party they re bleeding support from the traditional base so heavily that in a field split six ways to sunday they re able to overwhelm the republican primaries and impact the outcome and it was a brilliant move by the democrats they got to forever shed the hard hat socially conservative economically liberal types and become the euro style part of social democracy that they ve always wanted to be in the process the trump era gop has metastasized into a euro style christian democrat party long story short classical liberalism is dead deader than the dodo if anyone but trump were running against hillary we d be looking at republican control of the house the senate the white house and the control of both houses of enough state legislatures to propose constitutional amendments no planning involved chasing your own base out of the party isn t a smart strategy this landed in the democrats lap they just got lucky if anyone but trump were running against hillary i hate to break it to you but cruz is hitler too and rubio what we are seeing is the scorched earth politics of personal destruction writ large the democrats would have smeared other candidates with the same paint but not as much of it would have stuck sadly they would have covered trump a lot anyway since he is entertaining in his own way shocking vulgar anti pc a loud mouth snake oil salesman etc what s not to like in terms of getting ratings at some point you ll recognize that it s not a trump problem it s a gop problem their electorate put him there and continue to defend him there are a whole laundry list of problems with that statement let s start with the fact that only 9 of the american people voted in the primaries and then note that a majority of republicans voted for someone other than trump http www nytimes com interac inton html http www realclearpolitics c count html 9 is the percentage of people who voted for trump or clinton not the that voted in the primaries altogether trump has a 67 approval rating among republicans http m washingtontimes com n ryan poll right now hillary has a 55 unfavorable rating http www gallup com poll 161 news aspx how many of those people support trump with nose clamps on their tightest setting because they hate hilary more from the same link 33 have a favorable view of trump assuming all of trump s supporters are republicans which is a bad assumption that means half of the people you re calling trump supporters have an unfavorable view of trump you re just seeing what you want to see and dems how many support trump that s your contention give these two articles a read first there s the nyt burying the lead mr trump fares best among people who identify as republicans but nonetheless remain registered democrats or have a history of voting in democratic primaries a legacy of their previous political allegiances according to data from civis analytics a democratic firm one result is that mr trump s strength mirrors that of the democrats in the middle part of the last century it may seem odd to see massachusetts paired with mississippi as the top two states for mr trump but it s something the democrats pulled off quite regularly from 1928 until the passage of the civil rights act http www nytimes com 2016 03 oters html then cnbc talking about the actual results of the primaries in those open primaries trump has come out ahead in 13 out of 16 states in states with closed primaries trump won only six out of 14 states overall trump has won closed states about half as often as he s won those open states http www cnbc com 2016 03 22 aries html do the math yourself ken if you read cohn s entire article he talks about how trump has a lot of appeal among the type of republican primary voters who would have been democrats decades ago but that doesn t mean these people are modern democrats who just jumped on board the gop because trump was running he even mentions that a lot of these voters have been voting republican in presidential elections for decades one of the regions he mentions is the south a place that has been reliably republican at the presidential level for decades in recent years republicans have gotten 70 90 of the white vote in presidential elections in most southern states at what point are these people no longer democrats and are now republicans people change their political affiliations and voting habits it s a fact of life and this is about the fifth time i ve responded to the open primary thing and i don t think you ve ever even acknowledged my response states that had open primaries tended to be located in geographically favorable territory like the south and the northeast the only closed contest at least as of the time that article was written in either area that trump lost was in maine which had a caucus where cruz tended to outperform in general take a look at the exit polls from the open primaries trump won solidly among republicans not just independents and democrats the very article you linked shows that trump did better with republicans than independents in open primaries also since your article was from the middle of the primaries i looked it up and after that article was written trump has a string of huge crushing victories in mostly closed primary states in april that essentially clinched the nomination for him namely new york pennsylvania connecticut maryland and delaware all closed primaries lends further credence to my argument that geography was more important than whether a contest was open or closed plenty of conservative and moderate voters in the big east coast cities register as dems in order to vote in the democratic primary for local elections as the gop opposition is so weak that winning the d primary is tantamount to election trump himself has registered as a democrat more than once http www thesmokinggun com b ory 567920 that s not as big a deal elsewhere for example in wisconsin not only is there no party registration and an open primary but local races mayor city council etc are non partisan with a 2 stage election multi candidate primary and 2 candidate runoff the only people who are actual party members are the ones who send for a party card and may pay dues crossing over to cause mischief in a party you dislike is trivially easy and if you don t mind losing your vote in your party that day you can yeah that the new york times is reluctant to accept that progressives are chasing their own traditional base out of the party and into the arms of trump shouldn t be surprising you saw the same kind of rhetoric when carter era democrats chased the same demographics out of the democraic party and into the arms of ronald reagan that was the exact same dynamic at work reagan democrats no longer saw the democratic party as champions of their working class aspirations but instead saw them as working primarily for the benefit of others the very poor feminists the unemployed african americans latinos and other groups https en wikipedia org wiki reagan democrat that was written about white blue collar middle class voters in 1980 but it might as well have been written about white blue collar middle class voters today and i assure you the nyt was just as much in denial then about what was happening as they are today ken most of those people have been voting republican since the 80s or earlier white non college educated people haven t been the bulk of the democratic base for decades and they re nonetheless poised to win a 3rd straight presidential election these people are republicans now i can t and no one else can but you let me know how many dems crossed over and while you re at it how many independents waiting you want somebody to have checked the actual registration of every primary voter and then followed each and every one of them into the booth with a camera we have secret ballots in this country polling has to rely on self reporting we can rely on inference though it s what reasonable people do we take the facts we have and we make logical inferences that isn t what you re doing though you re closing your eyes sticking your fingers in your ears and going la la la la la la la which isn t surprising why would a progressive want to believe that progressivism is driving the democratic base out of the party 33 have an unfavorable view not a favorable view also that number was lower before pussygate i don t even understand what you re objecting to the point is that if 55 of the american people see hillary unfavorably then jack s 67 support for trump among registered republicans could just as easily be interpreted as opposition to hillary rather than support for trump specifically i certainly don t support trump but i prefer him to hillary because hillary took money from foreign governments while she was the secretary of state i was correcting what you wrote reread the comment i replied to it says 33 favorable not unfavorable though that may have just been a typo on your part in the polls favorability is a separate question from who you re voting for you can still say you re voting for trump while having an unfavorable opinion of him and some republicans are doing that also trump s numbers were similar or better well before he wrapped up the nomination and became clinton s opponent so that reasoning doesn t explain it no i wrote it correctly 33 of the american people have a favorable view of trump 62 have an unfavorable view check the link http www gallup com poll 161 news aspx a large number of registered republicans are voting for trump in spite of the fact that they do not like him the reason they are supporting trump despite the fact that they do not like him is because hillary clinton is a crook i don t like donald trump but i prefer him to hillary because she took money from foreign governments while she was the secretary of state that means i m pretty typical it also means that jack ace is talking out his ass when he tries to extend anything about trump to the republican party itself hell even the republican leadership is trying to distance themselves from trump they aren t doing that because he s so popular with and typical of their base oh ok i thought you meant 33 of republicans had a favorable view still my point stands that his favorability with republicans was solidly positive well before he was the nominee by the way rand paul endorsed trump has he walked that back yet i don t think so he is like the commenters here http www buzzfeed com natemc diqompmaa sane and rational able to weigh trump s pecadilloes against hillary s criminal career rationally probably so he kept his word and supported the nominee like he said he would has he campaigned for trump was he at the convention has he said anything favorable about trump at all so he is invoking reagan s 11th commandment his choice and certainly not the worst thing in the world but doesn t influence whom i m voting for his choice and certainly not the worst thing in the world but doesn t influence whom i m voting for agreed rand is still a republican albeit one who doesn t suck as much as most that s the courage he displays johnson is out there you know it apparently rand paul s choice in how he is playing it you mad bro that s the courage he displays johnson is out there you know johnson is a member of a different party and didn t sign a pledge to vote for the republican nominee rand s first mistake was joining the republican party and seeking their nomination the route he took from there was imho the most honorable one he had left for himself have a wonderful weekend you as well jack and ace has a hard time imagining that hillary is unpopular but that s delusional hillary has had around a 55 unfavorable rating since january according to gallup and according to gallup hillary hasn t had a favorable rating above 50 since july of 2014 two thousand fourteen she s wildly unpopular most of everyone hates her and you can see why she s a corruption magnate she s been knee deep in corruption since her days in little rock she can t help herself and everyone knows it that s why america hates hillary that s why republicans support trump speak for yourself the only advantage to a trump presidency would be photos of his wife i ll be in my bunk you all hung your hat with the gop see rand paul you deserve him i agree with the statement that every nation gets the government it deserves if that is the point you are making but i m not clear on whom you mean when you say you all all people who don t support clinton support trump how many times to joe amsoc and tony have to explain this to you 42 42 unless jack is voting for stein he s hung his hat with the dems and he deserves herself its funny jack is a pretty classic braindead partisan locked into a manichean worldview where you are either for his candidate or for the other major party candidate he can t process anything that doesn t fall into that very simple two dimensional world sadly neither can a great many other americans ain t that the truth sadly shakes head one more then its happy hour what those of us who don t live in a simple two dimensional world see is that our two major parties which are pretty much our political ecosystem have both catastrophically failed this year as evidenced by their candidates neither trump nor clinton would ever have been nominated by a politically party that wasn t very deeply dysfunctional their dysfunctions are different but i don t think there is any escaping the conclusion that our duopoly is a failed institution but if you are a 2d partisan you can t see that because you can t admit that your team is deeply dysfunctional and a failed institution but if you are a 2d partisan you can t see that because you can t admit that your team is deeply dysfunctional and a failed institution i think that gets it right to a certain extent specifically i think jack s problem is that he doesn t want to believe that progressive sjws in the democratic party are anything but popular he certainly doesn t want to believe that progressives are chasing the white blue collar middle class out of the democratic party tent on the republican side i think we re seeing something different there s a huge influx of disaffected traditional democrats but they happened to show up at a time when the republican party is in transition republicans like cruz rubio rand paul paul ryan etc were the young upstarts just a year ago the republican party was in transition but that probably wasn t indicative of dysfunction that these tea party firebrands had risen up in the republican hierarchy was a healthy thing if republicans were vulnerable to a guy like trump because the old dysfunctional establishment was still coming to terms with the fact that they weren t driving the bus anymore then trump may have interrupted a transition but it was a healthy process he interrupted semi ot i want to download an mp3 of this podcast for my mobile device but there s no link i mail myself a link to this page and to the podcast on soundcloud and click it on my phone and it says it s not available on mobile why it s a talk radio show isn t mobile where talk radio thrives why make me sit at a computer to listen to it the dylan podcast too bah what am i overlooking also would be nice if the home page links to pieces that are mostly audio and video would consistently indicate that here s the way i look at it as long as trump destroys the gop i m fine with that but getting trump elected is not going to destroy the gop it s going to save the gop it ll just no longer be a place for fiscal conservatives or anybody who doesn t believe government is the answer to all our problems you re just going to have the red state socialist party and the blue state socialist party arguing over what the government should be spending our grandchildren s money on and sooner or later one way or another you run out of other people s money and then it gets ugly might as well get on with it now while there s still something worth salvaging good podcast except for the anti russian bs what is our foreign policy nick cmon we all know our foreign policy is to drone kill whoever potus wants to kill regardless of anything including due process in the case of americans and according to him he is good at it we send soldiers and sf guys to all corners of the world and say we have no boots on the ground as well as shoot missiles into yemen so the saudis can kill people who have the bad judgement to go to a wedding eli is a delusional obamabot and if he gets his way we will get more of this idiocy with the most corrupt person to ever run for president at the helm fuck eli and all yammering nitwits like him ken most of those people have been voting republican since the 80s or earlier white non college educated people haven t been the bulk of the democratic base for decades those people are republicans now sorry this was supposed to be a reply up thread white non college educated people haven t been the bulk of the democratic base for decades they were more or less the same between parties only 8 years ago whether they were the bulk of anyone s base is sort of irrelevant what do you mean anyway primary voters share of registered voters the ones who actually show up if you read too much of the media bullshit you get the impression the demographic differences between gop and dnc are enormous the fact is that they have routinely swapped cohorts and that they actually overlap in large degrees with the same populations 60 40 is actually a huge split and yet its still mostly a shared population if there s any group that is demographically locked up its blacks everyone else is shared and fluid three things 1 2008 was a very favorable year for the democrats 2 most of the change in that came from 2008 2012 not the last 4 years so there s little to suggest trump has ushered in a movement 3 when it comes to presidential politics which party people vote for is more important than which party they identify with and as you can see from this source aside from bill clinton s 2 victories republicans have resoundingly won the non college educated white vote in every election since 1980 http www prri org spotlight e degrees and my point about the bulk thing is that ken has this narrative that he won t let go where white working class democrats the base in his mind of the party have mass defected this cycle to vote for trump and they were responsible for trump winning the nomination not republicans i m just pointing out that this isn t true and that he s largely relying on outdated stereotypes about each party the chart here shows that dem gop split of white people with no college degree was basically the same going back decades contra your point there was little difference in that pop until after obama got elected you were acting as though there were some exodus from the democratic party a long time ago its simply not true your linked source is about election exit polls not the total share of the vote represented by each party which is exactly the sort of misunderstanding of s i was talking about above people take limited information and make sweeping statements about populations which are basically untrue its stupidity created by treating your weeny media sources as more significant than they really are when you step back from these silly political bean counting exercises you ll grasp that the blue red city country dichotomy much hemmed hawed about by the media and the characterizations of the hordes of uneducated white rural voters is mostly an oversimplification which feeds the cultural biases of the urban political wonk class they want to believe in these sorts of monolithic cultural distinctions when they re mostly invented in their own minds though a mix of over weighting of polling like what you cite and their limited understanding of the country outside their own narrow milieu i think the problem here is similar to the way college campuses are reported about these days we read 100s of stores about safe spaces and microaggressions and rape culture and you get the impression that universities are dominated by this identity politics bullshit 24 7 and no one has time for any actual schooling between the title ix investigations when the reality is while real that crap is just maybe 5 of what s actually going on in universities yes it happens but the fact is that the way media looks at the stuff creates an impression of significance way out of proportion with reality thats basically what im saying about the way pundits talk about demographic groups in the us everyone wants to pretend that cohorts behave in monolithic ways and there are 100 stories repeating these same claims about the disaffected white vote which is really mostly just an exercise in projection its a 15 20 slight difference in behavior not a cultural bloc its people who dont know anyone voting for trump who need to imagine who those people are they cant accept that they might actually be mostly normal people more or less the same as themselves so they publish all these bullshit photo montages of trump rallies and only publish the pics of the fat people and the old people and trucker hats they look for evidence confirming their internal narratives your linked source is about election exit polls not the total share of the vote represented by each party which is exactly the sort of misunderstanding of s i was talking about above what are you talking about election exit polls measure the share of the vote each party receives your sources are talking about how people identify which does not necessarily determine how they vote a lot of those people may be the types that voted for conservative democrats in the south at the local or state level but voted republican for president for all of that change in party identification from 2008 to 2012 romney only did a few points better than mccain did among whites with no college degree also your source only goes back to 92 if you went back 2 or 3 more decades the democrats would have a massive advantage among both groups of non college whites that disappeared as they became even with hs or less and consistently behind among some college if you went back 2 or 3 more decades oh shut up you said there was some mass migration of white non college educated people to the gop decades ago e g white non college educated people haven t been the bulk of the democratic base for decades those people are republicans now i pointed out that both parties had equal share of this population going back 30 years exit polls from a handful of cherry picked elections isnt evidence of your claim which is making silly generalizations about a large share of the population go ahead an niggle with ken about any other point im just saying your own generalizations are in error oh shut up you said there was some mass migration of white non college educated people to the gop decades ago first off relax secondly i don t see how your link disproves whites without a college education were historically like 40 years ago a solidly democratic voting bloc so if they were 50 50 in 1992 then that means there was a pretty large migration to the gop thirdly this discussion has been about presidential elections and thus voting habits in those elections are imo more important than identification among registered voters many of whom don t even vote much as you can see from the link i provided that group has voted about 60 40 republican in presidential elections since 1980 aside from 92 and 96 when they voted 50 50 but even those 50 50 numbers are well below what the democrats got from this group before 1980 was my comment an oversimplification yeah sure i ll admit to that i wasn t writing a master s thesis i was making a statement to someone who i ve been in a debate with on and off for months on an internet message board who stubbornly refuses to acknowledge evidence that contradicts his argument i ll admit to using an oversimplification in that context ken has this narrative that he won t let go where white working class democrats the base in his mind of the party have mass defected this cycle to vote for trump and they were responsible for trump winning the nomination not republicans there s some truth to this nyt atlantic and others have run stories saying that some of the strongest trump voters in the primaries were people who voted for democrats in the last few elections but again same as my other point here it really only requires maybe 20 of that group changing its orientation to make a significant difference the idea that some group acts in some unified way and that entire swaths of the public act as a monolithic bloc is false the changes in behavior are on the margins yes it was enough to make a difference and i think ken is right that those people made a huge difference in the primaries but you have to remember that primary voters are like a fraction of a fraction of the actual population of the us they are a motivated 5 they re not the same as the general polling s which characterize the entire voting public there s some truth to this nyt atlantic and others have run stories saying that some of the strongest trump voters in the primaries were people who voted for democrats in the last few elections it wasn t necessarily that these people voted for democrats at least at the presidential level in the last few elections but that they were registered democrats or at some point had voted in democratic primaries but as nate cohn at the nyt wrote ken linked the article above a lot of these people have been voting republican for president for a while also i haven t seen anything in those articles to suggest that this group was a huge portion of the republican primary electorate or that it proved decisive margins to make an analogy mormons are a strongly republican voting bloc in presidential elections but outside of utah and a couple other western states they aren t of much relevance to the actual outcome because there s not too many of them you re still trying to pretend im making ken s argument whatever that is im just pointing out that some of your own stated claims are false and your assumptions are part of the same thing this writer refers to here re the dangerous idiots of the mass media hard numbers complicate if not roundly dismiss the oft regurgitated theory that income or education levels predict trump support or that working class whites support him disproportionately last month results of 87 000 interviews howed that those who liked trump were under no more economic distress or immigration related anxiety than those who opposed him according to the study his supporters didn t have lower incomes or higher unemployment levels than other americans income data misses a lot those with healthy earnings might also have negative wealth or downward mobility earlier this year primary exit polls revealed that trump voters were in fact more affluent than most americans with a median household income of 72 000 higher than that of hillary clinton or bernie sanders supporters forty four percent of them had college degrees well above the national average of 33 among whites or 29 overall these facts haven t stopped pundits and journalists from pushing story after story about the white working class s giddy embrace of a bloviating demagogue how is any of that related to my assumptions go back to the beginning and see what i was pointing out you were wrong about this is exactly what i m talking about when i say you jumped into an argument without understanding the context ken and i have been having this debate for months he was the one who brought up white non college educated or white working class people and how they were historically democrats but this year nominated trump on the republican side that s the reason i mention them because they ve been the focus of ken s argument this whole time i m aware that people have exaggerated the extent trump relies on them i ve been the one arguing that trump got enough support from traditional republicans to win the nomination as for that specific sentence you quoted i m referring to their base voters in presidential elections which these days are mostly minorities and college educated white people whites without a college education haven t been a reliably democratic bloc since at least the 70s and remember ken is the one that s been making this all about how they are the historic democratic base if you have proof that either of these statements of mine are false i d appreciate seeing it trump won closed primaries in geographically favorable territory with ease in the open primaries he won his margin with republicans was often greater than his overall margin exit polls consistently showed democrats as less around 5 10 at most of the republican electorate which is normal compared to past primaries i m not saying that there s nobody that exists that fits the description you or ken are talking about i m saying that there s no evidence to suggest that this group was most of trump s supporters or even that they provided a decisive margin over cruz it s a story that allows republicans to shift the blame to democrats for nominating him when by all measures trump was the 1 choice of republicans this cycle for the third time im not making kens argument im disputing your claim that the white poors were all republicans for decades which is bullshit not only are they not especially republican until recently they re not necessarily the big deal for trump either see above im not interested in any blaming of anyone for anything my point from the beginning was to point out that the way you people talk about demography exposes your own idiotic swallowing of bias confirming narratives pumped by the media which tends to over emphasize the significance of limited sources of information and which dont accurately reflect on large groups what most of the sources you read like nate silver et al reflect are recycled assumptions based on cherry picked numbers the fact is that what political pollsters try and describe as titanic shifts are actually just marginal changes to the weights of certain segments you can still find plenty of bernie sanders supporters in trailer parks and trump supporters in the upper west side its just that no one likes pointing that out because it doesnt feed the narrative this media paradigm created the tale of a divided america red v blue in which the 42 of kansans who voted for barack obama in 2008 are meaningless there are a lot of good quotes from that piece linked above but this is one of the ones that better makes my point the difference between 42 and 48 is treated as though there s some epic cultural divide involved its not much different than your citing of exit polls where you think theres somehow something significant involved when people voted for reagan and bush but somehow not when the exact same people voted for clinton your evidence doesnt show what you think it does is it a secret that bill clinton connected with middle america and working class whites better than carter mondale dukakis gore and kerry did i m not saying his elections are irrelevant i m saying they re clearly an outlier since 1980 at least also perot probably had some impact on those numbers in those elections at the presidential level whites without a college education voting republican isn t really a recent thing you re jumping into the middle of a debate between me and ken and completely ignoring the context of the discussion such as that this is about voting habits particularly at the presidential level not about general party identification and then nitpick and misconstrue my arguments my point was never that working class whites were a 100 gop demographic so i m not sure how the 42 vs 48 thing is relevant to anything i ve said not being college educated isn t the same thing as being poor i didn t make that argument i m talking about presidential level voting habits not who identified with what party i ve already provided evidence that non college educated whites have aside from bill clinton s elections voted 60 40 republican since 1980 in presidential elections lol the essence of this point i made which you still fail to grok is your hubris in saying those people as though your narrow cherry picked samples say anything about any signifcant demographic psychographic trend seriously wtf are you talking i don t think you understand the context of the debate i m having with ken which goes back months on these boards when did i say those people you seem to think this is about me looking down on people and generalizing them rather than refuting ken s argument that democrats nominated trump you re misunderstanding the context of my statements analyzing the historical presidential voting habits of a demographic isn t cherrypicking when the entire discussion is about how that demographic is voting in this year s presidential election until i looked at the paycheck saying 4730 i
