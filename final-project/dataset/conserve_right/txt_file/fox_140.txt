responsibility for the attacks back here at home president trump is at his florida retreat for the holidays but he aposs not taking a break from both celebrating what he calls exoneration by the mueller report while at the same time attacking former aides who he says misled the special counsel meanwhile democrats are split on whether to push for impeachment or move on to other issues in a moment we aposll speak with the president aposs personal attorney rudy giuliani and later house intelligence committee chair adam schiff but first let aposs bring in kevin corke at the white house with the latest developments kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent the president already busy on twitter once again this day and frankly a real pendulum of emotion following the release of that redacted mueller report swinging from vindication and exultation to downright frustration over its genesis and some of its underlying evidence begin videotape trump this should never happen to another president again corke president trump aposs insistence that he did not collude with the russians to sway the 2016 election is a message he not only reiterated once again a person following the release of the redacted mueller report his frustration boiled over on twitter where he called at the end result of the greatest witch hunt in u s political history no collusion no obstruction but mr trump also used social media platform to fume at some of the report aposs characterization particularly as it relates to obstruction of justice fabricated and totally untrue he tweeted adding that some of the statements in that report were total b s and only given to make the other person look good or me to look bad the latter an apparent reference to former white house counsel don mcgahn whose name appears on 66 of the report aposs 488 pages and was according to the report routinely criticized by the president for his persistent detailed note taking still the report aposs findings did little to quell the political uprising on capitol hill where congressional democrats have threatened to use it as a launching point for more investigation into the trump presidency nadler it is clear the special counsel aposs office conducted an incredibly thorough investigation in order to preserve the evidence for future investigators end videotape corke future investigations including a possible impeachment proceeding by the way chairman nadler has already issued a subpoena for the unredacted special counsel report including its underlying evidence and grand jury material by may 1st that aposs a request the doj is calling premature and unnecessary wallace kevin corke reporting for the white house kevin thanks for that joining me now the president aposs lead lawyer rudy giuliani mayor welcome back to fox news sunday and happy easter sir rudy giuliani president trump aposs attorney happy easter happy passover and good to be with you wallace you were planning we were told to release a counter report to the mueller report about 45 pages why haven apost you done so and are you still planning to giuliani number one we haven apost done so because we plan to do it if we needed to so far we don apost think we need to that may become necessary there is whether they go ahead with the hearings or not whether other issues are raised by different people there aposs probably a point at which we will use it right now we think the public debate this playing out about as well as we can why confuse with i mean it raises a lot of issues that maybe we didn apost have to respond to wallace you had said that if you were going to release on the counter report it was going to focus on obstruction here aposs what the president had to say about that after the mueller report was released giuliani right begin video clip trump they aposre having a good day i aposm having a good day too it was called no collusion no obstruction end video clip wallace but mayor that aposs not true the mueller report makes a clear especially on the issue of collusion that giuliani obstruction wallace obstruction rather that he aposs leaving it to congress and i want to pick up on the report volume two page eight giuliani i agree with that crosstalk wallace let me put this out here first the conclusion that congress may apply the obstruction laws to the president aposs corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances in the principle that no person is above the law so mueller invites congress to look into this and the president in terms of congress hasn apost been exonerated at all in the issue of the obstruction giuliani he doesn apost get exonerated i mean the standard first of all one of the main things that affects that report and makes it a warped report page two the standard you do not apply a standard of exoneration to anyone whether it aposs a president in an impeachment or you can apost exonerate exoneration means proving a negative but the law has recognized wallace but it aposs more than that he is suggesting that but sir crosstalk wallace he is suggesting that there is a case and evidence that congress should examine giuliani ok but let aposs start with this the standard he used his conclusion is i cannot conclude that the president committed obstruction but i cannot exonerate him wallace i understand your ideas that he doesn apost have to prove him innocent is not guilty crosstalk giuliani the second part of it is totally biased warped view of a prosecutor aposs role if prosecutors in america were asked to exonerate you and about 90 percent of the cases they wouldn apost be able to do it i did it for crosstalk wallace sir respectfully basically what he aposs saying is giuliani could exonerate somebody wallace i think it should go to congress that aposs what he aposs saying giuliani i know he did but you aposre touting ph a different opinion about that here aposs the different opinion number one if they aposre going to if they aposre going to review his removal power whether they do it as an attempt or a reality comey mueller whatever real question under article ii whether they can do that the constitution of the united states gives the congress a role in appointment advise and consent it deliberately doesn apost give them a role in removal because they say go back to the constitutional convention they say that would be too much of an intrusion because if you interfere in excepting somebody taking somebody you can always go find someone else but if you interfere in removal you aposre going to force a president to keep someone he doesn apost trust doesn apost like crosstalk wallace but that is excuse me i mean with all due respect that aposs not the issue here the issue is did the president obstruct justice or not let me just ask this i understand you aposre chomping at the bit let me just ask the question in june of 2017 giuliani right wallace the mueller report says that the president called white house counsel don mcgahn twice on the same weekend and he told him and this was a quote from mcgahn call rod rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general who is overseeing special counsel call rod tell rod that mueller has conflicts and can apost be the special counsel mcgahn recalled the president telling him mueller has to go the only reason that that doesn apost happen is because mcgahn threatens to resign and refuses to carry out what he considers to be a saturday night massacre giuliani ok now do you want me to answer wallace yes giuliani and you will let me give it wallace sure giuliani ok so number one had he done it it would not have been obstruction of justice because there were very good reasons to fire mueller and the president has the absolute plenary wallace wait what was the reason to fire mueller he aposd only been on the job a month giuliani mueller hired a staff in which he had people that i would find very questionable as people that would be investigating donald trump he hired the chief counsel to the clinton foundation absurd he hired someone who had been a very very strong partisan of hillary clinton that her going away party whatever that was and had a history of ethical misconduct unethical wallace but according to the mueller report sir giuliani can i ask finish chris it aposs a complex answer you asked a complex answer to my question i aposve got to give a complex answer i mean there are a lot of reasons why wallace ok but i understood that what you aposre saying is that the investigation is biased ok crosstalk giuliani i know you don apost want a long answer but in fairness wallace i understood what you aposre saying is the investigation was biased giuliani no what i aposm saying is you could perceive it that way which would give you a good faith reason to fire him and also he demonstrated in the case of comey that he could fire someone and not interfere in the investigation because immediately it was taken up by someone else he told lester holt that he realized wallace sir i aposm not asking about comey i aposm asking about mueller giuliani i aposm pointing out with his prior conduct he removed comey and he said i realized it will lengthen ph the investigation and now if he had fired mueller he would have expected somebody else came and took it over the guy had conflicts of interest the guy hired a highly partisan biased crosstalk wallace it also had come up it also had come up i understand you aposre trying to make the case but we do have limited time giuliani i aposm not trying to make the case i aposm trying to tell you there aposs an alternative expo nation crosstalk wallace there aposs another alternative explanation which mueller makes and mueller aposs explanation that two days earlier sir the report has come out in the paper that now mueller is investigating him for obstruction of justice and for the first time in this investigation for the first time the president directly is a target of the investigation giuliani chris what you aposre doing is you aposre taking the mueller report which is a prosecutor aposs version of what happened you aposre giving it full credit and you aposre not giving me a chance to explain the other side which is very very strong and was left out by the prosecutor i think that aposs unfair in the case of this magnitude not to tell the other side wallace i aposm asking about the other side i aposm giuliani you aposre not giving a chance to answer it wallace we don apost need to talk about james comey giuliani well it aposs two pages wallace what giuliani it aposs two or three pages of calumny and lies and distortion it takes a little while for example wallace you think that aposs what the report is calumny lies and distortion giuliani in certain respects everything that written and attributed to cohen half of it is not true wallace i aposm not talking about cohen i aposm talking about don giuliani but you asked you aposre asking me is the report you say is the report wallace no i aposm not i was asking about mcgahn this incident giuliani i think this is a product of not telling the full story that aposs not mcgahn aposs fault mcgahn gave when you read that mcgahn gave three different versions of that conversation the first version of that conversation is the president used the word fire and he told the president i aposm going to resign directly he then recants that and says no fire no statement that i was going to resign and then he comes up with that person and then a third version which is even softer which says something like he should be fired or he has conflicts he can apost be special prosecutor wallace and that mueller has to go ok giuliani interpreted that way it aposs a very complex set of facts on the other side the president says i didn apost say to fire him i didn apost want him to go i want at the conflicts to be taken into consideration that aposs the president aposs version you got to pick one version of the other wallace ok here aposs all right may i giuliani but in fact since you can apost prove it there aposs no obstruction and finally if he had fired him there wouldn apost have been an obstruction so long as he was replaced by somebody which he would have been and there were good reasons arguable reasons wallace here aposs the question crosstalk giuliani here aposs the overview the overview is this no no this is really important the president of the united states was an innocent man being charged with something he didn apost do you have to grant that now when they say no proof of underlying crime you aposve got to grant that as a legal and factual matter these things were being done wallace no i don apost no i don apost giuliani these things well wait a second these things are being done by an innocent man wallace this is called an interview it aposs not your closing argument you got to give me the opportunity giuliani no i aposm here to defend the president wallace i understand that and i aposm here to ask you some questions giuliani it gives distorted arguments made by prosecutor who had people who hated him crosstalk wallace one of your arguments has been that the obstruction of justice can apost have happened because there was no underlying crime that aposs what you say giuliani no wallace you said that he was being framed and he was fighting back let aposs look at what you said sir put it up on the screen begin video clip giuliani it aposs kind of ridiculous to go after a man for obstruction when he was falsely accused he was defending himself his intent in each one of these situations all ten of them is easily explained as an intent to not get framed end video clip wallace but that aposs what you just said giuliani i said it a couple days ago wallace ok i understand but that aposs the point you aposre making again the special counsel i aposm not arguing that the special counsel is right or wrong i aposm simply presenting arguments to try to get you to respond to it giuliani well i have wallace the special counsel says that what you just said is not true volume two page 157 giuliani oh one big surprise wallace obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect noncriminal personal interests to protect against investigations for underlying criminal liability falls into a gray area or to avoid personal embarrassment mueller says the injury to the justice system is just as great it doesn apost matter whether there was an underlying crime it aposs still obstruction giuliani well when did mueller become god mueller says the injury to the justice system is still as great there was no injury by the way we aposre talking about an inchoate crime we aposre talking about something that didn apost happen there was no obstruction nothing was denied him nobody crushed cell phones like hillary did nobody deleted 33 000 emails like hillary aposs people did and nobody bleached a server like hillary did there was no obstruction they don apost point to a single obstruction and investigation the one from day one to day end and they got everything they wanted wallace well that aposs not true giuliani well they are not entitled to testimony no prosecutor is that aposs not wallace that isn apost what you said you said they got everything they wanted giuliani but they are not entitled to that crosstalk wallace that aposs a different issue that aposs a different issue giuliani now we aposre going to take the perception of innocence we aposre going to throw it out because it aposs donald trump now we aposre going to crosstalk wallace i aposm simply saying you said that they got everything they wanted giuliani well you know why he didn apost testify before them because they were going to trap him into perjury like they did with flynn if you think i aposm a fool i would have been disbarred if i let him testify there were so many indications if they wanted to trap him into perjury because they don apost have a case that they were not in good faith here aposs what they did to flynn they called flynn in they go to his office they tell me him he doesn apost need a lawyer wallace i got a minute left well i want to talk about i want to talk about trump giuliani this isn apost worth more that a minute wallace i want to talk about trump giuliani but you have to look you have to look at the conduct of the prosecutor wallace i understand it giuliani they created as flynn aposs crime wallace there was also the nature giuliani they had the answer that they ask him in their briefcase wallace we aposre not talking about flynn we aposre talking about the president giuliani we are talking about flynn wallace here was the nature giuliani you are asking what is the president not go stand in front of them and let them try to trap and into perjury because he had good lawyers and he aposs not a fool wallace ok giuliani if they were fair people i would have been there in a minute what they did to flynn said to me they aposre going to try to do to my client wallace final question here was the nature here was the nature giuliani you aposre treating these people as if they aposre fair they aposre not that is totally it begins with he aposs got to prove his innocence then we aposre throwing out then we are throwing out the fifth amendment how many more amendments we would like to throw out in mueller aposs favor wallace i just want to ask you a question you say that they gave you gave the president gave them everything they wanted i understand you aposre saying they didn apost have a right to testimony let aposs look at the president aposs testimony giuliani by the way crosstalk wallace no no no sir at least 37 times he said in written answers he did not recall giuliani oh my goodness wallace well wait a minute you say oh my goodness giuliani comey says it 202 times wallace ok here aposs what when hillary clinton did that during her investigation about the email giuliani i know i said it wallace about the report here aposs what the president said take a look giuliani i said a similar thing begin video clip trump when she was interviewed by the fbi she claims she couldn apost remember important events 39 times so she really didn apost remember that aposs a problem and if she did remember that aposs a problem end video clip wallace you aposve got 30 seconds why is that a problem for hillary clinton but it isn apost for donald trump giuliani because hillary clinton was guilty of the underlying crimes she did crush the cell phones wallace who made you god as you said about mueller giuliani i aposm not god about mueller i aposm just the opposite crosstalk wallace no no you aposre saying that who made god who made mueller god now you aposre declaring whether she was guilty or not giuliani i aposm saying there aposs a difference between them i aposm not saying she aposs guilty i aposm just saying there aposs a difference the difference is there is overwhelming evidence that she actually obstructed justice she denied the investigators the information nothing was denied to them and by the way in the report they say they didn apost have to question him because they had the answers to all the questions right in the report wallace they also say the answers they also said the answers were inadequate crosstalk giuliani no i aposm sorry they were the truth wallace and they also said that to go through a subpoena was going to take a prolonged period of time giuliani they were the truth if my client if my client has an unclear recollection i aposm not going to go stretch out for the prosecutor so the prosecutor can nail him in an unfair way wallace mayor giuliani giuliani like they went after that great general and ruin his life and bankrupted him they should be ashamed of themselves wallace mayor giuliani thank you giuliani thank you wallace thanks for sharing your holiday weekend with us giuliani happy easter happy passover wallace and i will say this you are a heck of a lawyer giuliani oh you aposre a heck of an interviewer laughter giuliani thanks wallace up next we aposll talk with adam schiff the democratic chair of the house intelligence committee who promises to continue investigating the president but will that lead to impeachment commercial break democrats have issued a subpoena for the full unredacted mueller report and are calling on attorney general barr and special counsel robert mueller to testify before congress reaction from california congressman adam schiff democratic chair of the house intelligence committee wallace democrats have issued a subpoena for the full unredacted mueller report and they are calling on attorney general barr and special counsel mueller to testify before congress but they remain divided over how far they should take their investigation of the president joining us now from california democratic congressman adam schiff chair of the house intelligence committee chairman welcome back to fox news sunday rep adam schiff d calif thank you good to be with you wallace after the release of the mueller report you and some other top house democrats including house speaker nancy pelosi said that impeachment of the president would be a mistake here you are begin video clip schiff many of us do think the president is unfit for office but unless that aposs a bipartisan conclusion and impeachment would be doomed to failure i continue to think that a failed impeachment is not in the national interest end video clip wallace but now since you said that some top democrats including elizabeth warren senator warren is a candidate for president say the house should do its constitutional duty and begin impeachment proceedings do you still think they are wrong schiff well look i think it aposs a very difficult decision and we aposre going to have a caucus about this over the next couple weeks to try to figure out what the best course is not for the party but what aposs the best course for the country i think it aposs certainly the case that an impeachment would be unsuccessful if the republican party continues to place party above country continues essentially to back the president no matter how unethical or dishonest his conduct maybe and sadly that aposs where we are right now so we will have to decide do we nonetheless go through an impeachment because to do otherwise would signal that somehow this president aposs conduct is ok that future presidents can engage in this kind of corruption without consequence or do we decide that we are better off doing oversight through the context of a oversight hearings by the various committees rather than a formal impeachment that aposs going to be a very consequential decision and one that i aposm going to reserve judgment on until we have a chance to fully deliberate about it wallace chairman you aposve been leading the charge for more than a year that president trump and his campaign colluded with the russians to interfere in the 2016 election here are just a few examples begin video clip schiff this is about as clear evidence as you could find by intent by the campaign to collude with the russians to get useful information from the russians i think there aposs plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy in plain sight i did say that there is ample evidence and indeed there is of collusion of people in the trump campaign with the russians end video clip wallace sir let aposs look at what the mueller report found and i want to put it up on the screen volume one pages one two and five we understood coordination to require an agreement tacit or expressed between the trump campaign and the russian government on election interference the investigation did not establish that members of the trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the russian government and its election interference activities mr chairman the special counsel did not find the kind of coordination that you said was there schiff chris as you know and it wish you had played the rest of some of those clips i went on to say that whether that collusion that evidence of collusion rises to proof beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of conspiracy was a different question and indeed that distinction is made in the opening pages of the mueller report so when the president and his allies repeat this mantra of no collusion they clearly haven apost read or are ignoring the plain language of the report where bob mueller says two things he says we are not going to look into the question of whether it aposs collusion that aposs a common lay terms that can be criminal or noncriminal conduct we are going to look at the crime of conspiracy and on that issue bob mueller says something else that i aposve been saying frequently which is the fact that you may not be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt a criminal conspiracy doesn apost mean there is an absence of evidence of crime and when i talk chris and you aposre absolutely right i talked with us all the time on the course of the last year when i talked about evidence of collusion in plain sight i used those words in plain sight and appointed to the meetings of trump tower that don jr and kushner and manna manafort took what more clear intent to collude could you have done the russians offering dirt on hillary clinton as part of what was described as an effort to help mr trump in the campaign and don jr saying if it aposs what you say i would love it now i don apost know find you how you f abundant evidence of the attempt to collude and in fact wallace but sir schiff yes wallace let me just say the mueller report look at a lot of those specific incidents as you talk about for instance the trump tower meeting the fact that paul manafort shared polling data with someone from the ukraine who had ties to the russians and here aposs what they found again from the report volume one page 66 the investigation examined whether these contacts and they agreed there were contacts involved or resulted in coordination of a conspiracy with the trump campaign and russia including with respect to russia providing assistance to the campaign in exchange for any sort of favorable treatment in the future based on the available information the investigation did not establish such coordination here was the reaction after the report came out from white house counselor kellyanne conway begin video clip kellyanne conway counselor to the president i was the first person to publicly call for adam schiff aposs resignation from the intelligence committee chairman several weeks ago on your network i aposm going to double down on that not only should he resign he should produce the evidence that he said he has end video clip wallace there aposs no question that there were contacts but i think when he went other democrats i aposm not saying it aposs just you talk about collusion there was the feeling of a working arrangement an agreement and that somehow the trump campaign was involved in the hacking of the dnc and podesta emails and that there was a back and forth a working relationship as opposed to individual meetings do you have evidence of that kind of working relationship that the mueller report didn apost seem to find schiff well chris first of all i never said that the trump campaign was involved in the hacking itself what i did say is that for example in the trump tower meeting there was a clear intent to collude with the russians there was a willingness to receive russian health the president himself called on the russians to assist his campaign hacking hillary clinton aposs emails and if you look at pages 180 to 190 that discuss that trump tower meeting it wasn apost that they found a lack of evidence of all the things that i talked about in fact the meeting did take place in fact they did offer dirt on hillary clinton in fact the president aposs son did say he would love to have it in fact the president aposs son lie about it in fact the president was involved in dictating that lie all the facts i aposve set out are proven but what bob mueller said the reason he didn apost charge don jr and jared kushner and paul manafort is he found that he could not establish with admissible evidence that don jr was knowing knew that he was breaking the law that that he was essentially ignorant of the law now with respect to paul manafort we only have one sentence as to why some of that experience didn apost know that seeking the help and receiving the help of a foreign government was a crime and that aposs something we aposre going to want to ask bob mueller when he testifies bob mueller also said he couldn apost establish the value of the dirt they got so this i would say this to kellyanne conway the only reason that mueller says he didn apost charge a crime about that trump tower meeting was because he believed that don jr was too ignorant of the law to be charged and because the russians didn apost deliver the dirt they promised not that that campaign didn apost try to get dirt but the russians didn apost live up to their end of the bargain so that wallace i we got limited schiff that aposs what mueller found wallace we aposve got limited time i want to ask you one last question republicans are now calling for a full investigation of how the fbi investigation against the president and the trump campaign began and the mueller report found that the steele dossier which had all kinds of information about relationships between president trump and the kremlin that much of that information was either false or impossible to verify as chair of the house intelligence committee isn apost that a legitimate source of inquiry not saying you shouldn apost investigate the president but don apost you think the question of exactly how this investigation began was it a russians disinformation campaign to try to get since they were trying to to set americans against each other to not only tarnish hillary clinton but also to tarnish donald trump isn apost that a legitimate source of an investigation schiff chris you know the reality is that the republicans on our committee spent two years investigating exactly that because frankly they weren apost that interested in what russia had done the systemic attack on our democracy they spent the focus of their two years investigating the investigators and investigating exactly that question but christopher steele and the fisa application wallace but but sir and i aposve only got 30 seconds left we do have new information the mueller report discredits a lot of that says there was no indication that carter page did anything wrong shouldn apost you be looking at that just to find the truth schiff well what what we are going to be looking at is we aposre going to be looking at all of the counterintelligence findings that were the genesis of this investigation we have requested that on a bipartisan basis one of the few things that devin nunes and i agreed upon but let me just be very clear about this the mueller report makes it absolutely crystal clear that the initiation of this investigation was not only warranted but absolutely necessary because it revealed a widespread systemic effort by the russians to help the trump campaign and and that i think is the overriding conclusion of this report and we need to i think to to put our emphasis on making sure that kind of intervention never happens again wallace chairman schiff thank you thanks for joining us today schiff thank you wallace always good to talk with you sir schiff thank you wallace coming up we aposll bring in our sunday group to break down the mueller report is it the end of the russia investigation or just the start of a new chapter commercial break wallace coming up the release of the mueller report does not settle the obstruction debate begin video clips giuliani if we had had a trial there would be a resounding not guilty not guilty schiff the facts that are now established by this report are damning end video clips wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel to weigh in commercial break begin video clip attorney general william barr the special counsel confirmed that the russian government sponsored efforts to illegally interfere with the 2016 presidential election but did not find that the trump campaign or other americans colluded in those efforts end video clip wallace attorney general william barr announcing special counsel robert mueller found no collusion with russia in his final report and it aposs time now for our sunday group jason riley of the wall street journal bob woodward from the washington post former democratic congressman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and fox news correspondent gillian turner well jason what aposs your reaction to the mueller report how convincingly does it clear the president of collusion and how much does it not clear the president on obstruction jason riley fox news contributor well i think this report ought to be good news for this country good news for everyone democrats and republicans alike the mueller report found that no one in the trump campaign from the president on down conspired with a foreign entity to win the election despite the efforts of russia to interfere this ought to be good news for everyone we ought to be celebrating this yet we have some democrats and some members of the media who are deeply disappointed in this outcome because they had pushed a certain narrative that turned out to be untrue wallace congresswoman harman if you were still in congress would you vote to initiate impeachment proceedings jane harman former u s representative well here aposs what i would do let aposs remember fred malik ph a mutual friend of ours who chaired the wilson center board and was a passionate republican what fred always said was he only liked politicians who put the country first could we have a little conversation about that what does the country need now that this report has come out it aposs a nuanced report and its complicated and on the obstruction charge mueller said congress or i guess the people in in the next election need to decide i don apost know what i would do if i were in congress now i would first wait for mueller aposs testimony in congress to hear why he wrote what he wrote and and what it means he didn apost say you know i saw your long event with rudy giuliani exoneration is not the standard but surely the report does not exonerate anybody and it is time for the country to come together around what the next step is wallace bob when you read volume two of the mueller report which is the part that centers on obstruction and mueller lays out ten specific potential cases of obstruction how disturbing do you find them bob woodward the washington post well they aposre disturbing i think there aposs a pattern of lying and corruption here that can apost be dodged but jason aposs right the big conclusion on no i mean collusion is a bad word no coordination between the trump campaign and the russians that is a big deal and it aposs got to be faced and there is there there are elements in the report that are very disturbing basically and i aposm sure president trump would not acknowledge this it confirms what was reported in the new york times my newspaper and the wall street journal in a very significant way the question bubbling here is is this watergate is this nixon and the big missing element in all of this is money nixon used campaign money for the watergate aperation ph espionage and sabotage he used campaign money to pay for the silence of the people involved in watergate clear obstruction in this case you have no money paid by trump or his associates you know who paid for the russian meddling in our election vladimir putin it was his money wallace i want to ask you i want to ask you one quick question and i woodward yes wallace i don apost mean in any way to compare this to watergate woodward yes wallace there were obviously a lot more serious crimes that nixon and the committee to re elect were involved in than anybody in the trump campaign did but i was looking back at the at the june 23rd smoking gun tape woodward yes wallace in which the president says to h r haldeman then his chief of staff instruct the cia to tell the fbi to lay off the watergate investigation because it aposs a national security matter and that wasn apost the real reason it was because it was obviously going to incriminate people involved in the campaign is that so different from donald trump telling i aposm not talking about the underlying crime telling don mcgahn or cory lewandowski end the special counsel investigation woodward ok if you go back to that june 23rd tape in the nixon case that aposs six days after the watergate burglary and what haldeman who was nixon aposs chief of staff says to the president where worried about the fbi because they aposre tracing the money the money is the key to watergate and i aposll repeat in this case there aposs no money transfer does that mean there isn apost much to investigate indeed there is and i hope i know people in my business are going to be aggressively looking for new information clearly the democrats in the house are doing that wallace i want to bring in gillian but before i do woodward yes wallace i would say there was somebody as i remember who said to you follow the money woodward yes well that was in the movie version wallace all right let me go to you gillian what about attorney general barr because one of the things that strikes me reading the mueller report is that he in effect says look there are a lot of reasons one of which is the olc the legal ruling of the justice department you can apost indict a sitting president i aposm going to shift this over to congress what do you think of of the fact that william barr said no no i aposm going to make a judgment on this and i aposm going to clear the president gillian turner fox news correspondent well it aposs within his prerogative as the attorney general to make a conclusion mueller doesn apost get to decide whether the attorney general gets to make the conclusion and he did i will say that the bigger problem attorney general bill barr has is that he aposs the messenger here and everybody knows what happens to the messenger i think in this instance he was the first person that got their voice heard by the american people after the report and the investigation were finalized he was the first person to see the report the first person to comment on it publicly after reading it and in this instance the democrats obviously they aposve disagreed with everything about how he aposs handled this from what he said to how he said it to the order in which he said it i think democrats here are shooting the messenger wallace all right panel we have to take a break here but when we come back joe biden is set to officially announce he aposs running for president this week what does that mean for the rest of the 2020 field plus what would you like to ask the panel about the russia investigation and the allegations of fbi misconduct just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump this should never happen to another president again this hoax this should never happen to another president again end video clip wallace president trump kicking off what may be the next chapter of the russia probe looking into why the fbi launched the investigation and we aposre back now with the panel well mr woodward woodward yes wallace more than two years ago back in january of 2017 when the steele dossier first surfaced i remember you saying right here on this show that it is a quote garbage document do you feel that the mueller report basically discredited it and to what degree do you think it played a role in the russia investigation woodward well that aposs what aposs going to be investigated by lots of people including the attorney general and including senator lindsey graham but wallace and the inspector general is also doing it woodward yes and it should be i mean what i found out recently which was really quite surprising the dossier which really is got a lot of garbage in it and mueller found that to be the case early in building the intelligence community assessment on russian interference in an early draft they actually put the dossier on page two in kind of a breakout box i think it was the cia pushing this real intelligence experts looked at this and said no this is not intelligence this is garbage and they took it out but in this process the idea that they would include something like that in one of the great stellar intelligence assessments as mueller also found out is highly questionable it needs to be investigated wallace we asked riley and chris wallace let me i just want to pick up we want to ask you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the mueller report and the genesis of it we got this on twitter from leo terry how quickly do you think bill barr will start going after those who weaponized the department of justice and fbi against trump and his campaign gillian how do you answer leo and to what degree do you think the whole russia investigation was if not started by fueled by a disinformation campaign either from the russians or from the clinton campaign turner i think we aposre getting out ahead of our skis if we assume that barr is going to go after anybody what he said during his remarks is that he aposs going to look at the sum total of what all the various ongoing investigations have found and then make a determination of whether this needs to be investigated but i will say the steele dossier aposs origins and all of that it sort of pales in comparison to the real hard information that mueller confirmed which is you know there might not be an indictment of president trump in this report but there is certainly a scathing indictment of social media companies here and of the russian government aposs attempts to infiltrate them we learn he confirmed 126 million people on facebook 2 million people on twitter exposed unknowingly to russian propaganda that may or may not have influenced the way they wanted to to vote i didn apost hear chairman schiff talk about that on your show earlier this morning he aposs the chairman of the intelligence committee that aposs where the focus should be going forward wallace all right in the time we have left we are going to talk some 2020 democratic presidential politics because it appears that joe biden who according to the polls is the frontrunner is finally expected to enter the race this week and perhaps wednesday in charlottesville virginia which of course was the sight of that terrible white supremacist rally back in 2017 here was biden this past week at a rally for striking grocery workers begin video clip joe biden former u s vice president wall street bankers and ceos did not build america you built america we built america ordinary middle class people built america end video clip wallace congresswoman harman how steep a climb does biden face one because of his age and two because he seems to be a relative moderate in a field that aposs moving further to the left harman ok two points first putting the country first let aposs keep our eye on the fact that russia is actively interfering in our election we need to take steps to stop that not not share or focus blame on each other wallace ok we know that let aposs go to biden harman on biden eight years ago today on easter my cell phone rang jane it aposs joe are you ok why was he calling me i didn apost work for him i didn apost work in the obama white house i had left congress but my husband had died a few weeks ago and he wanted to check up on me that aposs who joe biden is a thoroughly decent thoughtful caring man is he too old well hope not should he be elected let aposs see how the campaign plays out in political terms there are years between now and 2020 should he enter the race absolutely is there a place for moderates you bet there are 30 new moderates who are democrats in the democrat in the house of representatives should the ticket reflect the diversity of america i think so but i think my my view is that joe biden should run he has a lot to offer and he aposs one of the nicest people on the planet wallace jason how do you handicap this race and and what do you think are the chances that joe biden who aposs the frontrunner getting in will remain the frontrunner as this campaign rages on riley right and that initial point is is worth making there you know back in the 2016 cycle we were probably talking about at this point jeb bush and marco rubio being the strongest candidates and we saw how that how that turned out i think the democrats have to decide whether they want a politically correct ticket or a ticket that can compete in the states that they need in 2020 joe biden obviously is someone who could compete in the upper midwest and states like that and and they aposre going to have to decide if they can put aside the fact that he is a white male and that they want more diversity on on their ticket so that aposs the the dilemma they have they have a progressive wing that wants more women wants more minorities and i will say on the minority front i think joe biden would bring a lot of goodwill from black americans to the ticket because of his affiliation with barack obama for eight years so i they they have some figuring out to do on a lot of fronts wallace on the other hand barack obama and it aposs understandably is noticeably silent even though he worked alongside joe biden he has done nothing to push his candidacy riley true and he probably has said to himself i aposm going to stay neutral during this primary process wallace all right well you know what i have a feeling we aposll discuss joe biden and the whole democratic race often thank you panel thank you all for coming in on easter see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the botus yes botus who made a splash when he arrived in washington and continues to have quite a following commercial break wallace finally this easter weekend he stole the show in vice president pence and his family arrived in washington and two years later he aposs still helping the second family teach children about civics and history here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape karen pence vice president mike pence aposs wife and he aposll sit and hold a poise and wait until you get a lot of shots i mean it aposs really adorable he aposs kind of a prima donna hey marlon wallace voice over karen pence is talk about the family aposs pet bunny the main character in a children aposs book she had her daughter charlotte have written called marlon bundo aposs day in the life of the vice president but before we get to the book there aposs marlon aposs story charlotte was working on a college film project and needed a bunny charlotte pence a day in the life of the vice president i asked the owner how much for the bunny and they said to make him an offer and so it became this godfather joke with my friends wallace marlon brando became marlon bundo who escapes from his cage just as two teens break out of their troubles c pence he aposs kind of a metaphor he aposs every deep wallace in 2017 when the family moved to washington photographers spotted marlon being carried off air force two k pence for some reason it became this phenomenon you know that oh my gosh the pences have a bunny and so charlotte thought it would be a lot of fun to start marlon aposs own instagram account wallace marlon made his first official appearance at an event honoring military families and clearly upstaged the vice president mike pence vice president of the united states you want to pet him k pence you know who this is don apost you whisper it whisper it m pence marlon k pence yes c pence marlon this is chris wallace mr chris wallace this is the botus wallace yes that stands for bunny of the united states wallace on camera my family has had a bunch of bunnies and none of them were ever as well behaved as marlon c pence he aposs good yes he aposs he we think he aposs kind of you know he likes the spotlight a little bit wallace voice over and so was born the idea for a book about marlon following grandpa the vice president around washington for a full day of meetings mrs pence who aposs an accomplished artist did the illustrations while charlotte wrote the story in verse c pence allow me to introduce myself i am marlon bundo pence i live with my family here at the vice president aposs residence wallace the pence aposs are donating proceeds from the book to charity charlotte to fight human trafficking mrs pence to support art therapy charlotte says marlon brings bunny lovers together erasing political lines but comedian john oliver came out with his own book trolling the vice president with proceeds going to lgbt and aids groups john oliver late night host our story is about marlon bundo falling in love with another boy rabbit because our marlon bundo is gay k pence on marlon aposs instagram marlon actually said the only thing better than one bunny book that benefits charity is two bunny books that benefits charity wallace marlon can be seen on instagram flipping the pages of his book while mother and daughter are clearly enjoying their collaboration
