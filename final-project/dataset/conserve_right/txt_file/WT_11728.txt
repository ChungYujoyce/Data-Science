apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic national security agency leaker edward snowden who apparently remained holed up in a moscow airport transit lounge monday night has chosen an itinerary taking him to sanctuary in nations restricting the very internet and press freedoms he says he stands for u s officials said criticism rose as mr snowden who was allowed to leave hong kong despite a pending extradition request from the u s disappeared from public view in moscow he failed to take two seats booked in his name on a russian aeroflot flight monday to havana from where he was expected to fly to quito the capital of ecuador ecuador s foreign minister confirmed that mr snowden applied for political asylum from the leftist government of president rafael correa see also white house slams hong kong china for shielding leaker mr snowden s supporters denied that he had been interviewed by chinese authorities and russian officials said that as a transit passenger he had not entered their country white house spokesman jay carney said u s intelligence officials were working on the assumption that any information he took from the nsa already had been compromised snowden s route secretary of state john f kerry noted monday that there was no small irony in the route taken by mr snowden a self proclaimed defender of internet rights and freedom of expression i wonder if mr snowden chose china and russia as assistants in his flight from justice because they re such powerful bastions of internet freedom mr kerry asked reporters in india but evidently mr snowden places himself above the law having betrayed his country with respect to the violation of his oath mr kerry said russia and china are infamous for limiting internet freedoms according to a global assessment compiled annually by one of washington s leading nonprofit advocacy rights groups freedom house s annual freedom on the net report for last year rated russia s record on the web as partly free and china s as not free china was one of only two nations surveyed that employed all nine categories of internet censorship that freedom house cataloged the other country was iran ecuador one of the countries to which mr snowden applied for asylum adopted a communications law that restricts journalists freedom of expression according to human rights watch the legislation passed by the ecuadorean national assembly on june 14 seriously undermines free speech and includes overly broad language that will limit the free expression of journalists and media outlets the group said in a statement last week human rights watch americas director jose miguel vivanco called the law yet another effort by president correa to go after the independent media he said provisions for censorship and criminal prosecutions of journalists are clear attempts to silence criticism journalist weighs in glenn greenwald the journalist at the guardian to whom mr snowden leaked some of the classified documents he stole from the nsa defended the self proclaimed whistleblower s itinerary he s not searching for political nirvana he s searching for a place where he can be safe and remain free and participate in the debate he told cnn mr greenwald said mr snowden could rely on few countries that could stand up to the united states he needs to find a place that is both able and willing to grant him asylum and shield him from u s prosecution there aren t many places on the earth willing or able to do that mr greenwald said julian assange the founder of the anti secrecy website wikileaks said monday that the group was assisting mr snowden at his request mr assange has been granted asylum by ecuador and is sheltering in its embassy in london to avoid extradition to sweden where he faces questioning on sex charges he told reporters on a conference call that mr snowden who turned 30 on friday is being accompanied by wikileaks researcher sarah harrison and was safe but declined to say where he was mr assange reportedly is facing a grand jury probe over his role in the publication by wikileaks of hundreds of thousands of state department and military documents leaked by pfc bradley manning mr assange has said the secret probe is being carried out by u s prosecutors from the eastern district of virginia the same federal jurisdiction where mr snowden was indicted under seal on june 14 the indictment was unsealed late friday revealing that the self proclaimed whistleblower faced felony charges under the 1917 espionage act punishable by life imprisonment headed to ecuador mr snowden has applied to iceland and other countries for asylum as well mr assange said but is traveling on a refugee document of passage by the ecuadorean government because the u s revoked his passport before his abrupt departure sunday from hong kong mr assange was asked about reports that mr snowden had been interviewed by chinese authorities before leaving the quasi autonomous chinese city state as far as i am aware that is false he said reports from moscow said russian authorities were claiming mr snowden as a transit passenger had not entered the country and that they had no grounds to arrest him nonetheless mr carney said it s safe to assume in the damage assessment being conducted by u s intelligence that any information that mr snowden might have provided publicly we would expect to be compromised administration officials made clear that they want russian cooperation and are asking for it at several levels of government we expect the russian government to look at all options available to expel mr snowden back to the u s to face justice for the crimes with which he is charged said white house spokeswoman caitlin m hayden a state department official speaking on background said fbi director robert s mueller iii had spoken personally with his counterpart at the russian domestic intelligence agency the fsb about the importance of mr snowden s return to the united states president obama has in recent months pushed a reset policy with russia looking for progress on nuclear weapons reductions that he has not been able to find on syria or other key bilateral issues sen lindsey graham south carolina republican warned the russian ambassador monday that the case was an important test of the reset in relations between our two countries if our two nations are to have a constructive relationship moving forward russian cooperation in this matter is essential he wrote mr carney said authorities in hong kong and beijing allowed mr snowden to leave even though his passport had been revoked and that the u s had filed an extradition warrant and sought his arrest we are just not buying that this was a technical decision by a hong kong immigration official he said the hong kong authorities were advised of the status of mr snowden s travel documents in plenty of time to have prohibited his travel as appropriate he said this was a deliberate choice by the government to release a fugitive despite a valid arrest warrant and that decision unquestionably has a negative impact on the u s china relationship he said dave boyer and guy taylo
