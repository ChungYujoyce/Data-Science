purchase 42 of its own the aircraft are designed to operate with short takeoffs and vertical landings such as on carriers the purchase underscores japan s growing role in its post war alliance with the u s in order to incorporate what was not originally in the design or something new that had not even been thought of i think this would require research into many areas otherwise it wouldn t go
