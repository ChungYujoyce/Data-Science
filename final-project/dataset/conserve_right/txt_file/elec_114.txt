left to think for themselves the horror 10 20 p m edt lester holt bows to the clinton campaign and tries to fact check trump on his support for or opposition to the iraq war it happens thus holt introduces matter of factly the premise that trump supported the iraq war trump pushes back calling it mainstream media nonsense trump burns two minutes explaining how he did not support the war citing howard stern and sean hannity at the end holt repeats the allegation again anyway this is what the clinton campaign and the mainstream media wanted him to do in one gesture holt proves everything that conservatives allege about mainstream media moderators nbc news and fact checking 10 07 p m edt the self proclaimed fact checkers join moderator lester holt and democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton for a real time demonstration of how so called fact checking is really a guise for deliberate political attacks step 1 moderator asks setup question in a segment on race relations holt asks trump about the birther conspiracy theory he asks no similar questions about clinton s record leaving trump himself to bring up such clinton hits as superpredator trump also notes that the birther conspiracy theory started in the clinton campaign step 2 democrat pounces on setup question clinton goes to town on trump s birther past denying her own trump counters again with examples of racism from clinton s 2008 campaign but then step 2a moderator interrupts trump s response holt reminds trump that the segment is about race relations just to reinforce the underlying charge of racism step 3 fact checker gives trump a false politifact tweets a link to an article from sep 16 claiming that neither clinton nor her campaign had anything to do with the birther conspiracy theory of course they did as clinton s campaign manager admitted trump points that out and perhaps that is effective but the point is that the left s so called fact checking machine completes the cycle to review moderator sets up attack democrat attacks fact checker removes republican s defense 9 58 p m edt trump fact checks clinton when she claims crime is down in new york including murder trump is right crime was down overall in new york last year but murder rape and robbery were up according to the wall street journal we don t need no fact checkers 9 49 p m edt trump

mayor our new mayor refused to go forward with the case fact wreck rating trump is 100 right according to the new york times and holt s collusion with clinton is becoming hard to ignore 9 47 p m edt the left s pressure on moderator lester holt seems to have worked as he raises the question of trump s tax returns not yet disclosed but says nothing about clinton s missing emails leaving that to trump to raise on his own factcheck org does not bother to fact check hillary clinton s false rebuttal which is that she made a mistake which she originally claimed was a mistake of using only one phone when she in fact had 13 instead the organization simply refers to a guide to hillary s emails 9 25 p m edt hillary clinton and donald trump both refer viewers to fact checking services on their campaign websites the media fact checkers are about to go out of business 9 22 p m edt hillary clinton fact checks donald trump after he says that she supported the trans pacific partnership before she opposed it clinton that is just not accurate i was against it once it was finally negotiated trump you called it the gold standard of trade deals you said it s the finest deal you d ever seen clinton no actually she did cnn counted 45 times clinton pushed the deal politifact notes that clinton did indeed flip flop on the deal live fact check trump is right clinton flip flopped on tpp https t co hownkuisae pic twitter com v70sdg3may politifact live politifactlive september 27 2016 was that necessary though trump just pointed it out 9 18 p m edt donald trump fact checks hillary clinton she said donald thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese he denied it he did in fact tweetin 2012 that the chinese invented the concept of global warming for their own benefit he later said he was joking candidates fact checking each other what a concept 9 16 p m edt factcheck org has two fact checks so far both of trump and not because hillary s been more truthful thus far the 1st factual error in debatenight is hillaryclinton saying the us doesn t yet have equal pay for equal work fact checkers joel b pollak joelpollak september 27 2016 9 12 p m edt alex burns of thenew york times files the first fact check of the evening complaining about trump s claims about ford moving jobs to mexico but burns and thus far the rest of the fact checkers missed the actual first false statement by any of the candidates the whopper came from clinton who suggested that the u s does not yet have equal pay for equal work something that has been a matter of law for decades the remaining inequality such as it is is largely due to factors such as career choice and time off for children 8 58 p m edt factcheck org calls nbc news host lester holt a moderate it s just a typo but why not moderate lester holt says that hopefully it will be just the two of them tonight and he will facilitate the discussion factcheck org factcheckdotorg september 27 2016 actually holt s political affiliation has been a part of the pre debate controversy trump called holt a democrat he is actually a registered republican fun fact fox news chris wallace is apparently a registered democrat according to political scientist tim groseclose more than 90 of political journalists are registered democrats while some 7 identify as republican ostensibly fact checking aims to help the public make moreinformed decisions both by helping them see past the candidates political spin and by helping them seewhich candidates are more truthful in practice fact checking is weighted against republicans largely because fact checkers evaluate republicans more than democrats when fact checkers do scrutinize democrats the party of the left often enjoys the benefit of the doubt for example when democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton first faced questions about whether she used her secret private email server to send or receive classified material thewashington post gave her a mere two pinocchios out of four when she claimed she had not for months evidence mounted that clinton had lied only when fbi director james comey said that clinton had indeed exchanged classified material through her email server while declining to prosecute her for the same did thepost upgrade its rating from two to four pinocchios conversely fact checkers often punish republicansforstatements that are factually correct for example politifact rated as false a statement by sen tom cotton r ar claiming that president barack obama had promised to dismantle iran s nuclear program but cotton s statement was in fact completely accurate in the run up to monday s first presidential debate democrats and media pundits have urged moderator lester holt to fact check republican nominee donald trump during the debate it is dubious advice given the disastrous precedent of cnn s candy crowley who erroneously fact checked republican mitt romney during the second debate in 2012 the pressure has another purpose which is to casttrump as more dishonest than clinton it is well past time to fact check the fact checkers check for regular updates during monday s
