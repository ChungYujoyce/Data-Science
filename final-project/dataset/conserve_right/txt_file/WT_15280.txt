apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic a senior pentagon official told congress last week that the u s government is concerned about the leakage of embargoed u s space technology to china gregory l schulte deputy assistant defense secretary for space policy was asked during a house armed services subcommittee hearing whether illicit exports of u s satellite technology by the french company thales would boost china s ambitious space weapons program mr schulte was questioned by rep michael r turner ohio republican and chairman of the strategic forces subcommittee about a recent letter he and two other lawmakers had written to secretary of state hillary rodham clinton on thales sale of satellites to china that contained restricted u s space technology the letter raised concerns about whether such tech transfers would boost the increasingly aggressive activity in space by the people s republic of china top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning mr schulte said the state department is investigating the thales satellite export case the leakage of sensitive technology to countries like china has of course been foremost in our mind as we ve thought about export control reform he said china s long range missiles were improved during the 1990s after two u s companies illicitly shared u s space technology with beijing mr schulte said the obama administration is planning to loosen technology export controls by moving some items on the u s munitions list to the more easily licensed commerce control list but only space items that are already widely available and we are not proposing removing the tiananmen square sanctions that would remain in place even with export control reform meaning that items still on the munitions list could not be exported to china mr schulte said and also meaning that we would not allow the launch of satellites from chinese launch vehicles the administration is also proposing that for china all items moved off the munitions list would still be subject to restrictive licensing and controls so we are very conscious of china and we have developed our export control proposals with china very much in mind mr schulte said in fact we believe that to the extent that we focus on those technologies that are most sensitive we can increase the focus of our export control and enforcement efforts to avoid situations like this in the future asked why no sanctions have been imposed on thales for the illicit u s satellite technology export to china mr schulte said we are clearly concerned at any leakage of sensitive technology to china and support all enforcement efforts there thales came under investigation by the state department several years ago for offering what it advertised as an itar free satellite for sale meaning it did not require u s licensing several of the satellites were sold to china and u s investigators found that they contained u s satellite technology that was restricted for export to china to date the state department has not sanctioned thales for the exports afghan fallout the pentagon is moving rapidly to try to limit the political fallout from the recent shooting deaths of 16 afghan civilians by a u s soldier defense analysts say the attack is a severe setback for u s and allied counterinsurgency operations in the country that are based in large measure on soft power efforts to gain support from the local afghan population to turn against the taliban the damage grew worse this week when a senior member of the iran s parliament called for the withdrawal of all coalition forces from the country senate speaker fazl hadi moslemyar on tuesday went on afghan television in his call for all foreign troops to depart afghanistan mr moslemyar also urged all provincial councils to close offices in reaction to the killings mr moslemyar said foreigners are not needed in the country and have brought only calamity and failure panetta on bunker busters for israel defense secretary leon e panetta last week disputed published reports that the united states had supplied advanced bunker busting bombs to israel asked about the bombs at a meeting with reporters mr panetta said we have not discussed that area instead the united states is discussing increasing missile defenses for israel which likely would face a large scale missile attack from iran in response to any military action against iran s fortified nuclear facilities mr panetta said we have very close military relationships with israel mr panetta said we obviously talk about a lot of things in terms of plans and training etc and we will continue to have that kind of relationship in the future the defense secretary went on to outline the u s position on an israeli attack stating that the united states shares israel s concerns but wants more time to allow sanctions to work before conducting an attack we obviously respect their sovereignty we understand that they have to make decisions you know that are in their interest the united states also has to make decisions that are in our interest he said and obviously we will do whatever we can to defend israel but more importantly when it comes to iran we have common cause against iran we have the same concerns as israel with regards to their obtaining a nuclear weapon and we ve made very clear we are going to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon and we are also going to ensure that they do not close the straits of hormuz asked why the united states appears to be taking a strong position on iran s nuclear weapons while saying less about north korea s nuclear arms program that is further along mr panetta said the united states is concerned about the north korean nuclear arms and is continuing to press pyongyang to step back from further developing nuclear arms as for iran obviously the concern there is the destabilization that would occur in that region if iran were to obtain a nuclear weapon he said michele flournoy who in february stepped down as undersecretary of defense for policy said during remarks last week that two countries in the region are set to develop nuclear weapons if iran get the arms she did not name the countries but speculation has focused on saudi arabia and turkey mattis on chavez marine corps gen james n mattis commander of the u s central command made some

fellow down in venezuela as a very significant ally mr chavez publicly joked about having a big atomic bomb during a meeting in venezuela in january with iranian p
