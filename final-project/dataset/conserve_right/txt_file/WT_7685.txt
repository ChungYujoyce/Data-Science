who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion fiona cunningham is to be commended for her report nuclear command control and communications systems of the people s republic of china nautilus july 18 2019 ms cunningham relies on unclassified sources to provide a well researched summary of the mainstream view of academics china scholars and even many military professionals of the prc s nuclear doctrine and c3 arrangements unfortunately this mainstream view is almost certainly wrong western analysts consistently fail to understand that for both beijing and moscow nuclear war plans and c3 to execute those plans are national security crown jewels that they try to protect and conceal behind a bodyguard of lies and disinformation trusting open sources and commentary especially when they are intended to cast nuclear doctrine and c3 in the most benign possible way is a big mistake top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk for example during the cold war the ussr went to extraordinary lengths to disinform western policymakers and the public that moscow had a nuclear no first use doctrine this was intended to conceal their real nuclear war plans that we now know entailed a massive nuclear first strike early in a conflict the nfu disinformation campaign was also intended to mobilize western anti nuclear activists in and out of government to constrain u s nuclear programs and operational plans china s alleged nuclear nfu doctrine like the ussr s during the cold war is almost certainly disinformation nfu for china does not withstand the test of common sense no conservative military planner would adopt nfu when as ms cunningham correctly observes china lacks bmews and satellite early warning systems that would enable china to launch on tactical warning nfu would doom china s nuclear deterrent to certain destruction by a u s or russian conventional or nuclear first strike or to a nuclear first strike by india china s nuclear posture especially the lack of early warning radars and satellites is use it or lose it which logically should drive prc military planners toward nuclear first use indeed toward surprise first use early in a crisis or conflict based on strategic warning regardless of the prc s declaratory nfu policy it strains credulity beijing s political leaders would adhere to nfu if confronted with compelling political and military intelligence of an imminent u s attack such strategic warning was the basis for the former ussr s secret plans for a disarming nuclear first strike under their vryan surprise nuclear missile attack intelligence program that nearly resulted in a nuclear apocalypse during nato s theater nuclear exercise able archer 83 just as ms cunningham s report would have benefitted from greater skepticism about nfu greater humility about what we know and don t know about china s nuclear posture is also advisable for example do we really know that china s nuclear warheads are in storage not mounted on missiles this would be a very grave vulnerability china s icbms and irbms are in cold launch cannisters we cannot see if they are armed or not ms cunningham seriously proposes that china gives such high priority to safeguarding against unauthorized nuclear use that their very costly ballistic missile submarine fleet may in peacetime carry no slbms perhaps she means they would carry no slbm nuclear warheads in either case this defies common sense as it would render useless china s ssbn fleet as a deterrent against surprise attack the ssbns would also become an escalatory liability in a crisis or conflict as the process of uploading missiles or warheads would be very lengthy highly visible and so provocative as to invite a disarming first strike undoubtedly china will operate its ssbns in peacetime as they are being tested now loaded for bear with slbms armed with nuclear warheads aboard for decades western analysts have almost certainly grossly underestimated china s number of nuclear weapons as about 300 compared to about 1 500 operational strategic nuclear weapons for the u s and russia or five times as many this seems based more on wishful thinking than a realistic appraisal of china s nuclear capabilities russian gen viktor yesin former commander in chief of the strategic rocket forces provided a more realistic estimate of china s nuclear capabilities in an article published seven years ago third after the united states and russia on china s nuclear capabilities without understatement or exaggeration april 30 2012 gen yesin calculates china could have 10 000 nuclear munitions based on the prc s estimated production of up to 40 tons of weapons uranium and about 10 tons of weapons grade plutonium manufactured as of 2011 however based on china s strategic and tactical delivery systems gen yesin concludes there may be up to 1 800 warheads in china s nuclear arsenal contrary to the title of gen yesin s article this would make china with 1 800 strategic and tactical nuclear weapons the second most heavily armed nuclear power after russia 3 500 operational strategic and tactical nuclear weapons but before the u s 1 700 strategic and tactical nuclear weapons china s nuclear capabilities are clearly underestimated significantly higher than commonly believed in the western expert community concludes russian gen yesin as the new cold war heats up in the pacific the united states had better not bet its security on china s no first use pledge and a presumed five to one u s advantage in nuclear weapons peter vincent pry served as chief of staff of the congressional emp commission and i
