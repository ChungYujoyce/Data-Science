apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic north conway n h ap toeing the 2012 line former utah gov jon huntsman sounded like a full fledged white house candidate saturday set to join the field this month as he mapped out a campaign strategy that bypasses early voting iowa to focus on new hampshire south carolina and florida in an associated press interview during a visit to new hampshire s rural north country huntsman said his party s nomination race has never been this wide open the unsettled nature he said benefits the kind of campaign he s preparing to undertake that uncertainty is good it allows people to get in assess express their opinions see whether their ideas rise or fall it s unlike any other election cycle in recent history huntsman said between stops top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey just five weeks removed as president barack obama s ambassador to china huntsman said the gop campaign at this point is about personalities not policy but that will change as the field firms up this is the marketplace of political ideas this is how america operates huntsman said it s a free market it s free wheeling from the outside it looks unpredictable there s a circus like free market he s not rushing to join that circus he s skipping a debate june 13 in new hampshire he said he won t be an official candidate by then iowa s lead off caucuses are out for him huntsman said because of his opposition to subsidies for corn based ethanol why waste time trying to court iowa voters who see that support as a way of life and a deal breaker he said i m not competing in iowa for a reason he said look for him a lot in new hampshire where independent voters who can cast ballots in either party s primary are the largest political bloc they twice rewarded arizona sen john mccain in his presidential campaigns many of huntsman s advisers are veterans of those runs then it s on to south carolina which is open to anyone and then to florida which he called his make or break state television ads hold huge sway in florida and huntsman a successful and wealthy businessman could blanket the airwaves with ads if he makes it that far during a three day new hampshire swing to introduce himself to voters who have the nation s first primary he held court at breakfast indulged in ice cream at a fair and dropped by a veterans hall that kind of campaigning a hallmark of this state contrasted with former alaska gov sarah palin s visit last week when she was treated more as a celebrity that a potential contender or former massachusetts gov mitt romney s choreographed race entering announcement on thursday huntsman is trying to portray himself as what an honest broker willing to say what others will not for instance he said the next budget should consider cuts in defense spending sacrosanct for hawkish republicans if we can t find cuts in the defense budget we re not looking carefully enough he said he isn t eager to dispatch u s military might we need to look at a map and say realistically where do we need to be they all add up and they all cost us something america s economic decline hasn t been solely democrats fault it s happened now during many administrations it s taken a lot of presidents to get us where we are today a lot of deployments a lot of wars a lot engagements you add them all up he said he understands that approach may not be the best political course if you go down talking about it that s ok what is important is that you re honest with the american people they re ready for that kind of discussion huntsman said huntsman said his role will be to make certain that the candidates are talking seriously about fixing washington from spending to entitlement programs such as social security that many have declared off limits if you re looking to cut a family budget or a business table you put everything on the table you don t automatically dismiss things as sacred cows he said it s just not intellectually defensible any other approach would smack of politics i don t think we can afford to do that huntsman who served three republican administrations said his time as envoy in beijing for a democratic president would not be the disqualifier some have predicted he cited gen david petraeus obama s pick to lead the cia and outgoing defense secretary bob gates their service dates to the george w bush administration they are representing every american s interests huntsman said they are not however running for president against the man who put them in their current jobs i m surprised that we ve gotten to a point where we don t put our country first and put our party first accepting an assignment from everyone s president during a time of war during a time of economic hardship is putting your country first i won t shy away from that he said if someone wants to hold that against me they can he said in the interview that he wasn t certain about his presidential ambitions before accepting the china post sometimes you don t see yourself the way other people do
