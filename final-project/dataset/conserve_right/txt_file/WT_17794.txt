agreed to institute full democracy for hong kong by 2017 under the mantra one country two systems many longtime residents say they have a right to feel shortchanged by a handover deal cobbled together by a british government eager to please a potential trading giant instead of full democracy hong kong is still ruled by beijing vetted candidates who are elected from small groups of local elites
