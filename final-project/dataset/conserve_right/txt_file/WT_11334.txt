apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic shanghai ap for a few thousand dollars chinese companies offer to export a powerful chemical that has been killing unsuspecting drug users and is so lethal that it presents a potential terrorism threat an associated press investigation has found the ap identified 12 chinese businesses that said they would export the chemical a synthetic opioid known as carfentanil to the united states canada the united kingdom france germany belgium and australia for as little as 2 750 a kilogram 2 2 pounds no questions asked carfentanil burst into view this summer the latest scourge in an epidemic of opioid abuse that has killed tens of thousands of people in the united states alone dealers have been cutting carfentanil and its weaker cousin fentanyl into heroin and other illicit drugs to boost profit margins top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey despite the dangers carfentanil is not a controlled substance in china where it is manufactured legally and sold openly online the u s government is pressing china to blacklist carfentanil but beijing has yet to act leaving a substance whose lethal qualities have been compared with nerve gas to flow into foreign markets unabated we can supply carfentanil for sure a saleswoman from jilin tely import and export co wrote in broken english in a september email and it s one of our hot sales product china s ministry of public security declined multiple requests for comment from the ap the u s government has told china that it is concerned about carfentanil s potential use as a chemical weapon a state department official said friday in response to the ap s findings agents like carfentanil could be used in lethal doses that would make them comparable to traditional nerve agents raising concerns that they could be used as chemical weapons the official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record the state department has raised this issue with senior chinese leaders before being discovered by drug dealers carfentanil and substances like it were viewed as chemical weapons one of the most powerful opioids in circulation carfentanil is so deadly that an amount smaller than a poppy seed can kill a person fentanyl is up to 50 times stronger than heroin carfentanil is chemically similar but 100 times stronger than fentanyl itself it s a weapon said andrew weber assistant secretary of defense for nuclear chemical and biological defense programs from 2009 to 2014 companies shouldn t be just sending it to anybody the ap did not actually order any drugs so could not conduct tests to determine whether the products on offer were genuine but a kilogram of carfentanil shipped from china was recently seized in canada carfentanil was first developed in the 1970s and its only routine use is as an anesthetic for elephants and other large animals governments quickly targeted it as a potential chemical weapon forms of fentanyl are suspected in at least one known assassination attempt and were used by russian forces against chechen separatists who took hundreds of hostages at a moscow theater in 2002 the chemicals are banned from the battlefield under the chemical weapons convention in fiscal year 2014 u s authorities seized just 3 7 kilograms 8 1 pounds of fentanyl this fiscal year through just mid july they have seized 134 1 kilograms 295 pounds according to u s customs and border protection data obtained by the ap fentanyl is the most frequently seized synthetic opioid u s customs reports users are dying of accidental respiratory arrest and overdose rates have soared china has not been blind to the key role its chemists play in the global opioid supply chain most synthetic drugs that end up in the united in states come from china either directly or by way of mexico according to the dea china already has placed controls on 19 fentanyl related compounds adding carfentanil to that list is likely to only diminish not eliminate global supply despite periodic crackdowns people willing to skirt the law are easy to find in china s vast freewheeling chemicals industry made up of an estimated 160 000 companies operating legally and illegally vendors said they lie on customs forms guaranteed delivery to countries where carfentanil is banned and volunteered strategic advice on sneaking packages past law enforcement speaking from a bright booth at a chemicals industry conference in shanghai last month xu liqun said her company hangzhou reward technology could produce carfentanil to order it s dangerous dangerous but if we send 1kg 2kg it s ok she said adding that she wouldn t do the synthesis herself because she s pregnant she said she knows carfentanil can kill and believes it should be a controlled substance in china the government should impose very serious limits but in reality in china it s so difficult to control because if i produce one or two kilograms how will anyone know she said they cannot control you so many products so many labs several vendors recommended sending the drugs via ems the express mail service of state owned china postal express logistics co as a fail safe option ems is a little slow than fedex or dhl but very safe more than 99 pass rate a yuntu chemical co representative wrote in an email if send to the usa each package less than 250g is the best small and unattractive we will divide 1kg into 4 5 packages and send every other day or send to different addresses ems declined to comment a yuntu representative hung up the phone when contacted by the ap and did not reply to emails seeking comment soon after the company s website vanished not all of the websites used to sell the drugs are based in china at least six chinese companies offering versions of fentanyl including carfentanil had ip addresses in the united states hosted at u s commercial web providers the ap found nobody was moving they put the people there like dolls in 2002 russian special forces turned to carfentanil after a three day standoff with chechen separatists who had taken more than 800 people hostage in a moscow theater they used an aerosol version of carfentanil along with the less potent remifentanil sending it through air vents according to a paper by british scientists who tested clothing and urine samples from three survivors the strategy worked but more than 120 hostages died from the effects of the chemicals olga dolotova an engineer who survived the attack remembers seeing white plumes descending before she lost consciousness when she awoke she found herself on a bus packed with bodies it was such a horror just to look at it she said nobody was moving they put the people there like dolls the theater siege raised concerns about carfentanil as a tool of war or terrorism and prompted the u s to develop strategies to counter its use according to weber the former defense department chemical weapons expert the u s russia china israel the czech republic the united kingdom and india are are among the countries that have assessed carfentanil and related compounds for offensive or defensive applications according to publicly available documents and academic studies countries that we are concerned about were interested in using it for offensive purposes weber said we are also concerned that groups like isis could order it commercially weber considered a range of alarming scenarios including the use of carfentanil to knock out and take troops hostage or to kill civilians in a closed environment like a train station he added that it is important to raise awareness about the threat from carfentanil trafficking shining sunlight on this black market activity should encourage chinese authorities to shut it down he said fentanyls also have been described as ideal tools for assassination lethal and metabolized quickly so they leave little trace agents from israel s secret intelligence service mossad sprayed a substance believed to be a fentanyl analog into the ear of hamas leader khaled mashaal as he walked down a street in amman jordan in a botched 1997 assassination attempt the u s began researching fentanyl as an incapacitating agent in the 1960s and by the 1980s government scientists were experimenting with aerosolized carfentanil on primates according to neil davison the author of non lethal weapons who now works at the international committee of the red cross the u s says it is no longer developing such chemical agents but two state owned companies in china have marketed narcosis dart guns according to michael crowley author of chemical control and project coordinator at the university of bradford s non lethal weapons research project he said the ammunition might very well be fentanyl or an analog of fentanyl adding that in the 1990s the u s explored similar guns loaded with a form of fentanyl among the problems with fentanyls is that the line between life and death is too thin there is no incapacitating chemical agent that can be used in a tactical situation without extreme risk of injury or death to everybody in the room crowley said hurry to buy dea officials say they are getting unprecedented cooperation from china in the fight against fentanyls noting unusually deep information sharing in what can be a fractious bilateral relationship the dea has shared intelligence and scientific data with chinese authorities about controlling carfentanil according to russell baer a dea special agent in washington i know china is looking at it very closely he said that s been the subject of discussion in some of these high level meetings last october china added 116 synthetic drugs to its controlled substances list which had a profound impact on global narcotics supply chains acetylfentanyl for example is a weaker cousin of carfentanil that china included on last year s list of restricted substances six months later monthly seizures of acetylfentanyl in the u s had plummeted by 60 percent dea data obtained by the ap shows several vendors contacted in september were willing to export carfentanil but refused to ship the far less potent acetylfentanyl a jilin tely import export co saleswoman offered carfentanil for 3 800 a kilogram but wrote with an apologetic happy face that she couldn t ship acetylfentanyl because it is regulated by the government now contacted by the ap the company said it had never shipped carfentanil to north america and had offered to sell it just to attract the customer seven companies offered to sell acetylfentanyl despite the ban however five offered fentanyl and two offered alpha pvp commonly known as flakka which also are controlled substances in china liu feng deputy general manager of zhejiang haiqiang chemical co said his company sent a large order of carfentanil to india last year and has sold smaller amounts to trading companies in shanghai he said they also had put false labels on packages for customers everyone in the industry knows it he said but we just do not say it another company went out of its way to recommend acetylfentanyl our customer feedback that the effect is also very good wonder synthesis emailed in broken english the company says it has warehouses in the united states europe russia and india wonder synthesis did not respond to emails seeking comment and the phone number provided did not work the ap visited its published address in beijing and found a beauty parlor the problem with carfentanil is not limited to the united states in late june canadian authorities seized a kilogram of carfentanil shipped from china in a box labelled printer accessories the powder contained 50 million lethal doses according to the canada border services agency more than enough to wipe out the entire population of the country it was hidden inside bright blue cartridges labeled as ink for hp laserjet printers keep out of reach of children read the labels in chinese royal canadian mounted police officers in vancouver sealed themselves inside hazmat suits binding their wrists ankles zippers and face masks with fat strips of yellow tape with large oxygen containers on their backs and chunky respirators it looked as if they were preparing for a trip to the moon cocaine or heroin we know what the purpose is said allan lai an officer in charge at the royal canadian mounted police in calgary who is helping oversee the criminal investigation with respect to carfentanil we don t know why a substance of that potency is coming into our country in august and september high level delegations of chinese and u s drug enforcement authorities met to discuss joint efforts on synthetic opioids but neither meeting produced any substantive announcement on carfentanil nonetheless some chinese vendors are already bracing for a new wave of controls in an email wonder synthesis wrote if you need any chems just hurry to buy butler reported from
