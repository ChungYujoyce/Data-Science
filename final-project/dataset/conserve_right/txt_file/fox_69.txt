tremendously powerful military force in that area it aposs always on the table wallace we aposll talk with republican senator tom cotton about his calls for an aggressive response sen tom cotton r ark what iran did last week warrants such retaliatory military strikes wallace but is he telling the president joe biden d presidential candidate we the people wallace then 20 democratic presidential candidates face off this week in the first debate but what about a serious dark horse who didn apost make the cut montana governor steve bullock joins us for a sunday sit down about where his campaign goes from here plus democratic frontrunner joe biden under fire for touting his past work with segregationist senators reporter are you going to apologize like cory booker has called for biden apologize for what wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel whether biden is in for more heat at this week aposs debate and our power player of the week always heard by never seen the old guard aposs elite cannon team on the split second timing of the 21 gun salute all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington president trump says nothing is off the table when it comes to how the u s will respond to iran shoot down of an american surveillance drone the president is at camp david recalibrating his iran policy after calling off airstrikes thursday night but national security adviser john bolton says iran should not quote mistake u s prudence and discretion for weakness in a moment we aposll talk with republican senator tom cotton but first let aposs bring in david spunt with the latest from the white house david david spunt correspondent chris president trump returns to the white house from camp david later this afternoon he spent the night there before leaving for the camp yesterday on the south lawn he said that dialogue is his number one priority with iran and a few hours after getting to camp david he tweeted that major sanctions would take place tomorrow begin videotape spunt president trump making it clear he wants to avoid war with iran trump everybody was saying i aposm a warmonger and now they say i aposm a dove and i think i aposm neither spunt the president says that aposs why he aborted airstrikes trump i don apost want to kill 150 of anything or anybody unless that aposs absolutely necessary if the leadership of iran behaves badly then it aposs going to be a very very bad day for them spunt with few specifics the president tweeted major additional sanctions will be imposed on the country the president says he hopes iran becomes a productive and prosperous nation again the president also holding off on arresting thousands of illegal immigrants sunday morning fox news has confirmed house speaker nancy pelosi called president trump to ask him to delay the planned ice raids a hint of bipartisanship and the president obliged end videotape spunt now president trump basically said he is giving congress only a couple of weeks congress on this hand has only a few more working days chris before their july fourth recess then president trump said those deportations would begin now on another note we can tell you that president trump apparently sent a letter to kim jong un in north korea this is being reported from the white house reportedly chairman kim from the north korea news agency said the letter was excellent a senior national security advisor said that president trump and kim jong un would not be meeting for another summit anytime soon chris back to you from the white house wallace david spunt reporting from the white house david thanks for that we are joined now by senator tom cotton a member of both the intelligence and armed services committees and author of the new book sacred duty a soldier aposs tour at arlington national cemetery senator welcome back to fox news sunday cotton chris thanks for having me on wallace last sunday you called for a military strike against iran after it had attacked two foreign ships near the strait of hormuz here you are begin video clip cotton unprovoked attacks on commercial shipping warrant of retaliatory military strike against the islamic republic of iran end video clip wallace well this week as we all know i ran went after and shot down a u s navy and president trump first ordered and then called off a retaliatory strike what do you think of the president aposs move cotton chris obviously i think retaliatory strikes were warranted when we aposre talking about foreign vessels on the high seas i think they aposre warranted against an american unmanned aircraft what i see is iran steadily marching up the escalation chain it started down with threats it went into an attack on vessels in ports went into attack on vessels at sea now to unmanned american aircraft i fear that if iran doesn apost have a firm set of boundaries drawn around this behavior we are going to see an attack on a u s ship or u s manned aircraft this is exactly what we saw in the 1980s where iran for four years was allowed to attack ships on the high seas over 190 attacks in the iran iraq war ron reagan finally lost his patients after one of those mines hit a u s navy frigate and then he launched one of the largest naval engagements since world war ii i hope that that aposs not the case i hope it is not the case i hope the president aposs statement on friday and a statement yesterday that we will not tolerate any kind of attack on the american service member anywhere in the region gets through to the leaders in tehran i worry though that they have a long history of marching up this escalation ladder anytime they face a kind of strategic challenge they face right now thanks to the administration aposs maximum pressure campaign wallace you were very critical of president obama aposs failure to enforce his redline against syria after a chemical attack saying that it raised questions about how strong u s security commitments and statements by the president were president trump has repeatedly gone after mr obama on the same thing take a look begin video clip trump when he didn apost cross that line after making the threat i think that set us back a long ways not only in syria but in many other parts of the world because it was a blank threat end video clip wallace does this run the risk of being president trump aposs red line moment cotton no chris i see some differences between the two situations first the president obama aposs syria policy was a mess second he himself in his words drew that red line and then he failed to enforce it here president trump aposs iran policy is working it aposs probably the first time in 40 years where we have the initiative against iran one reason they are lashing out is because of a maximum pressure campaign that has driven their economy to near depression levels of activity second he had not drawn any such red line in his own language he didn apost take military strikes last week and overt or conventional fashion but he has said very clearly that we will not tolerate iran or its proxies making any type of attack on american service members or citizens in the region and he aposs also said that major sanctions are going to be added tomorrow which is only going to increase the sanctions they already face which is one very positive results so far of the maximum pressure campaign wallace iran now says i mean i think it aposs fair to say attacks on ships and drones serious as they are are kind of the sideshow the big deal is the iran nuclear deal and iran now says that it is going to violate that deal this week that it is going to exceed the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium and that perhaps it is going to violate the limit on uranium go from 3 1 2 percent enriched up to 20 percent putting it closer to a nuclear weapon if it does that and gets closer to a nuclear weapon what should the u s response be and are you at all concerned that the president aposs back and forth this week where he ordered an attack and then called it back may perhaps unrealistically encourage the mullahs to think they can get away with that cotton well chris i aposd say about iran aposs threat to enrich uranium to levels beyond what is permitted in the nuclear deal it aposs really going to be a question for the europeans whether they want to continue the charade of pretending that iran may continue to obey those limits and they can engage in some kind of trade with iran and bypass american sanctions i would say to those european leaders that given the fact that the president exercised restraint in this last week they should view that as an opening to double down with the united states on those sanctions if iran bypasses those enrichment limits but just like an attack on an american ship or any harm to american service member or citizen in the region the president has also been very clear he will not allow iran to approach a nuclear weapon wallace president trump as you point out says that he aposs going to impose major sanctions on iran starting tomorrow but he also says that if iran were to change its way of doing things that it can turn into an economic powerhouse take a look at what the president said begin video clip trump if iran wants to become a wealthy nation again become a prosperous nation we aposll call it let aposs make iran great again does that make sense make iran great again it aposs ok with me end video clip wallace now that aposs the same offer he made to north korea that if they gave up their nuclear weapons that he would turn them into an economic or help them become an economic powerhouse do you really think that repressive regimes like north korea and iran are going to give up their nuclear ambitions in return for the blessings of western capitalism cotton chris i aposll probably adhere here to what ronald reagan once said about the soviet union trust but verify the president aposs policy as announced by secretary of state mike pompeo in his 12 point speech last year was very clear the administration is not going to renegotiate the obama era nuclear deal they are not going to put a few new provisions on it they want iran to change its campaign of terror throughout the region and drop its imperial ambitions so that means things like stopping terrorist groups in rebel groups that are trying to overthrow legitimate governments supporting military proxy forces in iraq if they will adhere to those 12 points that secretary pompeo laid out on behalf of donald trump and negotiate a genuine and verifiable into their nuclear program then we can have a different kind of relationship with iran and that would be very much to the benefit of the iranian people as the president laid out yesterday wallace but it would seem to me in any case that the prospects that iran you aposre basically talking about the islamic regime completely changing its colors completely changing the way it acts you aposve got the iran revolutionary guard you aposve got hard liners in tehran do you think the prospect of american capitalism is going to change that cotton that aposs why i say a healthy dose of skepticism is warranted when you aposre dealing with regimes like the ayatollahs but let aposs be clear chris secretary pompeo didn apost ask them to turn into a western european style parliamentary democracy he asked him to behave like a normal nation to stop committing acts of terrorism and supporting terror groups stop trying to overthrow governments in the region stop attacking shipping on the high seas those are very reasonable request that we expect of any civilized and normal nation wallace speaking of north korea the regime there says that president trump sent a letter to chairman kim that he has received over the weekend and that kim quote will contemplate the interesting content of the letter really the same question how optimistic are you that iran will ever agree to denuclearize through diplomacy cotton again chris i think healthy skepticism is warranted here what we should do with iran is exactly what the president has done with north korea since kim jong un made unreasonable demands on the hanoi summit in february and the president rightly walked away from that summit we should keep the maximum pressure campaign on give them no quarter give them the opportunity to begin to act like a normal nation and try to seek relief in return for tangible and verifiable commitments but healthy skepticism is warranted any time you deal someone like kim jong un or the ayatollahs wallace president trump has also delayed a round up that was supposed to begin today of migrant families that have already been given their deportation orders he says he is giving congress two weeks to work out and reform the asylum system and otherwise he will impose the round up i don apost have to tell you you have a little bit of a look on your face you talk about healthy skepticism congress isn apost going to reform the asylum system in two weeks sir cotton so chris i will just say healthy skepticism is warranted for dealing with democrats when it comes to immigration let aposs just think about the democrats apos position here chris these are people who have claimed asylum in our country they aposve had their day in court they aposve had their plans rejected and now they face a valid and final order of removal if they can apost deport people like that who can they deport that aposs when the democrats apos position ultimately comes back to in essence open borders crosstalk wallace so what do you think of the president aposs decision to hold off on the roundup of these people who should be deported cotton two weeks for a couple thousand families is not going to make a big difference and if we could get a genuine law passed through congress that would address the asylum reforms that we need to start the crisis at the border that would be a good thing but again i go back to this point if you can apost deport an illegal alien as a valid and final order of removal that aposs adjudicated by an immigration judge who can you deport wallace finally you have written as we mentioned at the beginning a new book called sacred duty a soldier aposs tour at arlington national cemetery what did you learn about your tour of duty at arlington guarding the tomb of the unknowns dealing with section 60 which of course is the area where the people who died in the global war on terrorism are buried what did you learn from that experience cotton well it was a true honor to serve at arlington national cemetery when i did and to be back at the cemetery last year with the young soldiers some of whom you aposre profiling on your show later today who were honoring our fallen heroes but given this fact that we aposre on a political show i aposll just say that one thing i say when i aposm in arlington is the reverence the respect the gratitude even the love that everyone has no matter their political views or partisan affiliation for our fallen heroes and for the young soldiers who honor you know arlington was born in the ashes of the civil war the most divisive time in our country and i think it aposs a good reminder that no matter how divided our time seems to be today that they aposre still many things that we hold in common and hold dear as a country that unites us as americans wallace senator cotton thank you thanks for your time and as you point out we have a terrific story about a power player at the end of the show about a unit of the old guard and you aposre exactly right the reverence they have for the fallen there at arlington is quite extraordinary and quite inspiring and as you say a good message for all of us thank you sir cotton thanks chris wallace up next we will bring in our sunday group to discuss divisions inside the trump administration over how to respond to the shoot down of that surveillance drone plus what would you like to ask the panel about escalating tensions between the u s and iran just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip reporter how will you respond trump you aposll find out reporter are you willing to go to war with iran trump you aposll find out you aposll find out i find it hard to believe it was intentional if you want to know the truth i think that it could have been somebody who was loose and stupid end video clip wallace president trump this week sending mixed messages about how he would respond to iran downing a u s drone before finally deciding to call off a retaliatory air strike and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service emily jashinsky from the federalist and host of media buzz howard kurtz well i talked with some top members of the president aposs national security team this week after the president aposs decision and here aposs what i was told they were unanimous all of these people pentagon state department national security council they were unanimous and recommending a strike the president was fully briefed early on thursday on potential casualties he gave the execute order and hours later called it off and top advisors were quote surprised and don apost know what changed his mind karl is the only one of us who has been in the situation room with decisions like this are made how unusual is what happened on thursday and what you make of it karl rove contributor well it is not unusual for the president to take the unified advice of his advisors and reject it what aposs unusual is for us to this be played so prominently in the public the president talking about cocked and loaded in 10 minutes before it was supposed to be and so forth the question is whether this leaves an impression of weakness and frankly we don apost know yes on the surface it might it does on the other hand the accuracy of the reports about the cyber assault on the iranians on thursday could be very important because it did knock out the control systems for their missile systems and basically take offline the groups that had organized the assault on the tankers then the message inside tehran might be we better not mess with these people but let aposs be honest we as a country and the rest ought to be prepared for more attacks by the iranians because the president sanctions are working the economy as tom cotton senator cotton pointed out is in freefall and the iranians will react to this by doing something to escalate this probably by using proxies but we do have a moment now where the president could say he said to them we aposre going to put some additional sanctions on a monday and then more sanctions were coming if things don apost move the europeans are clearly moving towards a situation of freeze freeze the sanctions freeze the nuclear program and then talk whether that aposs successful or not i don apost know but we ought to be prepared as a country for more assaults and maybe the loss of american lives wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook from cecil leake he writes are we going to do anything about the attack or are we going to get another red line scenario like syria mo i don apost have to tell you and as i brought it up with senator cotton republicans including president trump went after barack obama for failing to enforce his redline in syria saying it showed that you know he didn apost keep his promises he didn apost keep his commitments do you see what donald trump did on thursday ordering and then deciding to call off the strike do you see that as an act of wisdom or an act of weakness mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics public service i think it aposs an act of confusion and i think this is an incredibly dangerous time to have at least a publicly confusing policy when it comes to iran i agree with karl that this could be a situation where the iranians look at what we did and maybe you feel a little bit more emboldened because it was so publicly played out particularly and it didn apost need to be publicly played out this way the president has the right to make a decision he aposs going to make but to play it out the way he did and using rhetoric that he did has potential to embolden the iranians in a very very delicate time in the relationship there i think that there aposs you know look iran has never been an economic powerhouse iran these sanctions are hurting them but i don apost know if that aposs what aposs going to motivate them when you have a repressive regime like the iranians and if they aposre hell bent on pursuing a nuclear program this is actually provocations and bluster from the american government actually strengthens their case internally to continue to move forward so i worry that because of the presidents habits here you know i aposm glad at the end he pulled back but because of his habits and how he talks about these things i worry that he may have further poked the hornets nest wallace if the president is reluctant to use force against iran the past week he also decided at the last minute to delay a planned round up this morning of migrant families these are migrant families who have been given a court order for deportation and there was going to be around up in major cities across the country here is what the president said saturday morning about what is called a family op a family operation to round up these people in the country illegally begin video clip trump everybody that came into the country illegally will be brought out of the country end video clip wallace but emily late saturday as we say the president decided to delay this for two weeks to give congress time for asylum reform what are your thoughts about the delay what are your thoughts about the prospects that congress is going to make some major action on asylum reform in two weeks emily jashinsky teh federalist yes i mean i think any major action on that would have had to have happen before the midterms i mean here we are sitting in june of 2019 and i think the likelihood of anything passing in congress would have i mean that aposs well past its date of having any potential of getting done so this two week window is remarkably short i don apost think it aposs likely that anything gets done i think congress has punted time and again and that aposs really the main thing that has prevented this president who has done things like declare a national emergency for the border wall from enacting his full immigration agenda i think that frustrates a small portion of his base maybe not a significant portion of his base but i do think there is a small section of that hard core trump base that things democrats are winning on this are beating him in the negotiations on immigration this decision will fuel that perception wallace howie i think it aposs safe to say reporters like us tend to dismiss threats like this but on the other hand i remember couple of weeks ago when the president suddenly threatened mexico and said we are going to impose these tariffs and everybody went oh that aposs that could be very inflammatory it aposs not going to get anything done the fact is that mexico is now as a result of the threats taking steps to guard its southern border with guatemala and some of the central american countries are doing things to stop their asylum seekers from leaving their country and coming here so sometimes the president aposs tactics do work howard kurtz host of media buzz threatening to begin the ice raids today calling it off in the last minute is sort of the classic trumpian real estate developer make outrageous demands brinksmanship that it actually does work what happens is he will do something and his political opponents and the media will say has donald trump gone too far and then there was chaos and confusion and then he hammers out some kind of compromise and declares victory and there aposs connective tissue here between this decision and the decision not to go forward with the airstrikes against iran i think the process was obviously messy but the president ended up where most or at least many americans are which is after iraq and afghanistan tired of endless wars he was conflicted because he ran against dumb foreign entanglements but also likes to take a tough line against iran but i think the key thing chris is this whole he back down he cave narrative really reflects our pretty hawkish foreign policy establishment including some of its charter members in the media which almost always favoring military action after every provocation but then wallace let me pick on that kurtz yes wallace well i was just going to say i remember in the 1980s i was covering ronald reagan and he suddenly announced they were going to re flag kuwaiti tankers and fly them under u s protection and there were a lot of people in the media at that point who were saying oh my gosh he is going to get us into a war in fact he re flagged them at a certain point a frigate was hit a mine he went out as cotton said with a really aggressive attack on iran it didn apost get us in the war it got iran to back down sometimes a limited targeted use of force works kurtz sure but we have learned from iraq what everyone what generals saying wallace but that wasn apost limited target use of force kurtz no not at all but i aposm saying that you know things can escalate rapidly and the president ultimately decided he did not want to take the risk of doing that in this instance despite his reluctance wallace real quick real quickly rove yes look we saw this on syria the president president obama was applauded by many including people in the media saying well the red line we don apost want to get engaged in syria this is just going to bog us down and what happened with president trump set across her redline with him and set 100 cruise missiles plunging in syria and destroyed 24 percent of their airports like that nothing happened because the president demonstrated resolved i aposm not saying the president is appearing weak in this situation i aposm saying in this situation i aposm glad you agreed with me but you aposve got to fully it agree with me wallace you got to fully agree with him crosstalk wallace all right we got to get out of this segment rove you fully agree with me what really matters is how did the iranians react to the cyber attack and they say oh my god we better not mess around with these people but look what they did to our communications crosstalk wallace i wonder if taking out a military battery a radar a missile battery might have been more effective but in any case to be debated we have to take a break here we aposll see you panel a little later when we come back montana governor and 2020 candidate steve bullock why didn apost he make the first democratic debate and what will he do now to raise his profile we aposll ask him commercial break wallace coming up 2020 democrats knock joe biden for comments about working with segregationists while others stress his larger point begin video clip sen kamala harris d calif presidential candidate they were misplaced and frankly misinformed unidentified male you don apost walk away from those relationships over politics you try to work around them work through them end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel how badly was biden hurt end video clip commercial break wallace he aposs the only democratic presidential candidate out of 23 who won statewide office in a state donald trump one in 2016 but he won apost get to make his case in the first democratic debates this week because he didn apost qualify montana governor steve bullock joins us now for a fox news sunday sit down governor welcome gov steve bullock d mont presidential candidate good morning chris great to be with you wallace you i don apost have to tell you are not going to be on the debate stage this week for the first democratic debates in the meantime as the governor of montana you won apost be there but a tech entrepreneur andrew yang will be there and self help guru marianne williamson will be there how big a blow to your campaign sir bullock well chris it certainly disappointed because missing from that stage will be somebody that actually won in a trump state and we need to win back some of those places that we lost if we aposre going to win in 2020 someone that has bridge divides my legislature is majority republican but we aposve gotten meaningful things done someone from a rural state which i think is important and somebody from out of washington d c but i don apost think that it aposs a blow to my campaign in the slightest i mean during that time i aposll actually be in town halls in iowa and in new hampshire talking to people and i think that aposs how both i aposve won here in montana three times statewide i aposve always put sort of people above sort of the politics or the political party rules and i think that aposs what people are going to want in a president wallace ok let let aposs talk specifically about it because it is one of your main selling points that you have run and won in montana three times once as attorney general twice as governor in a state that donald trump won in 2016 by 20 points the question i guess i have is what aposs the practical effect of that the fact that you won in a red state how does in a practical way does that mean that you aposd have a better chance than another democratic candidate of beating president trump in states that he won in 2016 like pennsylvania and michigan and wisconsin bullock yes chris i was on the ballot in 2016 he took montana by 20 i won by four twenty five to 30 percent of my voters voted for donald trump in a practical we both have to bring out our base and win back some of those places that we lost and i can apost win in montana just by going to the pockets of blue i get all across this state and i think that we need to make sure that our democratic nominee can be competitive not only on the coast but as you know places like wisconsin places like pennsylvania and i believe i can be that candidate wallace you talk about working with and getting bills through the republican controlled legislature in montana which which brings me to joe biden who talked this week about how he used to work with segregationist senators to get legislation through that led to a controversy over whether biden should apologize for those comments take a look begin video clip question are you going to apologize like cory booker has called for biden apologize for what question cory booker has called for it he aposs asking you to apologize biden cory should apologize he knows better there aposs not a racist bone in my body i aposve been involved in civil rights my whole career period sen cory booker d n j presidential candidate for his posture to be to me i aposve done nothing wrong you should apologize i aposm not a racist is so insulting and and and and so missing the larger point that he should not have to have explained to him end video clip wallace governor what do you think of what the former vice president joe biden said and do you think some of your democratic rivals in the field are too focused on ideological purity over practical politics bullock well chris i certainly work to maintain decent relationships in my state house and i think that the vice president aposs illustration of the we need to work with other individuals and folks that we may not agree with all the time is a valid point and that aposs what i do here in montana i might not have chosen those specific senators from a perspective of giving the shout out to who he aposs been able to work with wallace let aposs my guess is most people don apost know where you stand on issues so let aposs do a lightning round and the point of a lightning round let me explain to you since it aposs our first time quick answers and i aposll give quick questions to give a sense of where you stand on some issues medicare for all bullock i think we ought to have access and affordability for everyone you can do that by providing a public option negotiating drug prices ending surprise medical billing but you don apost need to disrupt about 156 million people that have health insurance on the private market right now we should be driving down those costs wallace the green new deal bullock we need to take action on climate and it has to be immediate and durable we can apost wait another three decades by any means the scientists say we have to be net zero by 2050 i think we can do it a lot sooner so that aspiration behind it i agree with the specific policy proposals i think needs a heck of a lot of work wallace immigration you said last year that you would not send montana national guard to the southern border as part of president trump aposs effort but don apost we need to secure our borders sir bullock look yes and democrats certainly and i believe in border security and keeping families safe and also growing our economy but this 18th century solution let aposs just build a wall to a 21st century problem i don apost think is the way to go this is a humanitarian crisis and we aposre actually in many respects we aposre exacerbating that crisis we aposre not actually helping it wallace what limits if any on when a woman should have an abortion bullock forty five years ago the supreme court said that in roe versus wade that this ought to be a decision made by the woman in consultation with her doctor if she so chooses also her family and faith i aposve stood behind that and i think that aposs where we need to go as a country wallace but the roe system the roe decision did set up a system of trimesters and over time the court has basically said there are you know there are more protections for women in the first trimester and perhaps in the second than there are in the third are you saying that a woman should have a right to an abortion right up until the moment of birth bullock no what i aposm saying chris is we ought to follow roe versus wade you aposre absolutely right in the third trimester there aposs balancing and only in cases necessarily of a woman aposs when the health is endangered and i think that aposs what most places have done wallace all right i want to delve into one last area with you because it aposs an area where some of your critics say that you have flipped as you aposve decided to run for president and that is the area of guns back in 2016 you opposed universal background checks and you said that you would expand second amendment rights in your state of montana but more recently you now support universal background checks you support a limit on the size of gun magazines and you oppose or rather you support a ban on some semiautomatic weapons why the change of mind sir bullock yes and chris i have been both a supporter of the second amendment and i aposve also vetoed bills that i don apost think makes sense you know i aposve had to lower the flags five times just since parkland i think if we ever looked at this as a public health issue and not a political issue we could make strides like even republicans and nra members believe that guns should be kept out of the wrong hands and universal background checks we ought to move forward in that red flag laws when you look at being able to remove a gun where an order of protection is in place places like walmart and dick aposs have banned the selling of assault weapons assault rifles and it aposs about time we take a look at this as well you know when i was growing up the nra was a gun safety organization and a hunting organization now it aposs nothing more than a political organization trying to divide us we need to figure out addressing it from a public health perspective could actually make a meaningful difference in keeping our families and our communities safe wallace governor bullock thank you thanks for sharing part of your weekend with us this is the first but it won apost be the last time we talk with you sir safe travels on the campaign trail bullock it aposs great being with you this morning chris wallace when we come back democratic frontrunner joe biden coming off a tough week after some of his rivals call him out of touting his past civility with segregationist what can biden expect from his opponents at this week aposs debate commercial break begin video clip sen elizabeth warren d mass presidential candidate people across this nation understand it is time for big structural change in america sen bernie sanders i vt d presidential candidate i will make it my priority not only to eliminate national economic disparities but racial disparities once and for all end video clip wallace some of the democratic presidential candidates making their pitches at this weekend aposs south carolina state party convention and we aposre back now with the panel well howie this is the first big week in this race how do you handicap the first set of democratic debates this week and joe biden talking about working with segregationist senators how damaging do you think it is for him to talk about how we did things in the good old days given where the democratic party is today kurtz on the debates 19 other people trying to break through grab a viral moment on a very crowded stage is going to be tough on biden we all know what joe biden was trying to say about working with people of very different views but his selection of stone cold racists like james eastland a long dead democrat was just incredibly tone deaf and even more so chris because he aposs told these antidotes before and his staff had urged him to stop joe biden aposs problem right now is that elections are about the future and he sometimes seems stuck in these long ago battles about bussing and other issues back in the apos70s and it seems to me that he aposs given his liberal opponents an opening to say he aposs out of step with the party but i think there aposs so much good will that joe biden enjoys among democrats that this doesn apost hurt him much outside the washington bubble unless he keeps making these blunders wallace well he aposs going to have an opportunity to make those blunders on the debate stage you know emily biden holds continues to hold a double digit lead nationally and in most of the early primary states how aggressively do you expect that well it won apost be those 19 other candidates it will only be nine on the stage with him but the nine other candidates on the sage with him on thursday night to go after him emily jashinsky the federalist yes i think we aposve actually seen a preview of how that will play out just after these comments were made because every i mean cory booker has hit him hard for this kamala harris has hit him hard for this we aposve seen an energy over this among his rivals that clearly plan to use it against him that said you do note he he does enjoy a double digit lead i think he does enjoy as howie said a lot of good will with the broader democratic electorate which is older than i think a lot of the the hard left online recognizes and those hard left attacks have just not stuck to biden so far it aposs early but you know as early as it is we still haven apost seen those hard left attacks really damage him yet this is he aposs going to get hard over this this week hit hard over this this week that aposs for sure wallace let aposs turn to president trump who and i know it looks like and seems like he aposs been running ever since he was elected in 2016 but he officially announced this week in orlando that he aposs going to be running for re election in 2020 and let aposs take a look at a bit of that announcement speech begin video clip trump our radical democrat opponents are driven by hatred prejudice and rage they want to destroy our you and they want to destroy our country as we know it they would shut down your free speech use the power of the law to punish their opponents they would strip americans of their constitutional rights end video clip wallace other than that he aposs very fond of the democrats karl as someone who managed a successful re election campaign for george w bush in 2004 what do you think of using the first 30 or 40 minutes of your announcement speech to re litigate old grievances and do you think he can sell that dire vision of democrats in 2020 karl rove contributor well the to answer the first part of your question i aposm not certain that aposs the great way to start off by re litigating the past every election is about the future and it is important for him to say here aposs what i aposve done to strengthen our economy but it aposs even more important for him to say here aposs what i want to do next now as to the second part of your your question it is always useful to contrast yourself with your opponents i aposm not certain that that was the most effective contrast it aposs better if it aposs if if it aposs if they use the substance in their comments jon krakauer ph has an interesting piece today think about this we aposve we aposve talked about biden and it could have been worse if it were not for civil rights icon john lewis and and jim clyburn saying this isn apost a problem with us it would have been worse for biden but think about that that covered up the fact kamala harris goes to south carolina and says and defends the only member of the u s house to vote against the resolution calling for a u s response to al qaeda in the aftermath of 9 11 booker refuses to say that i won apost meet with louis farrakhan elizabeth warren stands up in south carolina and says free college no tuition no fees at any public university in america and bernie sanders attacks centrist democrats as representing of the corporate interest there is plenty of material being given to the president and his re election campaign and it aposs only going to get better only going to get more juicy only going to get more delicious and that aposs what the president ought to be focused on wallace mo this is why he aposs the best because i asked him a question about what donald trump said and he turned it into a full fledged attack on the democrats that was very very well inaudible it was a good pivot rove which the president i was i was sending a message the president can do that too wallace well now here aposs my question to you what did you think of the president aposs announcement speech and in an interview this week he said he doesn apost know that he aposs really going to have to go after swing voters because he said it aposs really just about you know turning out his base is is that what this is going to be about the president turning out his base democrats turning out their base and nothing in the middle mo elleithee georgetown institute of policies and public service it doesn apost have to be but that aposs appears to be where he aposs headed at least right look two important things to note about the president aposs numbers from the day he announced his candidacy through today his unfavorable rating has hovered around 55 percent that aposs pretty remarkable his approval rating job approval which is different than favorably but his job approval has always been sort of that 40 you know 38 to 42 percent sweet spot might tick up a little might tick down a little bit but that aposs been the sweet spot he got 46 percent of the vote he there are about 6 percent of the people out there who voted for him even though they did not like him he is doubling down in this speech and in this campaign by saying i don apost need those people this time i aposm going to focus on my base and try to depress turnout for the other side i think that is going to be his strategy democrats have an opportunity to go after those people in the middle rove neither party aposs base is big enough to win this election the winner of this election is going to wake is the person who wakes up and realizes they aposve got to take their base and cemented it to a majority of the small number of truly independent undecided swing voter wallace but but i think would you agree that donald trump hasn apost done that yet rove no but look i campaigns are about phasing and so he started out by saying i aposm i aposm i aposm appealing to my base there was a brilliant column elleithee it hasn apost stopped rove there was a brilliant column in wall street journal thursday morning i aposm surprised you didn apost read it that suggested that the president needed wallace was that by you rove yes of course it suggested that the president needed to mitigate the animosity of people towards him that 50 some odd percent who say they aposll never vote for him and he needed to focus his campaign on winning those on those swing voters wallace and when does and we aposve got ten seconds when does he need to do that rove well he aposll we aposve started this presidential campaign a lot earlier than we aposve ever started a re election campaign whether it was 2011 12 or 2003 and apos04 this is really really early so he aposs got plenty of time to do that wallace it aposs getting early late here i think that aposs what yogi berra said thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week it aposs one of the army aposs proudest and loudest units that fires those 21 gun salutes for presidents we aposll take you behind the scenes you won apost want to miss it commercial break wallace they aposre rarely seen but you can hear their work from miles away members of the artillery unit that honors presidents and other dignitaries with remarkable precision and they are our power players of the week begin videotape sfc joshua wood u s army the old guard ph bases itself on perfection sgt daniel stewart u s army if we mess up people know so i like the fact that we tend to not do that unidentified male ready inaudible wallace sergeant daniel stewart and sergeant first class joshua wood are members of the presidential salute battery unidentified male standby fire wallace that fires cannons at all the big events in washington presidential inaugurations and funerals special concerts and visits by distinguished guests and burials at arlington national cemetery wood when you are shooting for a president like that aposs that aposs the biggest that aposs like the super bowl there is no room for error the whole world is watching you unidentified male ready battery wallace voice over we got a rare look behind the scenes unidentified male settle down wallace at the extraordinary precision in everything the psb does unidentified male fire wallace there aposs a five man staff and two men on each canon the watchmen orders each fire but in the echo of the booms they found yelling one two three got lost stewart tap ph three inaudible step ph ready ph cut ph wallace on camera and you do that every three seconds stewart every three seconds yes sir wallace voice over what if the watchman loses his voice the psb has a plan for that stewart top ph wood inaudible wallace on camera he messes up and now who does it wood the chief next to him wallace because there aposs no room for error wood there aposs not wallace voice over they guns are m 5 anti tank canons from world war ii that saw action from north africa to the battle of the bulge three teams are usually assigned to a ceremony but if there aposs a misfire there aposs a backup unit just in case wood my left hand is on my side as soon as i lift it up the back up gunner like you said is looking at this hand as soon as it moves he pulls his lanyard ph which basically sets the gun off wallace and if there aposs another misfire the backup crew has to be ready to go again wood as a loader i aposll load the rounds in three seconds putting it inside the breach ph close the breach ph and then re fire and the same process is done until the ceremony is complete trump so help me god wallace if you think that aposs overkill it happened at the trump inauguration wood there was actually two or three misfires during the inaugural honors that were being rendered and i was loading fast enough that it didn apost even skip a beat it didn apost sound like anything happen wallace the psb is part of the old guard the longest serving active infantry unit in the army that aposs also charged with standing watch at the tomb of the unknowns which brings us to watch they see as their main mission wallace on camera with the military at war and some of your colleagues in actual combat why is the presidential salute battery important stewart every family that is in that cemetery they only get one funeral so it needs to be the best ceremony you can give wood you want to give them protection because their loved one served their country
