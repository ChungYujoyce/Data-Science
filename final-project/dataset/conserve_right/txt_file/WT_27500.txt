weekend drone assault on saudi arabia s energy infrastructure that his aides blamed on iran the attack which halved the kingdom s oil production and sent crude prices spiking led trump to authorize the release of u s strategic reserves should they be necessary to stabilize markets trump said the u s had reason to believe it knew who was behind the attack his secretary of state had blamed on iran

inconsistent with claims of responsibility by yemen s iran backed houthi rebels and instead pointed the finger directly at tehran a u s official said all options including a military response were on the table but added that no decisions had been made the official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations iran called the u s claims maximum lies and threatened american forces in the region the attack dimmed hopes for potential nuclear talks between trump and iranian president hassan rouhani at the u n general assembly this week the u s government produced satellite photos showing what officials said were at least 19 points of impact at two saudi energy facilities including damage at the heart of the kingdom s crucial oil processing plant at abqaiq officials said the photos show impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of iran or iraq rather than from yemen to the south iraq denied that its territory was used for an attack on the kingdom u s officials said a strike from there would be a violation of iraq s sovereignty the u s officials said additional devices which apparently didn t reach their targets were recovered northwest of the facilities and are being jointly analyzed by saudi and american intelligence the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters did not address whether the drone could have been fired from yemen then taken a round about path but did not explicitly rule it out the attacks and recriminations are increasing already heightened fears of an escalation in

markets well supplied he later credited himself for expanding u s energy exports in a monday morning tweet writing we don t need middle eastern oil gas in fact have very few tankers there but will help our allies iranian foreign ministry spokesman abbas mousavi dismissed the u s allegation of responsibility as blind and futile comments the americans adopted the maximum pressure policy against iran which due to its failure is leaning toward maximum lies mousavi said in a statement houthi leader muhammad al bukhaiti reiterated his group s claim of responsibility telling the associated press it exploited vulnerabilities in saudi air defenses to strike the targets he did not elaborate iran meanwhile kept up its own threats hajizadeh the brigadier general who leads the country s aerospace program said in an interview published across iranian media sunday that revolutionary guard forces were ready for a counterattack if america responded naming the al udeid air base in qatar and al dhafra air base near abu dhabi in the united arab emirates as immediate targets as well as u s navy ships in the persian gulf and the arabian sea wherever they are it only takes one spark and we hit their vessels their air bases their troops he said in a video published online with english subtitles trump insisted that unspecified conditions must be met before he would sit down with the iranian leader apparently rejecting the comments of two top advisers the fake news is saying that i am willing to meet with iran no conditions that is an incorrect statement as usual in fact treasury
