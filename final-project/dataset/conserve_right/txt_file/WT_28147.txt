tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion democrats timing for infatuation with socialism could not be worse economically the country is doing well and perceives itself to be hardly the recipe for systemic change politically recasting next year s race from a referendum on president trump s incumbency to one on a dismissed ideology is curious at best yet democrats find themselves in this predicament of their base s choosing far from an aberration the 2020 democratic field s leftward direction is a continuation while it did not start with barack obama that was its previous apogee despite working assiduously to hide it then mr obama was america s most liberal president a title he would undoubtedly welcome and additional indication of the party s leftward drift today it is unclear how much further he would have advanced the liberal agenda had democrats not lost the house in 2010 and the senate in 2014 however executive actions coupled with his first two years suggest plenty top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots in 2016 bernie sanders not hillary clinton followed the obama presidency s lead leftward despite mr obama s clear support for hillary clinton mr sanders still won 43 percent of democratic primary votes even while confronting party establishment opposition democrats 2018 midterm win advanced it now democrats 2020 campaign field has completely embraced it even the establishmentarian joe biden sounds more like mr sanders than mrs clinton who he resembles the left s success and attachment to socialism in the democratic party today starkly contrasts with that ideology s history of failure in america werner sombart the leading marxian of the late 19th and early 20th century famously concluded all socialist utopias came to nothing on roast beef and apple pie never has a hard left candidate garnered more than 4 percent of a presidential election s popular vote capitalist prosperity has continually trumped socialist ideology it would therefore make sense for a 21st century socialist onslaught to choose its moment when the economy was weak and provided an argument for changing the prevailing economic system however the opposite is currently the case by any popularly perceived yardstick america s economy is the strongest in some time inflation is low unemployment historically so growth measured in real gdp jobs and real wages is high democrats timing for a leftist ascendancy is bad absolutely but comparatively too the economy notable for its current strength is also notably stronger than the previous left of center administration s which got today s socialist juggernaut rolling democrats bad economic timing joins a bad political one president trump appears to offer democrats the rare opportunity to defeat an incumbent president rarer still mr trump appears to present it despite the strong economy something the last century s three elected incumbents who lost lacked democrats loudly profess the president s weakness polling appears to attest to it and mr trump s personal style seems to contribute to it democrats look to have the rarest of american political opportunities in their grasp a weak incumbent despite a strong economy changing the upcoming referendum from mr trump s incumbency to socialist ideology is hardly the course to take it moves from a stronger position to one not simply weaker but in context with past american presidential elections performances historically so american history argues socialism has failed in the face of exceptional prosperity advancing socialism would therefore seem to demand that the economy be weak if not exceptionally so if anything the economy is currently exceptionally strong historically incumbent presidents running for re election rarely lose only three times since 1916 and never when the economy is good yet democrats believe to the core of their collective soul that mr trump can and must be beat in 2020 it would therefore seem to demand their focus be solely on his unique incumbency instead changing next year s referendum on a president they disdain and dismiss mr trump to one on an ideology that america has disdained and dismissed seems to loom to their timing s diabolical dichotomy democrats can also add foreign policy on the list of america s nefarious global adversaries venezuela cuba and north korea those embracing communism socialism s further extension rank at the top finally america s top global competitor is china communist china having america s main antagonists be further extensions along the same side of the ideological spectrum makes socialism an even tougher sell than the hard one it already is it is bad timing any time to pursue what history the economy or politics domestic and foreign reject it is particularly so when all three reject it simultaneously only democrats base seems to accept it but that would be all it takes for the party to have to embrace it j t
