september they ll need to do some collective soul searching on the alliance s future nato served its original purpose in preventing the soviet union from overrunning western europe but the world isn t much safer today everywhere we look deadly threats abound from radical islamist terrorist groups and a future nuclear armed iran to a resurgent russia focused on restoring an empire to the rise of china and more despite these shared security challenges the continued alliance isn t guaranteed as most member nations balk at budget expectations equaling 2 percent of national gross domestic product

also a combat credibility issue nato led isaf stands for international security assistance force yet the half joking i saw americans fighting was the least offensive term commonly used to describe european contributions as defense secretary robert m gates noted in a 2011 pentagon farewell address the united states canada the united kingdom the netherlands and denmark along with nato ally australia were the only ones willing to fight and die facing off against the taliban he called nato s future dim if not dismal smarter policy with russia while vladimir putin is busy reconstituting a

those numbers are reversed nato nations must get tough including expanded sanctions and increased military exercises in places such as georgia the baltic states poland and even western ukraine nato should also acknowledge russian internal security concerns such as shrinking demographics from 148 million to 143 million over 20 years as a result in part to social issues run amok and a rapidly growing muslim population which according to the american foreign policy council s ilan berman could be the majority by 2050 yet the approach shouldn t be all stick no carrot collaboration in space and cooperation against the mutual threat from radical islam could reassure russians that nato is not their enemy confronting radical islam at home and abroad over the past 13 years al qaeda and

be admitted without delay once bosnia herzegovina and montenegro are ready they should follow georgia going global nato nations should prepare for more worldwide presence to stand with freedom since military operations are winding down in afghanistan owing to political exhaustion the taliban may return to power once the troops leave in 2016 meanwhile the islamic state has launched a genocidal campaign against christians and other minority groups iran continues its march toward a nuclear weapon and china is increasing defense budgets by more than 10 percent a year while menacing neighbors
