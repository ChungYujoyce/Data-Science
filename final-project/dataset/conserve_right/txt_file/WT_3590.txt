apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic two weeks of impeachment inquiry hearings produced little common ground in the testimony from the parade of witnesses but one thing they all agreed upon was that delaying foreign aid even military assistance happens frequently the white house s decision to place a hold on military assistance to ukraine is at the crux of democrats bribery case against president trump who they say withheld the money to extract promises of investigations into political enemies that there was a hold on the 391 million is not in doubt but the reasons for it and whether the ukrainians even knew about it for most of the time are very much in question the answers could decide mr trump s fate top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on

democrats contend the case was different for ukraine they say the aid was contingent on kyiv investigations of 2016 u s election meddling and corruption involving political rival joseph r biden and his son hunter daniel s goldman the democrats chief investigator for the inquiry asked william taylor the charge d affaires in ukraine whether he had seen another example of foreign aid conditioned on the personal or political interests of the president of the united states i have not mr taylor replied however fiona hill a former russia analyst at the nsc said political considerations played a factor in the obama administration s approach to ukraine u s security agencies wanted to deliver javelin missiles to ukraine to fight russian backed forces but the obama white house nixed the move i think it was very much made on a political basis about concerns that this would provoke the russians she testified mr trump had the same concerns but ultimately signed off on the sale of javelins in late april 2018 and added anti tank missiles to the lethal aid already flowing to ukraine mr hale said mr trump directly placed the hold on ukraine aid this year yet the president never took steps to cancel the ukraine security assistance initiative there were only two ways to discontinue obligation of usai a president directed decision or a defense department directed reprogramming action either of which would need to be notified to congress laura cooper a deputy assistant secretary at the department of defense testified i never heard that either was being pursued the aid was approved on sept
