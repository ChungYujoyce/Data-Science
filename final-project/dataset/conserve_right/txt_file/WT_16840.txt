to allow top indonesian military officials to participate as observers in an anti islamic state task force in washington the creating of the task force is within the u s government but we would like to join in order to sharpen the intelligence analysis capabilities of our own officers in tracking the islamic state threat the general said this week he declined to provide details about the task

who goes by one name and spoke through a translator made the comments hours after visiting the pentagon tuesday the latest in a series of meetings with u s commanders designed to show indonesia s desire to expand military ties with the united states the islamic state also known by the acronym isis has featured prominently in the meetings especially since officials in jakarta have claimed during recent months to have information on nearly 100 indonesians who have traveled to the middle east to join the extremist movement gen moeldoko said this week that the threat now presents an opportunity for the u s indonesian military relationship to expand erasing any lingering mistrust dating to when washington cut all official military ties with jakarta amid concern over human rights abuses committed by indonesian forces in the late 1990s relations were restored in 2000 and gen moeldoko said he takes personal pride in progress made by the indonesian military to confront its past human rights abuses but when it comes to relations with the pentagon the focus over the past decade has been on disaster relief coordination in asia indonesia has appeared relatively neutral toward washington s wider strategic initiatives such as efforts to inspire china s smaller neighbors to resist beijing s growing military dominance in the region it s not clear how the sudden emergence of the isis threat could affect the calculus in washington and jakarta the general said indonesia and the united states share the same interests regarding regional security and also recently the isis problem gen moeldoko said adding that the two nations have a good military to military relationship that i would like to enhance and make even stronger the general suggested that jakarta may even be willing to partner more closely on such issues as countering china but he chose his words carefully and went to lengths to avoid taking sides between washington and beijing both are responsible for provoking each other he said adding that the obama administration s strategic rebalancing within the asia pacific comes with the risk of creating instability in the region asked whether indonesia could emerge as a peacemaker between the two sides gen moeldoko responded with of course role for asean he added that a goal for himself and military leaders from smaller nations in the region is to band together through the association of southeast asian nations asean which does not include china to act as the biggest military force in the region the key is communication between all the stakeholders he said the same could be true in countering the islamic state threat in southeast asia where several nations with muslim populations including malaysia singapore and the philippines are struggling to counter the group s influence particularly its internet savvy recruiting propaganda u s officials have said that more than 1 000 people from the region have traveled to the middle east to join isis indonesian authorities have been particularly wary since july with the appearance of a video produced in indonesia s bahasa language that featured a black clad militant who called on indonesian muslims to join the islamic state cause the government responded by banning the group and cracking down on isis related internet material concerns remain high that foreign fighters may seek to return home and spread the group s extremist ideology or launch al qaeda style terrorist attacks like those that gripped indonesia during the years after 9 11 a smattering of al qaeda training camps existed in the nation during the early 2000s a threat that peaked in 2002 with the horrific bombing of a nightclub frequented by westerners on bali the suspected mastermind of that attack riduan isamuddin better known as hambali was arrested in 2003 and placed at the u s detention facility at guantanamo bay jakarta s bare knuckle counterterrorism efforts over the past decade have largely

population in the world but indonesian muslims are moderate and we do not accept the kind of extremists like isis he said i am a muslim myself and i can tell you that isis is not islam the general
