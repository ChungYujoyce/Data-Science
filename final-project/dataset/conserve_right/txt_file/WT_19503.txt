apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic new york ap immigrants with specialized skills are being denied work visas or seeing applications get caught up in lengthy bureaucratic tangles under federal changes that some consider a contradiction to president donald trump s promise of a continued pathway to the u s for the most talented foreigners getting what s known as an h 1b visa has never been a sure thing the number issued annually is capped at 85 000 and applicants need to enter a lottery to even be considered but some immigration attorneys as well as those who hire such workers say they ve seen unprecedented disruptions in the approval process since trump took office in 2017 you see all these arguments that we want the best and the brightest coming here said john goslow an immigration attorney in ann arbor michigan yet we re seeing a full frontal assault on just all aspects of immigration top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed for american businesses there is a bottom line impact link wilson an architect who co founded a firm in bloomington minnesota said finding enough qualified workers within the u s has been a problem for years that s due to a shortage of architects but also because his firm needs people with experience developing senior housing he said employers who turn to international applicants do so as a last resort putting up with legal fees and ever expanding visa approval times because they have no other choice we re just at the point where there s no one else to hire said wilson who hired an architect under an h 1b visa last year after enduring a long wait he estimates his firm turned away about 1 million in projects in 2018 because it didn t have enough staff to handle them three months after taking office trump issued his buy american and hire american executive order directing cabinet officials to suggest reforms to ensure that h 1b visas are awarded to the most skilled or highest paid applicants to help promote the hiring of americans for jobs that might otherwise go to immigrants subsequent memos have allowed for greater discretion in denying applications without first requesting additional information from an applicant tossed the deference given to people seeking to renew their h 1bs and raised concern that the government would revoke work permits for the spouses of h 1b holders one order restricted companies ability to use h 1b workers off site at a customer s place of business while another temporarily rescinded the option of paying for faster application processing attorneys who handle these applications say one of the biggest shifts is an increase in requests for evidence or rfes from u s citizenship and immigration services an rfe can delay a visa for months or longer as applicants and employers are forced to submit additional documentation over things such as the applicability of a college degree to a prospective job or whether the wage being offered is appropriate if the responses are unsatisfactory a visa may be denied they re just blocking the avenues so that employers will get frustrated and they won t employ foreign nationals said dakshini sen an immigration lawyer in houston whose caseload is mostly h 1b applications we have to write and write and write and explain and explain and explain each and every point uscis data released on friday shows an increase in the number of completed h 1b applications receiving an rfe from about 21 percent in the 2016 fiscal year to 38 percent last fiscal year the number continued to rise in the first quarter of this fiscal year to 60 percent a growing number of applications with such requests were ultimately denied while the approval rate among all applicants has fallen approvals also dipped in two other visa programs for foreign workers including one for individuals with extraordinary abilities in areas such as science sports and the arts jessica collins a spokeswoman for uscis linked the changes to the president s executive order saying the goal was to reduce frivolous petitions and that it is incumbent upon the petitioner not the government to prove eligibility some employers note traditional three year renewable terms of h 1bs have also been changing one lawsuit by an organization representing information technology companies claims some visas were valid for only a few days or had expired before they were even received meantime a vague entry published in the federal register last fall advised that the department of homeland security would propose additional revisions to focus on attracting the best and the brightest and to ensure employers pay appropriate wages to h 1b visa holders which has raised alarms that the administration will move to narrow the definition of who qualifies caught in the crosshairs of all this are workers like leo wang wang 32 spent six years after college in his native china learning all he could about data and analytics he got into the university of southern california interned at a major venture capital firm and wasted no time after finishing his master s before starting on another degree he couch surfed passed up an enticing foreign job offer and amassed educational debt all in pursuit of the dream that ultimately came true a six figure silicon valley job as long as it took wang to achieve his goal it disappeared in record time wang was working at seagate technology under an immigration provision known as optional practical training which gives those on student visas permission to work but that expired last year and because his h 1b application was in flux he was forced to take a leave from seagate and withdraw from the master s program he was pursuing at berkeley he says he and his company dutifully responded to an rfe compiling examples of his work at seagate but on jan 11 wang got a final answer he was denied an h 1b all i wanted was to be able to see my american dream he said sandra feist an immigration attorney in minneapolis said talented foreigners discouraged by the visa process are beginning to look at opportunities in other countries and she questions what that means for america s future especially if top tier researchers who could contribute to science and medicine are turned away one of her clients a computer systems analyst from india with a master s degree from a u s college filed his petition for an h 1b in april 2017 with 101 pages of documentation he received an rfe and a 176 page response was filed with additional paperwork attempting to prove just how complicated the position was he was denied feist filed a 282 page appeal requesting that the file be reopened though the appeal was approved there was a second rfe which feist said raises the same issues she already responded to with a u s work visa unlikely that client is applying for permanent residency in canada with his wife and u s citizen child ceos for companies including apple ford and coca cola penned a letter to homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen in august saying immigration policy changes were undermining economic growth at a time when the number of job vacancies are reaching historic highs due to labor shortages they said now is not the time to restrict access to talent a provision for immigration based on skills education and employer needs dates back to the immigration and nationality act of 1952 and the visa now known as the h 1b has until recently enjoyed wide support among politicians on both the left and the right a pew research center survey last year found broad approval for high skilled immigrants among the public as well with support at 83 percent among democrats polled and 73 percent of republicans trump has vacillated on the issue during a march 2016 presidential debate then candidate trump was asked about his opposition to visas for skilled workers to which he said i m changing and that he saw such policies as a way to keep top international students in the u s we absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country he said his campaign followed that with a statement saying the h 1b program is neither high skilled nor immigration these are temporary foreign workers imported from abroad for the explicit purpose of substituting for american workers at lower pay last month trump again reverted to a more conciliatory note tweeting that h1 b holders can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay including a potential path to citizenship back in china now wang isn t sure what to make of trump s words he s talked to a friend from seagate now at a swedish firm about openings there and a former boss in singapore has some prospects for him as well i still believe in the american dream he says it s just that i personally have to pursue it somewhere else sedensky c
