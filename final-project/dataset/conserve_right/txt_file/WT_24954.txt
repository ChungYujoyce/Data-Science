tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn special counsel robert mueller delivered a valedictory statement wednesday before he resigned from his two year investigation into president trump saying he could not exonerate the president of criminal wrongdoing though he d said as much in his 448 page report hearing it from the mouth of the man who spent two years investigating mr trump was a dam break moment for many democrats on capitol hill and on the 2020 presidential campaign trail who said mr mueller s statement was an invitation to begin impeachment proceedings against mr trump in a nine minute statement from the justice department s headquarters in washington mr mueller said his work was done he was shutting down the special counsel s office and would resist calls to testify to congress or speak publicly saying his 448 page report spoke for itself see also read robert mueller s full statement but it was his summary that rekindled the impeachment fire for many democrats if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mr mueller said we did not however make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime he also signaled that he didn t bring charges against mr trump because of longstanding justice department policy that a sitting president cannot be charged yet he did make such a determination on one aspect of his investigation saying there was insufficient evidence to conclude the president or his team conspired with russia to subvert the 2016 election but when it came to whether the president obstructed justice in trying to stymy investigations into the election mr mueller said they didn t attempt to reach a conclusion because of the department s policy we concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime he said the seemingly contradictory statements fueled diametrically opposed reactions from the president s supporters and his political opponents a host of 2020 democratic presidential candidates said it s time to pursue impeachment though those lawmakers who would actually spearhead an inquiry house speaker nancy pelosi and judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler were more circumspect saying they will continue to pursue their ongoing investigations all the same mr nadler said mr mueller s statement was dangerous news for mr trump undercutting his claims that he was exonerated it falls to congress to respond to the crimes lies and other wrongdoing the congressman said adding that impeachment remains an option down the road republicans led by mr trump said they didn t see any revelations from mr mueller nothing changes from the mueller report the president tweeted there was insufficient evidence and therefore in our country a person is innocent the case is closed thank you sen lindsey graham south carolina republican and senate judiciary committee chairman echoed the president s sentiments today s statement by mr mueller reinforces the findings of his report and as for me the case is over the top trump ally said mr mueller has decided to move on and let the report speak for itself congress should follow his lead the ranking republican on the house judiciary committee rep doug collins of georgia urged his colleagues on the left to back off their impeachment hunt relitigating the 2016 election and reinvestigating the special counsel s findings will only further divide our country mr collins said it s not yet clear what role mr mueller will play as democrats do proceed on capitol hill he pointedly signaled his resistance to testifying he said wednesday s statement was the only time he planned to speak about his investigation and if he called his comments would likely disappoint lawmakers any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report he said mr nadler who had been among those demanding mr mueller appear publicly begged off when asked if he still wants to hold that hearing mr mueller told us a lot of what we needed to hear today the chairman said but house majority leader steny h hoyer of maryland and intelligence committee chairman adam b schiff california democrat said they still want to hear more from the special counsel mr schiff said there are important counterintelligence matters which mr mueller could detail for congress related to his findings of russian attempts to interfere in the election while i understand his reluctance to answer hypotheticals or deviate from the carefully worded conclusions he drew on his charging decisions there are nevertheless a great many questions he can answer that go beyond the report the congressman said the decision of whether to pursue impeachment remains deeply divisive among democrats key figures including house oversight committee chairman bennie g thompson said after mr mueller s report that impeachment is ripe i support impeachment the president has egregiously obstructed justice the mississippi congressman tweeted impeachment can happen through a majority vote in the house but convicting the president requires a trial by the senate and support of two thirds of senators is needed to remove him from office given gop control of the upper chamber that s not likely yet mrs pelosi said she also downplayed the amount of support for impeachment saying it was 38 lawmakers out of 235 democrats in the chamber only one republican rep justin amash has publicly backed impeachment nothing is off the table but we do want to make such a compelling case such an iron clad case that even the republican senate which at the time seems to be not an objective jury will be convinced mrs pelosi said wednesday s press conference was mr mueller s first public remarks on the russia election meddling probe since being appointed nearly two years ago he stood alone at the lectern in contrast to attorney general william p barr who in announcing the release of the report last month was flanked by then deputy attorney general rod rosenstein and principal associate deputy attorney general edward o callaghan mr mueller cited a justice department regulation as the reason he couldn t pursue charges against mr trump undercutting claims by mr barr that the president s actions didn t amount to obstruction but a joint statement by justice department spokeswoman kerri kupec and peter carr a spokesman for mr mueller disputed that the special counsel contradicted mr barr the attorney general has previously stated that the special counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that but for the olc opinion he would have found the president obstructed justice the special counsel s report and his statement today made clear that the office concluded it would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime they said there is no conflict between these statements the statement continued mr mueller did try to ease some of the apparent tension between himself and mr barr stemming from decisions surrounding the release of the report mr mueller said he had fought for mr barr to release broad summaries of the special counsel s findings but mr barr withheld those saying his goal was to get the full report out in redacted form as quickly as possible at one point in time i requested that certain portions of the report be released mr mueller said the attorney general preferred to make the entire report public all at once we appreciate that the attorney general made the report largely public i do not question the attorney general s
