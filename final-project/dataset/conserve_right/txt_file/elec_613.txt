can t believe people still take me seriously friedman suggested that maybe the republican party just needs to crash and burn this version of the republican party needs to die so out of the ashes just as a new democratic party came out of the post mcgovern post dukakis era we will get a sane republican party such are the near daily daydreams of today s democratic establishment and their useful pawns in the media see here here here and here who gleefully rub their hands together imagining one party domination of the world s greatest republic for most americans the thought is a nightmare though for friedman a man who repeatedly lauds chinese despotism it s just par for the course this is not to say that those who predict or like friedman encourage a republican civil war are wrong conservatives recognize that on major areas of policy the gop s internal divide is large much larger following a donald trump campaign than prior to it and potentially unsustainable within a coherent single organization but in their audacious reveries full of the many petty and not so petty tyrannies they might impose on a once free nation as the republican party descends into chaotic soul searching democrats are missing something very important they re likely to face their own civil war as well and if a democrat resides in the white house especially a democrat as unpopular as hillary clinton is their own chaos is likely despite the media s best efforts to cover for them to be at least as messy at least as public and at least as internally destructive to their party as anything the gop will suffer between donald trump s flamboyant personality astounding statements past and present and mastery of earned media and the mainstream media s plain desire to grease hillary s ungraceful skid into the white house by making donald trump the center of attention something he has been too narcissistic to realize was hurting him you d be forgiven for forgetting about the millions of americans mostly a mix of na ve idealistic unemployed youth and cynical give me other people s stuff underemployed adults who spent most of the campaign season feeling the bern socialist senator bernie sanders and his supporters feel as if the democratic national committee rigged their primary process against him because they did the repulsive debbie wasserman schultz resigned over the first wikileaks revelation pointing to this fact if dnc leaders know what s good for them they ll force interim chairwoman donna brazile out over the second such revelation when pressed on the issue ms brazile sounded like a criminal who before answering a detective s question asks so what exactly do you have on me also note that brazile when asked by megyn kelly how she received a democratic townhall debate question in advance responded i did not receive any questions from cnn which does not answer the question she was asked bernie has announced to the world that he will be vigorously in opposition to government action including laws or policies supported by hillary clinton which are not sufficiently leftist much of what sanders wants is indeed in direct opposition to the interests of hillary clinton s major shareholders at goldman sachs in addition to hillary s bernie sanders problem radical senator elizabeth really i m cherokee warren who has a strong following among the furthest left part of the democratic party base and was pushed by many of that ilk to challenge hillary clinton for the democratic nomination waited until june to endorse clinton no doubt angering the entitled queen of chappaqua that s just a preview hillary wait until you see the actual movie warren s views on economic policy the over regulation of business the inherent evil of profit making enterprises in short her entire you didn t build that mindset roughly mirrors that of sanders the combination of the two will drag along some of the senate s other most liberal members at least those who come from safe seats and or aren t up for re election in 2018 a particular problem for clinton might arise when it comes to supreme court nominees of course much depends on which party controls the senate in january but even if democrats take a majority hillary might be in the awkward position of having to pick a further left than desired nominee to gain the sanders warren wing s support and therefore be unable to overcome a republican filibuster at least without a nuclear option involving changing the senate rules or a further right than desired nominee to garner the support of enough republicans to gain confirmation the latter scenario could plausibly be better politics and more easily accomplished by clinton than the former but the havoc it would wreak within the democratic party would be in the words of my 10 year old daughter epic opposition to much of the clinton agenda will have fervent support from a vocal minority of the democratic base including many who supported green party candidate jill stein for president who believe that the progressive case for hillary clinton isn t much of a case at all like trump supporters these most ideological members of their party would rather die fighting politically speaking than compromise like trump supporters they believe that when it comes to the two or three issues they care most deeply about the party should either come around to their views or be destroyed as with trump supporters rationality and evidence regarding these issues do not penetrate their consciousness but unlike with trump supporters whose fierce debate will mostly take place outside public view at least until the next primary election season it appears that the progressives fight will be with a sitting president and therefore on front pages and news broadcasts for the entire presidency of hillary clinton on the bright side the democratic infighting may be the only thing that adds a bit of spice to what will otherwise be the tasteless gruel of hillary clinton s single term in office on the evening of november 8 tom friedman and other members of the clubby democratic elite will look wistfully out over the electoral sea watching the gop s titanic steam inexorably toward the donald trump iceberg these democrats think they re the lighthouse but in fact they re just another ship on the sea about to be thrown onto the rocky shore of today
