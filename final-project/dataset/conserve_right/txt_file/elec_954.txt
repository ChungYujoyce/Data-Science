at deadline the presidential race hadn t been definitively called for donald trump or hillary clinton but it was clear that trump had once again turned conventional wisdom on its head and smashed it heading into election day clinton had seemed poised to finally break what she kept calling that highest hardest glass ceiling by the wee hours of wednesday morning it had become even more likely that trump was about to make history instead there is no underestimating the seismic shock of a trump victory or the sickening feeling it engenders in scores of millions of americans for scores of millions of other americans a clinton victory would be just as nauseating this election the most polarizing and anguish filled in memory was always destined to end with an immense swath of the nation horrified by the outcome as a voter who was adamantly nevertrump and neverclinton all along i cast my ballot on tuesday for libertarian gary johnson the only thing i looked forward to was the defeat of one of the two most execrable nominees in my lifetime but my never status ended tuesday night i have hated everything about this election but i won t be one of those zealots who refuse to accept the legitimacy of a duly elected president watching the inauguration of trump or clinton will be grim but whoever takes the oath of office will be my president too and i pray that new president against all odds will prove worthy of the office and govern with wisdom and humility yet even if the next commander in chief turns out to be as awful as many of us expect i m quite sure the republic will survive in recent weeks trump warned that the survival of our nation was riding on his election clinton claimed to be the last thing standing between you and the apocalypse countless americans believed one or the other this morning their dread is almost palpable but the united states has endured far more dire threats than the election of an unsuitable president from a bloody civil war to the great depression to the race riots and assassinations of 1968 we got through them all without turning into a dictatorship we ll get through the administration of the 45th president it would take an across the board abdication of entrenched constitutional prerogatives for any american president even the most popular and brilliant to establish a dictatorship fortunately the next president far from popular will be one of the least liked least trusted ever that portends a presidency on a very short leash no long honeymoon no compelling mandate indeed the inauguration of a president so loathed by so many may offer the chance to finally peel away some of the imperial trappings of the modern presidency election 2016 ends with a wretched president elect but don t panic it s a presidential election not armageddon alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
