the hindu springtime holiday in which people douse each other with colored water and paint modi canceled travel plans to brussels for an india eu summit amid a rising caseload in belgium and tweeted that he would not attend any holi festivities experts fear these precautions won t be enough for india s beleaguered under funded and under staffed health system to stave off an epidemic here are their foremost concerns too few labs not enough hospitals as the virus spread globally india began bolstering its ability to test and detect the virus while the national institute of virology at pune remains the main testing facility the government has identified 35 additional labs for testing but concerns remain over india s overstretched health infrastructure a single state run hospital for every 55 591 people on average and a single hospital bed for every 1 844 people india needs about 10 times more doctors to meet the norms prescribed by the world health organization a shortfall of at least 500 000 doctors experts fear that an epidemic would cause other routine health care functions to suffer everything will become about covid 19 and other routine services like immunization or taking care of maternal mortality would be affected said anant bhan a global health and policy expert health care inequality india s health performance an index that includes access to primary care maternal mortality rates and child health runs the spectrum with some states outperforming others by almost 2 5 times according to the government run think tank niti aayog the best performer was kerala the small state that found and treated india s first three cases the worst was uttar pradesh a state with roughly the population of brazil that has detected at least six cases kerala has a doctor for approximately every 6 000 people while uttar pradesh has one for every 18 000 people the inequalities are further pronounced between urban and rural areas with the bulk of the available beds concentrated in india s cities india spent an average of 62 72 per person on health care in 2016 according to who compared to china s 398 33 inequalities could make prevention even harder in places with limited access to clean water washing hands to prevent the spread of the virus is difficult said dr gagandeep kang a microbiologist who heads india s translational health science and technology institute retired virologist and pediatrician dr t jacob john said these inequalities aren t just a reflection of not spending enough on health care but also of not knowing where to spend the last time a needs based survey was done for india s health care was in 1946 he said adding that the country s health management system is very inadequate for india s existing problems let alone new ones quarantine millions india s health minister told parliament that the need of the hour is to contain viral clusters to prevent and break chains of transmission but in india with a population of 1 4 billion that is far from easy take the city of agra famous for the taj mahal where six italian tourists tested positive for the virus apart from the 40 000 tourists who visit the monument each day the city has a population of more than 4 million with nearly 3 000 people crammed into every square mile following who advice the indian government has told people keep a distance of at least six feet from others but anywhere you ve a dense population all the issues of social distancing become challenging kang said short on medicines with the virus lockdown in china resulting in shortages in india the government halted the export of 13 key drug ingredients and the medicines made from them on tuesday although india is the world s primary supplier of generic drugs it relies on china for nearly 70 of the active pharmaceutical ingredients it uses for making medicines india has said it has enough stocks but the government s minister for chemicals and fertilizers told parliament that there remains an apprehension that supplies of ingredients from china would be disrupted if the epidemic continues long term response on thursday health minister harsh vardhan met the management of india s top private hospitals to ask them to work with the government in dealing with the outbreak and urged them to prepare a pool of beds kang said india s current approach which is focused on travelers might restrict some cases but eventually it will have to expand testing to limit the spread of the disease within the country kang said the question she said is whether authorities want to
