apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap long before president donald trump turned up the heat on four democratic congresswomen of color saying they should go back to their home countries hateful rhetoric and disinformation about the self described squad was lurking online racist inflammatory and inaccurate content has circulated on far right blogs news sites and social media accounts about rep ilhan omar of minnesota and her three freshman colleagues since they ran for public office with his tweets and harsh comments trump has elevated that rhetoric playing into a conspiratorial feedback loop that reared its head repeatedly during his campaign and presidency trump rose to conservative prominence by falsely claiming former president barack obama the first black president wasn t born in the country since then he has promoted claims and memes that originated in the darkest corners of the internet while fueling new ones of his own top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds his latest targets are omar and reps alexandria ocasio cortez of new york ayanna pressley of massachusetts and rashida tlaib of michigan in his sunday tweets trump claimed without identifying the women by name that the minority legislators originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe he suggested they should go back to those totally broken and crime infested places even though three of the four were born in the u s and all are u s citizens he has since questioned the women s allegiance to their country accusing them of hating america and promoting terrorism while suggesting they should leave america if they re unhappy here for some the republican president s tweets were shocking but for others they were just an average day on facebook or twitter where allegations that omar was not legitimately elected is not a u s citizen and committed immigration fraud have festered in far right chatrooms blogs and social media sites since she was elected to the minnesota house of representatives in 2016 this is the agenda of white nationalists whether it is happening in chat rooms or it s happening on national tv omar said this week and now it s reached the white house garden omar was born in somalia and immigrated to the u s as a refugee in 1995 when she was a child she became a u s citizen in 2000 at age 17 the rumors about her have been spread by dozens of conservative social media figures and bloggers including michelle malkin and laura loomer the latter now banned from facebook in february self described far right social media influencers jacob wohl and loomer flew to minneapolis where they provided live updates on instagram twitter and facebook of their trip to investigate omar s past and immigration status even seemingly everyday citizens have taken to social media to upload their own theories on omar s background with one minnesota woman posting a video months ago on facebook sharing proof omar is not a u s citizen the video has been watched more than 50 000 times trump also repeated a contested claim characterizing as fact that omar had married her brother before acknowledging that he really didn t know well there s a lot of talk about the fact that she was married to her brother trump said this week in response to a question posed by a conservative news outlet i know nothing about it i hear she was married to her brother you re asking me a question about it i don t know but i m sure that somebody will be looking at that omar has described such allegations as disgusting lies she has declined to provide access to immigration records birth certificates or other documents that could verify her family history omar the biggest target of online vitriol among the four legislators has made comments that raise eyebrows including a remark this spring in which she referenced the sept 11 attacks by saying that some people did something she was also criticizing for asking a judge in 2016 to show leniency toward a man accused of trying to join the islamic state but other allegations have been provably false before they took office for instance omar and tlaib the first muslim women elected to congress were dogged by false online allegations that they were so anti american they did not intend to take the oath of office others tried to delegitimize omar in memes that falsely claim obama resettled 70 000 somali refugees in minnesota in an effort to ensure her election in fact the state received 6 320 somali refugees during the obama administration a similar inaccurate claim was later floated online about iraqi refugees in tlaib s home state of michigan other comments by the women have been taken widely out of context around february social media users and fringe sites began circulating an edited 2013 clip that they said showed omar laughing at al qaida and admitting to taking a terrorism class the full context of the 28 minute interview originally broadcast on a local minneapolis tv station shows she was talking about a u s college course and was making a point about how the arabic language had been hijacked by extremist groups to mean something negative in the 2016 presidential election russians relied on a similar online playbook deploying anti immigrant and anti muslim rhetoric on facebook instagram and twitter in an effort to boost trump s prospects racially divisive content was the biggest component of the russian disinformation campaign according to ian vandewalker counsel for the democracy program at the nonprofit brennan center for justice one facebook post linked to a russian agent for instance featured a group of women walking in headdresses and asked what are they hiding a lot of it was fearmongering that was intended to mobilize right leaning voters vandewalker said some of it was similar to or echoed themes in trump s own campaign he predicted russians would revive racially fraught social media content in 2020 negative sentiment about the four congresswomen has migrated into more mainstream outlets recently last week just days before trump s incendiary tweets fox news host tucker carlson described omar on his show as having undisguised contempt for the united states the president s comments in turn appear to have inspired even more negative online rhetoric including a new batch of facebook and twitter posts that describe omar as a terrorist memes also have emerged calling the women anti american and enemies within one mock movie poster labels the women the jihad squad and includes the tagline political jihad is their game the attacks are part of a pattern for trump said kathleen hall jamieson a professor at the annenberg school for communication at the university of pennsylvania and the author of a recent book about how russian hackers and trolls influenced trump s election she pointed to trump s birther claims against obama which she said suggested he doesn t belong here he belongs somewhere else as well as trump s unfounded claims in 2016 that hillary clinton and obama were co founders of the islamic state group chants at the president s rallies such as lock her up in reference to clinton or the newly minted send her back refrain for omar emerge because trump has cast the women as enemies of the nation jamieson said the result she said is to discredit the loyalty patriotism and ability to act on behalf of the u s of an elected official seitz reported from chicago follow seitz and colvin on twitter at https twitter com amandaseitz1 and
