apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion president donald trump created quite a media stir when he stood at the national prayer breakfast podium and in response to keynote speaker arthur brooks call to love thy enemies and leave behind thy contempt said he saw things a bit differently that it was rather difficult to swallow the bitter bites of fabricated impeachment pushes with a simple shrug and oh well hug well trump is right love does not mean tolerance of evil neither does it mean acceptance of evil top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey i m a follower of jesus the jesus who taught each of us to love god and who taught us to love each other said brooks a harvard university professor ex american enterprise institute president and author at the breakfast he went on adding that the biggest crisis facing our nation is the crisis of contempt and polarization that s tearing our societies apart he called for love enemies and prayer for those who persecute and on that he s quite right that is indeed a biblical command for believers that is indeed a call from jesus for those of the faith but love and tolerance and acceptance of evil are not the same and this is where the left not only goes astray but also exploits i don t like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong trump said taking the podium after brooks nor do i like people who say i pray for you when they know that that s not what they do umm nancy pelosi anyone quite right jesus hated hypocrisy jesus hates lies and deceptions and showing distaste and intolerance for hypocrisy and lies and deceptions is not unbiblical jesus the same jesus the left likes to teach as the standard bearer of love and tolerance and acceptance of all also turned over the tables of all who were buying and selling in the temple and drove them from the scene as matthew recounts jesus the same jesus the left likes to trot out as being the face of non stop unquestioning forgiveness also spoke harshly of the arrogant elitist scribes and pharisees who say things and do not do them who like to walk around in long robes and like respectful greetings and chief seats and places of honor but who behind the scenes devour widows houses as matthew and mark recount in other words it s one thing to love all pray for all fervently desire for all to make it to heaven it s another thing entirely to turn blind eyes toward evil and pretend all s good in the hood while the wicked have their way speaker nancy pelosi reps adam schiff and jerry nadler sen chuck schumer and more of the democratic party these were all key players in bringing forth the false falsified fabricated and utterly partisan charges of impeachment against trump they lied they deceived they received media watchdog pinocchio noses and pants on fire ratings for their deceptions in the process a process that really began in the beginning stages of trump s white house tenure what would jesus do brooks called for love and less contempt so would jesus so would democrats but one of these things is not like the other democrats far too frequently use biblical principles for their own political designs to advance their own wicked ways love and less contempt doesn t mean excusing the evil that drove the impeachment process it doesn t mean letting the democrats skate accountability for their lies and deceptions it doesn t mean standing sheepishly by as democrats join in the call for love and less contempt and then go back to their political offices to plot and strategize and plan their next partisan hatchet attack against the president absent true cause let s not confuse love with accountability jesus is love but jesus is also truth trying to blot out the second as if it s a show of the first is wicked and as trump himself noted that s not very biblical at all cheryl chumley can be reached at emailprotected or on twitter ckchumley listen to her podcast bold and blunt by clicking here and never miss her column subscribe to her newsletter by clic
