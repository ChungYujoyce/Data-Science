tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn recent editorials of statewide and national interest from new york s newspapers newsday on robocalls june 8 top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens the calls come during dinner during the workday even in the middle of the night they veer from annoying and laughable to frightening and dangerous sometimes they re offering debt reduction solar panels or a free trip sometimes they re in mandarin other times they re allegedly urgent calls from the social security administration or the internal revenue service the truly despicable ones claim someone you love is in trouble they have to stop the federal communications commission voted last week to allow phone companies to block such calls by default without getting customer permission though the new rule will include an opt out provision for customers who don t want such calls blocked phone companies can choose whether to participate they also can decide to charge for the service which would be unfortunate but the fcc s move is a start robocalls have become so ubiquitous that it s surprising when you go a day without getting one those who have landlines often don t answer any calls on cellphones the scammers use area codes and locations similar to others that you answer while the calls are hated for how irritating they are the bigger concern is just how easily and how often they work and how many seniors and others fall prey to scams and schemes according to the federal trade commission u s consumers lost 55 million just to tech support related scams last year according to sen chuck schumer a stunning 34 8 million robocalls were received in long island area codes in april alone that s more than a million calls a day the fcc says about 60 percent of the complaints it receives are about robocalls by some estimates more than half of robocalls are scams for years there s been talk about how to combat the calls but disappointingly there s been little action schumer and others have pushed for change but federal efforts have failed to make a difference the national do not call registry has been ignored by scammers and penalties on robocallers who have been caught haven t been sufficient the ftc and the fcc set regulations on this issue now congress and both agencies seem close to finding viable solutions the u s senate last month passed the telephone robocall abuse criminal enforcement and deterrence act traced the bill sponsored by massachusetts democrat ed markey and south dakota republican john thune would give the fcc more power to fine robocallers as much as 10 000 per call and would add to the timeframe between when a call is placed and when the fcc can find and prosecute such scammers perhaps most important the legislation would require telecommunications firms to establish technology that authenticates which calls are real and which are robocalls or scams and to stop them before they reach a customer fighting robocalls might just be the one issue nowadays that could be truly bipartisan the traced legislation passed the senate 97 1 with rand paul r kentucky as the sole holdout perhaps paul doesn t own a telephone now it s on to the house of representatives which should pass the bill too we hope president donald trump will sign it but that won t be enough the fcc s new rule should help too it also will allow consumers to decide whether to get calls only from contacts that they specify questions on how to execute the fcc s proposed filters remain regulators will have to work with the phone companies to make sure filters are flexible so wanted robocalls like a school closing or a fraud alert from a credit card company get through they ll also have to be aware of whether phone companies start to charge for the service and if they do consider mandating that it be free of charge federal officials and advocates also must educate seniors and others who are vulnerable to falling for fraud while aggressively pursuing and penalizing the scammers despite the progress that s being made however we re not convinced the fcc s own leadership is fully committed to ridding consumers of this plague sometimes it appears to kowtow to the industries that benefit from lax regulations republican fcc commissioner michael o rielly told an industry group representing debt collectors this month that robocall is not a bad word and argued that federal officials should stop vilifying automated calls most consumers would say otherwise the scourge of robocalls will end only when telecommunications companies federal regulators and lawmakers get ahead of the robocallers with technology and regulation and a constant pursuit of scammers it s time to hang up on robocalls online https nwsdy li 2f69fqr the daily news on transportation secretary elaine chao june 12 u s secretary of transportation elaine chao and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell are in bed with each other and not just as husband and wife new revelations of official coziness are a huge problem for chao whose leadership of the infrastructure building agency was already on a shaky foundation unless she can explain a slew of suspect decisions and do it quick she must step down monday politico reported that chao designated a dedicated liaison to help kentucky and only kentucky the state represented by her powerful spouse with infrastructure grants not california with more people and needs than anyplace else not new york the economic capital with aging tunnels and bridges just the bluegrass state so just as mcconnell was gearing up for reelection kentucky won nearly 80 million in approved grants including a highway improvement project that had been previously rejected twice convenient this obscene use of political power puts in sharp focus other curious episodes during chao s tenure the new york times reported that in a 2017 proposed trip to china chao whose family runs an american shipping company with extensive business in china attempted to have beijing embassy staff coordinate travel for at least one family member and have other relatives sit in on meetings with chinese government officials last month the wall street journal revealed that chao made 40 000 profiting from sale of stock in the country s largest construction materials supplier stock she had promised to divest from a year ago at this point we re too exhausted to muster much surprise at the discovery of this type of behavior in the trump cabinet but we re not tired enough to take it laying down online https bit ly 2f4odvy the adirondack daily enterprise on no bail reform june 3 have legislators in albany just erected a massive roadblock to treating the opioid scourge by eliminating bail for low level drug offenses it is entirely possible consider this situation which isn t really hypothetical because we have heard of it happening someone with an addiction issue is arrested on a low level charge and taken to their county jail in lieu of a small amount of bail unable to post bail with the help of medication available at the jail and a little bit of time the addict realizes he or she needs help to get rid of the addiction the addict volunteers to attend drug court and is released from jail without paying bail on the condition that he or she continues with treatment programs in this circumstance the inability to post bail has actually been a benefit to both a person and to the community by helping addicts realize they need help franklin county at least does a drug screening for everyone it takes in and offers treatment we have been at presentations at which franklin county law enforcement social services medical and drug treatment officials as well as addicts in recovery all agreed that there are many pathways to recovery for addicts once they get into the jail and prison system it s on the outside that we need more treatment access without bail or the threat of time in jail we wonder if fewer people will see a drug arrest as a wake up call that s a fear that david soares albany county district attorney shared with state legislators during testimony in january i also need to point out the possible impact on drug courts the way drug courts work right now is that defendants are held on bail and given the option of drug court or jail soares told legislators if everyone gets presumptive release on drug cases nobody will go to drug court we need to carefully examine how we treat drug crimes under any new bail proposal i know i don t have to tell you how bad the opioid crisis is in our state drug courts around have been very successful in helping individuals get the services they need and stay clean we hope soares s prediction doesn t come true drug courts are a well used tool here and around the country proven to reduce recidivism among addicts consider too the revolving door through which someone is charged posts quick bail and is back on the streets offending again the phenomenon happens regularly and is true of low level dealers who are often charged with crimes other than drug dealing bail reform is likely to allow low level users back onto the streets even more quickly than before alaska implemented a comprehensive criminal reform bill in 2016 that placed defendants into pretrial services after a risk assessment was performed later dubbed catch and release alaska s governor asked for change to the system in 2018 and then pushed tougher reforms to the legislation in january bail reform as a concept is not a bad idea bail reform as it has been approved in new york very likely may be a bad idea democrats in albany can t say they weren t warned about the issues with the law as it is written soares himself a democrat who is described as a progressive warned legislators in pretty stark terms about the flaws in the bail reform legislation they chose not to heed him if it turns out that new york follows alaska s catch and release example or even worse that counties find out addicts aren t finding their way into treatment we hope state legislators will use their heads and rewrite the law online https bit ly 2f3wodo the glen falls post star on law enforcement monitoring social media june 7 the warren county sheriff s office says it has contracted with a burlington based technology company to use advanced artificial intelligence to monitor social media accounts and alert law enforcement to possible threats toward local schools we like that schools and law enforcement are looking to alternatives to armed resource officers when it comes to school safety but we d like to know more details before going forward we believe a greater community discussion needs to be had we wonder if there is still a general expectation that social media posts are private how many of us really understand our facebook privacy settings the company social sentinel was founded by gary margolis a 30 year veteran of law enforcement and security who had previously served as the chief of police at the university of vermont the company describes itself this way on its website we study and understand the language of harm and violence we deploy advanced technology and work with subject matter experts to constantly evolve social sentinel s proprietary machine learning methodologies machine learning ai algorithms classify data into alerts for immediate attention and insights for a broader context leading to greater understanding we built technology that searches worldwide to make local connections beyond a geo fence we create context by highlighting discussions and trends relevant to your communities right now it is a compelling solution to not only school violence but anyone who might be contemplating doing harm to themselves it s fighting technology with technology social sentinel says it scans through a billion posts daily to identify ones related to a school s safety security and wellness it scans a dozen social media platforms using an ever evolving language of harm library as a baseline of what words to be concerned about naturally even the most advanced computer systems can t be 100 percent accurate about intent a cbs news report last fall pointed out a case where the post i gotta kill you all was flagged it turned out it was a rap lyric and one of the flaws of the system is many false positives so there is an absolute need for someone to review any post that is flagged the way it works when social sentinel has a concern with a post it alerts the sheriff s office whose officers decide how to proceed and whether they should try to track down that person because law enforcement is involved there is a concern that the system could be abused deciding what is harmless a bad joke or a real threat can be subjective it is unclear how law enforcement officials might respond as they investigate how would a hacked account be handled will officers be given advanced training on how to evaluate social media threats what will be the standards and once it becomes widely known that social media posts are regularly reviewed won t the system become less effective there is also a concern it could be abused by law enforcement four years ago the lowell police department was looking to purchase a similar monitoring system and received objections from the american civil liberties union of massachusetts technology for liberty project people should be able to criticize government in a free society without some cop somewhere writing down everything they say said director kade crockford to the lowell sun at the time we re concerned this is a slippery slope but it is an option that should be explored online https bit ly 2kejadk the dunkirk evening observer on china tariffs and rare earth minerals june 7 thank you beijing for making it clear to americans how short sighted we have been for many years chinese officials have issued a new threat as part of their reaction to president donald trump s increases in tariffs on some goods imported here from china his purpose is to force beijing to lower trade barriers that harm u s companies and to curb abuses such as theft of intellectual property some of the materials used in electronic devices such as cell phones and electric vehicles are rare minerals collectively they sometimes are referred to as rare earth instead of developing other secure sources of such minerals the united states has become dependent to some extent on china which possesses large quantities of rare earth now the chinese are hinting that in retaliation for trump s action they may cut off our supplies of the minerals for decades proponents of a global marketplace approach to economics have assured americans that is in our best interests in both the short and long terms so we have allowed other countries to build up certain critical industries including energy and steelmaking in the process the united states has become dependent on other nations for many products including some critical to our national security yes that has meant lower prices for some goods including steel and sometimes gasoline it also has resulted in other nations or groups of them as with the organization of petroleum exporting countries for many years being able to influence both our economic and diplomatic policies by threatening to cut us off and sometimes doing so china s threat on rare earth is one more reminder of how s
