supporters after victory in new york primary there are two ways to analyze donald trump s decisive win in new york s presidential primary first it s the acknowledgment of a big run for trump this week and next during which the gop frontrunner will amass delegates at a faster clip than any of the other three republicans in the race in the process stretching his lead over texas sen ted cruz and pumping up the volume that the republican nomination is deservedly the donald s regardless of where the delegate tally stands going into july s national convention in cleveland trump s argument will look good on paper at least after new york he s two thirds of the way to the 1 237 delegates required by the gop and a guaranteed first ballot win in cleveland if he s smart trump will use the rest of april and may to keep driving home one word inevitability for argument s sake let s give trump roughly 100 of the 172 delegates up for grabs next tuesday all the action occurring in his mid atlantic backyard of connecticut delaware maryland pennsylvania and rhode island once the five states holding gop contests in may apportion their combined 199 delegates trump s total should enter four digit territory per this associated press breakdown a first ballot scenario remains feasible if he s smart trump will use the rest of april and may to keep driving home one word inevitability backed up by this exit poll data showing that an overwhelming number of new york republicans saying the candidate with the most primary votes should be the party s nominee now the other takeaway from new york the sinatra question to paraphrase that other chairman of the board if trump can make it there winning big in the empire state in a closed republican primary can he make it anywhere with three fifths of a primary electorate that hasn t bought into his candidacy the answer no not in every primary at least and stay tuned may will not be the friendliest of months for trump what with a first tuesday primary in indiana that could spell more midwestern trouble perhaps a repeat of his meltdown in wisconsin after that a winner take all contest in nebraska that likely will go to cruz draw a line from texas to north dakota and it runs through states cruz has won finally oregon and washington awarding their delegates proportionally not much of a buzz there however there is an opportunity for trump to take a major step forward in a way having nothing to do with bean counting and convention arcana and that would be courting those skeptical republicans still waiting for a trumpian pivot from angry rhetoric and juvenile social media insults to a more dignified tone and statesmanlike persona the news that broke on the same day as new york s results that trump is shaking up his senior campaign staff and empowering his team to spend aggressively to win in may and june is a first step in that direction the next step breaching divides within the gop according to the latest nbc news wall street journal poll 63 percent of republican primary voters say they could be satisfied with trump as the gop nominee the good news it s better than the 49 percent trump received back in the march exit polls not so good it cries of work to be done specifically shoring up support among conservatives uneasy of trump s past policy inconsistencies and his unwilling in this campaign to take on entitlement spending and the federal budget dragon four years ago conservatives accounted for 35 percent of that year s presidential turnout the highest share since pollsters first began recording that statistic back in 1976 82 percent of them voted for mitt romney four years previously conservatives were 34 percent of the turnout only 78 percent voted for john mccain in theory cruz has a chance of repeating those percentages if not improving on them can trump only if he starts speaking the language such is the unusual nature of this republican contest in late april of 2012 after 43 republican primaries and caucuses had voted romney had distanced himself from the field to the point where he could travel to new hampshire and deliver this speech with an eye on the general election romney promised a new campaign to unite every american who knows in their heart that we can do better the beginning of the end of the disappointments of the obama years and the start of a new and better chapter that we will write together trump s not in that position at present and he may not be until the final night of the republican national convention then again he s not the only candidate going through hard times these days the same nbc wsj poll that gave trump a historically awful 24 percent positive 65 percent negative approval rating and had hillary clinton weighing in at 32 percent positive 56 percent negative cruz recorded a 26 percent positive 49 percent negative kasich came in at 31 percent positive 19 percent negative vermont sen bernie sanders the democratic socialist and clinton s chief tormentor these days received grades of 45 percent positive 36 percent negative suggesting that the american electorate is not only sour on the political class but sorely in need of a week in caracas for a reality check on how a socialist county fares under bernie vision will trump take advantage of may s light pace to transition from temper tantrums to a style more tempered it s the practical thing to do especially when confronted with national poll numbers that for now at least are practically awful get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week
