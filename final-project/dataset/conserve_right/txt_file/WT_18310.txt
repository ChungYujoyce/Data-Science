time trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore xi s government is emphasizing the promise of china s growing consumer market to help defuse complaints beijing abuses the global trading system by reneging on promises to open its industries this says look we re not a global parasite that is creating massive deficits we are buying goods said kerry brown a chinese politics specialist at king s college london the event also is part of efforts to develop a trading network centered on china and increase its influence in a western dominated global system president donald trump and his american first trade policies that threaten to raise import barriers to the world s biggest consumer market loom in the background exporters especially developing countries want closer relations with china to help insulate themselves from what is happening with trump and the u s said gareth leather of capital economics china has cut tariffs and announced other measures this year to boost imports which rose 15 9 percent in 2017 to 1 8 trillion but none address the u s complaints about its technology policy that prompted trump to impose penalty tariffs of up to 25 percent on 250 billion of chinese imports beijing has responded with tariff hikes on 110 billion of american imports chinese leaders have rejected pressure to roll back plans such as made in china 2025 which calls for state led creation of global champions in robotics and other fields ambitions that some american officials worry will undermine u s industrial leadership to keep the economy growing china needs to

aimed at giving chinese consumers better access to foreign goods chinese leaders emphasize those include anti cancer drugs and other medical products but many are specialty goods such as high end baby
