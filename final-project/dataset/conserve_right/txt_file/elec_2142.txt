president donald trump officially entered the presidential race on tuesday vowing to confront corporations and lessen their sway over the political system i think people believe that the corporations have bought the democracy that the politicians don t care about them or respect them he said in a video announcement really what we re trying to do is make democracy work by pushing power down to the people although steyer has not yet outlined a policy platform he has been an ardent climate change activist as well as a vocal opponent of trump s launching a 10 million national advertisement to unseat the president he s brought us to the brink of nuclear war obstructed justice at the fbi and in direct violation of the u s constitution he s taken money from foreign governments and threatened to shut down news organizations that report the truth steyer says in the ad the former hedge fund manager brands himself as another american citizen i m just like you he implores but while his impeachment rhetoric and anti corporatist positioning will surely resonate among many democrats steyer will likely have to confront some cognitive dissonance as a billionaire in a crowded field of populist contenders some of whom say that such personal wealth should not even exist that s certainly not lost on the newly minted candidate who has a net worth of 1 6 billion and has already pledged to spend 100 million on his primary campaign i m tom steyer and like you i m a citizen who knows it s up to us to do something he says in his push for impeachment an apparent attempt to convince listeners that his fortune doesn t alienate him from the little guy wealth aside his business ventures in and of themselves are expected to draw scrutiny now that he s thrown his hat into the ring his successful private sector run at farallon capital management included hefty investments in oil private prisons and subprime lending all of which are industries that progressives are increasingly criticalof as the party moves farther left he also has little traction with the establishment house speaker nancy pelosi d calif reportedly expressed her displeasure to steyer over his impeachment blitz calling it a distraction in 2017 when she was still the minority leader leveraging the elephant in the room the republican national committee came out swinging after a false start left wing extremist tom steyer has finally formalized his self promotion tour under the guise of a presidential campaign rnc spokesman steve guest said in a statement the only thing steyer s campaign will do is light more of his money on fire as he joins the rest of the 2020 democrat field in pushing policies that are way outside the mainstream steyer has been a prolific donor to liberal causes as well as a grassroots mobilizer founding nextgen america which advocates for increased youth voter turnout he will resign from his leadership role at thatgroup as well as at need to impeach although he said he will donate more than 50 million to ensure their continued sucess through 2020 in order to make it to the democratic debate stage later this month he will need to amass 65 000 individual donors by july 16 as a 1 percent polling margin this late in the game is likely an impossible feat next an iowa man wins his free speech suit after being charged for a facebook rant against a cop billy binion

band together to enforce big tech censorship heading into 2020 in direct violation of the u s constitution trump s taken money from foreign governments and threatened to shut down news organizations that report the truth gosh what a selective champion obama actually arrested journalists trump hasn t yet that i know of hillary and bill actually took hundreds of millions from foreign governments while in office trump doesn t need to and hasn t that i know of trump does a lot of stupid things but you ll have to find others these stupid things you are looking for do not actually exist this is what i think is funny and threatened to shut down news organizations that report the truth let s not get ahead of ourselves mr steyer he s rattled sabers about revoking the fcc licenses of some news organizations let s leave the truth out of this assessment for now shall we he recommends a constitutional crisis to overturn the last presidential election then wants to be the replacement president that s seriously whacked you don t replace a supposed dictator with a real one it s an embarrassment of riches in terms of finding dumb and dumber opponents for trump mark my words marianne is going to win i suspect you have a bone to pick with her more like bury one deep inside her stinky chakra if you know what i mean there s no stank like that stank but then whom am i to lecture the master of the field the former hedge fund manager will likely face scrutiny over his massive wealth and previous business dealings why no other rich democrat has faced such scrutiny yeah steyer we need to get money out of politics all that money that gerrymandered the georgia governor s race and i thought bill weld was going to be the 25th clown in the car billionaire tom steyer officially entered the

climate change activist as well as a vocal opponent of trump s launching a 10 million national advertisement to unseat the president has a net worth of 1 6 billion and has already pledged to spend 100 million on his primary campaign his successful private sector run at farallon capital management included hefty investments in oil private prisons and subprime lending at need to impeach he said he

protecting his wealth and power he is purchasing and media blasting a higher rank in a new administration treasury fed and wealth protection from his socialist or crony capitalist ilk why run for any office tax right off i think trump ran for the tax right off but won anyway really what we re trying to do is make democracy work by pushing power down to the people we re going to push power down to
