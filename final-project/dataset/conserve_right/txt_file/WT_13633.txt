isolationism following its defeat in world war ii japanese vice defense minister kenji harada characterized the security situation in east asia as increasingly severe and warned that tensions with

tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dubbing the japanese military buildup integrated mobile defense mr harada said in an interview we have to respond to the situation seamlessly and very readily chinese ships and aircraft have stepped up intrusions into airspace and waters around the islands since the air defense zone was set up in 2013 covering the islands japanese f 15 warplanes have made frequent intercepts of chinese aircraft in addition to military brinkmanship with japan over the islands mr harada said china is engaging in information war including the frequent use of state run media to falsely portray japan as reverting to world war ii militarism we recognize that china is currently taking not just physical measures but also the non physical measures namely the three warfares he said the term three warfares was coined in a pentagon study made public last year the study identified china s use of what it termed legal warfare psychological warfare and media warfare as surrogates for traditional violent force against enemies including in maritime disputes mr harada said chinese political influence operations are being combined with military operations closely related to their politics diplomacy economics culture and also legal entities we recognize that they are taking that type of policy he said mr harada rejected chinese charges of a militarist revival in japan calling them groundless that is just the part of the information war that they are conducting he said since the end of world war ii japan has been making efforts to be a peaceful country and in accord with the japanese constitution we have been taking an exclusively defensive posture and never became a country that poses a threat to other countries he said japan also remains a non nuclear power and is not developing a nuclear deterrent in the face of growing nuclear missile threats from north korea and china mr harada said but a japanese military buildup is a centerpiece of the policies of prime minister shinzo abe a conservative who was elected to a second term in december based on growing fears of chinese military threats japan is a global power with a rich culture and tradition that upholds universal values as freedom democracy respect for fundamental human rights and rule of law mr abe stated in a foreword to japan s national strategy japan as a maritime state can only ensure its own peace and security by actively engaging in efforts to make the entire world a more peaceful and secure place mr abe who will meet with president obama in late april is seeking to codify into law a new interpretation of the pacifist constitution announced in july that will mark a major shift in japan s postwar defense postures the reinterpretation includes a concept of collective self defense that allows japan to join international military operations as part of joint regional defenses in the past the military was limited to responding solely to attacks on japan japan s parliament last week debated the country s defense budget which will increase from 39 5 billion last year to 41 billion this year by contrast china s publicly announced budget this year for the military will be 142 billion and is believed to be much higher japan is facing a real security concern from the chinese military rise a senior japanese defense official said japan s military known as the japan self defense forces is making modest force improvements they include purchases of 46 u s f 35 jet fighters the addition of two aegis equipped destroyers the modernization and growth of the underwater force from 16 to 22 submarines and the upgrade of missile defenses the japanese military also will field the long range global hawk spy drones in the next two years japan s government also created a high level policy unit called the national security secretariat made up of senior officials and a staff to better coordinate defense and security policies the government also is considering establishing a foreign intelligence service modeled after the cia or britain s mi 6 a recent change to japan s space program rules will for the first time permit tokyo to increase the number and use of satellites and space assets for defense behind the scenes japan is working on new surface to surface and cruise missiles and is shifting forces from northern bases to southern zones to be ready to respond to any chinese provocations or attacks the abe administration also is strengthening alliances with key states including india australia southeast asian states south korea and the u s key to tokyo s increased defense posture is bolstering the u s japanese defense alliance the two nations are finishing a major revision of the u s japanese defense guidelines that officials and analysts said is focused on the growing threat posed by china i strongly believe that the enhancement of the u s japan alliance is the utmost critical point here mr harada said even though the defense ministry does its utmost effort to protect our people unless we have the cooperation and support from the united states we cannot maintain strong security narushige michishita a national security analyst at the national graduate institute for policy studies a think tank said the latest u s japanese guidelines follow revisions in 1978 that focused on the soviet union and in 1997 that were directed against the north korean threat the 2015 guidelines are aimed at china he said the new guidelines won t be explicit in using the c word but that is what they are about mr michishita said after the guidelines are formulated and the necessary bills are passed the u s and japan will embark on operational planning for dealing with china in the future he said adding that building up japanese military capabilities is urgently needed to meet the challenge china s decades of large scale defense spending increases and expanding military capabilities are forcing japan to cope with new regional security threats mr harada said japan is working with the united states to develop weapons and other capabilities that can counter china s anti access and area denial arms submarines missiles and aircraft aimed at controlling strategic waterways near china to deal with those weapons we have increased integrated operations capabilities and also enhanced the far abroad operations mr harada said chinese activities in the east china sea and in the skies above it have included intrusions by state owned boats and aerial incursions chinese jets also have flown dangerously close to japanese interceptor jets near the islands and may cause some dangerous accident or unexpected situation he said mr harada also confirmed that the chinese are building up military facilities on nanji island along the chinese coast around 186 miles from the senkakus japanese forces are conducting continuous surveillance of the chinese military activities he said to challenge chinese ship intrusions both state owned chinese maritime vessels and fishing boats the japanese government decided to use coast guard ships instead of naval vessels against the sea intrusions to avoid escalating the situation one japanese analyst described the strategy of countering chinese intrusions as don t be the first to pull a knife like we mistakenly did at pearl harbor japanese f 15 jets based at the southern air base at nara have been launched on nearly daily intercept missions against chinese air incursions mr harada said japanese forces will continue to conduct aerial and naval countermeasures against chinese violations of territorial sky and maritime territories japanese and chinese officials will meet thursday for talks on setting up a liaison mechanism to deal with air and naval disputes in the region mr harada said that because of chinese actions it is of utmost importance to implement the maritime and air liaison mechanisms at the earliest stage mr harada speaking the day before the four year anniversary of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that killed approximately 20 000 people in northern japan said the u s navy s dispatch of the aircraft carrier strike group led by the uss ronald reagan during that crisis was a welcome display of u s military it shows that the u s government is really committed
