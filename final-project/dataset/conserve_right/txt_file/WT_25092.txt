tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap the trump administration said wednesday it will create a way for americans to legally and safely import lower cost prescription drugs from canada for the first time reversing years of refusals by health authorities amid a public outcry over high prices for life sustaining medications the move is a step toward
