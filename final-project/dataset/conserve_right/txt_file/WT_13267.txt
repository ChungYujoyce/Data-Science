apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic hong kong ap early last year a little known chinese researcher turned up at an elite meeting in berkeley california where scientists and ethicists were discussing a technology that had shaken the field to its core an emerging tool for editing genes the strings of dna that form the blueprint of life the young scientist he jiankui saw the power of this tool called crispr to transform not only genes but also his own career in visits to the united states he sought out crispr pioneers such as jennifer doudna of the university of california berkeley and stanford university s dr matthew porteus and big thinkers on its use like stanford ethicist dr william hurlbut top stories trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century last week those shocked researchers watched as he hijacked an international conference they helped organize with an astonishing claim he said he helped make the world s first gene edited babies despite clear scientific consensus that making genetic changes that could be passed to future generations should not be attempted at this point u s national institutes of health director francis collins called he s experiment a misadventure of a major sort starring a scientist who apparently believed that he was a hero in fact he crossed every line scientifically and ethically but nobody stopped him how can that be to be fair scientists say there s no certain way to stop someone intent on monkeying with dna no matter what laws or standards are in place crispr is cheap and easy to use which is why scientists began to worry almost as soon as the technology was invented that something like this would happen and there is a long history in science and medicine of researchers launching experiments prematurely that were met with scorn or horror some of which led to what are now common practices such as in vitro fertilization gene editing for reproductive purposes is effectively banned in the u s and most of europe in china ministerial guidelines prohibit embryo research that violates ethical or moral principles it turns out he wasn t exactly tight lipped about his goals he pursued international experts at stanford and rice universities where he had done graduate studies work and elsewhere seeking advice before and during the experiment should scientists who knew of he s plans have spoken up could they have dissuaded him the answers aren t clear it doesn t fall into the category of legal responsibility but ethical responsibility said collins he said that not speaking up doesn t seem like a scientist taking responsibility china s national commission of health chinese academy of sciences and he s own university have said they were in dark and have since condemned him but three stanford scientists hurlbut porteus and he s former fellowship adviser stephen quake had extensive contact with him over the last few years they and other scientists knew or strongly suspected that he intended to try to make genetically edited babies some confidantes didn t think he would follow through others raised concerns that were never heeded stanford has not responded to an interview request quake a bioengineering professor was one of the first to know about he s ambition quake said he had met with he through the years whenever his former student was in town and that he confided his interest a few years ago in editing embryos for live births to try to make them resistant to the aids virus quake said he gave he only general advice and encouraged him to talk with mainstream scientists to choose situations where there s consensus that the risks are justified to meet the highest ethics standards and to publish his results in a peer reviewed journal my advice was very broad quake said hurlbut thinks he first met he in early 2017 when he and doudna co inventor of crispr held the first of three meetings with leading scientists and ethicists to discuss the technology somehow he ended up at our meeting hurlbut said since then he returned several times to stanford and hurlbut said he spent many hours talking with he about situations where gene editing might be appropriate four or five weeks ago hurlbut said he came to see him again and discussed embryo gene editing to try to prevent hiv hurlbut said he suspected he had tried to implant a modified embryo in a woman s womb i admonished him he said i didn t green light his work i challenged him on it i didn t approve of what he was doing porteus said he knew that he had been talking with hurlbut and assumed hurlbut discouraged the chinese scientist in february he asked to meet with porteus and told him he had gotten approval from a hospital ethics board to move forward i think he was expecting me to be more receptive and i was very negative porteus said i was angry at his naivete i was angry at his recklessness porteus said he urged he to go talk to your senior chinese colleagues after that meeting i didn t hear from him and assumed he would not proceed porteus said in retrospect i could have raised a hue and cry in a draft article about the gene edited twin girls which he planned to submit to journals he thanked uc berkeley biophysicist mark dewitt for editing the manuscript dewitt said he tried to dissuade he and disputed that he edited the paper he said he saw the paper but the feedback he offered was pretty general he s claims including that his work has resulted in a second pregnancy cannot be independently confirmed and his work has not been published he defended his actions last week at a gene editing summit in hong kong in contrast another u s scientist said he not only encouraged he but played a large role in the project michael deem a bioengineering professor at rice university and he s doctoral degree adviser said he had worked with he since the scientist returned to china around 2012 and that he sits on the advisory boards and holds a small stake in he s two genetics companies in shenzhen deem defended he s actions saying the research team did earlier experiments on animals we have multiple generations of animals that were genetically edited and produced viable offspring and a lot of research on unintended effects on other genes deem said deem also said he was present in china when some study participants gave their consent to try embryo gene editing rice said it had no knowledge of deem s involvement and is now investigating so far most of the attention has focused on regulatory gaps in china but that s not the whole story said rosario isasi an expert on genomics law in the u s and china at the university of miami let s focus on how it happened and why it happened and the way it happened said isasi how can we establish a system that has better transparency there s no international governing body to enforce bioethics rules but scientific bodies and universities can use other tools if someone breaks those rules scientists can ostracize journals can refuse to publish employers can refuse to employ funders can refuse to fund said hank greely a professor of law and genetics at stanford greely expects he s experiment will have ripple effects in academia whether or not regulators act universities are going to take a harder look at what s going on this incident will put everyone on alert about any related research of course sometimes bad beginnings can turn into better endings in 1980 university of california los angeles professor martin cline was sanctioned for performing the first gene therapy on two women in israel and italy because he hadn t gotten approval to try it at ucla cline announced his work rather than publishing it in a scientific journal and faced criticism for trying genetic engineering on people when its safety and effectiveness hadn t yet been established in animals now gene therapy is an established although still fairly novel treatment method two years earlier in 1978 dr robert edwards was similarly denounced when he announced through the press the world s first test tube baby louise brown the work later earned a nobel prize and ifv has helped millions to have a child and this year louise brown mother of two sons conceived in the old fashioned way turned 40 larson reported from washington d c this associated press series was produced in partnership with the howard hughes medical institute s department of
