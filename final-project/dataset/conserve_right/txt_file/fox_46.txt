truth to power at a time when there are so few people who do that he will be so missed acuna mccain aposs death came nine years to the day of another senate legend ted kennedy mccain delivered a eulogy at the kennedy funeral and while the friends were sometimes legislative combatants they also partnered together in attempts to change the nation aposs immigration system they each died of the same form of brain cancer glioblastoma perhaps the most moving tributes were offered not by politicians rather by mccain aposs wife and daughter cindy mccain writing on twitter my heart is broken i am so lucky to have lived the adventure of loving this incredible man for 38 years he passed the way he lived on his own terms surrounded by the people he loved in the place he loved best daughter meghan

senator kelly ayotte who was dubbed one of the three amigos on capitol hill along with senators mccain and graham for their joint pushes on foreign policy senator ayotte welcome back to fox news sunday good to have you on the program this morning kelly ayotte r former new hampshire senator thank you sandra smith you wrote a beautiful tribute senator calling senator mccain a dear friend and a mentor how will you remember him ayotte i remember him first of all what a tremendous loss for his family but for the entire nation i remember john for his courage his tenacity and his wonderful sense of humor i mean he was tough as nails incredibly bright and also just always cracking a joke always a smile believed so strongly in america and really a patriot but always never took himself too seriously what an amazing man and i feel so grateful to have known him smith and he loved new hampshire he won the first of the nation primary there twice he loved to campaign there why did he why did he enjoy why did he enjoy new hampshire so much as you mentioned in your tribute he loved his time spent there ayotte john had a very special connection with new hampshire i think we consider him an honorary granite stater he came back twice here to win a new hampshire primary and he did it from voter to voter he did town halls here i mean hundreds of town halls here in new hampshire and so he forged a special connection with the people of new hampshire he has so many friends here he is thought of so fondly here and really has straight talk in the way he would just answer anyone aposs questions speak his mind and be so direct and i think also a very special connection with our military families and our veterans here who he cared so deeply about smith senator you just mentioned how he used that straight talk he spoke his mind and he is credited for rising above party politics how was he able to do that ayotte he just had the courage of his convictions and he really was a true bipartisan champion someone who was focused on getting things done for the american people and he had the political courage even when his own party disagreed with him he was willing to get out there because he knew that we need to solve problems he wanted to make our nation better you know that takes a lot of courage and he just had so much moral fortitude you know i had the privilege of seeing him at the ranch this spring and what he said to me was do the right thing kelly that aposs how he lived his life and i aposll never forget it smith what is the political landscape look like in mccain aposs absence ayotte well i think that you know as we look at someone like john mccain and his passing i mean his legacy is really one of civility and dignity and honor and integrity in something that we really need very much in politics and bipartisanship smith you were a big part of the confirmation process for neil gorsuch and now we got brett kavanaugh aposs confirmation coming up next week if i could senator ask you what your expectations are for that and timing of the replacement for mccain seat is going to be crucial as well ayotte it is and you know i think that this is an excellent nomination by the president and i would expect that he will be confirmed before the elections you know tremendously qualified both in his education and experience and just like justice gorsuch i think he aposll have a strong vote and i think it will be a bipartisan vote smith senator ayotte so sorry for your loss he was a friend a mentor to you ayotte he was smith and to hear your stories this morning and thank you thank you for coming on and telling them ayotte thank you for having me on sandra my heart goes out to cindy and john aposs family what a wonderful group of people smith thank you senator joining us now former gop minority whip jon kyl who was mccain aposs colleague from arizona in the u s senate from 1995 to 2013 he has also been discussed as a possible replacement for mccain senator kyl thank you for coming on program this morning jon kyl r former arizona senator via telephone good morning sandra smith you join us by phone senator if you could just share with us your thoughts this morning senator mccain was a man you worked closely with for many many years kyl that aposs right the lead in to your comments or to your interview with senator ayotte included the comment living life in the moment jon aposs entire approach to life was we want to get the most out of the time that we have here so let aposs dig in and get going and in his case it pointed him towards public service service of his country end of the state of arizona and he certainly did get the most out of the time he had here smith he was a busy guy and got a lot done in his life what was it like being in the political arena with john mccain kyl well there was never a dull moment i will put it that way john was involved in so many different things it was a great experience we worked together on some things and then on we divided responsibilities to make sure that our state was well served but just all of the experiences of working with john there was never a dull moment and i want to just take on one thing that kelly ayotte talked about because your viewers should know what a mentor that john was to a lot of the newer members of congress he led probably more congressional delegation trips abroad than anyone else in the congress and he always included the newer members to help them meet the same people that he knew abroad to visit the same places and these were not garden spots we are talking yemen and afghanistan and iraq and places like that but he did that not only to teach the newer members but also to represent the united states in a very effective way abroad smith how specifically senator did he want to inspire the next generation kyl well i think he wanted to do two things first by his example the way that he conducted himself to show that that was the most effective way and the proper way to represent the united states and then secondly of course to dig into the issues in all of these different places i firmly believe that he that his legacy will be his commitment to and his contributions to the national security of the united states that aposs where i think he made the most difference and i aposm sure there are people all over the world today that are joining in the mourning of john mccain aposs death smith in an era of extreme partisanship senator what will or what does the political environment look like without him kyl well it aposs not as good because john was always there as kind of conscience of the senate i remember one day going onto the floor and he was just incensed that whoever the republican leader was at the time and this was a long time ago it probably was his great friend bob dole but somehow they weren apost giving the democrats to vote on an amendment that they wanted and he was incensed he said we have to give them about it aposs the right thing to do so he was always there trying to make sure that both sides got their say and were treated fairly and has already been noted he didn apost have any trouble working across the aisle smith senator kyl your name has been whispered as a possible replacement for now that vacant seat the arizona republican governor is tasked with naming that replacement he has now said he will not do so until senator mccain is laid to rest what do you want to see happen with mccain aposs seat kyl governor ducey has an awesome responsibility there and i think the key thing is to try to continue the representation of the state of arizona but more than that as i alluded to earlier to continue representation for all the people of the united states on the most critical international issues john had the experience to do that and he had the instincts in my view to make the right kinds of decisions and i hope whoever the governor appoints can work in that vein smith and senator kyl i know you aposll be heading to washington soon for the confirmation of brett kavanaugh you will be the sherpa rallying support around those confirmation his confirmation and senator kyl we really appreciate your time and thank you for coming on the program this morning looking back at a man you worked very closely with for a long period of time there in the senate thank you kyl thank you very much smith all right when we come back our sunday panel joins us to discuss the legacy of john mccain and we will take a look at some of his key appearances right here on fox news sunday next commercial break smith as far as sunday shows go senator john mccain was a perennial guest whether as his party aposs presidential nominee an authority on foreign policy or at provocateur of the white house you can count on him to make news including right here with chris wallace on fox news sunday begin videotape wallace senator you probably didn apost make a lot of friends in the white house this week when you contradicted one of their main attack points against senator kerry which is to say that he is weak on defense mccain john kerry is a friend of mine i don apost choose to attack or disparage him and i will not i know that having a friend in washington from another party is not acceptable to some in washington i have two words for them too bad i have found in my life that when i do what i think is right for example on the marriage amendment it always turns out in the end okay when i do things for political expediency which i have from time to time it has always turned out poorly wallace give me an example sent to bring it up what have you done what would you admit you did for political expediency mccain i went down to south carolina and said that the flag that was flying over the state capitol which was a confederate flag was that i shouldn apost be involved in it it was a state issue it was an act of cowardice wallace act of cowardice on your part mccain yes wallace and you did it because you thought this would help in the south carolina primary in 2000 mccain yes sure this won apost alienate certain voting bloc and i lost anyway laughter wallace one thing that i was surprised to learn about both of you is that you are maybe i aposm wrong about this too superstitious i aposm told that you have lucky suits i aposm told senator you have a lucky inaudible but after everything you aposve been through you aposve also been quoted as saying you feel you are one of the luckiest people on earth and you feel certain not to get highfalutin about it a sense of destiny do you feel that you have one final mission to serve this country mccain i have been blessed to be able to serve for many years both in the military and in public office it aposs one of the great honors of my life but it doesn apost mean that i was meant to be president it just means that whatever time i have left i would be of service to the country and i am grateful incredibly grateful that i aposve had the opportunity and if it stops tomorrow i will look back at an imperfect person but one who always tried to serve wallace republican insider senator say that your big job going forward is to reach out to conservatives here is what one mccain insiders that the other day reporter can he then go on and become the nominee of this party unidentified female yes i think holding their nose they don apost know how to take him wallace oh boy senator one is your mother right and two how do you persuade conservatives to stop holding their nose mccain i love my mother dearly more than anything in the world but really my mom is not is not a complete expert on this issue and i love her and i love her candor and she aposs been a great great asset particularly whenever the age issue comes up wallace on mccain aposs desk is a picture of his granddad during world war ii in the corner you can see a photo of the senator as a little boy mccain says treasure your children mccain if i had a message because i aposm not as young as i used to be it aposs enjoy every moment with them enjoy every second because they all grow so fast and you will have some of your best memories of the time you spent with them i fought against my own people administration when i wanted to when i thought it was necessary to do so and i will fight against this administration when i think it aposs necessary to do so wallace if i may press and it is what other people are saying that aposs what you are saying about yourself you said i never considered myself a maverick mccain well i what i was saying was that i had considered myself a person who is a fighter i wouldn apost be around today if i wasn apost a fighter i fight for things that i believe in and sometimes that aposs called a maverick sometimes that aposs called a partisan people can draw their own conclusions i prefer great american myself wallace as the son and the grandson of military men and as a war hero yourself mccain and a son in the navy wallace and a son in the navy mccain one who was in the marines too wallace your thoughts on memorial day mccain the great honor of my life it was to have had the opportunity long ago and far away to have served in a company of heroes i aposm the luckiest guy you have ever interviewed and will ever interview i aposm the most fortunate man on earth and i thank god for it every single day thanks for having me on again chris i love our spirited discussions wallace me too always end videotape sandra smith fox news host it is time now for our sunday group a former press secretary for vice president pence marc lotter columnist for the hill juan williams the co host of benson and harf on fox news radio marie harf and fox news correspondent gillian turner at least he left us laughing there and in such a sad few hours that we have seen since the family announced his death yesterday marc he did make us laugh marc lotter former pence press secretary he absolutely did and the only thing i can say is if you would have decided to retire and enjoy a quiet peaceful life after his military service no one could have faulted him for what he went through smith but that he did not do lotter but he felt called to serve and do more and he did smith and he did even in those final 18 months or so of his life he kept fighting the brain cancer for sure but he still stayed politically involved as well marie marie harf co host benson harf absolutely he was not going to just walk away and not have a voice in so many important issues we continue debate whether it aposs health care whether it aposs the state of our politics and sandra i thought a lot over the last few weeks about you know john mccain was a hawk for sure but for me one of the most significant things he did was when he worked to make peace with vietnam a country where he was tortured where he fought a war he banded together with john kerry who he disagreed with him on many things including the vietnam war and said that our past does not have to dictate our future when it comes to our relationships around the world normalized relations with the country who tortured him that is an extraordinary statement smith you know all of us sitting at this table at some point in our careers we had the opportunity and the honor of knowing senator john mccain and getting to know him in some instances juan we get a picture of you and your son with senator mccain juan william fox news political analyst yes smith he aposs someone you knew williams so that aposs the last time i saw senator mccain we ran into him at the nationals baseball game this summer so that aposs the last time i think that he was here and again you know senator mccain and i had had disagreements my job is to sometimes be critical of politicians i remember when he was yawning groaning i think it was in apos07 he was down at the bottom in terms of candidates seeking the republican nomination i said it looks like john mccain is out of gas here and boy he didn apost like it he let me know he did not he didn apost think that was the right thing for me to say and then when he came back he let me know hey i aposm back i won and you should tell people that i came back you know so that aposs john mccain but to me just picking up on what marie said what stuns me is not only that he would go back and work to normalize relations with vietnam but here in america at a time of political polarization part of the reason i think we honor mccain so much today it comes out of our living need to say that we can go beyond party politics we can go beyond polarization we can go beyond race you heard what he said to chris about acknowledging a mistake on the confederate flag issue but if you think about his working with russ feingold on campaign finance reform with ted kennedy on health care you think about him standing up to his own party on the affordable care act recently and saying i don apost think we can just strip it we have to have something to put in its place this is the maverick he said he didn apost like to be called a maverick he would rather be called a great american i think on this sunday morning sandra we can say john mccain you are you were not only patriot a great american and an american hero smith you know he referenced back gillian to his mother roberta mccain she is still with us she aposs 106 years old he was certainly obviously a war hero a politician with a long career a successful career in politics but he talked about his family being the most important thing in the world to him gillian turner fox news correspondent oh of course and those of us who know it had the chance to work with meghan when she was here at the channel know just how tight his bond was not with her but with all of his children marie pointed out that a really important part of his legacy is that he was a national security hawk a defense hawk but i think it aposs important to point out that he was not a warmonger far from it you know he spent a lot of time advocating for better support and services for service members veterans and their families but he had a very healthy appreciation especially later on during his tenure in the senate for the limits to the use of military force i always think about afghanistan he lobbied president obama really hard for increased troop presence in afghanistan and then was the first guy on the senate floor after that was secured to stand up and say america is never going to secure all of its interests in this country with the use of military force alone he is very unique in that he aposs worked on both sides of the issue as a service member and then his policy there is no one else like that smith yes and now a lot of questions about what will happen with that vacant seat who will fill it and what kind of the timing is going to be so important obviously with the brett kavanaugh hearings coming up a fighter he called himself and i think we all agree we saw in the same way we have to take a break with our panel but when we come back two of the president aposs former close associates are facing jail time what does this turn of events mean for the president we will speak with two insiders former attorney general alberto gonzales and former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski next commercial break smith coming up democrats issue a warning to president trump over the use of his pardoning powers begin video clip schumer the president should not even consider pardoning mr manafort or mr cohen at any point in the future end video clip smith we aposll ask our sunday panel about the true extent of the president aposs authority coming up on fox news sunday commercial break sandra smith fox anchor tensions between president trump his attorney general and the justice department reaching epic levels after a week of legal bombshells involving once loyal members of his inner circle let aposs review this week mr trump aposs former campaign chairman paul manafort convicted in federal court on financial crimes his former personal attorney michael cohen implicated the president in a harsh money scheme and the two men closest to those payments granted immunity the white house says none of this has anything to do with the president that he did nothing wrong and there are no charges against him joining us now alberto gonzales former u s attorney general who served under president george w bush welcome back to fox news sunday sir thank you for coming on the program alberto gonzales former u s attorney general good morning if i can let me let me just as an air force veteran i honor john mccain aposs service and sacrifice on behalf of our country our military our veterans and their families smith we appreciate your words this morning as we aposre all sharing sentiments in the wake of john mccain aposs death we aposre following the developments of what was it was a hectic week for this white house and for the president and questions about what sort of legal peril the president is in or is he in any legal peril at all depends on who you ask i want to start first with the president aposs argument that his attorney general never took control of the department begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i put in an attorney general that never took control of the justice department jeff sessions never took control of the justice department and it aposs a sort of an incredible thing end video clip smith so first just let aposs establish where you stand on this judge is that criticism of the president of his ag is that fair gonzales that is a very serious allegation that the department of justice is out of control you know jeff sessions has been mainly quiet until now in the face of a lot of criticism from the white house and he finally responded and i think it was appropriate that he did respond because to say that the department is out of control is a very serious charge from my perspective from my vantage point you know there appears to be investigations ongoing appear to be successful prosecutions and so i think that it aposs important for the attorney general to reassure the american people and speaking to the president that he is in control of the department of justice and that it aposs operating the way that it should be operating now that aposs not to say that the president as president of the united states he has a right to be critical to say what he wants to say about his cabinet officials as a general matter i think it aposs more effective to do it privately than publicly because it undermines the department the attorney general and also i think hurts the moral of the department of justice so i think it aposs preferable for the president to speak his concerns and criticism to the attorney general directly as opposed to publically but he certainly has a right to speak out smith well sessions hit back at the president and sort of rare for him he doesn apost normally publicly hit back at the president but here he was the action of the department of justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations and like i said this marks one of the few times that we aposve seen him publicly respond to the president although he did not call him out my name there but what is judge the danger in this feud between the president and his ag what is the danger in this continuing gonzales well as i said i think i fear that because the president is head of the executive branch and can remove the attorney general anytime that he wants that the continued criticism without taking any action i fear makes the president look a little weak but i also worry about the fact as i said it undercuts the attorney general aposs authority and agency battles with other cabinet secretaries with his counterparts around the world and i do think it has a long term effect upon the morale of the department of justice and undermines the integrity how people view the department of justice how the american people view the institution and i think that aposs that aposs very very dangerous and so as i said the president has a right to speak out no question about that he was unhappy with the performance of the attorney general but as a general matter i aposm not sure that it aposs doing the president much good it may be preferable and more effective to do it privately smith meanwhile a lot of developments as far as the robert mueller investigation goes this week a conviction in the case of paul manafort and the white house making it very clear where it stands on that case begin video clip sarah sanders white house press secretary the manafort case doesn apost have anything to do with the president it doesn apost have anything to do with his campaign it doesn apost have anything to do with the white house end video clip smith what are the ramifications of paul manafort aposs conviction judge gonzales i think it aposs still too early to tell it is interesting the white house is correct that no charges have been brought against the president but we need to be mindful of the fact that it is current doj policy as i understand it that the president cannot be indicted and the president cannot be prosecuted so you aposre not going to see any charges i don apost believe brought against the president irrespective of whether or not there is a conclusion by the department of justice that the president engaged in criminal wrongdoing but nonetheless i think with respect to the conviction of paul manafort and the guilty plea of michael cohen you know it aposs not good it creates a lot of debate and swirl around the president as an individual and that aposs never good i think it averts a president aposs attention from the business of the american people there are very serious issues both domestically and across the world that deserve the president aposs full attention and that aposs what i worry about smith but the president did seem to sort of praise paul manafort in the wake of his conviction leaving questions about whether or not he may pardon him look how he responded to that question begin video clip donald trump president of the united states paul manafort aposs a good man he was with ronald reagan he was with a lot of different people over the years and i feel very sad about that end video clip smith so that was him on the ground in west virginia seemingly praising paul manafort when asked specifically in a fox news interview whether or not he would pardon him he did not say no and he did not say yes do you is he laying the groundwork for a pardon gonzales well you aposll have to we aposll have to ask the president i don apost i can apost i can apost get into his mind it is a bit unusual for the president of the united states the head of the executive branch and the department of justice works for the president of the united states and they aposve had a very they had a very successful conviction of paul manafort and to have the president then you know speak so well of paul manafort was was somewhat unusual in terms of a pardon as we know the president aposs pardon power is virtually unlimited and so the president may decide that this is a particular case where a pardon is warranted if he believe that paul manafort was unfairly treated but again that would send a message that he believes his department of justice acted in a way that was unprofessional and unfair and i you know i worry about that kind of message as well smith so many wondering how far this mueller investigation will go how long it will go on the president talking about a sit down interview with mueller a perjury trap you heard that from rudy giuliani ultimately do you think the president should sit down with robert mueller gonzales i think it might be helpful politically for the president to at least respond to written questions i don apost know about sitting down with and giving oral testimony to robert mueller but i i think perhaps it may it may ease in the minds of certain members of the american public the president aposs involvement the president aposs knowledge about russia russian involvement in the presidential election 2016 so but we aposll have to wait and see smith that aposs a big wait and see we aposll see where it all goes judge alberto gonzales great to get your take on things this morning thank you for thank you for joining us on fox news sunday gonzales thank you for having me smith now to corey lewandowski president trump aposs former campaign manager who joins us now live from new hampshire corey welcome back to fox news sunday good to have you on the program what a week this was how would you describe this week for the president corey lewandowski former trump campaign manager well sandra let me first echo what judge gonzales said and and let all of the viewers know how our thoughts and prayers are with the mccain family and as a new hampshire almost native son the years he spent up here campaigning the success he had i just want to echo those statements to remember a man who served our country with great admiration and honorable and so i want to thank and thank the mccain family and have our thoughts and prayers with him as we start but as it relates to the president and this week what we have seen here once again is the mueller investigation which was designed to look at potential collusion between the trump campaign and the russian outside influence has no bearing has not produced any evidence not one scintilla of evidence that there was any type of collusion cooperation or coordination between the trump campaign and anybody from an outside source to impact the outcome of the election so what i think is important now is that the mueller investigative team finishes their investigation reports that to the department of justice and we put an end to the investigation which clearly has demonstrated has nothing to do with the presidential campaign of 2016 smith you aposve got to think about how that looks though the conviction of paul manafort the guilty plea from michael cohen immunities granted to two others close to all of this and you aposve got to wonder corey and you aposve got to you the optics of it does it spell trouble for the president as this investigation continues lewandowski well sandra if you look at what paul manafort was originally charged with and has now been found guilty of those are crimes that he was accused of and found guilty of that took place 10 to 12 years prior to him coming to the trump campaign for the five month window those were tax evasion charges those were charges that have absolutely nothing to do with his tenure with us and what bob mueller aposs team was supposed to be investigating was the potential collusion between russia and the trump campaign so the conviction of paul manafort has nothing to do with the trump campaign the trump organization or any work that transpired during the 2016 campaign and as it relates to michael cohen who has now pled guilty and was looking at 60 plus years in jail once again his crimes were basically crimes of not following the rules as it relates to your taxes following false filing false bank statements those have nothing to do with the campaign look i was the campaign manager i spent as little time with michael cohen as humanly possible he was never part of the campaign when i was there and what he has now pled guilty to by and large has nothing to do with the campaign or the trump organization this is michael cohen not filing taxes smith but corey corey i hear i hear what you aposre saying about your relationship with him and there have been reports that you privately tried to get the president tried to get the president to back away from him you were warning him that he was a loose cannon but the president said at that time at one point in time that he was a good lawyer and he trusted him for a long time now he aposs calling him a flipper so why did the president trust michael cohen as long as he did especially with warnings coming from the likes of you lewandowski you know michael was very good at certain things and one of the things that he was very good at and we aposve now seen it is intimidating people and pushing himself to fix he was the self described fixer which i don apost know what that means but i know from the corporate side and i didn apost work at the corporation to be clear but when there was a problem from the corporation side you know if there aposs a problem with an airplane engine michael was tasked with the negotiation to make sure that that engine was fixed under the warranty procedures when companies didn apost want to do that i know that was one specific project but i can tell you this i didn apost like to work with michael i didn apost like to interact with michael and that aposs why he had no role in the campaign even though he wanted one i was very clear when i was in charge of the campaign michael was not somebody who we wanted at the campaign he would go out and make statements that we had to walk back afterwards because he would say things which were factually untrue and i warned everybody at the organization that michael was going to become a problem smith here we are final week weekend in august i should say it aposs hard to believe we aposll be moving into september ever more closer to november what are your expectations for republicans in the midterm elections corey lewandowski my expectations are that when it comes to the u s senate the republicans will gain three to four seats expanding their majority there and when it comes to the house of representatives i think the republicans are ultimately going to have a smaller majority but they aposre going to continue with their majority because the american people are going to have a chance this november to either go in the direction of economic security homeland security and national security or they can go back to the days of potentially speaker pelosi whereby open borders and no tax cuts that aposs what the american people are faced with smith you mention nancy pelosi she called tuesday trump aposs day of reckoning if democrats were to win control of the house what do you think the chances are of of them going for impeachment of the president lewandowski well i think it aposs clearly on their agenda because they have no other agenda when you look at maxine waters who was slated to become the chairman of the house financial services committee jerry nadler from new york the chairman of the house judiciary committee if they take over they have no plan for the american people so there only plan is to be obstinate and obstacles to the trump economic agenda and that means starting an impeachment proceeding where there is none to be found but that will completely stymie a washington d c which is candidly already broken smith i aposve got to ask you finally about the new york state subpoenaed michael cohen this involves you as part of this probe into the trump foundation it alleges persistently illegal conduct they aposre accusing the non profit the trump organization of engaging in extensive unlawful political coordination with the trump campaign the president has vowed in response publicly that he won apost settle this case the lawsuit does point to you corey which is why we wanted to ask you about it before you go first of all have you been contacted about that lewandowski so i aposve never spoken to anyone from the state of new york about this issue and and what aposs really at stake here and what the crux of the argument is is that the trump foundation which has no overhead and actually gives out more money than it ever raises is a recognized 501 c 3 charitable organization and they aposre calling into question raising money for that 501 c 3 and then distributing it to other 501 c 3s that aposs what this is all about i aposve never seen it before i aposve never heard of it before and this the trump foundation gave away more money than it actually raised because the president then candidate trump was putting his own money into it smith well they aposve subpoenaed they aposve subpoenaed michael cohen what will they learn from him lewandowski well that aposs a great question i don apost know what michael has to do with the the trump foundation at all and i don apost know what he has to do with the disbursement of the money from the foundation so that will be news to all of us when we find that out smith corey lewandowski thank you very much for joining us today lewandowski thank you smith thank you up next our sunday group returns to discuss the fallout from the swirling investigations battering the white house commercial break begin video clip ben sasse r nebraska senator the idea that jeff sessions might be fired because he aposs not a political hack is a very very bad idea lindsey graham r south carolina senator replacing him before the election to me would be a nonstarter but the idea of having a new attorney general in the first term of president trump aposs administration i think is very likely end video clip smith differing opinions even inside the gop about the future of attorney general jeff sessions after the president reignited their feud over his recusal from the russian investigation and we are back with our panel marc you heard you heard senator sasse there suggesting firing sessions would be i think he said a very very bad idea would it marc lotter former pence press secretary and i don apost think anyone is seriously taking that as something happening before the midterms i think senator graham obviously talked about that as well i think any while the president can make changes you know when he decides it aposs time to make a change i would personally be surprised if it happened before midterms smith doesn apost lindsey graham one have a point when he says that the the president is entitled to have an attorney general that he has confidence in juan williams fox news political analyst without a doubt the problem is that given the political context sandra can he get a new attorney general the republicans have a 51 49 advantage in the senate but already you hear from people and you just heard one there but also susan collins and others say this would be a mistake and don apost forget jeff sessions was a u s senator he has lots of friends there so there would be strong opposition and the question then would be oh if you want to fire sessions are you going to replace him with someone then who aposs going to fire mueller or fire rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general smith right and williams and when people start thinking like that they are definitely going to have much resistance smith and susan collins a pivotal republican she wanted of the same thing if you fire him we may not be able to replace him right marie harf former state department spokesperson that aposs right and it shouldn apost matter whether it aposs before or after the midterms if it aposs wrong to fire him because he aposs not serving us president trump aposs personal attorney general which is i think what donald trump had in mind when he appointed jeff sessions to that role it should be a problem either before or after but the politics will be an issue here i do not think the senate particularly as closely divided as it is can replace him jeff sessions as juan mentioned he was a senator he has a lot of friends up there and i think what you see is the president had probably his toughest week and the press this week as president he aposs lashing out increasingly at everyone including jeff sessions because the situation is very dire there are three ongoing investigations people get immunity every day people are working with prosecutors smith hold on not every day harf but that aposs well every day this week we had a new report of someone close to donald trump getting immunity and i think you see the president not knowing how to respond smith but the question is what does all of that mean and imply for the president harf right smith and the white house is saying it has nothing to do with the president and the president there aposs no implication that he did anything wrong in all of that harf well we aposll see smith but sessions is firing back which was really interesting because we haven apost seen him fire back in such a public way and he said he will not let the department be improperly influenced by political considerations is that a sign perhaps gillian that he aposs taking this feud more public gillian turner fox news correspondent oh absolutely and a lot of folks were shocked to see that tweet when it came out yesterday smith statement yes turner or thursday whenever it was i do disagree with marie slightly in terms of the timing here i think that if sessions leaves whether he aposs fired whether he departs after the midterm he does get the president gets a little bit of a get out of jail free card on that in the sense there aposs nothing scandalous there aposs nothing unusual about an attorney general leaving anyone in the cabinet leaving after the midterms in any administration i think waiting until then would really turn the heat down on this entire situation and i think that aposs what collins and that aposs what cornyn and other republicans weighing in on this and warning the president are trying to tell him smith meanwhile the president and his team are making it very clear they want this mueller probe this investigation to come to an end rudy giuliani the president aposs attorney tweeted yesterday just days before 60 day run up to 2018 elections if mueller wants to show he aposs not partisan then issue a report on collusion and obstruction they will show president trump did nothing wrong then we will have to admit you were fair and we will is giuliani publicly trying to rush the special counsel to wrap up this investigation lotter well i think he is acknowledging what we what we see out there every day i mean anyone who was close to president trump or worked for president trump is getting a legal colonoscopy by every investigator out there meanwhile democrats smith that was a visual i didn apost need lotter and meanwhile democrats are getting a band aid and sent on their merry way and i think he wants to bring this to a close we have seen we aposve still see no evidence of collusion and nothing is still smith do republicans have a point marie this investigation aposs been going on 16 months and counting harf well also republicans investigated the clintons over whitewater for six years so let aposs all just have some perspective here i think that mueller cannot wrap this up before the midterms because they haven apost settled issues of whether the president will sit down with him there are a number of people who haven apost been interviewed yet i think that mueller will avoid actually saying anything until after the midterms because there are a lot of outstanding questions that still need to be answered and through the investigation we have learned much more the trump campaign started out by saying no one ever talked to any russians well now we know that over a dozen trump campaign people did that may not be collusion sandra but we have learned much more throughout this investigation that warrants further questions those are serious and cannot be wrapped up i think in the next few months smith i think it left a few people wondering why when the president this week said he could go in and do whatever he could run it if he wants but he decided to stay out when it comes to this investigation what does that tell you williams well i think he aposs really at this point sort of flustered and flailing if he thinks that he can take control of the investigation that aposs like you know al capone taking charge of eliot ness it aposs just not the way it aposs done in this country no man is above the law is the standard so he instead now is attacking not only sessions as we just discussed but he aposs also saying go after the democrats my political opponents why aposd they get an easy pass i don apost know if they got an easy pass i think they were thoroughly investigated but then the other part of it is that he goes after a witch hunt he says this has been a witch hunt and appeals to his base at some point smith inaudible williams you aposve got to ask people when do you stop justifying bad behavior by this president smith all right with the time we have left i want to go around the table predictions for the midterms starting with you marc lotter keep the expand the majority in the senate keeps the majority in the house smith marie harf democrats take the house it aposs going to be a bit of a blue wave the senate aposs a toss up smith oh you guys are making this easy all right gillian turner agreed dems take the house and the senate is smith juan williams oh i think that right now the president said this week a red wave i do not see a red wave instead what i see is likelihood that i would say a third a chance of a strong blue wave in which the democrats not only take the house but control in big numbers or secondly get just enough a third chance that they don apost make it and in the senate i think the odds given the playing field is still with the republicans to hold smith final question marie if democrats win control of the house will they move to impeach the president harf i think after the last week it is a conversation with having that wasn apost worth having a week ago and we aposre going to have it smith you guys are good i mean right on your time cues ok it was really fun to have you guys as our panel this morning thank you very much all of you harf thank you sandra williams i
