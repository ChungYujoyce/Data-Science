apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the united states and india have embraced a new strategic partnership its broad goal is to contain the rising influence of china in the pacific and to keep muslim pakistan an unstable ally in the war against the taliban in afghanistan at bay the partnership includes growing cooperation on military and security relations it also features expanding trade and investment in support of india s evolving national manufacturing initiative known as make in india all of these elements are working but there s a major hitch india is still using high tariffs and other protectionist measures to keep u s manufacturing goods from entering its domestic market top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time as a result america continues to suffer a debilitating trade deficit 32 billion with the world s second largest country which is home to some 200 million consumers it s a problem that the trump administration needs to address and soon the trend is actually getting worse for example in 2016 india increased tariffs on telecommunications equipment likewise medical equipment and devices such as pacemakers coronary stents and surgical instruments and parts of medical devices imported to india now face a 7 5 percent basic customs duty 12 5 percent additional duty and a 4 percent special additional duty other cliff high tariffs include 50 percent to 113 percent on agricultural goods flowers 60 percent natural rubber 70 percent automobiles and motorcycles 60 percent to 75 percent raisins 100 percent alcoholic beverages 150 percent and textiles some rates exceed 300 percent according to the u s international trade administration india s taxes on foreign made goods are another major problem imports are subject to state level sales taxes and the central sales tax as well as various local taxes and charges in some cases the government is also imposing price caps on american manufactured goods this is especially the case with american medical devices including stents and implants taken together indian tariffs taxes and price controls are having the effect of driving american producers out of the indian market or forcing them to suffer unacceptable losses some american companies are being singled out for abuse a good example is apple the company is the second largest producer of smart phones in the world india is the second market for smart phones however apple accounts for just 2 percent of india s domestic market for smart phones moreover india is making it exceedingly difficult for apple to set up its manufacturing plants in india the issue has been raised with india in the past but the government has refused to address it squarely the finance ministry claims that the matter is in the hands of the country s trade agencies the gst and the gat but these agencies have refused to act it s the classic regulatory run around protest over india s trade policies is growing this week the advanced medical technology association asked the u s trade representative to suspend or withdraw in whole or in part india s benefits under the general system of tariffs the ustr recently won a case filed before the world trade organization over india s attempts to force solar cells sold in india to include a high percentage of india manufactured component president trump who has eagerly promoted the idea of a close u s strategic partnership with india and enjoys warm relations with the country s conservative prime minister narendra modi is aware of the growing controversy in a speech last march he assailed india s policy of imposing a 100 percent tax on imports of harley davidson motorcycles he didn t actually identify india by name but the country s leaders surely got the message their newfound strategic ally is displeased the trump administration needs to raise the trade deficit issue to a higher level of bilateral diplomacy in the past mr trump has complained loudly about countries like mexico and china exploiting their trade deficits with america the administration need not denounce or criticize india publicly too much is at stake however ustr should meet with his indian counterpart and survey the status of trade policy the ustr needs to insist on greater transparency in india s regulatory policies trade is only one issue that should be on the table india is also failing to observe u s intellectual property rights it is currently one of the worst offenders in the world our tolerance in this area is wearing thin india s confusing maze of tax policies is also frustrating the pace of foreign investment congress which has not really tackled these issues thus far should weigh in behind the administration s new overtures to india india is moving in the right direction as a whole liberalizing many sectors and encouraging foreign investment mr trump needs to convince mr modi to allow for expanded u s exports and to facilitate more foreign direct investment however he should be prepared to engage in creative deal making to obtain these concessions a growing trade deficit with india is not in the american interest working to resolve this issue now rather than letting it fester is essential to keeping our strategic partnership with india on course stewart lawrence is a washingt
