perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong republicans are poised to pick up seats in the senate as congressional campaigns head into the home stretch but democrats are strongly defending a half dozen states that will determine whether the gop wrests control of the chamber or settles for another session of a divided congress analysts say republicans will pick up vacant seats in west virginia and south dakota long held by democrats and should pick up a vacant seat in montana putting them halfway toward the six needed to flip control of the senate despite a highly touted class of challengers though republicans have struggled in a number of other conservative states leaving the fate of the senate to be fought out over the next two months in north carolina louisiana alaska and

has become politically toxic in many states analysts say he is a huge drag said stuart rothenberg of the rothenberg political report the reason why the democrats are in trouble in states ranging from arkansas to iowa to colorado is the president if george bush were in the white house right now and he had the ratings that barack obama has none of these democrats would be in trouble most likely he said it is possible that when the final weeks of october roll around the election is all about the president and it is up to the democrat to make sure that doesn t happen the latest real clear

obama lost to republican challenger mitt romney in 2012 alaska arkansas georgia kentucky louisiana and north carolina despite the backlash against mr obama republican candidates in some of the most competitive races have failed to open significant leads part of the reason is that public disapproval is even lower for congressional republicans than it is for mr obama history also shows an uphill
