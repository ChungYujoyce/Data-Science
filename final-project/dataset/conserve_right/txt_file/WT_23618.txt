tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn president trump s boost in polls following his state of the union address has proved to be surprisingly durable even as he loses battles in congress and faces round the clock scorn from potential 2020 rivals mr trump emerged from the speech in early february with a cleaner message and approval ratings that averaged in the mid 40s he then avoided another government shutdown while battling congress over his border wall plans and has managed to maintain his numbers his approval averaged at 44 percent thursday about 2 percentage points better than right before his feb 5 address on capitol hill said ron faucheux a nonpartisan political analyst and publisher of lunchtime politics see also i chose you trump celebrates first veto launches official wall defense fund it may not seem like much of a bounce but every bit counts for the unconventional president who is touting a robust economy and is needling house democrats who have gained subpoena power but are struggling with intraparty divisions if he had received 1 point less of the popular vote in 2016 nationwide he would have lost mr faucheux said for him re election is about inches not miles though one big poll shows his ratings are starting to slide mr trump still holds a post speech bump of about 2 points in real clear politics polling average after the president s favorite poll rasmussen reports showed him stooping into the low 40s during a lengthy government shutdown he has since flirted with 50 percent approval in rasmussen the streak continues even as congress steps up its investigations of mr trump and has passed a resolution to terminate his emergency declaration for illegal border crossings mr trump vetoed that move friday saying the declaration is needed to fund a wall i suspect many of his voters will blame congress for the situation rather than blame trump said fran coombs managing editor of rasmussen reports which tracks approval every day what we ve seen pretty much since trump entered the scene is he s got a solid base of supporters and solid base of detractors that dynamic explains why mr trump s approval has floated around the low to mid 40s he captured 46 percent of the nationwide vote in 2016 without tanking or grabbing new supporters to get above the waterline watching the president s approval ratings is like watching a seismograph in vermont not much movement because of the steadiness of his base said ross baker a politics professor at rutgers university what fluctuations there are up or down are relatively modest most people pretty much have their minds made up about donald trump mr trump received a slight bump in approval from his state of the union address last year but it dissipated little more than a month later one difference this year is that he is now sharing the spotlight with house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat freshman rep alexandria ocasio cortez new york democrat and the crowded democratic presidential field while battling mr trump the democrats have debated the extent of a government run single payer health care plan and whether to embrace ms ocasio cortez s major greenhouse gas emissions overhaul known as the green new deal differences within the party seem to be working in the president s favor or at least directing the glare of public opinion elsewhere the state of the union speech helped clean up his messaging and some of the benefits of that remain mr faucheux said i think there are two reasons for that first the economy is in good shape second the democrats have moved too far left giving him something to run against the white house says america is winning again so people are starting to notice our economy is stronger than ever before jobs are growing wages are rising and america is respected again internationally said judd deere white house deputy press secretary when president trump promised greatness again he was serious and he has kept his word even so mr trump faces a partly cloudy outlook his disapproval rating consistently tops 50 percent and his approval rating has tumbled 4 percentage points in gallup s polling from 43 percent in late february to 39 percent at the start of march a weaker than expected jobs report at the end of the polling period might have worked against the president the pollster said mr trump s 39 percent approval is equal to his mark at the start of the federal shutdown in late december and puts him far behind other recent presidents at this point in their first terms by gallup s measure barack obama hit 47 percent in march 2011 george w bush was at 58 percent in march 2003 around the start of the iraq war and bill clinton clocked in at 48 percent in march 1995 yet rasmussen says mr trump is on par with mr obama at this point with both floating in the high 40s where mr trump s approval goes in future months may depend on special counsel robert mueller the conventional wisdom is that mr mueller s report expected soon will not be as explosive as once thought yet that is speculation if they come out with some damning proof that trump did something or other yes that will hur
