the manor and slaughtering a dozen deplorables according to the hollywood reporter mr trump in the meantime has been the one steady reasonable voice in the midst of this madness in his statement after the shootings he condemned racism and bigotry but also dared to address the multitude of issues we face we must recognize that the internet has provided a dangerous avenue to radicalize disturbed minds and perform demented acts we must stop the glorification of violence in our society it is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence high
