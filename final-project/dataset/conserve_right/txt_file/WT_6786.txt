hong kong anti government protesters saying he did not intend to offend any of the team s chinese fans or sponsors a short time after morey posted that statement the nba said it was regrettable that

tweeted an image that read fight for freedom stand with hong kong referring to the four month old protests in the semi autonomous chinese territory that led to houston owner tilman fertitta turning to

that is worth 1 5 billion over the next five years and chinese state television both of which said they would not be showing rockets games it wasn t immediately clear if morey s new tweets or the nba s statement that followed would be enough to salvage those relationships chinese athletic apparel maker li ning released a statement saying it was upset with morey s tweet i did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to rockets fans and friends of mine in china morey tweeted early monday from japan where houston is playing this week i was merely voicing one thought based on one interpretation of one complicated event i have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives i have always appreciated the significant support our chinese fans and sponsors have provided and i would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention my tweets are my own and in no way represent the rockets or the nba nba chief communications officer mike bass said the league recognizes that morey s tweet deeply offended many of our friends and fans in china which is regrettable bass added that the league supports individuals sharing their views on matters important to them we have great respect for the history and culture of china and hope that sports and the nba can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together bass said earlier fertitta attempted to distance the team from morey s tweet with a twitter post of his own emailprotected does not speak for the houstonrockets our presence in tokyo is all about the promotion of the nba internationally and we are not a political organization the timing of this is particularly awkward for the nba whose players have often been outspoken on social issues in the united states china has teams in the u s playing preseason games this week the rockets are about to play two games in japan and the los angeles lakers

comes to china and hong kong by now i hope you can begin to understand why the daryl morey tweet is so damaging to the relationship with our fans in china tsai wrote i don t know daryl personally i am sure he s a fine nba general manager and i will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been but the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair the statements from morey and the nba caught the eyes of lawmakers including no fewer than three u s senators ted cruz of texas rick scott of florida who criticized nba commissioner adam silver for the league s statement apparently unaware it was made by bass an nba spokesman and brian schatz of hawaii we re better than this human rights shouldn t be for sale the nba

error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact the consulate general s office said in a statement sunday the chinese league said sunday on its official twitter like weibo account that morey had made improper remarks regarding hong kong to which it expressed its strong opposition that underscores beijing s extreme sensitivity about foreign attitudes toward the ongoing protests and increasing violence china accuses foreign parties in the u s and elsewhere of encouraging the demonstrations the protests that started in june over a now shelved extradition bill have since snowballed into an anti china campaign amid anger over what many view as beijing s interference in hong kong s autonomy that was granted when the former british colony returned to chinese rule
