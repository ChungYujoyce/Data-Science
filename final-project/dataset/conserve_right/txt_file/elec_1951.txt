so called whistleblower who caused the impeachment drama of course the identity of eric ciaramella was never much of a secret lots of people in d c knew that the former national security council staffer was the reputed source for california rep adam schiff s investigation of president trump s july 25 phone call to ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky ciaramella s name has been in many news stories in recent months report anti trump complainant eric ciaramella worked with brennan biden and dnc operative chalupa american greatness oct 30 2019 and open society emails show anti trump cia whistleblower eric ciaramella was updated on george soros s personal ukraine activities gateway pundit nov 17 2019 to cite just a couple but cnn viewers have never heard ciaramella identified and jake tapper evidently wants to prevent anyone else from reporting this fact either wednesday afternoon tapper tweeted a trump campaign official just rted a tweet containing the name of the alleged whistleblower tapper s third grade tattletale behavior was in response to trump campaign deputy communications director matt wolking retweeting investigative journalist paul sperry with a photo showing ciaramella meeting with ukrainian officials in 2015 why doesn t tapper want anyone to see that photo perhaps because it shows ciaramella taking notes while seated between liz zentos who was eastern europe director on the national security council at the time and michael carpenter a foreign policy adviser to then vice president joe biden sperry pointed out that in january 2018 carpenter was seated beside biden at the council for foreign relations event when biden notoriously boasted about using u s aid as leverage to force ukraine to fire a prosecutor in other words the photo illustrates what trump s defenders have been saying for months about schiff s investigation that it is a partisan witch hunt in which the alleged whistleblower is part of a cabal of democrat loyalists with close ties to biden this has become an issue in the senate trial in which kentucky sen rand paul attempted to ask about connections between eric ciaramella and his former nsc colleague sean misko who joined schiff s committee staff in august the same month the whistleblower submitted his complaint supreme court chief justice john roberts refused to admit paul s question in the trial but why was tapper playing twitter tattletale against a trump campaign staffer in an apparent effort to suppress the name eric ciaramella as professor glenn reynolds has often said the media in general have become democratic party operatives with bylines their coverage is organized on the basis of what will help democrats win elections and advance the party s agenda and anything contrary to that organizing principle they consider not newsworthy tapper and his network now consistently third place in the cable news ratings are a perfect example of how this principle operates the decline of cnn illustrates why this one sided political bias is bad for the news business and ultimately also bad for democrats how did donald trump get elected after all during the 2016 presidential campaign cnn went so all in on its support of hillary clinton that its coverage amounted to a massive contribution in kind to her campaign the bias was so obvious during the democratic primaries that supporters of hillary s rival bernie sanders dubbed cnn the clinton news network why did cnn treat sanders so unfairly wasn t it because they viewed clinton as the more electable candidate in the general election that confidence in clinton s electability widely shared in the so called mainstream media arguably fed into the over confidence within the clinton campaign which clearly underestimated trump s appeal to blue collar voters in states like pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin the media in 2016 conveyed the idea that trump couldn t possibly be elected but apparently 62 9 million voters didn t get the memo the benefit of having a majority of the new media acting as democratic propaganda operatives is diminished if a democrats make the mistake of believing their own publicity or b the public becomes aware of the unbalanced nature of what is being presented as news in 2016 biased coverage led democrats to underestimate the appeal of trump s populist message and trump made it a habit to call attention to how biased the media really is if tapper and his cnn colleagues want to treat eric ciaramella s identity as a secret they are free to do so others however are free not only to name ciaramella but also to point out that cnn is deliberately refusing to report important information relevant to the impeachment trial yet in contradiction to basic first amendment principles anti trump media types like tapper evidently wish to silence their critics what did tapper imagine would be the effect of his tattling on matt wolking did he suppose the trump campaign would fire wolking or did he hope that perhaps twitter s own censorship squads the orwellian trust and safety council would suppress wolking s twitter account this attitude an apparent desire to silence anyone who doesn t share their political agenda is what makes the anti trump media not only the enemy of the people as trump has called them but also their own worst enemy by the blatant obviousness of their bias journalists like tapper undermine their own credibility and inspire a sense of public paranoia if americans can t trust the most trusted name in news which cnn claims to be doesn t this feed into the belief that elite insiders exercise nefarious influence in our national affairs such distrust of elites explains not only right wing populist support for trump but also left wing populist support for bernie sanders the truth that cnn is trying to suppress after all involves hunter biden s 83 000 a month job with the ukrainian natural gas firm burisma and trump s effort to convince ukraine to investigate that deal is exactly why there is an impeachment trial going on in the senate it is entirely legal to publish the name eric ciaramella as a crucial link in the chain of events that led us to this point after tapper tried to scold wolking on twitter wolking fired right back and soon twitter was filled with mentions of ciaramella s name see for example juanita broaddrick s tweet which got more than 6 000 retweets in 24 hours wolking went on to explain that the belief that it is illegal to name ciaramella is a myth created by adam schiff and his allies in the media to prevent the american people from learning about the origins of the democrats totally partisan impeachment sham reports indicate senate majority leader mitch mcconnell believes he has the votes to bring this impeachment to a swift conclusion but the problems caused by bias in the media will continue and democrats will suffer most of anyone because of those problems simple question why did nancy pelosi believe this impeachment would succeed isn t it because she believed the media would help her drive trump from office but she couldn t get a single house republican to vote for impeachment and the senate trial has been a debacle for democrats headlines like schiff throws temper tantrum about his staff getting smeared by reports on the whistleblower pj media and top 8 reasons trump already won impeachment the federalist suggest what a disaster pelosi led her party into but cnn s dwindling audience has no idea because jake tapper won t tell them who will tell them the president of the united states that s who the massive crowds turn out for trump s rallies cheer when he criticizes the fake news media impeachment actually appears to have made trump more popular sean trende of real clear politics noted this week trump s job approval is now the highest it has been in our average since feb 5 2017 does anyone think this trend will be reversed if somehow democrats can get enough gop senators to cross the aisle and vote to drag out the impeachment trial beyond this weekend maybe jake tapper thinks so but he seems to believe his job is to report only what democrats want to hear and the most important news he never reports at all keep it up jake and you ll get lots of credit when trump gets reelected in november the heroes act introduced tuesday by house speaker nancy pelosi read
