john delaney of maryland accused mr sanders and ms warren of peddling fairytale economics see also 2020 democrat warns party playing into donald trump s hands on immigration he warned that the party will lose if it embraces the liberal agenda of mr sanders and ms warren invoking past democratic presidential losers george mcgovern walter mondale and michael dukakis as a cautionary tale of what happens when the party moves too far left we don t have to go around and be the party of subtraction and telling half the country that their private health insurance is illegal he said former colorado gov john hickenlooper warned that the party would lose the election if it embraced the green new deal and a socialist agenda see also this is amazing marianne williamson winning democratic debate donald trump jr says you might as well fed ex the election to donald trump he said new age guru marianne williamson who said she usually sides with the duo on the radical left joined the moderate doubters on medicare for all i have a concern that it will make it harder to win and will make it harder to govern ms williamson said mr sanders and ms warren though both vying to lead the party s far left wing found themselves standing side by side at center stage a veritable tag team beating back the moderates democrats win when we figure out what is right and go out there and fight for it said ms warren massachusetts democrat she accused the moderate democrats of being co opted by republicans when they complained that medicare for all was too expensive and would strip thousands of americans of private insurance we are the democrats she said we are not about trying to take away health care from anyone that s what the republicans are trying to do and we should stop using republican talking points she also mocked mr delaney s criticisms saying she didn t understand his point i don t understand why anyone goes to all the trouble of running for president of the united states just to talk about what we really can t do and shouldn t fight for ms warren said mr sanders said it was the insurance companies who were the bad guys and accused his rivals of toeing the insurance company s line by the way the health care industry will be advertising tonight on this program he said they will be advertising tonight with that talking point he also insisted his proposals had broad appeal every credible poll i ve seen has me beating donald trump mr sanders said in another exchange montana gov steve bullock admonished his rivals for playing into donald trump s hands by promising to decriminalize illegal immigration and give illegals free health care we ve got 100 000 people showing up at the border right now if we decriminalize entry if we give health care to everyone we ll have multiples of that the governor said citing jeh johnson president barack obama s homeland security secretary south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg urged democrats to stop worrying about what republicans will say about their policy ideas if we embrace a far left agenda they re going to say we re a bunch of crazy socialists mr buttigieg said if we embrace a conservative agenda they re going to say we re a bunch of crazy socialists let s just stand up for the right policy and go out and defend it mr buttigieg along with ms warren and mr sanders said ending the criminal sanction against illegal immigration is critical to defanging mr trump s policies the point is not about criminalization that has given donald trump the tool to break families apart ms warren said we need to fix the crisis at the border and a big part of how we do that is we do not play into donald trump s hands ms warren said but you are playing into donald trump s hands mr bullock countered cnn devoted about 10 minutes to the issue of illegal immigration tuesday night far less than it gave to health care and barely touched on the complexities of the matter asking chiefly about some candidates push to end the criminal penalties mr sanders for his part objected to having his universal government run health care plan medicare for all attacked for covering illegal immigrants too i happen to believe that when i talk about health care as a human right that applies to all people in this country he said democrats sent a message by selecting the motor city for the second showdown that they are focused on putting michigan back in the blue column in the 2020 general election mr trump meanwhile is seeking to be the first republican since president ronald reagan to carry the state in back to back presidential elections after taking a stunning 10 000 vote upset over hillary clinton in 2016 for democrats the key to unlocking michigan could be in wayne county which is home to more than 1 7 million people and has backed democrats in every presidential race since 1932 mrs clinton won the area in 2016 but she dramatically underperformed compared with mr obama who had strong support in the detroit metropolitan area particularly among blacks the voters offset losses elsewhere and handed him victory in michigan in 2008 and 2012 in detroit 80 of the residents are black and 14 are white according to the u s census the debate was held a week after nine of the contenders parachuted into detroit to woo black leaders and activists at the annual naacp gathering the opening debate features all white candidates mr trump s recent twitter attacks against rep elijah e cummings of maryland and the rev al sharpton only intensified the focus on race and the struggles of urban america the next stop on the debate schedule is slated for september in houston where eight candidates have claimed spots that leaves the lower tier candidates scrambling over the next six weeks to meet the stiffer polling and financial thresholds needed to qualify each of the 10 candidates tuesday was given a minute to deliver an opening statement a closing statement and responses to questions from debate moderators dana bash don lemon and jake tapper for months mr sanders and ms warren have carefully competed to dominate the far left lane of the race on the debate stage they also competed with a crowd of candidates who are polling in low single digits and trying to differentiate themselves as moderates mr buttigieg and former rep beto o rourke of texas who occupy the fifth and sixth positions in the polls respectively attempted to carve out room in the center of the democratic party other lower polling candidates in the showdown tuesday were sen amy klobuchar of minnesota and rep tim ryan of ohio mr sanders 77 who describes himself as a democratic socialist blazed the far left trail his 2016 presidential bid came up short but nevertheless set a liberal agenda for the democratic party that includes tuition free public universities and a medicare of all program of government run health care these formerly radical proposals have become normal if not unanimous among the 2020 democratic hopefuls ms warren 70 forged a similar political brand for herself with a decadeslong crusade against wall street and income inequality which propelled her to the u s senate and onto the presidential campaign trail mr sanders and ms warren each lead separate movements of far left activists and they face the same challenge to unify the movements they also jockeyed for the second place position in polls behind the front runner former vice president joseph r biden mr biden and other top contenders including sen kamala d harris of california will be among the 10 candidates on the debate stage wednesday ms warren was widely viewed as on the rise in recent weeks but mr sanders has maintained solid support from his base and managed to bounce in and out of the no 2 spot a quinnipiac university poll released monday gave mr biden a wide lead of 34 followed by ms warren at 15 ms harris at 12 and mr sanders at 11 a survey by emerson polling released tuesday showed mr biden at 33 mr sanders in second at 20 and ms warren in third at 14 the tougher criteria that the democratic central committee set to get into the houston debate includes higher polling and donor thresholds the candidates will need to get 2 in four qualified polls and 130 000 donors across 20 states up from 1 in polls and 65 000 donors needed for the first two debates the candidates have to achieve both the polling and donor benchmarks to earn a spot in that debate rather than one measure that sufficed in the first two debates so far eight candidates appear to have made the cut for houston mr biden mr sanders ms warren ms harris mr buttigieg mr o rourke mr booker and entrepreneur andrew yang stephen dina
