player of the week educated author tara westover this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday february 10 2019 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i aposm chris wallace president trump pushes his agenda for 2019 while at the same time warning house democrats begin videotape president donald trump if there is going to be peace and legislation there cannot be war and investigation rep nancy pelosi d calif speaker of the house we will not surrender our constitutional responsibility for oversight wallace what are the chances washington will get anything done this year we aposll ask white house chief of staff mick mulvaney then trump we need border security we have to have it it aposs not an option wallace with the deadline for another government shutdown now just five days away will there be a deal on border security we aposll ask two members of the bipartisan panel trying to find a compromise republican senator richard shelby and democrat jon tester together only on fox news sunday plus amazon founder jeff bezos accuses the national enquirer of trying to blackmail him threatening to publish intimate photos we aposll ask our sunday panel about the battle between the tabloid and the world aposs richest man and our power player of the week the woman behind a national bestseller on her remarkable journey you never went to grade school or high school why not all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington there are reports today that congressional negotiators are closing in on a border security deal that would prevent another government shutdown next weekend but any compromise is likely to fell well short of the 5 7 billion president trump wants to build a wall the big question will the president agree to that deal in a moment we aposll speak with acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney who brought house members to camp david this weekend looking for areas of common ground but first let aposs get the latest from chief congressional correspondent mike emanuel mike mike emanuel chief congressional correspondent hi chris democratic sources say their side will not accept more than 2 billion for physical border barriers they say the range under consideration is between 1 3 billion and 2 billion president trump insists the wall will get built one way or the other begin videotape emanuel with funding talks at a critical stage president trump has not been drawing red lines for congressional negotiators trump they are working on something on both sides are moving along we aposll see what happens we need border security we have to have it emanuel the senate appropriations chairman sounded hopeful heading into this important weekend of talks sen richard shelby r ala after the meeting with the president and the vice president i believe we got some latitude to hopefully conclude this emanuel house speaker nancy pelosi told reporters leave it to the negotiators she aposs staying out of it pelosi i have asked the administration to be as noninterventionist as i am on that just let them do their work emanuel vice president pence is signaling this border security battle won apost end with this funding fight mike pence vice president we are going to build that wall one way or the other i promise end videotape emanuel time is precious congressional negotiators recognize they need a deal by tomorrow in order to pass it through the house and senate by the end of the week chris wallace mike thank you joining us now the white house chief of staff mick mulvaney welcome back to fox news sunday mick mulvaney acting white house chief of staff good morning it aposs good to be here wallace well as we just heard mike report apparently that the number that congressional negotiators are talking about is somewhere between 1 3 billion and 2 billion of the most in any case less than half the 5 7 billion the president wants for new border barriers will the president signed a deal at that number mulvaney i have to laugh because i aposve heard those numbers i aposve also heard zero for a border barrier or wall 800 million was a number i aposve heard i aposve also heard 2 5 or 2 6 and i aposm looking forward to actually watching interview after i aposm off of this show because i just don apost know where the democrats are and i think that aposs a reflection chris of where their party is i don apost think they know where they stand on this particular issue and that aposs one of the reasons i think we aposre having difficulty coming to a deal to answer your question the president is going to build the wall you saw what the vice president said there and that aposs our attitude at this point which is we aposll take as much money as you can give us and then we will go off and find the money someplace else legally in order to secure that southern barrier but this is going to get built with or without congress wallace ok so i want to unpack because you set a lot of stuff there you aposre saying he will take whatever congressional negotiators give me you are saying then if they agree let aposs take the numbers that aposs been mostly reported 2 billion he will sign a bill and then try to find more money mulvaney a couple different things i aposm not saying what the president will or won apost sign because keep in mind there aposs a lot of things that don apost get discussed which is what else is in the bill you could give a number that the president might like but take away something he doesn apost like i was talking with senator shelby i understand a new issue has come up in the last couple of hours that he aposs going to discuss with you in a couple of minutes regarding detention beds so there aposs going to be a lot of different moving pieces so i aposm not in a position to say the president will absolutely son or will not sign here aposs what we do know the president has to sign a piece of legislation in order to keep the government open he cannot sign anything that they put in front of him excuse me he cannot sign everything they put in front of him there aposll be some things that simply we couldn apost agree to so the government shutdown is technically still on the table we do not want it to come to that but that option is still open to the president and will remain so wallace i want to pick up because the president tweeted we aposll build the wall one way or the other and as you pointed out mike pence has also said that over the weekend what does that mean let aposs say you get 2 billion from the congress and you agree to that can he repurpose money that congress has appropriated for other purposes and spend that on the wall or does he have to declare a national emergency mulvaney the answer to the question is yes and no yes there are other funds of money that are available to him through what we call reprogramming there is money that he can get at and is legally allowed to spend and i think it needs to be said again and again all of this is going to be legal there are statutes on the books as to how any president can do this wallace and he can do that without declaring a national emergency mulvaney there are certain funds of money he can get to without declaring a national emergency and other funds that he can only get to after declaring a national emergency so wallace how much good to get without declaring mulvaney that remains to be seen let aposs talk about the whole pot the whole pot is well north of 5 7 billion wallace now it aposs clear that a lot of republican leaders including senate majority leader mcconnell are saying don apost declare an emergency there aposs going to be a resolution of disapproval a lot of republicans are going to break with you it sets a bad precedent mulvaney right wallace is his does he is the national emergency declaring a national emergency still on the table or has he been persuaded by some of his fellow republicans let aposs not go that way mulvaney it aposs absolutely on the table and it aposs not a precedent ok this is the law the law as it exists today i think we aposve had 58 declaration of national emergencies since the national emergency act was passed in the 1970s so this is not a case chris as many folks think it is of the president is not getting what he wants so just going off and magically declaring a national emergency and getting all the money he wants there are certain things that every president must do in order to trigger the rights that he has to sort of move money around so yes there aposs a lot of republicans who don apost want to do it face it the president doesn apost really want to do it that aposs why we have to go through the shutdown that aposs what he aposs let congress do what they aposve done for the last three weeks he would prefer legislation because it aposs the right way to go and is the proper way to spend money in this country but if that doesn apost happen the president proceeds his number one priority is national security he will then look at the national emergencies act as a way to do his job wallace in his state of the union address the president warned about the dangers of illegal immigration here he is begin video clip trump tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate it is actually very cruel end video clip wallace but the washington post reports this weekend the trump golf club in new jersey has employed a steady stream of illegal immigrants for years and that the managers at the club knew they were illegal how do you explain this apparent hypocrisy by president trump and by his business mulvaney one of the things you and i have talked about with my job is what i call compartmentalization which is that i deal with running the white house we deal with running the government what you just put up it aposs a fair question but it aposs a question that goes to the trump organization and not to the trump white house we are not involved with the operation of those facilities wallace yes but has the president ever discussed the fact that there was apparently a stream of illegals working for him mulvaney no i don apost talk with the president about his business i know that sounds unusual to people but we have so much to do running the government we don apost get into these other matters wallace all right you brought a small group of house members republicans and democrats to camp david friday saturday to discuss potential areas for common ground that you can actually do business in did you find any mulvaney a little bit i think so i found out i can beat john yarmuth at bowling even though he beats me in golf that was fun but i also found out that john yarmuth and peter welch good friends of mine when i was in the house are interested in talk about things such as border security such as prescription drug pricing so yes in fact i think were going to have at least one meeting this week on drug pricing that grew out of that get together friday night i think we need to do more of that spend more time focusing on if you and i disagree 90 percent of the time that means we agree 10 percent of the time maybe our time is better spent trying to figure out how to work on the 10 percent wallace president trump said this week in his state of the union speech that if house democrats conduct what he called quote ridiculous partisan investigations that nothing will get done i want to play for you some clips from the president from intelligence committee chair adam schiff and then the acting attorney general matthew whitaker at a hearing on friday here they are begin video clip trump if there is going to be peace and legislation there cannot be war and investigation rep adam schiff d calif we are not going to be intimidated or threatened by the president to withhold any legislative advancement rep jerrold nadler d n y have you ever been asked to approve any request or action to be taken by the special counsel matthew whitaker acting attorney general mr chairman i see that your five minutes is up and so laughter end video clip laughter wallace people see you laughing at that two questions one does the president recognize that congress has a legitimate oversight role in addition to its legislative role and it aposs an aggressive legislative role and two what did he think of attorney general whitaker aposs behavior in that hearing mulvaney the president absolutely agrees with the concept that the congress has the right to do oversight it aposs one of the constitutional jobs that aposs not his point he aposs not trying to discourage them from doing it what he saying is look you have a choice we can either work together on legislation or we can spend all our time with you doing investigations but you can apost do both crosstalk wallace wait you can do both and presidents have done both plenty of times mulvaney right but don apost again it aposs not reasonable to expect the president to work with you on monday on a big infrastructure bill and then on tuesday have you punch him in the face over 15 different investigations wallace you were in congress for six years are you aware you were mulvaney sure wallace you were there of what the republicans did to barack obama and hillary clinton on benghazi on fast and furious and they got some things done despite the fact that these were aggressive partisan investigations mulvaney well we didn apost get very much done listen i aposll be the first to admit that when the tea party wave of which i was one got here in 2011 the last thing we were interested in was giving president obama legislative successes that aposs where the democrat party is right now the difference between then and now is that so many of these democrats got here by saying they wanted to reach across the aisle and they wanted to work with the president a lot of those swing district folks are in there saying you know we aposre not really interested in investigations we want to work with our friends across the aisle we aposre giving them a chance to do that but we aposre telling them is you can apost do both you can apost go home and tell the voters back home that you aposre going to work for the president and then come to washington and do nothing but investigate the president so wallace if they want to investigate no oversight no investigations mulvaney if they want to no if they investigate there will be but that aposs their choice wallace no i aposm saying if they want to legislate no investigations mulvaney it aposs very difficult to do both i just think that aposs human nature wallace all right in his speech i aposm running out of time here so i want to get to a couple of things quickly in his speech the president warned democrats about socialist policies and he issued this declaration begin video clip trump tonight we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country cheers end video clip wallace i understand the president opposes the new green deal but does he think that aposs the view of a wing of the party or does he think that aposs the prevailing opinion of democratic leaders mulvaney i don apost think anybody knows i think that aposs one of the big questions of the day is where is the center of gravity in the democrat party you aposre going to have jon tester on a little bit who aposs widely perceived as being sort of a conservative within the party i aposd be curious to know where he is on the green new deal i think that roughly half of the president announced presidential candidates the democrats have supported this even though they are not sure what it is the other half is not so i don apost know where the democrat party is on this i know where the republican party is and by the way it aposs fun to be in a party where we are united and the other side is divided we are against the green new deal wallace no but that is without any question that is true president trump has repeatedly gone after amazon founder jeff bezos and here aposs a tweet from last month after the national enquirer reported that bezos was having an extramarital affair so sorry to hear the news about jeff bozo being taken down by a competitor whose that aposs the enquirer whose reporting i understand is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper the amazon washington post given his support for the inquirer how does he feel about bezos saying that the enquirer was threatening to blackmail him with intimate photos mulvaney yes i don apost think there aposs any question there is no lost between the president of the united states and mr bezos or the washington post but in all fairness i never asked him that question if i back to the point that while these things make news and a lot of the folks in the media are interested in them it aposs not what we do in the west wing we run the government wallace are you troubled with the idea that the enquirer would threaten to expose explicit photos unless bezos dropped an investigation mulvaney take me out of my role as chief of staff and i think it aposs a very interesting question the i think what little i aposve read about was the national enquirer is asserting a first amendment privilege to do that mr bezos is saying he aposs been blackmailed it aposs going to be very interesting to see that constitutional issue play out in the courts wallace but it aposs not the question of whether they have the right it aposs that they are saying if you don apost drop the investigation and don apost say there aposs any political motive we are going to do this that would seem to be extortion mulvaney again yes and that aposs the allegation mr bezos is making you and i are not going to resolve those issues here today wallace we could try anyway final question how close are you to finding the person or persons who leaked the president aposs private schedule and if you do what are you going to do to him or her mulvaney here aposs why this is important to me as the acting chief of staff the stuff in the memos is not that confidential about 400 people get that there aposs much more private schedules that i see for example as the chief of staff so it aposs not the content it aposs the fact that someone within the white house spent three months collecting this information which is really really hard to do it also shed light on the fact that many people who work for us weren apost hired for us it would be like maxine waters taking over the financial services committee in the house and having to keep jeb hensarling aposs staff we need civil service reform so the president can trust everyone working for him and we aposre not there right now wallace and how close are you to finding who did it mulvaney hoping to have a resolution on that this week wallace so you aposre really close mulvaney yes sir wallace so when you find that person or persons mulvaney we aposre going to find the person or persons and it aposs likely going to be a career staffer you aposre going to learn a lot about how hard it is to fire federal workers wallace you aposre saying that you may not to be able to fire em mulvaney i aposm saying that i know from work at cfpb it aposs nearly impossible to fire a federal worker wallace mick thank you thanks for coming in i got to say i ask you a question i get an answer mulvaney it aposs always a good time wallace always good to talk to you sir mulvaney thanks wallace up next two members of the conference committee working to bring a deal to the president they will give us the latest on where negotiations stand commercial break wallace a congressional conference committee is up against the clock looking for a compromise on border security president trump will sign to avoid another government shutdown in just five days joining us now two leading members of the panel the republican chair of the senate appropriations committee richard shelby and democratic senator jon tester gentlemen welcome to fox news sunday senator tester let me start with you has the conference committee reached agreement at least on the number of reported barriers and these reports that it aposs going to be south of 2 billion is that true sen jon tester d mont we are still in negotiations chris and i think that when you aposre talking about border security it includes more than just a barrier it includes technology it includes what we are going to do with the ports manpower aircraft the works we are not to a point where we can announce a deal negotiations are still going on there are good people on this committee so i have confidence that hopefully we aposll get something done very soon wallace yes senator shelby i hope you heard chief of staff mulvaney just before you say that apparently an issue has come up and at the talks are in jeopardy tell me what that is sen richard shelby r ala i think the talks are stalled right now i aposm hoping we can get off the dime later today or in the morning because time is ticking away but we got some problems with the democrats dealing with ice that is detaining criminals that come into the u s and they want a cap on them we don apost want a cap on that we haven apost as jon tester said we haven apost reached a number on the barrier yet but we aposre working and we aposre hoping we can get there but we aposve got to get fluid again we got to start movement wallace i aposm going to get to senator tester and this idea that the talks are stalled but on this question of the number you met with president trump on thursday and you came out and said that you were more optimistic than you have been if for the sake of this argument for the sake of this discussion if the number is 2 billion substantially less than the 5 7 billion did the president give you any assurance that he aposs willing to go along with that number to avoid another government shutdown shelby well the president our talks with the president are confidential but i came out of the meeting thinking we could make a deal with the democrats if they are willing to meet us halfway secondly the president basically in the conversation gave us some latitude to talk and that aposs what we aposre trying to do to get to yes today wallace senator tester what do you do you agree with senator shelby that the talks are stalled and specifically this deal of detention there has been talk that democrats want fewer detention beds which raises the question if you can detain fewer people doesn apost that mean you have to catch and release more which raises the possibility more of them won apost show up for their court hearings tester chris it aposs negotiations ok negotiations seldom go smooth all the way through it aposs give and take it aposs compromise it aposs the way government is supposed to work we got good people in this conference committee chairman shelby john hoeven blunt capito you know durbin i can go down the list the bottom line is is that we got people who aren apost bomb throwers they are people who know how to work together and get a deal i aposm not positive we aposll end up with a deal but with this group of people and the folks from the house i think we are going to end up with something that deals with detention beds with barriers with technology with the challenges we have on the southern border in a common sense way chairman shelby is correct time is of the essence we need to move forward we need to keep our eyes on this but i aposm very hopeful not positive but very hopeful we can come to an agreement wallace why would you want to limit the number of detention beds if the idea is you want to detain them rather than catch and release them and then they emerge into the country tester i can tell you until we get a final number i aposm not sure we are doing any of that wallace but on principle why would you want crosstalk tester we aposve got to come to a final number and it aposs a negotiated process i think what everybody wants including the people i serve with on both sides of the aisle they want to make sure that southern border is secure there aposs many ways to do that whether it aposs detention whether it aposs technology whether it aposs a barrier and i think that we aposll come up we can apost do everything all at once by the way we have to prioritize and move forward and i think this committee is fully capable of prioritizing expenditures and hopefully will get something the house that the house can pass the senate can pass and the president will sign wallace senator shelby let me bring you back into this obviously time is of the essence the government runs out of money at least some agencies do at midnight friday night and because a variety of rules and i love one of them is that the house actually wants time to read whatever you guys come up with the thought has been that you have to make a deal you have to announce something by tomorrow do you feel that aposs the deadline and how confident are you that you can reach a deal by tomorrow shelby chris that is a deadline i aposm not confident were going to get there i aposm hoping we will get there but the house has some leeway as far as they aposve got rules that aposs true they wave rules sometimes that aposs difficult but i think the next 24 i said the other day it was 72 hours i think the next 24 hours are crucial we could close some deals but they aposve got to be good to secure our borders wallace let me just pursue that for a second you aposre saying it aposs got to be a good deal obviously what if you can apost make a deal in 24 hours do you give up do you keep going what happens shelby i don apost think we ever give up but the president will have some options perhaps we will have some options but short of a deal they aposre not good options wallace let me just pick up on that with you senator shelby i aposll bring in senator tester in a moment what is your attitude at this point towards a government shutdown is that just completely off the table and there aposs been talk that there are a lot of republicans particularly in the senate who really don apost like the idea of declaring a national emergency despite what mick mulvaney said fearing that it will set a precedent for a democratic president shelby well shutting down the government should always be off the table we would like of it to be off the table we aposve worked hard to fund the government we aposre going to continue to work hard in these negotiations but the specter of a shutdown is always out there wallace and what about national emergency shelby well i think the president has some powers under the constitution and also under the statute but i would rather we reach a legislative conclusion to this that aposs our job i aposm going to do everything i can to do it but we aposve got to do it both ways it aposs got to be a double edged sword here wallace i you know the interesting thing is senator tester there was quite a lot of optimism as recently as this weekend that you guys were going to have a deal you are going to announce something yes the president was going to have to eat considerably less money for a border barrier how much trouble is this in right now tester i think chairman shelby put his finger on it i mean if we stay focused on getting a deal and we negotiate in good faith on border security i think we aposll end up with something that can work and keep the government open and give certainty for not only the public employees but for the safety of the country and i think that aposs the bottom line and nobody wants a shutdown nobody wants the president to use some kind of emergency powers we just need to do our job and we can do it and look every negotiation almost every negotiation out there hit bumps in the roads there are bumps on the road but as long as we stay focused in a bipartisan way bicameral way to get this done i aposm hopeful we can get it done is it a done deal no it isn apost and we could end up in a train wreck it aposs happened before but i don apost think anybody has an appetite for government shutdown and i think everybody wants to make sure borders are secured wallace do you want to give me some odds on the idea that you get is it 50 50 better worse that you aposre going to have a deal tomorrow tester i aposm a farmer i never make the right decision when i aposm selling my grain i aposm not a good poker player either wallace ok shelby i will say 50 50 we get a deal i hope and pray we do tester so the glass is half full laughter wallace well it depends on how you look at that isn apost it senator i want to ask about one more question gentlemen while there aposs no question that illegal immigration is a real problem there are charges particularly from democrats that president trump is exaggerating it and i want to talk about a specific issue the president goes to el paso tomorrow for a big rally and here aposs what he said about the situation in el paso at the state of the union begin video clip president donald trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country end video clip wallace but let aposs look at the facts from 1993 to 2006 the number of violent crimes in el paso and this is before the wall was built fell 34 percent construction of the wall didn apost start until 2008 and from 2006 to 11 before the wall was built until after the wall was built the violent crime rate in el paso actually rose 17 percent so it fell before the wall rose during and after the wall senator shelby is the president misleading or exaggerating the threat to americans shelby well i don apost think he aposs misleading or exaggerating we aposve got real problems along our borders we aposve got millions of illegal immigrants in this country we aposve had a lot of drug dealers gangs and everything come across that border he aposs not exaggerating it we aposve got to secure the border we aposve made progress but we can do better than this i think we owe it to the american people wallace senator shelby senator tester thank you both thanks for your time always good to talk with you and we aposll be following what happens in the next 24 hours 50 50 tester thank you chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss president trump setting the stage for 2020 and his run against democrats and socialism commercial break wallace coming up president trump looks to brand democrats as socialists heading into 2020 begin video clip sen cory booker d n j we as house democrats support what i would term compassionate capitalism end video clip wallace we aposll as our sunday panel how the issue will play on the presidential campaign trail next commercial break begin video clip trump we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y climate change and our environmental challenges are one of the biggest existential threats to our way of life rep nancy pelosi d calif speaker of the house i do know that it aposs enthusiastic and we welcome all the enthusiasms that are out there end video clip wallace president trump trying to wrap congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez aposs green new deal around democrats necks as a push for socialism while house speaker pelosi keeps her distance and it aposs time now for our sunday group rich lowry of national review columnist for the hill juan williams former democratic congresswoman donna edwards now a columnist for the washington post and former national security council spokesman michael anton author of the new book after the flight 93 election well rich from the president on down republicans are salivating at the prospect of painting democrats as backing a socialist agenda how good an issue is that for them as we gear up for 2020 rich lowry national review i think it aposs very good i think you have a lot of democrats who have signed on to various aspects of a frankly socialist agenda including the green new deal including medicare for all at least the bernie sanders version without any thought given to how it would play in a general election especially in the crucial upper midwest and the green new deal it aposs hard to think of a more radical proposal for an utter transformation of our society that has ever been proposed in a democratic country wallace well let aposs take a look at some of the specifics of the green new deal that was unveiled this week by congresswoman ocasio cortez and some other democratic leaders one hundred percent of u s power demand by 2030 from clean renewable and zero emission energy sources upgrade all existing buildings expand high speed rail so most air travel is obsolete and it goes on and on congresswoman edwards isn apost that pretty radical and in fact couldn apost you call it socialist donna edwards d md former congresswoman well first of all the democrats are not socialist they aposre democrats and so i think what you see is that the house has proposed a new select committee on the climate crisis i think all of the ideas including the ideas for a green new deal are going to be part of that conversation and then we aposre going to go to the relevant committees energy and commerce to to do it wallace all right but but but all renewable energy basically do away with the internal combustion engine by 2030 medicare for all free college tuition guaranteed jobs you couldn apost you argue that aposs pretty radical and possibly socialist edwards it may be radical but it aposs not socialist it aposs it aposs at wallace why why not edwards no because i think that you know people said that medicare was socialist and of course it wasn apost and you know john dingell who just past reminded us of that and so any time you have bold new proposals they have to go through the process and we aposll see what we come out with but i mean there aposs nothing radical about saying that we have a climate crisis and that it aposs important for us to structure our economy develop resiliency in communities to make sure that we deal with this crisis wallace michael democrats think this conceivably could be a win win for them because for instance nancy pelosi keeps her distance from those specifics she even has called it a green dream so the argument is you can you can energize the the the a lot of voters particularly young voters who are particularly concerned about climate change but it aposs just aspirational so you don apost have to be held to account for the specifics michael anton former national security council spokesman well i would say we should all hope so because the real problem with this is not whether or not it socialist it aposs that it my view it just can apost work does anybody remember george w bush in 2003 promising the hydrogen economy and hydrogen cars we aposre 16 years later we don apost have it these technologies seem to be much further off than the plan presupposes and whether they can be achieved or not the one thing i aposm pretty sure of is that the government aposs not going to achieve them the private sector innovation and research is going to achieve it so forcing timetables isn apost going to make this happen wallace so juan according to the polls there is a growing percentage of americans particularly young people who say they support socialism over capitalism and republicans say it may sound good but wait until you find out what that actually means how that would actually affect your life and the the bigger role the government would play in business and in your lives where does that come down juan williams political analyst well i think obviously for republicans they point to venezuela and say look at that look at the chaos look at things falling apart you young people don apost understand but the numbers the polls you referred to chris are pretty overwhelming it aposs 51 percent of people under 30 say yes to socialism americans and remember you have 70 percent of all americans who say yes to medicare for all right and at the same time you have like 70 percent in the fox poll who say that we should have higher marginal tax rates on people who earn more than 10 million i think it aposs 65 percent people who earn just more than a million so you could label this as socialism but to lots of people at a time of income inequality rising income inequality where 1 percent of americans the very richest 1 percent control 40 percent of all the wealth in the country you can understand what young people especially those with high college tuition debt who know about the high cost of medicare may not have health insurance are saying we need to change the structure of this economy to respond to our needs wallace so rich if all of that is true and at least according to the polls that aposs what people feel now why do republicans think this is such a good issue for them lowry because when you get down to the details i i think this is an eminently winnable debate for republicans and it aposs not just young people there aposs a gallup poll showing a majority of democrats feel warmer towards socialism than they do towards capitalism but going back to the green new deal this thing would be more costly the interstate highway system more costly than the apollo moon program more costly even than the new deal it will cost tens of trillions of dollars and you get down to the details of that case it aposs one that aposs eminently winnable for republicans wallace all right we have to take a break here panel when we come back growing scandals in virginia lead to calls for the top three state officials all to step down and now the lieutenant governor is accused of sexual assault by a second woman and what do you want to ask the panel about jeff bezos accusing the national enquirer of blackmail just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump he wants political influence so that amazon will benefit from it that aposs not right and believe me if i become president oh do they have problems they aposre going to have such problems end video clip wallace well that aposs donald trump on the campaign trail well back in 2016 going after amazon founder jeff bezos for buying the washington post this week bezos accused the national enquirer of trying to blackmail him threatening to publish explicit photos if he didn apost back off investigating the tabloid and we aposre back now with the panel all right juan let me start with you did the enquirer try to blackmail bezos one and two should federal prosecutors in new york who had a cooperation agreement with the enquirer aposs parent company ami for their role in paying hush money to at least one woman who claims to have had an affair with president trump should they drop their agreement and go after the enquirer williams well on the first point jeff bezos writing in medium not the washington post and puts out this statement in which he releases e mails that have bright dots connecting a demand from a representative of the national enquirer for him to drop the charge that there aposs anything political about their story on him and his alleged mistress in exchange for killing salacious photos terrible photos of him wallace so is that blackmail williams i think that aposs you know a prima facie case of what looked like blackmail i aposll leave that to the prosecutors but the prosecutors do have a right here to look and especially given what you described which is that there aposs a previous deal between the prosecutors and ami the national enquirer aposs holding company that says they are not to engage in this type of behavior and again this is linked to the parents of karen mcdougall wallace right williams catching and kill where the enquirer would get the story and kill it kill unflattering stories about president trump wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on the whole bezos controversy with the enquirer lynn latta tweeted this why would ami again the parent company of the national enquirer why would ami be so dumb i think it aposs a pretty good question as to send a letter describing images and threaten to publish them michael how do you answer lynn and how do you answer the controversy and we saw a case of it there and and the tweet that i played that i read to mick mulvaney where the president and the enquirer have kind of been together on a lot of these things anton the question is how could they be so dumb it aposs because this is in a way their business model they aposve done it before and it aposs worked before they get salacious material they go to the source and they say hey work with us and maybe we aposll get you out of this you do a cover story in another one of our magazines we aposll kill your story in this magazine so this is what they aposve been doing for years and i note it aposs always useful when reading a story about bezos or the washington post to read what the new york times says what the competition says the new york times reports that some of bezos apos own lawyers the people that he aposs hired to help him in this controversy have actually negotiated such deals on behalf of others in the past so i think the national enquirer just thought it was doing what it always did that aposs what it looks like to me wallace and do you think it aposs wrong anton i listen it aposs a sleazy tabloid it always has been it aposs not something i aposve ever read but this is their wallace well maybe at the checkout counter but anton this is their this is this is their this is their bread and butter is to post salacious stories about about prominent ph figures and the world aposs richest man is a prominent figure he aposs newsworthy for that reason i don apost believe the bezos line that this is in any way politically motivated i don apost think it would matter what his politics were a supermarket tabloid if it gets wind of an affair by the world aposs richest man that aposs their bread and butter and they aposre going to run with it wallace all right let aposs turn to the other big story this week and that is that all three top officials state officials in virginia are are in trouble governor northam who admits that he wore blackface back in the apos80s now says that he will not resign but lieutenant governor justin fairfax faces a second woman who says that he sexually assaulted her back when they were both in college which is leading to calls for impeachment take a look begin video clip patrick hope d virginia house of delegates he needs to resign immediately should the lieutenant governor fail to do so on monday i intend to introduce articles of impeachment on lieutenant governor justin fairfax end video clip wallace congresswoman edwards what do you make of all this and of at this point the fact that that northam fairfax and also the attorney general mark herring who also has admitted that he wore blackface back when he was in college that they aposre all refusing to resign edwards well they aposre refusing to resign but i think they ought to i mean virginia needs a restart wallace you think all three should edwards i i really do and i think virginia needs a restart i mean they need to figure out the timing of which one resigns because you want to uphold the will of the voters that democrats are you know in control of the of the state but at the same time wallace let can i just interrupt for a second because if they all resigned at the same time edwards right wallace then the governor would be the speaker of the house who aposs a republican so you aposre saying edwards that aposs why i say timing is really important wallace but there has to be a process for that and look you know i aposm basically the same age as these guys and so i aposm wondering why it is that it was ok even at 19 or 24 or you know 59 to do this kind of thing and i think that virginia can apost tolerate it the nation can apost and frankly democrats can apost tolerate it we can apost have one standard for steve king and another standard for ralph northam wallace and and and what about the argument look in in the case of northam and herring they both admitted that they did it so there aposs no real due process you can argue whether it aposs it should it aposs disqualifying or not in the case of fairfax he denies that he had these incidents these sexual assaults of these women what about due process for him edwards well i mean look i think there aposs always a tricky balance of due process and frankly that process might come through in an impeachment hearing where you know these women who both have said that they want to come forward and tell their stories and when i look at the statements of both women it it aposs very persuasive and so i think that justin fairfax has a problem at the same time you know you look at northam it aposs amazing that the blackface incident will get a pass and they would continue to hold office while the guy who aposs alleged with sexual assault the black guy is gone i think the entire thing is untenable and we cannot be in a position i think as democrats of that kind of hypocrisy and so it aposs really important to right it and again i believe that there is a structured way that that can happen so that you still maintain the politics and the will of the voters but you have a clean slate wallace rich lowry it just seems obvious to me the alleged offense in the case of justin fairfax is much more serious than what northam and herring have confessed to which is dumb and offensive acts 30 or 40 years ago that weren apost crimes that didn apost involve subjecting someone to a coercive act now i do believe there should be an element of due process here even though the allegations now are much more serious than what blasey ford alleged of brett kavanaugh because her allegation was vague there was absolutely no contemporaneous corroboration of it this is much more serious but still he deserve some sort of hearing there should be some sort of fact finding the question is what would that look like and it aposs probably going to have to be in an impeachment inquiry wallace you kind of were shaking her head at at at rich why edwards well i was because it was very dismissive of the allegations of dr ford against brett kavanaugh and i think that she was very credible the fact that he ended up on the supreme court well go figure that aposs politics but i don apost want to dismiss her as you know as a victim and survivor and at the same time not dismiss the doctor tyson i guess it is wallace yes edwards and and ms watson lowry but there aposs there aposs no edwards and and and wallace let me just because i aposve got 20 seconds go lowry there aposs no evidence that blasey ford and kavanaugh ever even met each other with in the case of vanessa tyson they were they were in the same room their they actually edwards except her word lowry there was a sexual act involved wallace all right lowry so this he aposs he aposs in a much tougher place fairfax than kavanaugh ever was wallace no he aposs in a tough place thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week her journey from a survivalist family to the heights of academia has been a best seller for a year you aposll meet her when we come right back commercial break wallace as of today it aposs been on the new york times bestseller list for 49 weeks and no it aposs not a spy thriller or a trump tell all here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape tara westover author educated i could not continue to have my family and my life and and be in any way respectful of myself wallace tara westover is describing her journey the story she tells an educated which has been on the bestseller list for almost a year westover i think people want to believe that they can change wallace it aposs a remarkable but painful account that has captivated hundreds of thousands of readers tara grew up in bucks peak idaho one of seven children their dad was a mormon survivalist who believed the government had been taken over by an evil organization wallace on camera you never went to grade school or high school why not westover he thought if we went to school that we would be brainwashed wallace what aposs your birthday westover i don apost know my birthday wallace voice over tara describes a break when she was 16 her father wouldn apost let them see doctors but after her brother was in a bad accident she disobeyed her dad and took her brother to a hospital westover i could tell i was going in one direction and he was going in the other direction and it was not clear to me how the relationship was going to survive wallace the next year she began her formal education passing an exam and attending brigham young university westover i was pretty wildly unprepared one of my first lectures that i that i went to i raised my hand and asked the lecturer what the holocaust was i i just never heard of it before wallace but with the help of some female classmates and a fierce drive to learn tara thrived westover i think for for some of us having not had access to education when we finally got it for me anyway there was a kind of obsessive quality for that and i you know i wasn apost going to stop until i kind of run out of road wallace tara got a fellowship to harvard and ended up with a phd from cambridge university in england but it wasn apost easy breaking away from bucks peak wallace on camera at one point in the book you describe yourself as an ignorant girl who crawled out of the scrap heap did you really think of yourself that way westover i think i thought of myself that way and worse wallace voice over her family said her academic success came at the expense of her soul westover that tension for a lot of years between this idea of myself as this expletive and my ideal of myself as a scholar was very difficult to reconcile wallace and that led tara to the final chapter of being educated westover for me i ended up discovering for myself that i could love my family and still choose to say goodbye to them wallace on camera when was the last time you talk to your mom or dad westover the last time i saw my mother it aposs probably been about a year and a half since i saw her for maybe five minutes and since i saw her for a real amount of time four or five years wallace voice over tara hopes her story helps other people estranged from family understand they aposre not alone westover i remember thinking to myself i don apost know how i can believe that i aposm a good person when i know that my mother doesn apost think i aposm a good person for me it aposs about saying this is not a good option this is not a nice thing to have happen but i do think there aposs a way to be at peace with it en
