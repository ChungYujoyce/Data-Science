presidential candidates last week because govs gary johnson and william weld respect limits on presidential power sunday when fox s chris wallace challenged johnson s plan to replace the irs with a consumption tax johnson pointed out that he s not getting elected dictator or king wallace suggested that means don t take my policies seriously because they won t get through i disagree it means that johnson understands that america is a constitutional republic and there are and ought to be checks on what presidents can do in response to wallace s comment about johnson not taking his promises seriously johnson said take them very seriously count on certainty that we re always going to support taxes going lower being in business being easier rules and regulations not getting worse johnson and weld hold clear positions unlike aspiring dictators donald trump and hillary clinton clinton changes positions from year to year praising trade deals then condemning them condemning gay marriage then praising it then scolding anyone who doesn t share her new position trump changes positions even faster sometimes day to day after saying he ll deport millions of immigrants now he says he won t if they pay taxes and fill out paperwork roughly the same position jeb bush and marco rubio held when trump trashed them libertarians don t shift to fit the whims of the day because we have core principles one is on most every issue less government involvement is better government doesn t create jobs said johnson when a young woman asked what johnson and weld would do about jobs the libertarians said jobs get created when government gets out of the way imposing only a few clear and predictable rules while trump makes vague promises about making government great and clinton about making it fair johnson and weld talk about getting rid of as much of it as they can there are constitutional limits to that said johnson but if you were to wave a magic wand there are a number of departments that come up commerce housing and urban development education homeland security unlike trump and clinton johnson specifies cuts and he s willing to go after sacred cows such as defense spending you can t balance the federal budget something we re promising to do in the first 100 days you can t do that without cutting military spending the brac commission set up by the pentagon says that we ve got to eliminate 20 percent of those bases but that hasn t happened where markets thrive people thrive weld understands that when the gis returned from world war ii they had two sets of needs education and health care he says education was handled through the gi bill which was essentially a voucher system you could go wherever you wanted the most successful program in domestic political history of the 20th century health care was the opposite approach command and control one size fits all the government is going to do this the gi bill vouchers allowed soldiers to enroll at a school they chose but for health care they must wait in long lines at government run veterans hospitals sometimes dying for lack of adequate care applying these free market lessons across a range of policies johnson and weld would roll back the drug war decrease our involvement in foreign wars and give individuals more control over how their social security funds are invested when an audience member suggested that voting for a third party is a wasted vote weld replied we re fiscally responsible we re socially inclusive and tolerant but if you agree with us and you want to go waste your vote on trump or clinton be our guest we re libertarians johnson and weld don t promise they can get rid of the washington leviathan overnight but taking a few steps closer to liberty sounds like a good start to me it s a lot better than the path the two major parties want us to take copyright 2016 by jfs productions inc advertisement next donald trump to meet with president of mexico john

report abuses trump s speech tonight about black violence was a blatant veiled call to genocide you could hear it in the cheers i mean seriously since when do low educated middle age white men get so excited about reducing crime in the inner cities and improving educational opportunities for black kids i only wonder if the black people who support trump are delusional or if they think they will get appointed as work camp stazis and oh glad to hear johnson doesn t want to be king dishonest virtue signaling as usual go away my friend just told me about this easiest method of earning money from home i ve just tried it and now i am making 12500 per month without spending too much time you can also learn about this trick by the link below visit more this site http goo gl j42naq that book isn t going to magically finish itself fuckface why wouldn t small business owners or people who want the economy to grow want inner city black kids to succeed isn t every successful business an employer and don t we need to see the number of business births go up in order to get above 2 growth plus most middle class white folks think everyone deserves a fair shake and that democrats have deliberately kept black people oppressed as a voting mechanism plus if there are good inner city schools then the suburban schools have to innovate and improve to keep up with the inner city schools quality clinton changes positions from year to year praising trade deals then condemning them condemning gay marriage then praising it then scolding anyone who doesn t share her new position trump changes positions even faster sometimes day to day after saying he ll deport millions of immigrants now he says he won t if they pay taxes and fill out paperwork clinton is triangulating based on polls it s called pandering trump is negotiating he lays out a direction he wants to go with an extreme position and expects to come to a compromise with congress etc it s amazing that so few people understand trump s methods read his book or take a negotiation course or spend a few months with a ceo of a startup stossel makes a good philosophical case for johnson he lays out a direction he wants to go with an extreme position and expects to come to a compromise if you re a businessman or a union leader that s a good strategy but it s unacceptably dangerous for a president of the u s ceos don t have armies and nukes a good president must always assume he ll be taken seriously and not take the risk that others won t understand he s playing a game presidents bluff threaten and saber rattle all the time trump is merely less reserved less dedicated to diplomatic lingo why do you think it s called a bully pulpit presidents bluff threaten and saber rattle all the time they do sometimes and it s almost always a stupid idea trump is merely less reserved that is comic understatement trump would be a dangerous loose cannon in the white house if elected the power elite would have to remove him like they did kennedy another mentally unstable president who courted disaster by bluffing and saber rattling why do you think it s called a bully pulpit you misunderstand the meaning of bully in that context i think a modern tr would call it an awesome pulpit tr and barney stinson would be bffs red line does your name mean you only have 1 cled only one ocle he lays out a direction he wants to go with an extreme position and expects to come to a compromise if you re a businessman or a union leader that s a good strategy but it s unacceptably dangerous for a president of the u s ceos don t have armies and nukes a good president must always assume he ll be taken seriously and not take the risk that others won t understand he s playing a game you re completely wrong the best presidents are natural born poker players predictability is one of the worst traits one can have especially in insane times like these this is pretty much exactly how ronald reagan achieved major arms reductions with the soviet union while at the same time laying the groundwork for its collapse most of his advisors were like you by the way thankfully he usually didn t listen to them but to his own instincts instead i was a reagan republican before i discovered the lp he didn t bluster he didn t threaten he simply stated what he intended to do within the limits of what he could do and then proceeded to start doing it that s why gorbachev had to believe him he spent the ussr into the ground unfortunately in order to get that spending he agreed to a lot more spending on other things to get it yep when reagan said tear down this wall it wasn t an extreme position from which to compromise it was his sincere intention to make it happen and he believed it was achievable we start bombing in five minutes wasn t extreme either fyiyctaj fuck you if you oh it s been taken care of nevermind we start bombing in five minutes wasn t extreme either count on certainty that we re always going to support taxes going lower being in business being easier rules and regulations not getting worse ok but in the nazi gay cake situation johnson is on record as wanting to make rules and regulations on business worse currently businesses don t have to make nazi gay cakes but johnson suggests that they should be compelled to do so it would be one thing for him to say as his apologists do in general i want to relax regulations on business except where it comes to nazi cakes and in that situation i m simply extending the logic of the antidiscrimination laws then the voters could decide whether to take him seriously about how he wants to relax regulations on businesses except in just this one minor area but when he simply makes the broad statement that he wants to relax regulations and doesn t try to explain how this is consistent with his nazi cakes views then it makes me wonder what other implied exceptions he s going to make to his anti regulation principles and if his cultural leftism is so strong that he can t even stand up for small businesses against an unnecessary expansion of the public accommodations laws combined with an attack on religious freedom then how will he be able to stand up against a big spending congress sending him all sorts of left wing spending and regulatory bills currently businesses don t have to make nazi gay cakes correction in many states they do have to make gay cakes nazi cakes not so much and whether they should be compelled to make gay cakes under federal law is still an unsettled and much debated question to me freedom of association means choosing who my friends are who i invite to my house who i go out to dinner or a concert with etc who to serve in a store not so much when it s about someone walking up to a counter and expecting to be served in the same manner as others public accommodation laws do make sense they should apply to stores and generally to businesses which hold themselves out as serving the public not to people doing jobs privately by word of mouth or distributing business cards as in one publicized case involving wedding photography an extreme case of where such laws are needed was mentioned in a post here a few days ago about a black person asking if in a libertarian world a private hospital could turn her away if she was injured simply because she was black told that yes it potentially could she decided she had no further interest in libertarianism in fact it may make sense to get rid of what seems to be an ever growing list of specific reasons why businesses can t discriminate and instead say they can t discriminate for any reason except ones that meet specific tests as being bona fide btw i notice that johnson s actual statement was he will always oppose increasing regulations on business not that he will always support relaxing them a subtle difference perhaps made with that nazi cake controversy in mind ok but this is about whether johnson supports being in business being easier rules and regulations not getting worse racial discrimination has been illegal for some time so by promising not to make rules and regulations worse johnson isn t necessarily promising to legalize racial discrimination but with nazi gay cakes he is calling for regulations to be getting worse so shouldn t he be more specific in his statements i support rules and regulations not getting worse except public accomodations laws which should of course be stricter the original federal civil rights act did in fact spell out in some detail what types of businesses are public accommodations subject to the law and which were not the extension of anti discrimination rules to virtually all types of businesses happened largely as a result of state civil rights laws expanding their scope sorry but the issue is not whether or not you should be able to refuse service to gays that is one of my biggest disagreements with him but i ll gladly support someone i agree with 90 on over someone i only agree with 20 on we ll argue that last 10 when we get closer there are some non dictatorial things a president johnson johnson iii can do without being a dictator he can use his veto to force congress to make at least some cuts in the budget by laying down reasonable goals and vetoing overspending then putting congress in the wrong if it overrides him and an override would require some bipartisan cooperation in the face of a public rebuke that they re spending too much he can certainly continue and extend obama s pardon record and he can turn to good advantage one of the worst features of the administrative state administrative discretion he and his appointees can use the flexibility congress gives them to make regulations a bit less onerous even if he can t discard them all in one fell swoop he can certainly continue and extend obama s pardon record he has a good record for commuting sentences not for pardons actually a poor record on pardons big difference pardons clear your record commutations do not ex felons have poor job prospects see cato s podcasts for details correction duly noted thank you awesome content now you can easily install ifile for ios and have an awesome user interface thanks for sharing ummmm this is the same johnson who totally supports expansive executive orders when congress refuses to act whatever the hell that means as it s congress s prerogative to do whatever it wants without direction from the executive he said that in this very magazine i have not heard johnson talk once about restricting executive authority civil liberties or foreign policy other than saying he would totally be restrained while saying the war in kosovo was justified in the same breath i know that reason is to the libertarian party what the washington post is to the democratic party pravda but now you re just making up shit nor have i heard him talk about privatizing light houses or ending social security tomorrow or abolishing the u s patent office or any number of other fringy libertarian proposals nor have any of my friends who might want to vote libertarian to protest the utter embarrassment of the two major candidates heard word one about nazi cakes because that s only an issue with a handful of libertarians for whom truth be known could in good conscience only vote for their pure selves i guess i didn t realize that civil liberties a restrained executive and opposition to foreign adventurism were fringe issues i guess the libertarian party just stands for annoying conservatives and groveling to leftists thanks for explaining i ll be sure to never vote for any of them it would probably be more accurate to just admit that you re never going to vote ever that isn t a judgment it s just a fact i m pretty sure that s exactly what creech was pointing out if there were a libertarian candidate i would have voted for them i m not really drawn to a democrat lite candidate like gary johnson he does nothing to further liberty he s just a squishy moderate it s funny that both president bush and president obama also made the remark that they weren t elected to be dictators or kings yet both men drastically expanded the power of the presidency the biggest power a president holds outside of being the commander in chief is his pen when it s used to veto legislation and his eraser when it s used to rescind previous executive orders memos administrative advisories but for health care they must wait in long lines at government run veterans hospitals sometimes dying for lack of adequate care this is what they call a self correcting issue if they die they aren t collecting g i benefits re neither dictator nor king it is indeed a tragedy this country does not have a king or a dictator dictator preferred one can only speculate the amount of overwhelming joy lost knowing we will be ruled by a true sociopath like hitler stalin or castro i am sure we all weep on our pillows softly at night knowing there is no one out there that can put us into a gulag where we all have the opportunity to be beaten starved and shot how many times do we daydream about having a secret police knocking our doors down in the wee hours of the morn how many times do we all wish we didn t have to go through the painful and confusing process of thinking for ourselves how many sleepless nights have we lost knowing that we have not been properly re educated into the wise and benevolent diktats of the enlightened dictator that has shown so much compassion and kindness to oppress and enslave us all how often did we look into each other eyes and secretly tell one another that we don t want grocery stores cars tvs sports but just wanted to be rationed food clothing etc how many times did we ache for the whip to strike our backs to correctly obey our dictator s orders all too often i know i am only saying what we are all thinking and that is to truly be free and enjoy the happiness brought by a dictator we all must submit ourselves to just one wise cruel and sadistic asshole that is willing to enslave us all a benevolent dictatorship is by far the best form of government except for that absolute power corrupts
