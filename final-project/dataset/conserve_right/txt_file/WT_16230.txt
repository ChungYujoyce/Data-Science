apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic sri lanka s presidential election earlier this month dealt china a major blow as opposition leader maithripala sirisena who had made curtailing excessive chinese influence the main focus of his campaign won a surprise victory over the beijing friendly incumbent president mahinda rajapaksa the global times china s leading international politics and security newspaper published a somber editorial on jan 20 bemoaning the sri lankan result the editorial draws a parallel to china s overly eager investment in myanmar in the past only to see those projects rejected curtailed or canceled by a newly elected anti china leader the risk we are facing in today s sri lanka once again should remind us that we should have placed several more layers of insurance on some countries political uncertainty the global times editorial stated even though it s easier said than done in this regard top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time china has eyed the indian ocean nation over the past decade as the key link connecting and commanding some major maritime and strategic choke points of the world including one of the most crucial sea lanes of communication that passes through the country as a result china has lavishly spent on sri lanka especially its military and the nation s infrastructure culminating in june 2012 when beijing surprised the world by announcing a whopping 50 billion plan to rebuild sri lanka s key military and civilian infrastructure over the next 10 to 15 years in particular china spent billions to build the deep sea ports of hambantota and colombo which allowed the chinese nuclear and conventional powered submarines to dock last year prompting security alarms from new delhi and tokyo to washington however sri lanka s overreliance on china and china s dominant role in sri lanka s economy and government have backfired among voters the pro beijing incumbent mr rajapaksa was soundly defeated by the more skeptical mr sirisena with a 51 28 percent versus 47 58 percent of all votes mr sirisena has vowed to balance the nation s relationship with all friendly nations especially india pakistan and japan and not just focus on china he has also vowed to stop several key chinese operated projects immediately including the 1 4 billion project to modernize the port of colombo mr sirisena s approach has not been taken lightly by beijing and the agony of defeat is palpable in state controlled media outlets which rarely admits any faux pas of china s international diplomacy china is obviously lagging behind in securing insurances against political precariousness in targeted foreign countries during the process of china s global outreach campaign said the beijing based global times our comprehensive diplomatic strength does not match the demand for dealing with composite risks overseas china s global outreach is destined to encounter risks and sometimes these risks make us sweat in fear it seems that money alone really can t buy friends general likely corruption target dies gen zhang wannian the most powerful chinese people s liberation army officer between 1995 and 2003 as the vice chairman of the chinese communist party s central military commission died on jan 14 at the age of 87 gen zhang was a pivotal figure in some of the most important military affairs under general secretary jiang zemin in 1997 gen zhang was the only senior military representative at the 1997 hong kong handover ceremony but he was mostly remembered for advocating for and conducting a missile exercise to intimidate taiwanese voters in march 1996 in the island democracy s first ever direct presidential election in response the u s government dispatched two nuclear powered aircraft carriers to the waters off taiwan to deter further military intimidation gen zhang was known as mr jiang s loyal henchman inside the communist party politburo he was reported to have engineered a semicoup in the inner sanctum of the party to allow mr jiang to retain his control over the pla for two more years after mr jiang s handover of power to successor hu jintao that move by gen zhang was deeply resented by mr hu and reportedly also by xi jinping china s current supreme leader some analysts believe that mr xi s current anti corruption campaign inside the pla initially targeted gen zhang whose most influential protege inside the pla was lt gen gu junshan the very first corrupt senior military official dubbed by mr xi as tiger to fall under the sweeping anti graft campaign gen gu began his meteoric rise in 2001 and was promoted by gen zhang to run the pla s lucrative base and barracks construction department when gen gu published a self glorifying autobiography gen zhang wrote a maudlin preface however gen gu was purged two years ago by mr xi as the moneyman in the pla who had bribed many key army leaders during mr hu s reign including the recently purged former cmc vice chairman gen xu caihou some military analysts believe that if zhang wannian had not died he would certainly become the next fallen tiger under mr xi s binge of purges inside the pla miles yu s column appears
