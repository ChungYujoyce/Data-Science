apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap president donald trump is pitching a medicine for covid 19 sufferers that science has not concluded is effective or safe for their use take it he said of the drug for people sick with the coronavirus he said sunday it can help them but it s not going to hurt them in fact it may or may not help some people and it may or may not hurt them his straight ahead advocacy of hydroxychloroquine a malaria drug is the latest and one of the most consequential examples of trump and public health authorities not being on the same page in the pandemic top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hogan says maryland can begin testing residents for covid 19 without appointment symptoms his statement came during a weekend when he also misrepresented the facts behind his firing of the intelligence community s inspector general whose handling of a whistleblower complaint led to impeachment proceedings over the previous days he d spread a number of distortions on the pandemic a look at his recent remarks malaria drug trump on the government s decision to stockpile millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine drug to make it available for patients with covid 19 what do you have to lose i ll say it again what do you have to lose take it i really think they should take it but it s their choice and it s their doctor s choice or the doctors in the hospital but hydroxychloroquine try it if you d like news briefing saturday trump they say taking it before the fact is good i m not acting as a doctor i m saying do what you want it can help them but it s not going to hurt them briefing sunday night the facts he s making unverified claims about a drug that can have serious side effects and may not work the drug has not been approved as a treatment for covid 19 and trump s own health experts say more studies are needed to know whether it s safe and effective to use the president has been talking up hydroxychloroquine a drug long used to treat malaria rheumatoid arthritis and lupus after very small preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner doctors can already prescribe the malaria drug to patients with covid 19 a practice known as off label prescribing research studies are now beginning to test if the drugs truly help covid 19 patients and the food and drug administration has allowed the drugs into the national stockpile as an option for doctors to consider for patients who cannot get into one of the studies but the drug has major potential side effects especially for the heart and large studies are underway to see if it is safe and effective for treating coronavirus the fda says people should not take it without a prescription and emphasizes that the malaria drugs being explored are not fda approved for treatment of covid 19 on friday dr anthony fauci of the national institutes of health and a member of the white house coronavirus task force said americans shouldn t consider hydroxychloroquine a knockout drug we still need to do the definitive studies to determine whether any intervention not just this one is truly safe and effective he said on fox news the american medical association the american pharmacists association and the american society of health system pharmacists in a joint statement previously cautioned against prophylactically prescribing medications currently identified as potential treatments for covid 19 that means prescribing a medicine for the purpose of warding off a disease or preventing its spread spanish flu trump the problem is when something like this comes along which you don t expect look 1917 it s a long time ago perhaps 100 million people died it s a long time ago so people don t think it s going to happen briefing sunday night the facts he got the year wrong for the spanish flu and appeared to overstate deaths from it the pandemic spread from early 1918 to late 1920 it killed an estimated 50 million or more worldwide with about 675 000 of the deaths in the u s says the centers for disease control and prevention impeachment trump on firing michael atkinson the intelligence community inspector general i thought he did a terrible job absolutely terrible he took a whistleblower report which turned out to be a fake report it was fake it was totally wrong news briefing saturday the facts no the whistleblower s accusations have not been shown to be wrong key details have been corroborated for example the white house account of trump s july 25 2019 phone call with ukraine s new president showed that the whistleblower had accurately summarized the conversation as relayed by unidentified u s officials in the complaint atkinson sent to the acting director of national intelligence witnesses who heard the call testified to the accuracy of that account trump suggesting that atkinson had claimed that the whistleblower complaint regarding ukraine should be discounted because of political bias he even said it was politically biased he actually said that news briefing saturday the facts he actually did not say that atkinson did not state that the complaint was politically biased or suggest that it should not be regarded seriously to the contrary atkinson wrote in a letter to joseph maguire then the acting director of national intelligence that any potential bias on the whistleblower s part did not take away from his overall conclusion that the complaint was credible he noted that an initial review by his inspector general s office had found support for key allegations in the complaint including that trump had put pressure on ukraine s leader to take action favorable to his re election campaign the virus threat trump on a warning that had just been delivered by dr deborah birx of the coronavirus task force that more americans need to heed distancing steps ordered by many states and recommended by washington she wasn t referring to our country she was referring to one state briefing thursday the facts no she was talking about more americans overall needing to keep away from each other more specifically birx said the outbreak would not be spreading by now in areas with low infection rates if everyone were following the guidelines instead officials are now seeing cases of people who were infected after the guidelines took effect this should not be happening any longer in new places if people are doing the social distancing washing their hands not getting together in large groups more than 10 she said at the briefing where trump then tried to tamp down her warning out of his concern about the headlines tomorrow birx said we see spain we see italy we see france we see germany when we see others beginning to bend their curves we can bend ours but it means everybody has to take that same responsibility as americans bending the curve means flattening out the rate of increase in cases she added yes there are states that are dead flat but you know every what changes the curve is a new detroit a new chicago a new new orleans a new colorado trump four weeks ago we had the greatest economy in the history of the world the greatest in the world greatest in the history of the world briefing thursday the facts not true the economy was healthy back then but not the best in u s history much less world history economic gains largely followed along the lines of an expansion that started more than a decade ago under president barack obama and while posting great job and stock market numbers trump never managed to achieve the rates of economic growth he promised in the 2016 campaign the u s economy was not the world s best in history when this started trump going back to that period four weeks ago and then one day i get a call from deborah who s fantastic and from dr fauci and he said and she said we have a problem i said what s the problem and they said we may have to close it up i said close what up they said close up the country and i said what s that all about briefing thursday the facts you d think that trump was just learning about the outbreak from birx and dr anthony fauci of the national institutes of health in the phone call that s not the case trump knew the u s had a problem well before that timeline of roughly early march by then the u s had restricted travel from abroad experienced its first coronavirus infections and was told to expect the outbreak to spread in the country the world health organization declared a global health emergency jan 30 vice president mike pence i don t believe the president has ever belittled the threat of the coronavirus cnn interview wednesday mitch mcconnell senate majority leader the coronavirus crisis came up while we were tied down in the impeachment trial and i think it diverted the attention of the government because everything every day was all about impeachment interview tuesday with radio host hugh hewitt the facts while pence claims trump always treated the virus threat seriously mcconnell suggests trump may not have because he was distracted by impeachment neither claim is credible trump says he would not have done anything faster on the virus absent impeachment and he actually belittled the coronavirus threat repeatedly from january to mid march maintaining his position even after the senate acquitted him feb 5 in his impeachment trial he dismissed the threat as a small number of u s cases that were under control and would fall to zero by april on feb 10 he asserted we re in great shape we have 12 cases and told fox business it will be fine because in april supposedly it dies with the hotter weather and that s a beautiful date to look forward to when you have 15 people and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero that s a pretty good job we ve done he said feb 26 a day later he said it s going to disappear one day it s like a miracle it will disappear it s got the world aflutter but it ll work out trump told the national association of counties on march 3 along the way he said democrats who were calling on him to do more were perpetuating a hoax on march 9 he tweeted the 546 cases and 22 deaths experienced by then in the u s were no reason to take drastic steps nothing is shut down life the economy go on trump now acknowledges the u s could see 100 000 to 240 000 deaths from the pandemic even if current distancing guidelines are maintained when asked tuesday if impeachment proceedings had distracted him from the u s coronavirus response he said i don t think i would have acted any differently or i don t think i would have acted any faster social media trump i have you know hundreds of millions of people number one on facebook did you know i was number one on facebook i mean i just found out i m number one on facebook i thought that was very nice for whatever it means news briefing wednesday the facts it doesn t mean anything because it s not true he s nowhere close to no 1 trump has 29 million followers on facebook far below former president barack obama who has 54 million cristiano ronaldo the portuguese soccer player has 126 million travel restrictions trump i stopped some very very infected very very sick people thousands coming in from china long earlier than anybody thought including the experts nobody thought we should do it except me and i stopped everybody we stopped it cold interview march 30 with fox friends pence the president suspended all travel from china in january interview wednesday with cnn the facts trump didn t stop cold all the people infected with coronavirus from entering the u s with a ban of all travel from china there were gaps in containment and initial delays in testing leading to the u s rising to no 1 globally in the number of people infected by covid 19 nor did trump decide on his own to impose travel restrictions on china he followed a consensus recommendation by his public health advisers his order in late january temporarily barred entry by foreign nationals who had traveled in china within the previous 14 days with exceptions for the immediate family of u s citizens and permanent residents americans returning from china were allowed back for two more weeks they were given enhanced screenings but screenings can miss people who are carrying the virus but showing no symptoms mortality trump so we have more cases than anybody but we re doing really well and we also have a very low relative to other countries very low mortality rate and there are reasons for that interview march 30 with fox friends trump we ve been doing more test tests than any other country anywhere in the world it s one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries because we ve been testing it s also one of the reasons that we re just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate news briefing on march 29 the facts his suggestion that the u s response is better than other countries because its mortality rate is just about the lowest is unsupported and misleading it s too early to know the real death rate from covid 19 in any country look at a count kept by johns hopkins university and you can divide the number of reported cases by the number of recorded deaths but that math provides a completely unreliable measurement of death rates and the johns hopkins tally is not intended to be that first the count changes every day as new infections and deaths are recorded more important every country is testing differently knowing the real denominator the true number of people who become infected is key to determining what portion of them die some countries the u s among them have had trouble making enough tests available when there s a shortage of tests the sickest get tested first and even with a good supply of tests someone who s otherwise healthy and has mild symptoms may not be tested and thus go uncounted the result is a hodgepodge of numbers that get sorted out as the crisis diminishes indeed initial death rates were thought to be as high as 4 in parts of china but a report published monday in the lancet infectious diseases calculated that 1 38 actually is the best estimate of deaths among confirmed cases across china and that accounting for unconfirmed cases could drop that rate below 1 early on fauci estimated that the death rate in the u s might hit around 1 which would be 10 times higher than mortality from a typical flu season associated press writers darlene superville lauran neergaard and matthew perrone in washington alan
