protests in iran and whether we aposre closer to war with north korea then fire and fury hits washington with bombshell allegations and steve bannon aposs attacks on the trump family leave the president to distance himself from his former top advisor trump i don apost talk to him i don apost talk to him that aposs just a misnomer wallace we aposll sit down with mr trump aposs first campaign manager corey lewandowski who continues to be a close advisor to the president it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive plus new reports the fbi is investigating the clinton foundation and that mr trump tried to head off the russia probe trump everything that i aposve done is 100 percent proper that aposs what i do is i do things proper wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel which side is in more legal jeopardy and our power player of the week getting to know the nation aposs doctor unidentified male for my entire life i aposve tried to use the gift that god gave me to improve health wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington president trump and republican leaders met at camp david this weekend to plan their legislative agenda for 2018 but that was overshadowed by a new book about the president that report some of his top advisors don apost think he aposs up to the job coming up we aposll get reaction from corey lewandowski mr trump aposs first campaign manager who remains in close touch with him but first cia director mike pompeo who briefs the president on the nation aposs most pressing intelligence matters director pompeo welcome back to fox news sunday mike pompeo cia director great to be with you chris good morning wallace let aposs start with the book the author michael wolff reports that almost everybody on the president aposs team in his cabinet questioned whether the president has the mental and emotional fitness to be the commander in chief here he is begin video clip wolff they say he aposs a moron an idiot this man does not read does not listen so he aposs like a like a pinball just shooting off the side end video clip wallace as cia director you give the president aposs daily intelligence brief almost every morning what do you see pompeo yes those statements are just absurd chris i mean just pure fantasy my personal experience i was with the president yesterday at camp david i aposm with him almost every day when we talk about some of the most serious matters facing america and the world complex issues the president is engaged he understands the complexity he asks really difficult questions of our team at the cia so that we can provide him the information that he needs to make good informed policy decisions and i watched him do that i watched him take the information that the intelligence community delivers and translate that into policies that are of enormous benefit to america statements like the one mr wolff made about how we all think about the president are just ridiculous on their face they are frankly beneath the conversation this morning chris wallace well but it is the conversation so i aposm going to pompeo only because you made it so sir wallace well no i understand that well i didn apost make it michael wolff did and the country and to a certain degree the president has by responding to it so directly fitness to be president pompeo completely fit i mean i paused only because it aposs just a ludicrous question right these are from people who just have not yet accepted the fact that president trump is the united states president and i aposm sorry for them in that we aposre going to move on with our mission at cia we are incredibly focused on keeping americans safe and things like this book frankly are just passing moments in history we aposll get on we aposll do the people aposs work and american will appreciate the good work that we do wallace i want to press on a couple of more points i promise we aposll then get on to your day job the author quotes an email that was supposedly representative of the view of one of the president aposs top economic advisors gary cohn i aposm going to put it up on the screen trump won apost read anything not one page memos not the brief policy papers nothing he gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored now back in may you were quoted as saying that one of the ways you keep the president engaged in your intelligence briefings is with quote your words killer graphics pompeo yes absolutely i love color graphics so do you chris you use them on your screen all the time here on the show right it aposs how you convey information this president reads material that we provide to him he listens closely to his daily briefing different presidents the previous president didn apost receive his briefing in that same way he didn apost take up daily briefing from his cia director president obama chose not to do that this president is an avid consumer of the work product that our team at the cia produces and we do our best to convey that to him nearly every day wallace now a year ago i asked the then president elect during the transition about why it was that he was only taking an intelligence briefing about once a week here aposs what he said begin video clip trump you know i aposm like a smart person i don apost have to be told the same thing and the same words every single day for the next eight years it could be eight years but eight years i don apost need that end video clip wallace and yesterday morning mr trump fired back at questions about his mental fitness with this tweet throughout my life my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being like really smart not smart but genius and a very stable genius at that that i say this respectfully sir and i understand your impatience with our dealing with the subject the cia does psychological profiles of world leaders routinely what would you say about a world leader who refers to himself as a very stable genius pompeo chris i aposm not going to dignify that question with a response this is a man who is leading the united states of america and who engages with intelligence community in ways that are sophisticated he deals with the most complex issues and has handled them in a way that i have great admiration and respect for we aposre keeping america safe and president trump is completely capable of working alongside of us and leading us in that effort wallace i want to pick up on that last point you say you are keeping america safe by raising questions about the president aposs fitness in a sense and the president became part of it making this the big topic this week has this book weakened our country weakened our standing around the world pompeo no wallace all right let aposs move on let aposs turn to these protests in iran against the government the revolutionary guard says this morning that they have put these demonstrations down one is that true and two what do you make of the fact that our closest european allies failed to support us when we tried to rally around the protesters pompeo chris with this issue in the protest in iran is very real the economic conditions in iran are not good that aposs what caused the people to take to the streets president trump made very clear that america supports the iranian people and is looking for them to have a voice and better economic and living conditions meanwhile the iranian regime threatens violence qasem soleimani wastes their money in places like lebanon and syria and yemen trying to foment goodness knows what making them the world aposs largest state sponsor of terror look that is a backward looking regime and is a theocratic regime that is looking backwards instead of a regime that is looking forward to making the lives of their people better whether it aposs rouhani who himself 1999 crushed violent revolts or soleimani pick a leader or whether it aposs the ayatollah each of them views themselves as running a theocracy and the iranian people don apost want that so my full expectation that you aposll see the iranian people continue to revolt against this wallace all right well let me ask you a couple of specific questions have the authorities the repressive authorities of the iranian regime have they put down the protest pompeo so they aposre still going on in a low level there has certainly been violence that has taken place that is the regime has used force to push back against it but it aposs my expectation these protests are not behind us wallace secondly the iranian state prosecutor said that this is all the work of the cia and he talks specifically about your top man on the iran desk pompeo it aposs false this was the iranian people he started by them created by them continued by them demanding a better set of living conditions and a break from the theocratic regime that has been with them since 1979 wallace you have been very clear in your statements about the regime president trump has been if anything even clearer about it why is it that our top european allies failed to support us on this and in fact france when we brought it up before the emergency meeting at the united nations security council joined with russia and china and said this isn apost a fit subject to bring up at the u n security council pompeo yes they aposll have to answer for their behavior but my sense is that we are in the same position that is i think when i talked to my counterparts in europe they are with us in working to figure out ways to counter iran aposs maligned behavior throughout the world and indeed we are working together with them in that effort wallace the president faces some deadlines in the next ten days as to whether or not to stay in the iran deal or to re impose sanctions congress is working on legislation could they do something over these next 10 days that would make it sensible and reasonable for us to stay in the iran deal pompeo they could chris i aposve only seen a little bit of this it aposs not in my lane directly they could do something they could take some of the weaknesses from the agreement from the joint comprehensive agreement extend deadlines put snapback sanctions into place where they could really happen so there are set of things they could do to make that deal better and then ultimately the president will have to make the decision about whether to remain in the deal or not wallace now when you talk about changes they could make one of them would be supposedly that they would basically say that we the firm deadline as to when we can do it we would remove some of the timelines and say if they meet certain thresholds then the sanctions go back in place pompeo that aposs right chris and then there are other things the agreement itself covered only a set of maligned behaviors their nuclear program there are other things which present real threats to america and to the world that i hope we can all counter together wallace one more trouble spot this week north korean and south korean officials are going to hold their first official talks in two years to discuss relations just ahead of the winter olympics this was the initial reaction the negative reaction from our u n ambassador nikki haley begin video clip nikki haley u s ambassador to the united nations we won apost take any of the talks seriously if they don apost do something to ban all nuclear weapons in north korea end video clip wallace are these talks a good thing or do you see them your best cia estimate as an effort and this wouldn apost be the first time by north korea to try and drive a wedge between south korea and its alliance with the united states pompeo look the north koreans are in a tough spot president trump has made very clear that the u s policy is denuclearization of the peninsula and that we are going to achieve that so you see the north koreans doing what they have historically done reaching out trying to find space trying to come up for air when they are being strangled by a president who aposs made very clear that their behavior is unacceptable and so yes this is certainly part of that we aposll see how the talks go on tuesday of this week and what they are able to resolve with respect to the olympics but the american position is unchanged wallace but you sound in your answer as if you have grave skepticism about the question as to how sincere north korea is in trying to improve relations pompeo the north koreans are behaving out of fear that is they are very concerned that america for the first time in an awfully long time is serious about denuclearizing the peninsula and i think they are finding trying to find a foothold trying to find a place to reach out and we aposll we aposll just have to wait and see how the conversations going tuesday wallace final question kim jong un the head of the regime in his new year aposs day statement where he reached out and talked about wanting to deal with south korea he also talked about the fact that he had a nuclear button on his desk and president trump responded with this tweet will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that i too have a nuclear button but it is a much bigger and more powerful one than his and my button works question how is that helpful to get in his back and forth of taunts with the leader whom you and the cia judge as unstable pompeo this is the first time in an awfully long time that american policy has been consistent that tweet is entirely consistent with what we are trying to communicate we want the regime to understand that unlike before we are intent on resolving this and it is our firm conviction that resolving this diplomatically is the correct answer but that this administration is prepared to do what it takes to ensure that people in los angeles and denver and new york aren apost held at risk from kim jong un having a nuclear weapon that tweet is entirely consistent with that policy wallace and just quickly how do you respond to people who are very critical of the tweet and say you know it lowers the threshold it trivializes the possibility of nuclear war pompeo yes i just simply disagree with them we in this administration understand the seriousness of what it is we are undertaking we understand the threat we speak i speak with the president about it nearly every day but we are intent upon laying out a set of plans that achieve the goal that frankly previous administrations have been unprepared to engage in wallace director pompeo thank you thanks for your time this weekend pompeo thank you chris wallace always good to talk with you sir pompeo good to talk with you sir wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the trump agenda for 2018 and the impact of a book that questions the president aposs fitness commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we are very well prepared for the coming year we finished very strong end video clip wallace president trump laying out republican plans for 2018 after meeting with gop leaders this weekend at camp david and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove rachael bade who covers congress for politico julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press and guy benson of townhall com karl i gather you like i was ripping through the book i stayed up until 11 00 on friday night what do you make of the book and what does it tell you about president trump and his team in the white house karl rove former bush white house adviser well if you didn apost like drum you aposre not going to like him any better and if you like trump you aposre going to dismiss a lot of the book but not since that vietnamese monk poured gasoline on himself in an intersection in saigon in 1963 and lit a match have we seen someone immolate themselves as steve bannon did in this book it is clear that this book was based on a large number of interviews taped with steve bannon by michael wolff including chapter 21 where all of these ugly things that he says about trump aposs family are at a dinner with wolff in his apartment in arlington and there aposs clearly a tape recorder running so the biggest victim of this book by the book itself is steve bannon his glory hopes of organizing a movement raising millions of dollars backing candidates against every senate republican incumbent against ted cruz and maybe running himself for president in 2020 if trump didn apost run if all of these desires and dreams poof up in smoke wallace briefly because i want to bring in everybody else in bannon whatever you think of him one would think he aposs a rational guy why would he do this rove because he aposs got a gigantic ego let me say one other quick thing the problem for the president is not this book it aposs his own quotes it aposs it aposs not it is not the book it aposs his behavior and going out and issuing a tweet saying i have i aposm a very stable genius and i aposm like really smart was not helpful it elongated the book drew more attention to it and dominated the conversation when there were better things for him to talk about than when we say something like that it caused people to say well why are you so defensive about it and the question is why did the president feel compelled to be defensive about this book wallace well i want to pick up on that with you julie because this book comes out just as the president was riding pretty high with the passage of the tax bill with a long list of good economic news how much has the book and the president aposs reaction to it thrown them off their game as they prepare for what aposs going to be a tough month very tough month we aposll get to it in a second but the government running out of money in 12 days and a very challenging midterm election year julie pace washington bureau chief the associated press it has overshadowed everything that republicans on the hill and white house advisors had hope to spend this week talking about there was no effort made no serious effort made by the white house this week to sell the public on the tax overhaul which is pretty unpopular right now and they aposre going to have to bolster its popularity if republicans hope to run on it in the fall there was no effort to lay the groundwork publicly on a spending bill very little public conversation about immigration and daca or the border wall and to karl aposs point this book based on the content of it was always going to be news but it would not have reached this level if it not had been for the president coming out and putting out a statement going after steve bannon if it hadn apost been for the tweets yesterday so much of the coverage of this is driven by the president aposs own action that aposs something that aposs fully within his control and he cannot avoid a fight if he sees somebody going after him personally he feels like he has to get in there he has to mix it up he does not feel like as president he is above squabbling with even a former advisor wallace not to mention something that was almost unprecedented which is having his lawyers threatened to sue steve bannon and the publisher and michael wolff the author which again was just like thank you mr president if i aposm the publisher of that book as i said the first key government deadline is to find a way to keep the government funded in 12 days or else we aposre going to have a shutdown democrats say no deal on spending unless there is a deal on daca and the dreamers and yesterday at his meeting with republican leaders at camp david president trump laid out his conditions for that begin video clip trump we want the wall the wall is going to happen or we aposre not going to have daca we want to get rid of chain migration very important and we want to get rid of the lottery system end video clip wallace rachael democrats say ok we can go for border security but we aposre not going to go for a while and we found out in the last couple of days that the administration is saying the cost of the wall just for the first phase would be 18 billion over ten years so how in the next 12 days can they make an agreement to keep the government funded when you aposve got all these conditions about yes daca no wall yes there has to be a wall rachael bade congressional reporter politico i think everybody on the hill is asking the exact same question right now democrats saying they want this done before they agree to a long term budget deal the problem here is that the president wants something that they are not going to be able to approve or vote for we heard this week that two senate republicans in this bipartisan working group that everybody thought would come up with a bipartisan daca deal actually walked away from the table thom tillis of north carolina james lankford of oklahoma they left because they said democrats are not willing to give anything on border security meanwhile you have the president sort of doubling down on his partisan rhetoric in terms of demanding a wall i aposm not sure how this is going to come together i am skeptical however that democrats are going to take the shutdown in late january because they had a chance to do that before in december and they blinked and they voted for a short term spending bill i aposm skeptical that they aposre going to hold the line on this we aposll just have to see wallace so i just want to be clear here because the immigration people and the hispanics are saying you this is your time for leverage you aposve got to get this as part of a spending deal you aposre suggesting the democrats won apost do that bade you know they said that they were going to do this as part of before christmas that they were not going to support any kind of spending deal or agreement before they left for the holiday break and yet there were a number of democrats in the senate who voted for short term spending bill so i think that there are a lot of republicans who thought this was the hill that democrats were willing to die on and they would have to cave to democratic demands on daca the sense i aposm getting now from republicans is that they think maybe they could push this off get a spending deal and deal with it later in march wallace guy there aposs also a split that we saw this week within the republican party you have house speaker ryan who continues to push for welfare reform but the reports this week that the president and senate leader mcconnell had cooled on that and want to lead with infrastructure do you have any sense of the order that aposs with the priorities and what are the chances particularly because you aposre going to need democratic votes for any serious legislation this year guy benson townhall com well much better chance for democrats to hop on board in infrastructure bill than spending reform bill or welfare reform so when i was talking to top house republican sources prior to the new year they were saying oh yes you know we are doing the tax cut it aposs going to be a great deal for the american people and then we need some fiscal discipline we aposre going to get to welfare reform next and i was always skeptical saying hey the president aposs appetite for that sort of things has always seemed very limited he came out on the campaign trail hard against entitlement reform is he really going to follow up a tax bill with something like welfare reform and it seems like he aposs really backing off of that with mitch mcconnell being his conduit on capitol hill saying let aposs talk about infrastructure spending instead that might be an easier lift in an election year wallace which raises another question karl the first midterm election for the party that has the president in office is always tough with the exception of you in 2002 with george w bush how much trouble are republicans in as they had towards the midterm in 2018 in november karl rove former bush white house adviser big trouble president aposs approval rating is in the high 30s and the republicans are 24 seats in the house away from losing their majority as a result i think we aposre going to see two republican agendas in 2018 we aposre going to see the unified republican agenda house senate and white house which is going to focus on infrastructure and maybe a daca deal and a couple other things and then we aposre going to see a house republican agenda in which they do tackle things like poverty and welfare and reform so that the members have the ability to go home and say we passed it i voted for it and it aposs now bollix up in the senate there aposs always been a tension between the house and the senate this year the house republicans are going to use that tension creatively in order to say we aposre working they aren apost vote for the republican me your republican congressman and the senate can go to heck wallace i aposm glad you cleaned it up that way all right thank you panel we aposll see take a break here we aposll see you guys a little bit later when we come back corey lewandowski president trump aposs first campaign manager and still a top outside advisor on the controversial new book and steve bannon aposs sudden fall from power commercial break wallace coming up the white house pushes back on claims of that new book fire and fury begin video clip trump he said he interviewed me for three hours in the white house it didn apost exist ok it aposs in his imagination end video clip wallace we aposll talk with president trump aposs first campaign manager and still outside adviser corey lewandowski next commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway at savannah georgia after its heaviest snowfall in three decades back now to the fallout from michael wolff aposs book on the trump presidency joining us from manchester new hampshire president trump aposs first campaign manager corey lewandowski who is now chief strategist for america first action a pro trump super pac corey what do you think of the book and how accurate is it corey lewandowski chief strategist america first action well chris let me first say happy new year and let me be very clear this is a book of fiction not only is it not accurate there are so many misrepresentations in this book that it shouldn apost be taken seriously and if you look at the critics of mr wolff his contemporaries his colleagues the new york times cnn clearly not people who have been friendly or supportive of this president or his administration they have called into question the simple facts that are in this book as factually inaccurate and mr wolff himself claimed at the very beginning of the book that it looks like he aposs taken liberties to put things in the book that may not have happened but he lets the reader decide that is not journalistic integrity and this book is a complete application wallace all right but here aposs one excerpt of the book were michael wolff describes your relationship with the president aposs two sons don junior and eric and also jared kushner let aposs put it up lewandowski regarded both brothers and their brother in law with rolling on the floor contempt not only were don junior and eric stupid and jared both supercilious and obsequious the butler but nobody knew a whit about politics the fact is you didn apost think much of don junior who helped force you out as campaign manager lewandowski you know chris it aposs very important to know mr wolff and i never spoke about this book so where he comes up with these assertions of what i think of the trump kids or or jared kushner are completely made up i aposve never spoken to him about this and so let me be as clear as i can be and look i talk about this in my book i think eric and don are fantastic advocates for their father i have a very close working relationship with jared kushner i respect what he has done by leaving his business and coming to government service so these again are made up accusations from a person who never spoke to me about my opinion of anybody in the trump orbit or the trump family wallace well ok but but one could argue that your views of some of these people we just talked about were known to other people i have a lot of respect for you corey but your discretion and your and your your lack of giving your views is not one of the things that i necessarily agree with let me ask you another question honestly did you ever refer to jared as the butler lewandowski look chris i aposve never done that and that aposs such you know that aposs such conjecture it aposs such speculation it shouldn apost have ever been printed and and and like i heard on the entire chapter that this guy wrote about the cpac event he never called matt schlapp and cpac or anybody else to talk about it he never called me i never sat down so for him to say i called anybody anything without talking to me is an injustice to the integrity of of publishing a book the guy aposs a liar is what it comes down to and i don apost think anybody who looks at what is in this book can take it honestly so look chris i aposve been very clear i don apost think i should have been fired by the trump campaign after helping to steer the candidate through 38 primaries and caucuses and help him get more votes than any candidate in the history of the republican party but the family made a decision to have me moved out in june of 2016 and that was a decision that we now live with but the bottom line is i never spoke to wolff and whether you know was i disappointed in june of 2016 you bet i was but have i done everything humanly possible from that day to make sure the trump agenda moves forward whether it was right after that right after i left the campaign on television or this day on the outside you bet i have wallace you also think that if you hadn apost been fired trump would have won more than 306 electoral votes lewandowski well look you know i aposd love to say that i could have maybe helped deliver new hampshire because selfishly i wanted to see him win my home state and i wanted to see him win nevada it was an amazing election victory that donald trump gets all the credit for but i do think there could have obviously been a role for me at that campaign had i not been asked to leave wallace ok let aposs get to the central point here michael wolff basically says that all the people around the president question his fitness to be the commander in chief here he is begin video clip michael wolff fire and fury author the one description that that everyone gave everyone has in common they all say he is like a child and what they mean by that is he has a need for immediate gratification it aposs all about him end video clip wallace your reaction lewandowski chris i spent 18 hours a day seven days a week for almost two years next to candidate trump and i aposve had the high privilege of continuing to speak to the president as he has assumed that office and i can tell you this never have i seen anything like this michael wolff hasn apost spent any time with a candidate he wasn apost with us on the campaign trail he hasn apost been next to the president while he aposs been in the oval office making decisions and if you look at what this man has achieved throughout his lifetime it aposs not instant gratification it aposs long term success whether it has been books or television or running for office you know it was two years ago this very week three excuse me three years ago this very week i joined the trump organization the trump team to start planning that run for president that aposs not instant gratification and what donald trump achieves in that campaign was unparalleled success against an amazing field of republican candidates that took two long years of dedication and hard work by candidate trump to do something nobody ever thought he could do and wolff wasn apost anywhere near that wallace all right look i want to make it clear because i aposve talked a long time to you and you say it was two years ago that i did a power player on you we aposve talked often since then i aposve read your book and clearly your admiration for donald trump is there and in no way do your question his fitness in fact quite the contrary you basically say he aposs he aposs kind of a genius i don apost know i forget whether you used those words or not but you also do talk about some behavior that is questionable and i wanted i wanted to discuss that because that aposs also part of your description of him you say that four major food groups on trump force one were mcdonald aposs kentucky fried chicken pizza and diet coke and here aposs what you say about what happens when the president often or then candidate would lose his temper the mode that he switches into when things aren apost going his way can feel like an all out assault it aposd break most hardened men and women into little pieces around the campaign we aposd call it getting your face ripped off corey you talk about one instance when the president got so upset he aposs in a helicopter you aposre i think you aposre in the helicopter with him that he orders the pilot to fly it down so low that he can get cell phone service so he can chew out paul manafort lewandowski well chris look having your face ripped off by the president as we describe it is because we failed as a staff this is a man who woke up every day and put 18 or 20 hours a day in every day on the campaign trail and when something didn apost go right it wasn apost because he wasn apost giving 125 percent effort it aposs because the staff failed him the microphone didn apost work properly something that we should have had done for him wasn apost right and that aposs the accountability he expects demands and deserves the best and he should have that and when i failed as a campaign manager he let me know it makes me a better person for that i didn apost take it personally i wanted to work harder because i saw what he was doing and i forced our staff to work harder so that he gets the very best there aposs nothing wrong with that chris i took that as a level of professionalism that forced me and my team to be better because that aposs what he deserved chris you have to remember at the significant early stage of this campaign there were four or five people against the republican juggernauts right against the bush campaign wallace right lewandowski the walker campaign the cruz campaign where they had hundreds of people we were doing this with a much smaller team and so what we had to do is we had to y be perfect every day and when we weren apost he held us accountable and that aposs the right thing to do wallace ok i aposve got about two minutes i want to get into one last subject with you let aposs talk about accountability steve bannon you have generally gotten along with him how do you explain him accusing don junior and jared of treason for their meeting with that russian lawyer in june of 2016 at trump tower and also suggesting that some of them may have been involved including jared in money laundering how do you explain him being so indiscreet lewandowski look i can apost explain it there aposs no justification for that whatsoever i know don junior i know jared kushner they aposre american patriots don loves his country jared loves his country they have given up so much to help this country be better and so wallace i aposm not talking about them i aposm talking about steve bannon why would he do that lewandowski look i can apost justify what steve said if that aposs what steve said then he owes he owes donald trump he owes donald trump junior he owes jared kushner and the entire trump family an apology if that aposs what he said and if that aposs what he said then shame on steve bannon because that is so out of bounds to accuse somebody of treason it aposs so out of line so out of character for a guy like steve bannon that i have a hard time believing what wolff wrote but if that aposs what steve said then shame on steve for doing that because that is way out of line wallace final question because here was the president at camp david yesterday on both the author michael wolff and also on steve bannon here he is begin video clip trump well i never interviewed with him in the white house all he was never in the oval office we didn apost have an interview sloppy steve brought him into the white house quite a bit and it was one of those things that aposs why sloppy steve is now looking for a job end video clip wallace the president says he and bannon are done the mercers conservative billionaire backers said they aposve got no more dealings with steve bannon thirty seconds what is steve bannon aposs place in republican politics now lewandowski well look chris the only person that aposs the head of the republican party is the president of the united states donald trump and people 60 million people voted for him and they didn apost vote for steve bannon or becca mercer or anybody else to be the president of the united states they voted for donald trump so if steve bannon wants to get on the trump team and join with the president to make sure that we hold the house in 2018 and we hold the senate or expand our majority then he aposll be welcome to do that but if you want to run an agenda which is antithetical to the president aposs agenda then there is no place in the republican party for you because donald trump is the head of the republican party he is the head of our country wallace right lewandowski and his is the agenda that the american people voted for wallace corey thank you thanks for getting through the snow in new hampshire i know it was a tough slog to talk with us today sir lewandowski thank you very much wallace coming up president trump denies he did anything wrong in trying to stop attorney general jeff sessions from recusing himself in the russian investigation and guess who else is still under investigation yes hillary clinton the panel returns next commercial break begin video clip trump everything that i aposve done is 100 percent proper that aposs what i do is i do things proper everyone found that after a year of study there aposs been absolutely no collusion there aposs been no collusion between us and the russians now there has been collusion between hillary clinton the dnc and the russians end video clip wallace president trump denying any wrongdoing as the special counsel aposs russia probe continues and taking obvious pleasure in reports the fbi is still investigating hillary clinton and we aposre back now with the panel well guy let aposs start with the news that the fbi apparently resumed its investigation of the clinton foundation and allegations of pay to play more than a year ago and now gop senators want the fbi to take a look at possible criminal investigation of the man christopher steele who was behind the so called russia dossier what do you make of that and the fact that it looks like hillary clinton is back as a possible target of fbi investigation guy benson townhall com well on the steele point the allegation from the senators the republican senators is that there aposs some evidence that he may have lied to federal officials and the fbi and if he did that that of course would be a crime as for mrs clinton wallace you think part of what they aposre saying is hey if you aposre going to go after george papadopoulos benson right wallace and and michael flynn benson if going to the fbi is a problem for trump world people it should be a problem for anyone else wallace right benson that would be a consistent position as for mrs clinton i think that what you aposre going to hear from democrats is this is just going back and re litigating an old fight because the president is having tantrums on twitter and so the justice department is responding in a political way that aposs what they aposre going to say what republicans will point out is there were allegations in 2016 reported by cnn by the wall street journal that there were fbi agents and fbi officers four field officers in fact that were looking into the clinton foundation and those efforts were quashed by obama era justice department officials so there may be something there that was never fully investigated properly or probed properly and so trump defenders and clinton critics will say this is legitimate wallace meanwhile rachael under heavy pressure from house republicans the fbi has finally agreed to turn over documents and also to allow witnesses to testify in the fbi aposs conduct of both the clinton and the trump investigations and they aposve met up went up to capitol hill met with house speaker ryan and he demanded that they cooperate with these investigations on the hill rachael bade politico yes top justice department officials went and talked to speaker ryan specifically about narrowing document and witnesses witness increase to try to bring them to capitol hill they didn apost want to turn over all those documents but speaker paul ryan you know stuck with the chairman on this and he said no we need this information from you guys and it aposs congress apos duty to oversee the executive branch so we have a right to do this i think this was sort of a tentative truce even just two days later we saw lindsey graham and chuck grassley come after the fbi and say specifically that they think they should be investigating the author of the dossier that sort of triggered a lot of this russia scandal investigation and that aposs not small potatoes there i mean grassley and graham are not particularly seen as partisan hacks these guys are oversight bulls who a lot of people on both sides of the aisle really respect we also saw to conservatives mark meadows and jim jordan say that they want jeff sessions to step aside because they don apost like the way the fbi is handling the russia probe so this is just going to continue it aposs a partisan mood swing right now and you know the fight between the fbi and the republicans on the hill is going to get uglier wallace and meanwhile the democrats who originally had no love loss for jeff sessions are saying no he aposs got to stay there and we can apost leave this because they don apost want to see anything that interferes with the special counsel which brings us to you karl and the special counsel because we learned this week that the white house apparently lobbied attorney general sessions not to recuse himself in march of 2016 or 2017 when all of this was coming out that he had meetings undisclosed with russian ambassador sergey kislyak when you look at that the lobbying of jeff sessions when you look at the firing of james comey when you look at the president aposs role in helping to write that air force one statement that turned out not to be true about don junior aposs meeting with a russian lawyer how close are they getting to a case of obstruction of justice karl rove former bush white house adviser on the first two instances firing comey and encouraging sessions not to recuse himself i don apost think they have any problems i aposm not a lawyer but every lawyer most every lawyer i aposve talked to says they don apost see how there could be a case made there unless there aposs an underlying criminal intent on the third question of the statement being drafted on air force one everybody who was in that room who was involved in that statement in drafting that is going to have to answer questions at the fbi and see if they square with earlier statements they made about it but the point about jeff sessions let aposs be clear about this in 1978 the congress passed an ethics law 74 5 in the senate 307 23 in the house requiring that the memories were still fresh of bobby kennedy as jfk aposs attorney general and john mitchell as nixon aposs and specific rules were required by that law for recusal and as a result in 1982 the rules were set down no employee of the justice department shall participate in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation political relationship means a close identification with an elected official or a candidate arising from service as a principle adviser there too jeff sessions was the first senator to endorse donald trump and a senior adviser to him throughout the campaign now i know lawyers may disagree but i read that and say he had no other course except to recuse himself wallace julie the president aposs lawyers have been saying for some period of time this is going to go away it was going to go away at thanksgiving then they were saying it aposs going to go away early in 2018 they also say the president is completely in the clear as all of this continues to come out are they quite so confident julie pace the associated press they remain confident in the president not having done anything wrong either on collusion in the campaign or with comey aposs firing or pushing sessions to recuse to not recuse himself they are less confident at this point that this is now an investigation that aposs wrapping up in part because all of these targets that they keep setting all of these deadlines that they keep saying all pass and the president gets frustrated with that and you can understand why he aposs a client and if your lawyers are telling you that this investigation is wrapping up and then it doesn apost it becomes quite frustrating they now expect that this is something that they will be living with for another period of time realistically when you talk to people lawyers for other people who are being probed here they expect this to be quite a lengthy investigation something that could continue perhaps through the end of this year so that aposs two years of the trump administration that could be tied up in a pretty complex investigation wallace well that anybody i aposve talked to who is familiar with special counsel investigations tells us there aposs never any timeline and these guys take whatever time they feel they need so why were the lawyers saying that the only reason i can figure is because they felt well let aposs we aposll keep the president controlled by saying oh it aposs it aposs just wait a couple of more weeks mr president pace right which is a confounding strategy because when you actually put a couple of deadlines on there i mean the calendar turns and you know that thanksgiving has passed christmas has passed the end of the year has passed and the investigation is still going i think one thing to watch this year is how the president responds when he comes to the realization that more people around him are going to be called in to talk to bob mueller that this investigation is not wrapping up any time soon wallace karl as the one person at this table i think who aposs actually been the rove inaudible give him some advice from having been through this wallace yes rove stay focused on your job compartmentalize this put it aside stay focused on your mission and don apost be expecting it to wrap up soon or wrap up quickly and to the degree that you keep focused on it to the degree that the president is obsessed with this he is not serving himself or the people of america well stay focused on the job wallace and we should point out that no charges were brought against karl rove right wallace which is why he is here today thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the nation aposs top doctor and his plans for battling our most pressing health issues commercial break wallace health care is one of the most divisive political issues in our country but one man here in washington is all about ratcheting down the debate and working for solutions here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape dr jerome adams u s surgeon general i think of the role of the surgeon general as being one who leads with the science who promotes health and prevents disease wallace voice over dr jerome adams is the country aposs 20th surgeon general in charge of the 6 500 officers of the public health service but more important he is the nation aposs doctor in the apos60s luther terry warned about the danger of smoking in the 80s c everett koop fought political opposition to inform the country about aids c everett koop former surgeon general let aposs stop the rumors and commiseration about aids wallace on camera sometimes in your job science bumps up against politics how do you balance those adams science has got to be the key for the surgeon general but there aposs a saying chris people need to know that you care before they care what you know wallace voice over adams believes instead of a zero sum game where one side wins and the other loses public health is about building partnerships on climate change adams we know the science says that man is having an impact on the climate but we also know that people are dying from not having jobs not being able to feed their families wallace whether gun violence is a public health issue adams gun control i think in and of itself is a term that turns people off i aposm interested as the surgeon general in gun safety wallace but the most pressing problem now is the opioid crisis ninety one people a day dying from overdoses the nation aposs life expectancy declining for the second year in a row back in october president trump declared it a public health emergency trump we will defeat this opioid epidemic it will be defeated wallace but so far the trump administration has not kept its promise to ask congress for more funding wallace on camera drug addiction is personal for you your brother is in prison adams my younger brother philip suffers from addiction it aposs painful to share but it helps people understand that if this can happen to the surgeon general and his brother it can happen to anybody so help me god wallace voice over vice president pence appointed adams as indiana aposs health commissioner when he was governor mike pence vice president of the united states it was dr jerome adams who led from the front wallace and he saw how the doctor dealt with an outbreak of hiv in a deeply conservative rural county adams needle exchange programs are extremely politically controversial wallace but adams convinced the law enforcement and business communities adams that we cared about the same things that they cared about about resolving this epidemic and shared with them how the science could lead to that outcome wallace so dr adams may sometimes have to walk a tight rope in his job but he says always in pursuit of the greater good adams for my entire life i aposve trie
