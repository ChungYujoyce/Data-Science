treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning pressure on comey to end probe of michael flynn this includes the president s statement to then fbi director james comey regarding the investigation of then national security adviser michael flynn trump told comey i hope you can see your way to letting this go president s reaction to the continuing russia investigation among the evidence is the president telling then white house counsel don mcgahn to stop attorney general jeff sessions from recusing himself from the russia investigation and trump s subsequent anger at sessions trump also contacted comey and other intelligence agency leaders to ask them to push back publicly on the suggestion that trump had any connection to the russian election interference effort firing of comey and aftermath mueller s report says substantial evidence indicates trump s decision to fire comey in may 2017 was the result of the fbi director s unwillingness to say publicly that trump was not personally under investigation on the day after trump fired comey the president told russian officials that he had faced great pressure because of russia that s taken off appointment of special counsel and efforts to remove him trump reacted to news of mueller s appointment by telling advisers that it was the end of his presidency the president told aides that mueller had conflicts of interest and should have to step aside his aides told trump the asserted conflicts were meritless following media reports that mueller s team was investigating whether the president had obstructed justice trump called then white house counsel don mcgahn at home and directed him to have mueller removed mcgahn refused further efforts to curtail the special counsel s investigation trump instructed former campaign manager corey lewandowski to have sessions publicly announce that notwithstanding his recusal from the russia investigation the investigation was very unfair to the president the

investigation at several points in between july 2017 and december 2017 trump tried to get sessions to declare that he was no longer recused from the russia investigation and would assert control over it the report says there s evidence that one purpose of asking sessions to step in was so that the attorney general would restrict the investigation s scope trump orders white house counsel to deny that president tried to fire mueller in an oval office meeting in february 2018 trump told mcgahn to correct a new york times story that reported trump had earlier instructed mcgahn to fire mueller trump also asked why mcgahn had told mueller s investigators about the directive to remove mueller mcgahn told trump he had to tell the investigators the truth trump s actions toward flynn manafort and other possible witnesses mueller looked at whether trump s sympathetic messages to flynn former campaign manager paul manafort and others were intended to limit their cooperation with mueller s investigation when flynn began cooperating with prosecutors trump passed word through his lawyer that he still had warm feeling for flynn and asked for a heads up if flynn knew of information implicating trump trump praised manafort during and after his criminal convictions and refused to rule out a pardon for his former campaign chairman trump actions toward michael cohen mueller noted that trump s conduct toward cohen a former trump organization executive changed from praise to castigation after cohen began cooperating with prosecutors the evidence could support an inference that
