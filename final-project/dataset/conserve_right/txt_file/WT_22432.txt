apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the capital times may 20 false facts and false premises threaten women s health president donald trump often criticizes what he calls fake news his mischaracterization of reporting that reveals his wrongdoing and incompetence is deception designed to fool some of the people some of the time top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender unfortunately some of the same people who are fooled by trump with regard to media issues are also fooled by republican politicians who peddle deception in the form of legislation wisconsin s republican controlled state assembly just passed an anti abortion measure that addresses a supposed threat that trump identified at a recent campaign rally in green bay doctors and mothers who conspire to execute babies but as an associated press fact check noted it s already a crime to kill babies and as dipesh navsaria a madison pediatrician and cap times columnist who serves as the vice president of the wisconsin chapter of the american academy of pediatrics has noted no one is executing babies period that s not happening state rep debra kolste d janesville summed things up during last week s assembly debate when she said republican legislators were employing false facts and false premises as part of a political assault on women s health the journal times of racine may 20 wisconsin needs a state funded pro vaccination campaign amid reports of outbreaks across the united states of measles a disease declared eradicated here by the federal centers for disease control and prevention in 2000 comes news of a disturbing prospect in wisconsin s largest city more than 11 000 students in milwaukee public schools alone did not receive all required vaccinations this school year including those to prevent measles polio diphtheria and hepatitis b according to state health records the milwaukee journal sentinel reported may 9 that s nearly 15 of mps students which means there could be too few vaccinated students within district boundaries to sustain herd immunity which prevents newborn babies unvaccinated children or adults in poor health from contracting diseases that could disable or kill them it s like you have a can of gasoline and you re just waiting for someone to drop a match said james conway a doctor who specializes in pediatric infectious diseases and associate director for health sciences at the university of wisconsin madison school of medicine and public health state rep gordon hintz d oshkosh has written a bill that would make it difficult for unvaccinated children to attend school we re going to increase vaccination rates one of two ways we re going to pass this bill or we re going to have a measles outbreak he said given the milwaukee statistics hintz s statement doesn t sound like hyperbole hintz s bill is not receiving support from republicans assembly speaker robin vos r rochester said he is opposed to mandatory vaccination i don t think that anybody should have that the government should have the ability to mandate that something has to happen to your child vos said now would i support an education campaign because i think vaccination is right i would then let s have it let s have the bill with bipartisan support to fund a pro vaccination campaign throughout wisconsin the united states achieved measles eradication in 2000 because two generations of americans the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963 were raised by parents who had seen the painful effects of the highly contagious rash in the decade before 1963 nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years of age the cdc reports on its website it is estimated 3 to 4 million people in the united states were infected each year an estimated 400 to 500 people died 48 000 were hospitalized and 1 000 suffered encephalitis swelling of the brain from measles so by 2000 measles had been eradicated less than 20 years later we have measles outbreaks some cases of unvaccinated children in milwaukee and elsewhere in the nation are a matter of insufficient access to vaccinations however we note that in the year 2000 american adult internet use reached 52 percent according to the pew research center more than half of the adult population the internet spreads misinformation and outright lies just as fast as it spreads accurate information not everyone can discern the difference between an informed opinion and an uninformed opinion although we would have thought everyone accepts that a physician knows more about diseases than say someone with no evident medical degree posting something in opposition to vaccinations on social media this is what a wisconsin pro vaccination campaign would be up against we re going to need a widespread well funded campaign print tv radio and billboards to push back against the nonsense being spread on the internet we look forward to watching wisconsin republicans and democrats come together to put their shared knowledge of the effectiveness of vaccinations into action beloit daily news may 20 who is to blame look in a mirror consumers will pay a tariff tax that reflects their shopping choices in the field of economics it doesn t get much more basic still everyday folks can be forgiven a lack of understanding after all the inner workings of international tariff policies is not exactly dinner table talk which is why it made news when fox news host chris wallace pinned down the top white house economic adviser on the topic cornering larry kudlow into acknowledging that china is not paying the united states for higher tariffs those extra costs fall to american import businesses and eventually u s consumers when say another 25 tariff is popped on chinese goods coming into america the u s business bringing in the chinese export fronts the cost and usually jacks up prices to the end user who consumes the product the political idea is that consumers will rebel at higher prices and move on either to other suppliers for american made goods or products from non tariff countries the producing country in this case china will feel that pressure and mend its ways some of that could work some won t for example many tech products think ipads are singularly delivered from china issues can hit in reverse too when china imposes its own retaliatory tariffs for example already chinese purchases of brazilian soybeans are up 22 percent on the year striking american farmers hard is that switch permanent good question all that makes president trump s continuing claim that china is paying the tariffs to the u s government at least a misstatement of fact it doesn t however make the underlying issue china profiting at u s expense sometimes through outright theft of technology any less concerning such issues should be addressed the question is whether trade tariffs constitute smart strategy not to mention what does a win look like the goal setting has not exactly been precise what has made china such a successful purveyor of goods to america is not just that country s export chops or regime based plans truth be told americans do not have to leave u s shores to identify culprits this is not entirely a foreign trade policy problem consider u s consumers want cheaper products and they don t think much about where they come from or how they got here shoppers flock to big box retailers to pick over shelves stocked with foreign made products and then brag about how cheap they bought something few give a thought to the fact that most of those shelves used to be filled with american made goods produced by companies employing u s citizens meanwhile u s manufacturers in a long list of fields found themselves increasingly needing to compete with cheap foreign made goods quickly they discovered their products could be produced cheaper with overseas labor giving them not only an opportunity to compete at price point but also to achieve higher returns the result shuttered u s plants and unemployed americans obviously american workers are quite capable of making great shirts comfortable shoes high quality phones and tablets and televisions and any number of other consumer goods but americans won t work for these kind of wages cambodia 153 a month vietnam 145 a month or even rising scales in china about 1 400 a month the problem is real but the arguments are presented too simplistically and fighting the battle on the tariff front is a blunt instrument that may do more harm than good so long as american consumers primary interest is low prices and u s companies main goal is maximized profits solutions to foreign trade issues will be hard to come by at least though the current tariff battle should be conducted on honest terms the escalating war is a tax on american companies and consumers who are paying the cost until china falls to its knees and capitulates to pre
