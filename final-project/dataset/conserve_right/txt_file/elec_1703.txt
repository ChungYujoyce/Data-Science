tomorrow your friends will gasp celebrities will judge you your mother might still love you grudgingly the very concept of democracy depends on it they ll say and don t you care about america don t accept the guilt trip not voting can be an equally legitimate and moral choice here are four of the most common myths used to shame nonvoters your vote matters as reason s katherine mangu ward has often pointed out you re not going to sway a major election your chances are vanishingly small of affecting a race at the state level and a single vote has decided precisely zero federal elections in more than a century a comprehensive review by economists casey mulligan and charles hunter looking at tens of thousands of races since 1898 unearthed just a single federal race that hinged on one vote but a recount revealed the final difference to be much larger voting is like playing the powerball punch your ticket or don t and your life will stay exactly the same yes if a million other people think the same way then the result could shift but this is about you and whether or not you cast your one vote it simply won t affect the outcome not if you live in a swing state not if the electoral college were abolished not even if you re in florida and your chad is hung like a moose if you don t vote you have no right to complain only about half the voting age population makes it to the polls and groups including young people the poor and the disabled are underrepresented in voter rolls do they not deserve a voice the act of voting doesn t a good citizen make and it s actually one of the least effective ways to contribute to the american experiment most social and cultural change happens outside the political sphere and that s a good thing rather than follow the latest horse race you could tweet blog buy donate or activate you might spend your scarce time exposing corruption developing a new vaccine or microwaving a burrito any of these things can have a more tangible impact on the world than your vote it s your civic duty to vote generations of brave americans have fought for your right to vote and for your right not to in fact you can choose not to vote because you love your country maybe you don t feel educated or at least not enough to fill out your ballot and cancel out the vote of your well informed neighbor that s ok and really quite moral besides even the most knowledgeable voters can t predict what a candidate will do in office remember when obama was going to rein in w s foreign adventuring it was about 10 years and one drone kill list ago if you don t vote you re just lazy a principled citizen might actively avoid a two party system that systemically silences alternative voices you could decide that by design it doesn t represent your interests and that voting for the lesser of two evils only helps the fat cats in washington maintain a smoke screen of legitimacy in that case go ahead and wash your hands of the whole rotten mess at the end of the day you might want to vote maybe to give your granddaughter an upclose look at the machinery of american government maybe to get that fashionable i voted sticker selfie that proves to your insta friends how woke or un cucked you are maybe you just really like middle school gyms so this tuesday go ahead and rock the vote if it makes you happy but if you decide that it s a symbolic act that s unlikely to tangibly help your family or community it s ok to spend your time and resources doing something more impactful this tuesday you don t need to vote produced by justin monticello shot by
