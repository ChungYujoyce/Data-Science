magic eight ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion the current presidential campaign is blowing up lots of political myths for years the conventional lament was that the wrong bush had run for president in 2000 george w bush was supposedly tongue tied he was said to be polarizing he was derided as too much the twangy conservative texas christian if only his younger softer spoken brother then florida gov jeb bush had run instead top stories australian researchers see virus design manipulation 500 doctors tell trump to end the coronavirus shutdown say it will cause more deaths democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots so the myth went jeb was said to be far more bipartisan and judicious jeb not w was deemed by many to be the more likable and more competent descendent of their father former president george h w bush the 2015 debates now remind us how false that comparison was w may have been more controversial but he was decisive unshakeable charismatic and connected with crowds in a way the bookish distracted and low energy jeb has not been so far for four months pundits wrote off the flamboyant donald trump for his brash name calling political inexperience bombast over the top narcissism and even his wild dyed combed over hair but the wheeler dealer mr trump only rose in the polls each time pundits wrote his epitaph why mr trump s candidacy was largely created by underestimated popular outrage over the federal government s politically motivated refusal to enforce immigration law that issue divides elites who are not so much affected by their own open borders advocacy from the middle classes who certainly are mr trump saw that angry divide and so far has brilliantly capitalized on it illegal immigration sent the trump candidacy from nowhere to front runner status in much the same way that uncontrolled borders have all but imploded the once popular german chancellor angela merkel after barack obama s two successful presidential elections liberal and supposedly far more inclusive democrats declared themselves the only party that looks like the new multiracial america republicans in contrast were written off as mostly old white fogies has beens bitterly clinging to their fading prior privilege the campaign has exploded that myth too the republican field is far more diverse although the candidates see their ethnicity as incidental rather than essential in bumper sticker fashion to their personas the candidates include the young 44 year old ted cruz bobby jindal and marco rubio the ethnically diverse mr cruz mr jindal mr rubio and ben carson and successful outsiders who do not have political backgrounds mr carson mr trump and carly fiorina in contrast the democrat candidates appear far older are all white and are all political has beens multimillionaire hillary rodham clinton alone boasts of her female status in a way her republican counterpart mrs fiorina does not but hillary is neither young nor a fresh outsider she represents half of a tired clinton dynasty whose old boy network of wall street washington insider big money politics goes back well into the last century mr obama polls poorly especially among conservatives his team often hints that racism is the culprit but the meteoric candidacy of dr carson an arch conservative african american who in some states is outpolling front runner mr trump illustrates that mr obama s divisive left wing agendas along with his failed economic and foreign policies are what finally turned off more than half the country not his race media bias is usually dismissed as the whine of conservative crybabies but anyone who saw last week s cnbc debate noticed the embarrassing difference between the interviewers treatment of republicans and how cnn had conducted its democratic debate earlier last month suddenly an emboldened media gave up all pretense of objectivity in a brash way not seen since 2012 when presidential debate moderator candy crawley jumped in to help mr obama s floundering defense after mitt romney had criticized the administration s handling of the benghazi attack hostile cnbc moderators grilled republicans with gotcha questions along the lines of how long have you been beating your wife in contrast cnn moderators in the democratic debate created a love fest between front runners mrs clinton and bernard sanders and mostly ignored the back of the pack candidates usually an impartial media is not so crude in its liberal bias but this time the prejudices were so flagrant that they finally boomeranged on a discredited cnbc whose moderators limped home from the debate licking their self inflicted wounds conventional wisdom also stated that governors make far better candidates and presidents than do senators supposedly they are not washington insiders have executive experience and actually ran something but so far there is not a single former or sitting governor among the front runners of either party in fact the most successful past or present governors mr bush mr jindal chris christie mike huckabee john kasich george pataki rick perry scott walker and martin o malley struggle in the polls or have already quit the race perhaps give and take governors have to make compromises and sound namby pamby in the debates and on the stump senators and outsiders do and talk as they please and seem more savvy about the media and about raising big money the campaign has just started and already past wisdom is proving to be ignorance with more
