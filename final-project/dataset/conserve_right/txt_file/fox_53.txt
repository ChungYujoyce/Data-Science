ent trump vows to uncover the origins of the russia investigation for all to see insight from republican senator lindsey graham this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday may 26 2019 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace anchor i aposm chris wallace president trump gives his attorney general sweeping power to declassify intelligence related to the russian investigation as his war of words with speaker pelosi escalates dramatically begin videotape rep nancy pelosi d ca speaker of the house we believe that the president of the united states is engaged in a cover up donald trump president of the united states get these phone investigations over with pelosi i wish his family or his administration or his staff would have an intervention trump she is not the same person she lost it wallace we aposll discuss the president aposs latest moves and the standoff with house democrats with republican senator lindsey graham it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive then trump the i word can you imagine pelosi the white house is just crying out for impeachment that aposs why he flipped yesterday wallace we aposll ask congressman eric swalwell one of the many democrats running for president about prospects for impeachment plus president trump orders 1 500 more u s troops to the middle east to counter the threat from iran mike pompeo secretary of state forty years of terror coming out of the islamic republic of iran and president trump is determined to change the course of that regime wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel if the u s is headed for another war in the region all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again on this memorial day weekend from fox news in washington president trump is in japan today leaving behind a nation aposs capital here more unsettled than ever the president and speaker pelosi continue to attack each other trade talks with china at a standstill and now mr trump is giving his attorney general authority to declassify intelligence about how the russia probe started in a moment we aposll talk with south carolina senator lindsey graham but first john roberts traveling with the president in tokyo begin videotape john roberts fox news chief white house correspondent it was a first for president trump a guest of honor at a sumo wrestling championship the president long a fan of american wrestling handing out the 70 pound trophy to the winner japanese prime minister shinzo abe is eager to show off his friendship with the president earlier taking him for a round of golf but most importantly inviting him tomorrow to be the first international leader to meet japan aposs newly enthroned emperor naruhito while pomp and ceremony will take up part of the visit the prickly issue of trade will also take center stage as president trump still works to reduce the 58 billion trade deficit with japan trump the prime minister and i talked a lot today about trade and military and various other things i think we had a very productive day roberts the strains over trade aside the trip is a welcome respite for the president from investigations and swirling talk about impeachment back home add to that new criticism that giving attorney general william barr sweeping the power to declassify documents about the origins of the russia investigation could imperil national security trump i don apost care about payback i think it aposs very important for our country to find out what happened end videotape roberts on trade with japan president trump told fox news earlier today that he will wait until after elections in japan in july to really push for a new trade deal and in a tweet the president appeared to contradict his national security advisor john bolton who said on saturday that north korea aposs firing of missiles into the sea of japan was a violation of the united nations security council resolutions president trump said he aposs not worried about it and believes that kim will live up to his commitment the promise he made to president trump to eventually denuclearize chris wallace john roberts reporting live from tokyo john thanks for that and joining us now from south carolina republican senator lindsey graham chair of the senate judiciary committee senator president trump as we just reported has given attorney general barr quote full and complete authority to get in declassify all government secrets related to the russia investigation here is the president begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i declassified everything everything they want i put it under the auspices of the attorney general he aposs going to be in charge of it end video clip wallace senator any problem with that sen lindsey graham r sc senate judiciary committee chairman no not at all from my point of view i was one of the republicans insisting that mueller be allowed to do his job i never thought it was a witch hunt the report is in no collusion no you know mueller didn apost do anything on obstruction now i aposm insisting that we get to the bottom of this i want all the documents around the fisa warrant application released i want to find out exactly how the counterintelligence operation began i think transparency is good for the american people not one democrat seems to care i was the hero when i said let aposs support mueller i wish some democrat would come forward to find out if the fisa court was defrauded by the fbi and the department of justice so i support attorney general barr to make this as transparent as possible wallace critics make two points particularly about this issue of declassify because these are after all the crown jewels of the intelligence community including reportedly the identity of a key informant was close to vladimir putin here are the two questions that they raised one can barr be trusted with these secrets and two can he be trusted not to cherry pick the information to make a case for the president graham well i think he can be trusted i aposm going to look at this you know nobody doubted my trust or my ability to be fair when i supported mueller the people who are about this are worried about being exposed for taking the law in their own hands it doesn apost surprise me that the people we are looking at they don apost want transparency we aposre not compromising national security here we aposre trying to create a system to make sure this never happens again by shedding light on what happened with the fisa warrant process the counterintelligence investigation did they have a lawful reason to surveilled president trump aposs campaign did they lie to the fisa court every american should want to find that out wallace the other big story in washington this week is the extraordinary war of words between president trump and speaker pelosi the president ended up saying that house democrats have a choice they can either legislate or investigate here he is begin video clip trump i walked into the room and i told senator schumer speaker pelosi i want to do infrastructure but you know what you can apost do it under the circumstances so get these phony investigations over with end video clip wallace you have made it clear senator you disapprove of what the democrats are doing to the president but you also say that he can apost allow them to goad him into ignoring the nation aposs problems graham yes what started off as nancy pelosi is writing a bucking wild bronco called the democratic caucus seventy percent of the democratic base throughout america wants president trump impeached she knows that impeachment would be political suicide because there aposs no reason to impeach the president so she aposs trying to keep the party intact if she goes down the impeachment road republicans take back the house we keep the senate president trump gets reelected but her job is very much at risk so what i think is going to happen here i think that she aposs going to be driven towards impeachment if she goes down that road it will be suicide for the democratic party from president trump aposs point of view i disagree with the idea that you can apost work with them while they aposre doing things like this you have to work with him if you can apost control mr president with the democrats do but you can control what you do and you need to leave this country to better bridges and roads and lower prescription drug prices they say no to you that will help you they say yes with you and work with you that will help the country so i don apost believe that the idea of working with the democrats should be taken off the table because they aposre going too far wallace you call all of what aposs going on here in washington a political circus but you took it a different view back when you were leaving the impeachment effort against bill clinton back in the late apos90s at that time graham right wallace you said that any president and you talked specifically about clinton and richard nixon who defied congress when it came to subpoenas was in danger of impeachment here you are back then begin video clip graham you aposre becoming the judge and jury it is not your job to tell us what we need it is our job to comply with the things we need to provide oversight over you end video clip wallace question why is it an impeachable offense for clinton or nixon back then to ignore congressional subpoenas but it aposs ok for president trump to do now graham well there aposs two things here the mueller investigation was a special counsel appointed to find out if the president committed a crime if he colluded with the russians if he obstructed justice the president gave him 1 4 million documents to mueller everybody around the president was allowed to testify he never claimed executive privilege he complied no cover up worked with mueller mueller is the final word on this for me so if clinton had stiffed ken starr that aposs different what nadler is doing is trying to destroy the president and his family if i were the president i aposd fight back against this political revenge coming out of the house mueller was the man of the law mueller was an independent voice that we all trusted to be fair i don apost trust house democrats to be fair they aposre trying to redo the mueller report they aposre trying to make up other stuff and at the end of the day it will be political suicide for them to impeach if i were the president i would fight nadler tooth and nail i aposm glad he cooperated with mueller that aposs the difference wallace as we have reported the president today i don apost know maybe it was today maybe it was yesterday this time differences with japan confuse me the president tweeted this and i want to put it up on the screen north korea fired off some small weapons which excuse me which disturbed some of my people and others but not me i have confidence that chairman kim will keep his promise to me do you share the president aposs conference in kim and how do you square that with the fact that his own national security advisor the president aposs national security advisor john bolton said just the day before that the firing of these missiles was a violation of u n resolutions graham i don apost think it aposs remotely possible that chairman kim will give up his nuclear weapons until he feels the threat to do so i aposm glad the president is engaging him all those before president trump failed on their watch and president trump has finally got kim jong un aposs attention but i aposm not naive about this i think they aposre trying to run out the clock on president trump the only way kim will give up his nuclear weapons if he believes he aposs better off without them and you aposve got to make the threat of military force real if he continues to develop missiles and bombs directed at america what we do in venezuela and what we do in iran will make a difference as to how kim reacts to us in north korea wallace i want to get to both of those trouble spots in a moment but just to go back you say that he needs to in effect present a threat to kim so what good does it do or do you think it was a mistake to tweet out that some of my advisors were upset about firing these muscles but not me and that he has confidence in kim to keep his promise graham i think is trying to give north korea some space to come back to the table and end this but like every other president he is trying very hard to stop the nuclear advancements of north korea i think he aposs made more progress than other presidents because he aposs engaging him personally but president trump will be judged by the outcome it aposs not the process at the end of the day did kim give up his nuclear arsenal on president trump aposs watch in return for security and prosperity we are a long way from there but i hope we can get there i aposll give trump the space he needs to deal with kim but i will remind the president that you have to deliver on this this is one of the signature issues of your administration wallace all right let aposs talk about iran presidents and a 1 500 more troops to the middle east to counter the threat in iran and also he says as part of the counter to the threat to iran he has announced arms sales on an emergency basis 8 billion in arms sales to saudi arabia the united arab emirates and jordan any problem with the president going around congress and particularly when it comes to arms sales to saudi arabia continuing to do business with the regime that slaughtered jamaal khashoggi graham yes i aposve got a real problem with going back to doing business as usual with saudi arabia jordan is a great ally the uae has been problematic in yemen but a good ally saudi arabia is a strategic ally but the crown prince was in my opinion involved in the murder of mr khashoggi and he aposs done a lot of other disruptive things so i don apost i don apost support the arms sales now but i do support american troops going in to the mideast in larger numbers to deter iran let there be no doubt from my point of view the threat against american personnel in iraq coming from iran particularly shiite militia controlled by the ayatollah was real i aposm glad abraham lincoln is in the region i aposm glad we are sending more troops and why is this happening the maximum pressure campaign against iran is working great if you can play oil from iran anymore without being sanctioned yourself and the iranian revolutionary guard the henchmen of the ayatollah now are subject to sanctions their terrorist organization so president trump is putting a lot of pressure on iran they aposre trying to break our will and this is an effort to deter iranian aggression not to invade iran wallace senator i aposve got two more issues i want to squeeze them both and if i can if the president is reportedly considering issuing pardons around memorial day around tomorrow to service members that were either convicted or accused of committing war crimes here aposs how the president explains it begin video clip trump we are looking at a lot of different pardons for a lot of different people some of these soldiers are people that have fought hard long you know we teach them how to be great fighters and then when they fight sometimes they get really treated very unfairly wallace as someone who spent three decades as a military lawyer and then a military judge how do you feel about the president aposs possibly granting parties to people accused or convicted of war crimes graham well it depends on what case you aposre talking about i don apost mind the president looking at these cases but mayor pete said he shouldn apost pardon anybody i spent a lot of time in the region we had a situation where we would catch the terrorists because the legal system was so broken in iraq and afghanistan there would be right back on the streets the next day that was frustrating to our soldiers but we also had a case where a young man went in and murdered a family and raped the daughter that aposs not the conduct we want military justice is about good order and discipline and dealing with crimes so the rules of engagement conduct there are a lot of people had to make snap decisions under a tremendous amount of pressure look at these cases individually let the military justice system work its will make sure that every soldier is looked at as an individual there was a time in iraq where and afghanistan if we caught a terrorist they would be right back on the street in a matter of days and that was frustrating to our troops but again we are an ethical force we are well trained in the military justice system is designed to maintain good order and discipline look at these as individuals not holistically wallace ok i aposve got about a minute left on going to ask for a quick answer here you had a tough article in the wall street journal this week in which he said that the u s really needs to get much tougher in venezuela you said we need to order cuba to get all of their forces out of venezuela immediately and to even talk about the u s invading venezuela like ronald reagan invaded granada really graham yes really so here aposs the deal we are being tested in north korea iran syria assad is going into it idlib now there aposs a lot of pressure on the trump administration and trump said rightly maduro is not the legitimate leader of venezuela the entire region supports the trump approach that guaido is the legitimate leader he wouldn apost be in power without 6 000 or 7 000 cuban security forces in venezuela i would do exactly what reagan did i would give cuba an ultimatum to get out of venezuela if they don apost i would let the venezuelan military know you got to choose between democracy and maduro and if you choose maduro and cuba we are coming after you this is in our backyard trump said that he was for democracy against socialism wallace right graham and he has drawn a red line when it comes to maduro if he doesn apost ask everybody in the world is going to think he aposs weak if he does act it helps us with north korea iran russia and everybody else wallace senator graham thank you we covered a lot of ground thank you for sharing part of your memorial day weekend with us it aposs always good to talk with you sir graham thank you wallace up next democrats are ready to take on the president but split whether impeachment is going too far we aposll discuss where things stand with congressman and 2020 hopeful eric swalwell next commercial break wallace democratic calls for impeachment are growing with revelations from the mueller report and president trump rejecting congressional subpoenas but house speaker nancy pelosi says that aposs what the president wants figuring impeachment will backfire on her party joining us now from new hampshire congressman and 2020 democratic presidential candidate eric swalwell congressman let aposs start with the new powers that i discussed with lindsey graham that the president is granting to the attorney general to declassify all secret information about the russia probe the special counsel robert mueller was given 22 months to investigate whether donald trump had colluded with the russians why not give the attorney general the power to conduct this investigation rep eric swalwell d ca presidential candidate good morning chris and also this memorial day weekend i just want to thank the gold star families for their sacrifice of their family members but chris what concerns me about this order by the president is that he is asking our intelligence community to essentially not do the job that we are asking them to do the next time they may see something like this this is to put a chilling effect into place so if you aposre an fbi agent and you get a tip that a foreign adversary is seeking to help either the republicans are the democrats in his upcoming election you aposre going to think twice about that because you may be attacked by this president or you may lose your job and if we step back and look back at what happened in 2016 they may not have amounted to the crime of conspiracy but i don apost think anybody can read those 200 pages of contact that the trump team had with the russians and say we want this to happen again in 2020 i think this is an abuse crosstalk wallace i aposm going to get to that in a second but let aposs go back to the barr investigation because some would argue if anybody in the fbi or the intelligence agencies did something wrong we should find out about it if they didn apost do anything wrong than the investigation will turn up nothing swalwell that aposs right and the inspector general has already looking at that but for the president of the united states to instruct the attorney general to do that again it looks like he is using the attorney general to be his personal lawyer rather than having attorney general look at whether there are still ongoing threats to our country and you said the mueller report did not find any collusion we should also remember mueller did not look at the financial aspect of donald trump and his family foster his dealings with russians that was a red line we aposre going to look at that an intelligence committee because we are not convinced that the president is not compromised so this work continues wallace all right i want to pick up on exactly that because you are one of the democrats leading the charge for years that the president his team colluded with the russians in the investigation the election of 2016 here you are just days before the mueller report was handed over to the attorney general begin video clip unidentified male do you believe the president himself colluded with the russians swalwell yes so the president knew the russians were seeking to help them and so he went out as a candidate and invited them to hack more unidentified male do you believe there is direct evidence that the present included swalwell his invitation for them to hack more that aposs direct evidence of inviting them to collude end video clip wallace but congressman the special counsel directly contradicts you volume one page five of the report the investigation did not establish that members of the trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the russian government in its election interference activities congressman the mueller report spent 22 months look at all the evidence says you were wrong swalwell it did not say that chris actually it played out 200 pages of contact between the campaigns and because a prior congress had a failure of imagination to specifically articulate a crime of collusion doesn apost mean a future congress shouldn apost say we don apost want this to happen i respect the special counsel aposs finding of the laws we have today and with the limitations of not being able to look at finances he could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt conspiracy i don apost accept that this is what we want a president or a candidate to do so i aposve written legislation to put an onus on any campaign family member or candidate if they have this type of outreach crosstalk wallace congressman let aposs take a look at the one case you gave there on that msnbc interview you said well the president called for more hacking i mean seriously i remember that vividly most americans do it was in july after the hacking of the dnc and the president then donald trump holds a press conference and says well you know if the russians want to find those 30 000 emails that hillary clinton deleted i aposm sure the media will be interested in that you can apost possibly think that is collusion swalwell well chris what are the russians do next the mueller report lays out that they undertook more hacking within hours of that and crosstalk wallace and you think that was an order i mean you think that was an order from donald trump you don apost think the russians were already in fact probably already doing it swalwell i don apost believe in coincidences with the russians and your last guest he used to not believe in coincidences with the russians until he got too close to donald trump wallace if mr trump colluded with the russians if he obstructed justice as you claim both of those you claim why not move to impeach the president you aposre one of the democrats was not calling for that yet swalwell yes and chris you just pointed out no one is going to question how hard i fought while our democracy has been on the line but i also believe dearly in the rule of law i was a prosecutor and i know when i go to court i got to have my pencil sharpened my subpoenas ready and my witnesses and exhibits ready to go you only get one shot at this i want to make sure we get it right i think that means first getting the full mueller report unredacted getting mueller to testify himself getting people like don mcgahn in and so we are pressing that and we are winning in the courts right now the president is outnumbered with the subpoena power and the court rulings that are on our side i think that aposs a road would go down but we are not going to do donald trump justice here because we only get one shot to make sure the rule of law still stands in america wallace meanwhile we have the standoff now between speaker pelosi and president trump she accused him of a cover up an hour before she was going to meet with him on infrastructure no concern that if you continue to pursue this the subpoenas the insults that the allegations of lawbreaking that you will fail to do the people aposs business whether it aposs infrastructure or funding the government or raising the debt limit swalwell donald trump is not the first president chris to be investigated but he is the first president to be investigated and not be able to work with congress richard nixon bill clinton they still had production while there was perceived obstruction and this president is doing a disservice to the american people by just walking away from our obligation to build roads green our grid to work on gun violence we sent a background check over to the senate and he aposs missing that opportunity i also want to say something that doesn apost help this debate is the distortion that we are seeing on facebook or even by fox business news by taking with the president is saying about nancy pelosi and distorting and altering video of her to suggest that there something wrong with her health that really just means the conversation wallace i understand that as part of moving your bones as a democrat to attack fox news we have you here we aposre treating you fairly let aposs move on ok congressman swalwell yes wallace all right swalwell but it distorts the debate and it aposs something the russians did in the 2016 election i just don apost think that facebook and the president should be conducting themselves that way wallace all right well we aposll talk about facebook and the president you aposre one of the two dozen democrats running for president and i want to put up on the screen the latest polls because nationally we have you at zero percent we don apost that aposs the latest monmouth university poll and your 1 percent in iowa which is the state where you were born question sir why run for president when there are so many candidates i get this to thousands now democratic candidates and you aposre so far behind swalwell yes well chris you know i aposm from a generation that is paying the price on climate change i took my kid to school for orientation last week and i saw you know while i was thinking about things that most parents didn apost have to think about a generation before which is whether he aposs going to be safe or not and when it comes to our health care were paying so much out of our pocket today that i feel a responsibility to run i was the first in the family to go to college but i see that my generation is going to see worse than the next generation and i aposm going to do something about that and i aposm not going to give up it aposs early in the race and i aposm going to keep fighting wallace congressman swalwell thank you thanks for your time safe travels on the campaign trail sir swalwell my pleasure thanks chris wallace coming up we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss president trump aposs decision to let the attorney general declassify intelligence on the russia probe plus what would you like to ask the panel about whether the president can work with congress amid the partisan gridlock just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up president trump and speaker pelosi spar over investigations begin video clip donald trump president of the united states let them get rid of the nonsense first but you can apost go down two tracks at the same time rep nancy pelosi d ca we can walk and chew gum at the same time i hope he can too end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel with the feud means for taking care of the nation aposs business next on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states it was an attempted coup or an attempted takedown of the president of the united states it should never ever happen to anybody else end video clip wallace president trump explaining why he aposs giving attorney general barr power to declassify information related to the origins of the russia investigation and it aposs time now for our sunday group jonah goldberg of the national review peter baker from the new york times and author of obama the call of history liz marlantes politics editor for the christian science monitor and fox news correspondent gillian turner well gillian you have good sources inside the intelligence community how strong is the pushback to the president aposs decision to give barr access to this information both in terms of concern about the security of the information and also concern that he might use it to make a political case for the president gillian turner fox news correspondent so up until now only two people in the entire government had the power to essentially snap their fingers and declassify any information any intelligence they wanted and that aposs the president and that is the director of national intelligence dan coats so what the president has done confers tremendous new powers on the attorney general now the challenge according to the intelligence community my sources there is really this sets up a potential epic battle between the attorney general and between the director of national intelligence because what happens if somewhere along this investigation barr decides to declassify information and then on the back end the director of national intelligence says wait wait wait wait this was this went way too far this compromises national security this compromises intelligence operatives around the world maybe puts their lives at risk what happens then and nobody knows because there isn apost really a precedent wallace so there aposs heartburn turner there there aposs a lot of angst about how this could play out wallace peter what aposs your sense of what the president hopes to accomplish by giving barr this information and the the runway to to have this investigation and of course barr has called in the u s attorney from connecticut does he really think that this investigation is going to turn up a deep state effort to take him down either in the campaign or as president or do you get the sense from his people that he sees it more as well this will keep people chattering about something else while the house continues to investigate peter baker the new york times yes i think both things can be true i do think he honestly believes that he has been targeted and he feels very aggrieved about what has happened and he thinks that if they root around in there that they aposll find some you know misdoing by the obama administration and they aposll be able to to prove it at the but there aposs also a convenient and useful political narrative right the narrative isn apost what i did wrong the narrative is what the investigators did wrong and let aposs make sure we focus on that rather than try to redo the mueller report it aposs a way of keeping his supporters focused on what matters most in his mind which is the misdeeds of his enemies and his perceived adversaries wallace which brings us to the remarkable standoff this week and we aposve seen a lot of it but this took the cake at least for today between the president and speaker of the house nancy pelosi here aposs just a taste this week begin video clip donald trump president of the united states crying chuck crazy nancy i tell you what i aposve been watching her and i have i have been watching her for a long period of time she aposs not the same person she aposs lost it rep nancy pelosi d ca i pray for the president of the united states i wish that his family or his administration or his staff would have an intervention for the good of the country end video clip wallace we asked you for questions for the panel about this showdown and tamara hyland sent this on facebook is impeachment the only remedy that democrats will be satisfied with from all of the investigations they need to get back to work it aposs partially a question and partially a statement jonah how do you answer tamara jonah goldberg national review look i aposm sort of an outlier on this i think that congress can impeach anything they want if a grand jury can indict a ham sandwich congress has the power to impeach someone for eating a ham sandwich they just have to do it they have to have the political will to do it it has to be in their political interest to do it and right now nancy pelosi believes it aposs not in their political interest to do it there are lots of rank and file based democrats who think it is in their political or it aposs the right thing to do and it will have to be just sort of worked out i think that nancy pelosi aposs probably right on the political calculation and wallace that it would be a mistake goldberg that it would be a mistake but also just to get to this weird standoff you know one of the things i think people miss is that donald trump aposs superpower is the ability to destroy republicans by giving them you know nicknames and insults and all that kind of stuff there aposs very little evidence it works the same way against democrats and so when he starts attacking nancy pelosi this way or chuck schumer this way he can apost riling his base against those people doesn apost weaken them the way it would weaken a republican and so this is not going to play out the same way we aposve seen this play out before where he destroys someone like jeff flake or even justin amash right now because he can apost marshal his troops in the same way he can with a republicans wallace liz to sort of go past this though who runs more of a risk if nothing gets done in washington over the next year and a half is it president trump and the republicans are nancy pelosi and the democrats liz marlantes christian science monitor i think it depends i mean i think for example infrastructure is what got derailed this week that was president trump aposs most popular campaign promise two thirds of americans when he took office said that they wanted him to do something on infrastructure and it hasn apost happened it aposs actually quite interesting to think about what would have happened if he tackled that first if that had been the very first thing he tried to do in office we might have had a very different two and a half years than what we aposve had goldberg but infrastructure aposs been in our hearts all along marlantes oh yes we all want we all want infrastructure to happen turner well also nancy pelosi took a dramatic behavioral like left turn this week because up until now she aposs been all about you know when they go low we go high she arguably went lower than the president this week and that aposs going to hurt her marlantes and so some extent you could say she took a page out of his playbook and i do think part of it was to distract from this growing drumbeat for impeachment that is coming up within her own caucus wallace but but you know for all the talk about and i want i want to bring peter in on this for all the talk on infrastructure there wasn apost going to be an infrastructure deal was there i mean if they had if she hadn apost said what she aposd said and they aposd met in the room when it got to the fundamentals of how big of the the the program going to be who aposs going to pay for it where aposs the money going to come from marlantes absolutely no absolutely i mean that is a factor of you know congress is kind of broken right now congress seems unable to do pretty much anything we have divided government the house democrats would tell you they have passed 50 bills since taking office or since they took the majority and and the senate has taken up almost none of them so you know we aposre in a situation where it aposs pretty clear to everybody that nothing is going to get done and so the question is you know to what extent can they make the politics work in their favor wallace peter i want to pick up on the president who came out dramatically to the rose garden after his three minutes in the room and we aposve heard from a half dozen of his top aides that he was very calm and very very resolute baker right wallace at some point the president said you aposve got to choose either legislate or investigate at some point doesn apost he have to do business with democrats baker yes wallace i mean you aposve got to fund the government you aposve got to raise the debt limit i know he desperately wants maybe more than infrastructure to pass this straight deal with mexico and canada so i mean he really can apost freeze out the democrats for the next year and a half baker look on all the basic blocking and tackling they aposre going to have to do something they aposre going to have to as you say pass a debt limit increase and keep a government open presumably this disaster relief bill that aposs sort of making its way to the president will eventually get there the question is whether they can move the country forward in a big way more than just treading water right there aposs a treading water kind of piece of legislation infrastructure is something where we actually could move forward the usmca the new trade deal with mexico and canada is something we can move the country forward that aposs where the harder things are going to be and this is the difference with bill clinton right we you and i were around and bill clinton jonah like when bill clinton was under impeachment he would never have talked about his enemies and impeachment if he could help it right he wanted to actually look at least like he was trying to focus on the people aposs business and that worked to his benefit his number went up wallace no you aposre saying i can apost i can apost waste time on this i aposve got to go back baker those guys are dealing in the muddy stuff and i care about your problems his numbers went up they didn apost get a lot done but his numbers went up trump on the other hand can apost help talking about it loves talking about it engages in the fight the fight is what animates him and maybe in this current moment with twitter and social media and the prevalence of cable news that aposs the only way to do business it aposs certainly the only way he knows how to do business but it aposs a big difference in 20 years wallace all right marlantes and the biggest the biggest risk i would say for trump in this particular situation is that he comes across as seeming like he aposs more concerned with his own political wellbeing than the go of the country wallace all right marlantes and that is a risk for him wallace and we have to take a break here when we come back the president orders more forces to the middle east how does that square with his promise to bring troops home our panel ways in next commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we aposre going to be sending a relatively small number of troops mostly protective and some very talented people are going to the middle east right now and we aposll see how and we aposll see what happens end video clip wallace president trump announcing his decision friday to send 1 500 more troops to the middle east responding to what he says is an increased threat from iran and we aposre back now with the panel gillian two interesting develops with iran this week first of all sending those 1 500 more troops not to iran but to the middle east also the president announcing an emergency arms sale as a counter to iran 8 billion in arms sales to saudi arabia and the united arab emirates and jordan what message do you think the president is sending to iran turner well the message that he aposs intending to send to iran is that we aposre choosing sides in the ongoing civil war in yemen we aposre choosing saudi arabia aposs side every day we aposve been choosing their side for five years and we aposre going to continue to do that the challenge with this weapons sale is is not necessarily that he aposs bypassing congress i personally believe the he aposs got the legal authority he needs to do that if he believes it aposs in the national interest the problem in all of this is saudi arabia because the question becomes what is saudi arabia going to do with those weapons and the answer to that question is they aposre going to continue to drop dirty bombs in yemen as they aposve been doing for at least four years dirty bombs being bombs that kill civilians indiscriminately and that aposs a that aposs a very big problem and i think the administration thinking geostrategically about this is not really thinking about that and from the foreign policy community from a diplomatic immunity aposs perspective that is the number one you know hot button issue in all of this and i have yet to hear the president or anyone in the administration really address that wallace well in fact more than not think about it when congress voted to end u s involvement with saudi arabia and yemen the president vetoed it so i mean they they aposre doubling down on that policy liz for all of the president aposs tough rhetoric about iran and other places here was another case and a pattern that we have seen where there was a lot of talk i mean the pentagon wanted 15 000 20 000 and he agreed to 1 500 i mean once again this is a president who really is reluctant to commit u s troops overseas marlantes yes i mean i think we aposre seeing almost like a good cop bad cop routine going on with the president and his own advisors but what aposs interesting on on this particular issue is trump is the one who seems to be backpedaling on almost every other issue when you see that or trade or whatever it aposs the advisors who are trying to rein him in and on this one you really get the feeling it aposs trump reigning in his advisors and you know he campaigned as a very different kind of republican on all of these issues he was outspoken in his opposition to the war in iraq and i think you know in terms of heading into the 2020 campaign he doesn apost want to be involved in a new military venture that is controversial that aposs really not his political identity at all wallace in the time that we have left i want to turn to another story the justice department late this week issued another indictment in the case of julian assange charging him with violating the espionage act by working to obtain and disseminate secret documents what you aposre looking at there is him being hauled out of the ecuadorian embassy a couple of weeks ago jonah free press advocates are saying well yes look assange is a bad guy but by accusing him or indicting him for what he did as a violation of the espionage act you aposre also it aposs an assault on the first amendment and what reporters do how much sympathy do you have for that concern goldberg i have sympathy for the concern i have zero sympathy for assange wallace right goldberg i think he aposs a force for evil but it is true when you read the indictment when you read the paperwork it sounds like it could be they could be describing the new york times or the washington post or fox news in terms of thinking blaming the recipients of classified information for the government aposs inability to keep their own secrets gillian but he wasn apost just the recipient goldberg no that aposs right so the thing is where i draw a distinction or where where i aposm waiting to withhold judgment is to find out in the actual details of a prosecution how much the because what julian assange really is is a cutout for russian intelligence and if they if he behaved in that way and was basically a proxy of a foreign power and not acting as a journalist then he deserves whatever he gets coming to him and that aposs a safe harbor for mainstream journalists inaudible wallace let me bring peter into this the new york times was mentioned baker yes wallace can apost prosecutors or if necessary in terms of changing the law congress make a distinction between what julian assange did and we aposll get into the details of it and the very different things that reporters do baker yes and they did look when the justice department came out with the indictment they said look we aposre not targeting journalists this is not meant to we think this is different than what journalists do we think journalists behave responsibly in their you know even when they have information we would just chose they not have they they look at it responsibly the new york times when we publish stories based on classified information doesn apost just throw it on the website willy nilly we try to verify it we talk to the government about what might be you know dangerous to individuals wallace but you aposve got to know some of your colleagues baker but wallace are concerned that this is a slippery slope baker and and that aposs the point is the distinctions that he made that the national security official the justice department made are all well and good but they aposre a matter of policy not principle and i don apost know whether legally you can make a distinction between responsible behavior by journalists and irresponsible behavior by people who act as journalists and that aposs when you get really really fuzzy then you start having the government decided you aposve acted responsible you haven apost and there aposs no distinction in the first amendment between responsible action and irresponsible action as long as it aposs truthful wallace but and let me bring you into this gillian because when you look at specifically with assange is charged with doing he openly solicited this information in fact he even posted a list of quote most wanted leaks so he was he wasn apost just the recipient of this information i understand reporters are sometimes urging sources to give them information in addition to which once he got the information he published on the internet the names of people who had and basically been helping u s forces in iraq and afghanistan very much endangering their lives i guess i understand the concern about journalists being swept up in this but it seems to me that there ought to be a way to distinguish between the two turner there is to from my perspective having now worked on both sides of this in the national security community and then now as a journalist there is a very clear distinguishing line and it gets crossed when you conspire with your sources to actually commit illegal acts peter i aposm sure you aposre not on the phone with your sources giving them keys about how to navigate classified government systems to extract information and then disseminate that information that is where the line becomes drawn so if it aposs ultimately proven that he did assange did conspire with chelsey manning to help her obtain the tranche documents that she did he becomes an active participant in the illegal acts wallace but but the argument back would be they already had him on that because they aposd already charged him with conspiracy and that he was helping try to break the code for the for so that they could get into this information what you need the espionage act turner well because you have to you need the espionage act because you helped define the line between somebody who aposs serving as a foreign agent and somebody who is not so the espionage act comes into play when you aposre working for a foreign government and that is the that is the missing link in all of this that will come to light as jonah says over the course of the next several months probably whether assange was actually actively communicating with the russians on a daily basis to kind of enterprise all of this wallace thirty seconds are you persuaded by baker no i think that is a distinction i mean you aposre not a you aposre not a journalist if you aposre acting on behalf of a hostile foreign power and if that aposs what they end up proving the that at least draws that clear line you aposre talking about the question is whether they aposll get to that or not and we we have not seen anything yet about his actions in the 2016 election for instance when he seemed to be acting on behalf of moscow wallace all right thank you panel see you next sunday thanks so much for coming in on your holiday weekend up next our power player this memorial day weekend a man who aposs made it his life aposs work to honor veterans in 24 musical notes commercial break wallace we first met him ten years ago sharing the story of how he aposs worked to ensure all veterans receive a proper tribute it aposs become a memorial day tradition here and once again he aposs our power player of the week begin videotape tom day founder bugles across america when you aposre playing it it aposs only 24 notes but it aposs so meaningful to that family wallace tom day is talking about playing taps at the funerals of military veterans and he should know he aposs the founder and president of an organization called bugles across america wallace on camera all told how many funerals have you done since you started bugles across america day at 200 000 wallace really day in ten years right wallace voice over it started back in 2000 when congress gave every vet the right to a funeral with military honors including two uniformed officers to present a flag and play taps the problem was the military only had 500 bugler aposs so they sent someone to play a recorded taps on a boom box or an electronic device inside a bugle tom day who played in the marines in the apos50s didn apost like it day i call it stolen dignity that these veterans can apost get live taps when we are out there ready to perform live taps wallace so he started his organization recruiting 400 horn players within a year day now we have 6 270 horn players and we aposre doing 2 200 funerals a month wallace it aposs become quite an operation that day runs out of his basement near chicago families can go on his website to ask for a bugler a message is sent to every horn player within 100 miles of the funeral day gives away bugles and helps with uniforms while he gets support from foundations he runs a deficit every year wallace on camera how do you make up for the shortfall day i kind of make it up myself wallace 15 000 20 000 a year day probably ten you finish you know the last of the 24 notes you put the horn down and the flag has been presented then the family comes over the kisses the handshakes from these families there is nothing no amount of money could ever buy the feeling that i get from the family once i aposve finished the 24 notes wallace voice over with soldiers killed in iraq and afghanistan plus some 400 veterans of world war ii dying every day there is a flood of military funerals day says he wants to keep going until he dies then leave his organization in solid shape to carry on day i want every family to have live taps at that going away presentation of their veteran and it kind of tells the marines who are guarding the gates in heaven live taps we aposre going to let this veteran right in end videotape wallace what a lovely story day turns 80 years old next year he tells us playin
