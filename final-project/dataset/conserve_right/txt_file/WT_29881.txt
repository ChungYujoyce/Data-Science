tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn republicans cheered the news that the justice department has named a new investigator to probe the origins of the fbi s anti trump investigations in 2016 even as the scope of the probe expands to include intelligence agencies attorney general william p barr who on monday revealed he d named connecticut u s attorney john durham to probe the premise of the trump investigations has also roped in cia director gina haspel and director of national intelligence dan coats to help with the probe of their departments the associated press reported we wanted this a long time ago rep jim jordan ohio republican told the washington times i have been so impressed with the attorney general and his commitment to putting a team together and getting to the bottom of this top stories gop vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning the exact outlines of mr durham s investigation remain unclear and it s also not immediately apparent what it means for john huber the u s attorney in utah whom then attorney general jeff sessions had named in 2017 to look at some of the same ground mr jordan described it as a change of pitcher in order to get things going sometimes the manager has to make a trip to the mound and make a change mr jordan said we haven t heard anything from john huber indeed it was republicans frustration with mr huber s lack of public progress that fueled calls for a new special counsel to get to the bottom of the obama administration s efforts to snare the trump campaign mr barr rather than name a special counsel told lawmakers he ll oversee the review himself and now he has a point man to gather the information mr durham s probe will be the third examining the actions of the fbi and justice department related to the 2016 probe justice department inspector general michael e horowitz has commenced an investigation and is expected to release a report this month or next as a u s attorney mr durham can extend his probe beyond the limits of the inspector general whose power is constrained to only current government employees president trump while denying he had a hand in the move said he was glad to see it i am so proud of our attorney general that he is looking into it the president told reporters tuesday i think it s great the president had been among those agitating for a look at how the obama administration treated him during the campaign mr trump s calls grew stronger after special counsel robert mueller concluded his investigation revealing there was no evidence of conspiracy between the campaign and russia to subvert the election the charge that the fbi had been pursuing mr durham brings a sterling reputation to his task he s also had bipartisan backing in the past including his 2017 nomination to serve as u s attorney in connecticut where the state s two democratic senators recommended him and praised him as a fierce and fair prosecutor he led numerous government corruption probes for attorneys general from both parties including exposing fbi agents who d been turned by mobster james whitey bulger both the bush and obama administrations meanwhile asked him to lead probes into matters dealing with cia interrogation of terrorism suspects mr durham has already quietly been working for months on a related inquiry into politically motivated leaks and the hartford courant reported he s built a team of investigators giving him a head start on the probe into 2016 decision making by the obama administration republicans say they see plenty of fishy activity to investigate including the fbi deploying informants to try to get close to the campaign and using a now discredited democratic opposition research document the steele dossier to help justify a secret surveillance warrant on a trump campaign adviser mr barr has called those activities spying though he says it remains to be seen whether the spying was justified senate judiciary chairman lindsey graham who had been agitating for a special counsel and had vowed his own probe said tuesday he was going to step back and let mr durham go at it we finally have somebody outside of politics he said i don t want to get in their way i don t want to mess up his criminal investigation and i don t want to put people at risk so i m going to back off one democrat called the probe a total distraction saying the fbi was correctly investigating whether russia was interfering with the 2016 election mr mueller uncovered plenty of evidence that russia sought to manipulate the election according to the 448 page redacted report the investigation had nothing to do with the steele dossier it frankly had nothing to do with the trump campaign it was on actionable intelligence from foreign ambassadors concerned that our democracy was under threat rep ro khanna of california told cnn sol wisenberg a former deputy on kenneth starr s whitewater investigation said mr durham s background demonstrates the importance mr barr is placing on this investigation it shows me that barr is really serious he said as a u s attorney mr durham will have access to subpoena powers and a grand jury just as a special counsel would but those were the same selling points mr sessions s team used last year to justify putting mr huber on the case the two probes on the surface appear very similar mr huber was to review some of the early stages of the russia probe including a surveillance warrant the fbi obtained to watch trump campaign figure carter page it seems to me it is hard to separate the two of them mr wisenberg said mr durham s probe does appear to be more expansive on one front with the review extending beyond the fbi and justice department to inc
