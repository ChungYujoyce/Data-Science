disagree with the president on that one said dorothy louallen 87 of dunlap tennessee who described herself as a born again christian opposed to abortion i really don t think government and churches should be involved the poll also showed a majority of white evangelical protestants supporting higher taxes on the wealthy albeit by smaller margins than the other major religious groups surveyed as
