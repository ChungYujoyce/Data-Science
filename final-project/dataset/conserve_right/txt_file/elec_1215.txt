he said if you apos ve got a business you didn apos t build that somebody else made that happen romney spokeswoman andrea saul told foxnews com on monday that the remarks reflect just how unqualified he is to lead us to a real economic recovery they are also insulting to the hardworking entrepreneurs small business owners and job creators who are the backbone of our economy she said in an email the obama campaign though accused the romney campaign of launching a false attack to distract from questions over outsourcing tied to his former company bain capital campaign spokesman ben labolt defended the premise of obama apos s comment as president obama said those who start businesses succeed because of their individual initiative their drive hard work and creativity labolt said in a statement but there are critical actions we must take to support businesses and encourage new ones that means we need the best infrastructure a good education system and affordable domestic sources of clean energy those are investments we make not as individuals but as americans and our nation as a whole benefits from them kevin hassett an economist with the conservative american enterprise institute said obama apos s comments are so far from the current debate but setting the stage for the administration apos s tax argument obama is trying to create the intellectual space to take money away from people he apos s trying to say apos what you do on the playing field would never be possible without the help of the government apos he said obama apos s comment friday came just days after he urged congress to extend tax cuts enacted during the bush administration only to families earning less than 250 000 annually part of his argument that top earners have an obligation to pay more to trim the deficit there are a lot of wealthy successful americans who agree with me because they want to give something back the president said if you apos ve been successful you didn apos t get there

off the internet small business owner debbi somers who runs somers furniture in las vegas agreed with obama that there isn apos t any way that a small business owner can achieve their dream if they don apos t have the support of the government however somers who backed obama in 2008 and now supports romney said the notion that businesses owe their success to government isn apos t necessarily true we put in we work 80 hours and we live it we breathe it we sleep it she said the national federation of independent business said the president apos s unfortunate remarks over the weekend show an utter lack of understanding and appreciation for the people who take a huge personal risk and work endless hours to start a business and create jobs i apos m sure every small business owner who took a second mortgage on their home maxed out their credit cards or borrowed money from their own retirement savings to start their business disagrees strongly with president obama apos s claim they know that hard work does matter the group also said though hassett described obama apos s comments friday as far from the current debate they were not foreign to democratic talking points elizabeth warren
