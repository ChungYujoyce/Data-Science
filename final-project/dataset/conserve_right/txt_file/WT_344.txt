much swifter economic recoveries and less poverty than governors in the northeast and midwest with plans to keep their businesses and public places shut down for many more weeks to come mr moore said among the governors who get high marks in the study for protecting their economies from devastation are republicans ron desantis of florida brian kemp of georgia pete ricketts of nebraska kevin stitt of oklahoma kristi noem of south dakota bill lee of tennessee greg abbott of texas and mark gordon of wyoming and democrat jared polis of colorado governors receiving lower grades for putting their

fiscal rescue efforts but has called for a payroll tax cut for workers and a ban on federal aid to states and cities that serve as sanctuaries for illegal immigrants white house economic adviser larry kudlow said sunday that the administration wants to see how the 3 trillion in aid already approved helps families and businesses he made a point on cnn s state of the union of saying that i don t think anything s been decided yet on mr trump s push for a ban on aid to sanctuary states but mr kudlow wondered about another round of aid he noted that the small business administration approved loans and grants of more than 175 billion last week for the paycheck protection program bringing the total of that emergency aid to more than 500 billion he said 175 million americans have received federal assistance but we also want to look at some medium term items he mentioned a payroll tax holiday for workers significant tax deductions for business and entertainment a full tax write off of new business expenses for anything related to covid 19 and a shield to protect small businesses from liability if someone is exposed to the virus and files a lawsuit now it s time to look forward to economic growth incentives mr kudlow said governors are seeking a massive amount of state aid from washington house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat has floated a proposal of 1 trillion for states and cities mr hogan also appearing on state of the union said the message from the white house on state aid seems to sort of change almost on a daily basis sometimes several times a day i think we are going to need more help mr hogan said the president vice president and treasury secretary steven t mnuchin have already committed to it multiple times and now the message seems to be changing i m hoping we can put aside all this kind of divisiveness and partisanship because we just have to get this
