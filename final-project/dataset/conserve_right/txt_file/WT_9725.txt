apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap maneuvering over china s leadership succession is providing an opportunity for the powerful military to exert greater influence over decision making potentially dragging the government into a more confrontational stance with its neighbors and the united states the military has gained prominence in public life at a time when china s economic and diplomatic entanglement with the rest of the world is growing some generals and military strategists are fixtures in popular often nationalistic media usually calling for a harder line against other countries the armed forces have engaged in much publicized missions to protect chinese nationals in libya and other foreign countries whether this higher profile translates into increased influence in policy making is being watched as the political leadership enters a fraught succession the central committee made up of nearly 400 communist party elite drawn from government and the military closes an annual policy meeting tuesday ostensibly focused on cultural issues behind the scenes powerbrokers are networking over who will replace president hu jintao and many top members in his leadership when they begin stepping down a year from now top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus

movement in 1989 the party rewarded it with double digit percentage budget increases nearly every year this year s defense budget at about 91 5 billion is second only to the u s military s as a result the 2 3 million member military s professionalism and capabilities have grown giving it a larger say in foreign and defense policies with many chinese feeling proud about china s rising power and
