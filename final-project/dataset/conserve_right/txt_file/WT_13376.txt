apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap president donald trump is off way off on the u s trade deficit with china he repeatedly uses an inflated number for the trade gap as the world s two largest economies escalate their dispute over imports and exports he s also taking liberties as he makes his case for a new crackdown on the southern border to stop illegal immigration including requesting the deployment of the national guard here s a look at his recent comments top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump because of the trump administrations actions border crossings are at a still unacceptable 46 year low stop drugs tweet thursday the facts trump s numbers are dated and he s taking credit for a reduction in apprehensions at the southwest border that began before he took office the detentions tend to follow a predictable pattern the numbers begin to rise around january peak in the spring and fall as temperatures rise in the summer but fiscal year 2017 which lasted from oct 1 2016 to sept 30 2017 was an anomaly with numbers dipping after the 2016 election and plummeting after trump took office through april 2017 which logged the fewest arrests in a single month since the homeland security department was created in 2003 indeed thanks to that drop the 2017 fiscal year logged the fewest border patrol arrests in 45 years but and this is a big but the numbers have been slowly ticking up since that banner month of april and since the fall of 2017 the numbers have stabilized returning to the typical arrest rates seen in the 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 fiscal years the department of homeland security released new statistics this week that show 50 308 arrests in march a whopping 203 percent increase from march 2017 when there were only 16 588 arrests and up 37 percent from the previous month trump has called the spike a crisis though the numbers are on par with years prior apprehensions at the border are a useful but imperfect gauge of illegal crossing since nobody knows exactly how many people cross without being detected trump we are not in a trade war with china that war was lost many years ago by the foolish or incompetent people who represented the u s now we have a trade deficit of 500 billion a year with intellectual property theft of another 300 billion we cannot let this continue tweet wednesday trump when you re already 500 billion down you can t lose tweet wednesday the facts he overstates the trade deficit by 163 billion he does this by counting americans purchases of goods from china as a loss for the u s while ignoring what china buys from the u s he also ignores another big part of the equation trade in services last year americans bought about 505 6 billion in goods from china while china bought about 130 4 billion in goods from the u s so the actual trade deficit in goods was just over 375 billion factor in trade in services and the actual u s trade deficit with china was 337 billion as for intellectual property theft it s not clear where trump gets his figure of 300 billion though it may be a plausible estimate illicit activities such as counterfeit goods pirated software theft of trade secrets and copyright and trademark infringement cannot be precisely measured an independent bipartisan u s commission estimated that u s interests lost 300 billion from global intellectual property theft in 2013 with china the main culprit the commission in a 2017 update gave a wide ranging estimate 225 billion to 600 billion with thefts led by thousands of chinese actors the trump administration this week announced planned tariffs on 50 billion in chinese imports beijing responded with plans to penalize imports from the u s by the same amount this followed an opening salvo of u s penalties on steel and aluminum imports from overseas including china and beijing s retaliatory taxes on 3 billion of u s products u s customs border protection southwest border apprehension statistics https www cbp gov newsroom stats sw border migration 2017 u s trade statistics https www census gov foreign trade press release current press release exh20 pdf intellectual property theft report http www ipcommission org report ip commission report update 2017 pdf associated press writers christopher rugaber josh boak and elliot spagat contributed to this report find ap fact checks at http apne ws 2kbx8
