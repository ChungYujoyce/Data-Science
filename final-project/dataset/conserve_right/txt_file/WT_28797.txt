tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion as a practitioner of public opinion polling i ve studied poked and analyzed opinions for more than 25 years i ve learned and grown to appreciate how fickle and malleable opinions can be i ve also come to understand through opinion research why president trump is playing a winning hand going into 2020 and why he is better positioned for victory than you might think mr trump isn t playing the opinion game he is playing on a different field he is playing on beliefs and values and his opponents are all too happy to assist him opinions can change and they often do beliefs don t change we can change our opinion about a candidate or a restaurant or a tv series but we don t change our fundamental values we don t change our beliefs opinions are ephemeral beliefs are unwavering top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director many of us believe in god it s not an opinion it s a belief our nation was founded on judeo christian values not judeo christian opinions mr trump understands this distinction and is riding this straight to a victory party on nov 3 2020 in fact the contrast between mr trump and the democratic field is a demonstration of just how much mr trump understands the american psyche and just how much most democrats do not look no further than the midsummer democratic debates and the concepts that the democrats are pushing open borders no more private insurance the elimination of the electoral college packing the u s supreme court with liberal justices abortion rights for transgendered men a war on betsy ross and our nation s founders free health care for illegal immigrants these aren t a series of individual issues they are an attack on the fabric of america and american institutions and sovereignty they are an attack on american culture they are an attack on the belief of what america is what america represents the american ideal that most of us over the age of 30 grew up with voters don t process these as opinion issues or thought experiments they process them as value propositions they process them as challenges to their fundamental belief systems that s why public polling shows deep opposition to these proposals among the very swing voters democrats are hoping to attract in fact surveys like july s npr pbs newshour marist survey are at this point more instructive than the traditional approval and horse race polls that populate our inboxes and airwaves the npr polling showed the vast differences in support between democrats and independent voters on some of the key policies that the democratic presidential candidates are running on for example while 60 percent of democrats support a national health insurance program for immigrants who are in the u s illegally only 27 percent of independents support it sixty three percent of democrats support abolishing the electoral college while support among independents is only 44 percent sixty four percent of democrats support medicare for all but only 39 percent of independents do in the august 2019 wsj nbc national survey much attention was paid to the generational gap that exists on the importance of american values such as patriotism religion and having children according to the aug 25 wall street journal views on these traditional american values varied by age but a closer read of the data suggests deep fissures within the democratic party from the journal generational differences on personal values were most pronounced among democrats in fact the views of democrats over age 50 were more in line with those of younger republicans than with younger members of their own party the reckoning that democrats will face is this the proposals driving their energized progressive younger base when deconstructed is an assault on the american fundamental beliefs in capitalism autonomy and electoral representation that is also one of the reasons why mr trump s capitol 4th celebration last july was such a politically astute move despite the democratic protests it will be all about him it was the perfect contrast to what voters were hearing from the left it was a nostalgic and not so subtle reminder of many of the cultural touchstones that are embedded in our dna it was mr trump reminding us that it s ok to be proud it s good to be an american it s good to be a patriot it is ok to be filled with american pride on the most american of holidays these aren t opinions these are beliefs while horse race polls have their place my own polling as one of the trump pollsters in the 2016 presidential campaign replicated elsewhere show that reluctant or hidden trump supporters are still very much part of the polling landscape and will continue to be part of the story as this president is attacked daily by the media and hollywood elite and his supporters are physically and verbally assaulted by an increasingly violent and militant left some respondents would rather not tell a stranger on the phone or internet that they support mr trump fearing potential consequences or backlash ignore them at your own peril the 2020 race is shaping up thematically at its most bare deconstruction it is this we can either preserve american institutions and the value proposition that americanism represents or we can tear it down regardless of voters opinions on mr trump they will vote their fundamental beliefs and donald trump will be re elected adam geller a public opinion researcher who worked on the trump pence 2016 campaign is a pollster for america first action
