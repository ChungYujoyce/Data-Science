should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion if there ever was a time to get serious with china now is the time the recent news of fake apple and ikea stores is almost too absurd to be true but in china the rules don t apply brand name and innovation mean zip intellectual property is free game anything is up for grabs and if i were a betting man i d bet that the government is getting a nice cut out of it all but that s communism right it s a system in which your ideas are my ideas your success is my success as our deficit soars and the u s continues to borrow borrow borrow as much as 43 cents on every dollar we do not have the upper hand in this battle china increasingly owns our securities and thanks to its currency manipulation our dollar continues to struggle on the world market the u s faced fierce economic competition from japan in the 80s but that was far different china represents one fifth of the world s population by comparison japan has less than 2 percent china can dominate the market and get away with its unfair theft of american goods and innovation because of its sheer size wealth and power but why must we tolerate the biggest robber baron of them all beijing is connected to or at least benefits from networks of criminal thugs most recently china admitted to operating the online blue army this is exactly what it sounds like a military unit of hackers who operate offensively at the behest of beijing the u s has fallen victim to beijing s hackers at least several times over the past few years in october 2006 the website of the commerce department s bureau of industry and security bis was locked down for more than a month after repeated attacks by hackers on chinese servers this wasn t just some arbitrary target no bis has responsibility over u s exports for commercial and military applications the state department s washington and overseas systems were downed thanks to chinese hackers it s intolerable that we have yet to hold communist china accountable for these cyberdeclarations of war against the u s top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender as if accessing our secure government networks weren t enough the chinese criminal networks also exploit our financially weak position by placing harmful pharmaceuticals on the market making defective products and ripping off consumers left and right since i joined the house judiciary committee s intellectual property subcommittee in january i ve heard from dozens of american businesses that have experienced significant economic harm from chinese counterfeits take for example houston based farouk systems maker of chi hair products several years ago farouk shami chairman and founder of farouk systems expanded the company s operations to china to save costs when faced with an onslaught of chinese counterfeits he closed the factory in china with that move he brought production and 1 000 jobs back to houston and accepted higher manufacturing and salary costs without passing them along to the consumer but also with the move he could better protect his intellectual property and innovation the chinese have become so expert in ripping off farouk systems chi flatiron that the detailing on each package is almost identical to that on the legitimate product including the exact same warranty with a picture of farouk shami s face for a bit of extra authenticity farouk systems regularly fields complaint calls about broken products but the products are counterfeit fighting chinese counterfeits has cost this company approximately 10 million that s 10 million that it could be using to hire more workers or expand its business operations i also met jim d addario ceo of d addario guitar strings an instrument strings manufacturer based in new york this business family owned since the 1600s has spent millions to stop the manufacture of counterfeit guitar strings in china mr d addario has watched several coordinated raids on manufacturing facilities in china that exist solely to make counterfeit copies of d addario fender martin and other american companies guitar strings on a website it s hard to tell the difference between a counterfeit and a legitimate d addario guitar string set as with the chi flatirons the packaging looks identical but the fake package of guitar strings contains a hologram sticker just to trick you and the product inside is horrendous it is that unbelievable so what do we do the bottom line is that while beijing benefits from these criminal networks they hurt our government and american businesses we must take every opportunity to 1 raise public awareness of the need for intellectual property enforcement and the dire impact on american businesses of rampant ip theft 2 insist that china adopt strict enforcement measures to protect ip rights and 3 take action when our words fail which they will if china does not protect our intellectual property we should block its imports into the u s it s time to play hardball with china the need for enforcement of intellectual property rights is more than just preventing brand dilution or in the case of mr d addario protecting a reputation earned over four centuries it s about the principle of working hard and having it taken from you in an instant by a crook today s criminals are a bit smarter and more high tech than during my former days on the bench they sit at laptops overseas direct online traffic to rogue websites and make a heap of cash from selling fake goods many times buyers never see the product they purchased and by that point it s too late their identity is stolen credit cards are racked up the problem is too prevalent for us to continue to do nothing it s time to get tough on china and that s just the way it is rep ted poe a texas republican was a prosecutor and judge in houston he serves on the house judiciary and foreign affairs c
