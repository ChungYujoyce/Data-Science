our party for a pro life democrat there apos s also a place in my support for pro choice republican so you look at a candidate and you make a decision even though you don apos t agree with them on every single thing liberals move to purge pro life dems from party yes there are pro life elected officials in the democratic party and that apos s ok klobuchar added saying she disagrees with trump on defunding planned parenthood pressed bymaccallum on democrats apos recent opposition to the so called born alive bill which would establish criminal and professional consequences for physicians who don apos t provide a normal standard of care to babies that survive abortions klobuchar dismissed republican efforts to pass the legislation i would apos ve voted with the democrats on that because i

bergmann a democratic strategist whose firm does work in a number of super tuesday states it s a tough deal for the candidates who are perceived to be at the lower rungs at the moment to figure out where can they get some juice sanders releases fact sheet showing how he apos d pay for trillions in new spending klobuchar and her rivals have faced logistical challenges because of the large number of states voting on tuesday which comprise a third of the total delegates needed for the nomination it s a very difficult time logistically to try to balance all this acknowledged sanders adviser jeff weaver suddenly now you have contests all across the country and candidates just have to do the best they can for example pete buttigieg had planned to swing down to florida which votes later in march for three private fundraisers wednesday he abruptly canceled the events and a public campaign stop in the miami area because of illness his aides said he had flu like symptoms buttigeig met with members of the congressional hispanic caucus and did media interviews in washington d c before returning to south carolina on thursday for another round of campaigning on wednesday joe biden who is polling far ahead in south carolina turned heads by saying that other candidates would have to consider dropping out if they underperform in the diverse state click here to get the fox news app they would have to consider dropping out not because i want them to or anybody else does but because the victories and losses are going to dictate it biden told the post and courier how do you stay in if you have demonstrated you can t get any african american support how do you stay in if you don t get support in south carolina so i just think the process is going to take care of that i don t think it requires anybody to say get out of the race klobuchar however hasn apos t shown any signs that she may pull out and neither have elizabeth warren bloomberg and other challengers behind sanders
