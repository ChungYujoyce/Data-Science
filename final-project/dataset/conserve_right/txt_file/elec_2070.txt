biden has become the center of gravity in the democratic presidential race since he announced his 2020 bid last month fundamentally altering the contours of the primary and leaving other candidates to navigate the dust cloud in his wake his rallies and speeches earn presidential level coverage on cable and president trump himself appears consumed with mr biden treating him as the likely rival even disparaging his iq during a visit to japan the other democrats in the 2020 race meanwhile are having to choose between an antagonistic or conciliatory approach each of which carries downsides for those struggling in the polls and looking to stand out it s all the more complicated because of mr biden s chief claim to fame having been the right hand man to president barack obama who remains a revered figure across the party s electorate see also dark period in american history trump blasts biden over 1994 crime bill i think it is tricky how do you take an opportunity to draw a distinction favorable to you without being seen as attacking joe biden said kathleen sullivan a member of the democratic national committee from new hampshire and you don t want to sound whiny about the fact you are being asked all these questions about joe biden at a washington post forum this month pete buttigieg mayor of south bend indiana was asked three biden related questions shortly after taking the stage does he agree with voters who say mr biden earned the 2020 nomination does he believe mr biden symbolized a political system voters had rejected and did mr biden blow it by authoring the 1994 crime bill i can t help but get the impression that there is more interest in one of my competitors than any of the others mr buttigieg said with a smile sparking laughter from the crowd for the most part the candidates have tiptoed around the chance to launch a negative attack against mr biden but they ve struggled to get out their message without getting hit with a question about the former vice president in recent interviews gov steve bullock of montana rep tim ryan of ohio and gov john hickenlooper of colorado have been asked why they would be a stronger nominee than mr biden sen bernard sanders of vermont has been grilled over why he has slipped in the polls since mr biden entered the race and sen kamala d harris of california has had to dismiss all the chatter about her being a great fit as mr biden s running mate mr buttigieg at the forum sought to both deflect and distance himself from mr biden by pointing to one of the former longtime senator s signature accomplishments the 1994 crime bill that some sociologists blame for a generation of incarceration look i wasn t there for the crime bill debate i mean i was there but i was 12 and it was not a priority for me the young mayor said mr biden s pole position in the race and his lengthy record make him a natural target for those kinds of jibes it s not always fun being a front runner said eric fehrnstrom who was a top aide to 2012 republican presidential nominee mitt romney you wake up every morning with a big target on your back the media is gunning for you your opponents are planting negative stories mr fehrnstrom said every slip up or gaffe becomes magnified even before mr biden joined the race cable news talking heads debated the pitfalls of his candidacy now that he s in the questions have only intensified is he is too old and too white for the gig will his off the cuff style hurt him and can his record of bipartisanship and his electability message connect a party base looking for a confrontational liberal champion mr biden s team has kept him in controlled public environments so far and he s been trading shots with mr trump who s treating him like the presumptive nominee there s good reason for that he carries a 17 point lead over his closest competitor mr sanders in the realclearpolitics average of polls still there s evidence his gravitational pull is already waning that 17 point lead is down from a 27 point lead he held two and a half weeks ago amid a post announcement surge going wire to wire with the lead could be tricky in such a massive field especially with the first caucuses and primaries eight months away the problem for biden is that there s so long to go before the first voting takes place mr fernstrom said when that happens it s hard to escape the feeling you re like a giant balloon that is slowly deflating with time on the other hand it s easier to raise money as a front runner he said you can seize control of the discussion and your phone calls get returned the first major test for mr biden will come next month at the first debate of the primary ms sullivan said she anticipates sharper attacks against mr biden there is going to be somebody or somebodies who will be negative who will be critical who think that is their ticket to get into the story and get attention they are not getting particularly if you are not getting coverage form the cable news people she said so there is that temptation and i think there will be someone or someones who do that copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint
