apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic tokyo ap japan s conservative liberal democratic party returned to power in a landslide election victory sunday after three years in opposition exit polls showed signaling a rightward shift in the government that could further heighten tensions with rival china the victory means that the hawkish former prime minister shinzo abe will get a second chance to lead the nation after a one year stint in 2006 2007 he would be japan s seventh prime minister in 6 years public broadcaster nhk s exit polls projected that the ldp which ruled japan for most of the post world war ii era until it was dumped in 2009 won between 275 and 300 seats in the 480 seat lower house of parliament official results were not expected until monday morning before the election the party had 118 seats top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore the results were a sharp rebuke for prime minister yoshihiko noda s ruling democratic party of japan reflecting widespread unhappiness for its failure to keep campaign promises and get the stagnant economy going during its three years in power with japan stuck in a two decade slump and receding behind china as the region s most important economic player voters appeared ready to turn back to the ldp a serious looking mr abe characterized the win as more of a protest vote against the dpj than a strong endorsement of his party i think the results do not mean we have regained the public s trust 100 percent rather they reflect no votes to the dpj s politics that stalled everything the past three years he told nhk now we are facing the test of how we can live up to the public s expectations and we have to answer that question the ruling democrats which won in a landslide three years ago amid high hopes for change captured less than 100 seats exit polls indicated down sharply from its pre election strength of 230 calling the results severe mr noda told a late night news conference he was stepping down to take responsibility for the defeat i apologize deeply for our failure to achieve results he said it was the voters judgment to our failure to live up to their expectations during our three years and three months of leadership the ldp will stick with longtime partner new komeito backed by a large buddhist organization to form a coalition government party officials said together they will probably control about 320 seats nhk projected a two thirds majority that would make it easier for the government to pass legislation mr noda said a special parliamentary session would be held before year s end to pick a new prime minister as leader of the biggest party in the lower house mr abe almost certainly will assume that post the new government will need to quickly deliver results ahead of upper house elections in the summer to revive japan s struggling economy mr abe will likely push for increased public works spending and lobby for stronger moves by the central bank to break japan out of its deflationary trap still some voters said they supported the ldp s vows to build a stronger more assertive country to answer increasing pressure from china and threats of north korean rocket launches mr abe has repeatedly said he will protect japan s territory and beautiful seas amid a territorial dispute with china over some uninhabited islands in the east china sea i feel like the ldp will protect japan and restore some national pride momoko mihara 31 said after voting for the liberal democrats in the western tokyo suburb of fuchu i hope mr abe will stand tall the ldp may also have benefited from voter confusion over the dizzying array of more than 12 parties including several news ones and their sometimes vague policy goals one of the new parties the right leaning populist japan restoration party won between 40 to 61 seats nhk projected the party led by the bombastic nationalist ex tokyo gov shintaro ishihara and osaka mayor toru hashimoto both of whom are polarizing figures with forceful leadership styles could become a future coalition partner for the ldp analysts said mr ishihara was the one who stirred up the latest dispute with china over the islands when he proposed that the tokyo government buy them from their private japanese owners and develop them in this first election since the march 11 2011 earthquake tsunami and nuclear disasters atomic energy ended up not being a major election issue even though polls show about 80 percent of japanese want to phase out nuclear power in the end economic concerns won out said kazuhisa kawakami at meiji gakuin university we need to prioritize the economy especially since we are an island nation he said we re not like germany we can t just get energy from other countries in a pinch the staunchly anti nuclear tomorrow party which was formed just three weeks ago captured between six and 15 seats nhk estimated tomorrow party head yukiko kada said she was very disappointed to see ldp the original promoter of the nuclear energy policy and still the most pro nuclear party making a big comeback mr abe 58 is considered one of the more conservative figures in the increasingly conservative ldp during his previous tenure as prime minister he pursued a nationalistic agenda pressing for more patriotic education and upgrading the defense agency to ministry status it remains to be seen how he will behave this time around though he is talking tough toward china and the ldp platform calls developing fisheries and setting up a permanent outpost in the disputed islands called senkakus by japan and daioyu by china a move that would infuriate beijing during his time as leader mr abe also insisted there was no proof japan s military had coerced chinese korean and other women into prostitution in military brothels during japan s wartime aggression in asia he later apologized but lately has suggested that a landmark 1993 apology for sex slavery needs revising he has said he regrets not visiting the yasukuni shrine which enshrines japan s war dead including class a war criminals during his term as prime minister china and south korea oppose such visits saying they reflect japan s reluctance to fully atone for its wartime atrocities the ldp wants to revise japan s pacifist constitution to strengthen its self defense forces and breaching a postwar taboo designate them as a military it also proposes increasing japan s defense budget and allowing japanese troops to engage in collective self defense operations with allies that are not directly related to japan s own defense it s not clear however how strongly the ldp will push such proposals which have been kicked around by conservatives for decades but usually make no headway in parliament because they are supported only by a fairly small group of right wing advocates the economy has been in dire straits these past three years and it must be the top priority mr abe said in a televised interview we must strengthen our alliance with the u s and also improve relations with china with a strong determination that is no change in the fact the senkaku islands are our territory ap writers elaine kurtenba
