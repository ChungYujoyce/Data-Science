added that if mr biden is elected we would never be treated with respect because people don t respect him even the people that he s running against the trump administration has approved a 16 billion bailout fund this year for farmers hurt by china s retaliatory tariffs after a 12 billion bailout last year the president said u s tariffs on china are funding the emergency farm aid and out of those tariffs we gave the farmers 16 billion he said nobody else is going to do that china has levied unfair retaliation but we ve made up for it and more so we re reversing decades of failed trade policies
