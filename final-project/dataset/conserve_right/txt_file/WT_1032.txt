ld be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion bipartisanship was in short supply at last week s state of the union address with one notable exception nancy pelosi had been looking dyspeptic shuffling the papers she would later rip to shreds when president trump reminded his audience that the united states is leading a 59 nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of venezuela nicolas maduro suddenly the house speaker applauded mr trump then introduced the true and legitimate president of venezuela juan guaido mrs pelosi rose from her chair smiled and put her hands together for the tall dark and handsome latin american in the house gallery when mr trump said all americans are united with venezuelans in their righteous struggle for freedom she again stood up and clapped top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time i wondered was bernie sanders the socialist senator and perhaps leading candidate for the democratic party s presidential nomination applauding too or was he sitting on his hands and scowling it turns out he was in new hampshire viewing the event on television however keane bhatt one of his policy advisers tweeted there is no better distillation of washington d c than a state of the union in which nancy pelosi having just led the impeachment of donald all roads lead to putin trump twice joins in a rousing standing ovation of juan guaido trump s appointed president of venezuela there s more a year ago mr sanders told univision s jorge ramos that he didn t recognize mr guaido as venezuela s legitimate leader asked whether he regarded nicolas maduro as a dictator he refused to say that prompted rep donna shalala a miami democrat to charge that mr sanders has demonstrated again that he does not understand this situation on the campaign trail the brooklyn born vermonter likes to say he s a scandinavian style socialist but in 2003 he signed a letter in support of mr maduro s predecessor hugo chavez a self proclaimed marxist and comrade of cuba s fidel castro whom mr sanders also has praised he s called daniel ortega nicaragua s far left leader an impressive guy and of course in 1988 newlyweds bernie and jane honeymooned in the soviet union want to guess which candidate mr maduro is rooting for let me remind you of venezuela s riches to rags story though the country possesses the world s largest oil reserves over recent years 90 percent of the population has fallen into abject poverty millions of venezuelans have fled to neighboring countries burdening those economies the nation s descent began during the 11 year rule of hugo chavez he died of cancer in 2013 having designated mr maduro as his successor on jan 10 2019 following an election widely viewed as neither free nor fair mr maduro was sworn in again the organization of american states promptly declared his presidency illegitimate venezuela s national assembly invoked a state of emergency and on jan 23 mr guaido was declared acting president the united states canada brazil and dozens of other countries are behind him but a cuban russian axis also including iran china nicaragua north korea and syria supports mr maduro oh by the way the u n sides with the authoritarian bloc u s tax dollars at work trump administration efforts to bring about regime change in venezuela have been principled persistent and so far ineffective russia controls roughly 70 percent of venezuela s oil production profiting to the tune of 2 billion last year according to estimates i regard as reliable no fewer than 25 000 cubans reside in venezuela some are teachers and doctors but others advise and guard mr maduro still others are spies and de facto commissars within the country s bureaucracies military units and intelligence agencies also playing an especially nefarious role the islamic republic of iran research conducted by emanuele ottolenghi my colleague at the foundation for defense of democracies reveals that the maduro regime makes passports and travel documents available to iranian agents tehran s regional propaganda headquarters is in caracas the two regimes collaborate in a disinformation war against the united states their spanish language television networks hispan tv and telesur respectively share journalists across latin america hezbollah a proxy of the clerical regime is firmly ensconced within venezuela s large about 200 000 lebanese shia community simply put mr ottolenghi notes maduro and his cronies use the trappings of a sovereign state to run a criminal syndicate involved in pillaging state resources and taking commissions from organized crime to use venezuela as a staging ground for their global smuggling operations he adds hezbollah supporters concentrated in several areas of venezuela and along the venezuela colombia border have over the years lent their businesses to trade based money laundering schemes designed to repatriate drug money for the cartels minus a hefty commission for hezbollah the day after the state of the union president trump met with mr guaido to discuss how to expedite a democratic transition in venezuela that will end the ongoing crisis according to a white house press statement i d argue that will require additional sanctions not just on the maduro regime

putin the russian neo czar toward whom mr bhatt believes mr trump is too solicitous may have interpreted mr kerry s words differently as an invitation to exploit u s neighbors an invitation he and others have been only too pleased to accept clifford d may is founder and president of the foundation for defense of democracies fdd and a columnist for the washing
