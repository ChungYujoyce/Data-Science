apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic shenyang china ap as recently as february liu xiaobo s brother dismissed reports that the imprisoned chinese nobel peace laureate might be ill then came the bombshell on monday that liu has been diagnosed with late stage liver cancer and transferred to a hospital on medical parole a brief video has also emerged of liu s wife tearfully telling a friend that no treatment surgery radiation or chemotherapy would work for liu at this point the news has shocked and angered liu s supporters and human rights advocates who are questioning if china s best known political prisoner received adequate care while incarcerated or whether the authoritarian government deliberately allowed the 61 year old to wither in prison top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots chinese prisons are notorious for their poor health care lack of nutritious food and abusive conditions and it s highly common for prisoners to re emerge in a deeply weakened state that may be especially true for the prison in a small northeastern city where liu has been serving an 11 year sentence for inciting subversion of state power a serious illness like liver cancer could be easily missed at the prison despite checkups although it s equally possible that beijing has neglected care for liu on purpose said political dissident hu jia who has served time in jail with liver issues given his influence and his massive following it s possible that beijing does not want him to return to society healthy physically capable and energetic said hu beijing considers him to be a political rival hu is calling on beijing to be open and transparent about liu s medical care liu is in a hospital in the northeastern city of shenyang and has not communicated directly with the outside the local prison management bureau could not be reached for comment police cars were seen tuesday parked outside the china medical university no 1 affiliated hospital in shenyang where liu reportedly was being treated an associated press journalist could not locate liu in the sprawling facility and nurses on likely floors for cancer patients said they had not had a patient by the name of liu xiaobo liu a literary critic and essayist was already in less than robust health when he was detained and later sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2009 recalled liu s former lawyer mo shaoping the defense team had argued for liu to be released while awaiting trial on the basis of poor health but was turned down he said still mo said he was unaware of liu s cancer diagnosis until it was revealed on monday we would think there must be symptoms for earlier detection and that a responsible prison would not have discovered liver cancer only in the very late stage he said other than general concerns for liu s health there had not been alarming news until this week in february responding to rumors that liu underwent computerized tomography scans for possible illnesses washington based radio free asia reported that liu s brother had dismissed the rumors chinese authorities have a troubling record when it comes to the treatment of political prisoners untold numbers died in china s vast system

rare interview in 2015 gao celebrated that he s still living every time we emerge from prison alive it is a defeat for our opponents he told the associated press sophie richardson china director at new york based human rights watch said beijing should be held to account for letting a peaceful critic like liu fall gravely ill from those who ordered liu s prosecution to those who denied him adequate treatment in detention there are many people to be held accountable for their role in this cruel travesty richardson said in a statement supporters have called for liu to be allowed to seek treatment overseas although president xi jinping s administration has taken a hard line on refusing permission for dissidents to travel u s embassy spokeswoman mary beth polley called for liu s release as well as that of his wife liu xia who lives under house arrest china should provide them the protections and freedoms such as freedom of movement and access to medical care of his choosing to which they re entitled under china s constitution and medical system and international commitments polley said china s foreign ministry did not directly address questions about whether liu would be allowed to leave the country for treatment spokesman lu kang said any chinese citizen s exit from and entry into the country is ruled by law he warned that liu s case is a domestic affair and demanded that china s judicial independence be respected no country shall interfere with china s internal affairs through any individual case lu said hu the dissident said that for now it s imperative that the government make public the names of the eight oncologists in charge of liu s cancer treatment in shenyang and that liu is brought as soon as possible to beijing which has the country s best medical professionals and is his home we cannot take the government s word we must be able to judge if these eight people are truly qualified hu said we want to make sure liu xiaobo is seeing the best doctors in the best hospit
