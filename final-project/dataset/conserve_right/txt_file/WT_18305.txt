apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic new delhi the theme of chinese premier wen jiabao s visit to india was friends not rivals but a border dispute remains a source of tension and analysts warn potential conflict between the asian giants the joint communique that concluded mr wen s recent visit barely mentioned the long standing border issue as both sides sought to highlight areas of agreement with an ambitious plan to double trade to 100 billion by 2015 the only reference was a vague pledge to try and maintain peace and tranquility in border areas and continue talks on the issue already the subject of 14 rounds of fruitless negotiations top stories gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens it will not be easy to resolve this it requires patience was mr wen s only public comment the border dispute triggered a brief but bloody war in 1962 that proved to be a defining moment in modern indo chinese relations and the basis for decades of mutual suspicion and mistrust that have yet to be be fully shed india says china is illegally occupying 15 000 square miles of its northwestern territory while beijing claims a 56 000 square mile chunk of northeast india perceptions that china is taking a harder line on its claims have prompted new delhi to beef up its military presence along the frontier with thousands of extra combat troops armor and expanded frontline air bases siemon wezeman of the stockholm international peace research institute said issues of national prestige have always blocked efforts to resolve the dispute and warned that further militarization carried obvious dangers while both sides make statements that the dispute should be solved peacefully they also make prestige vis a vis each other more important mr wezeman said the border dispute remains a problem and if reports are to be believed little incidents happen frequently with more troops and weapons poured into the region such little incidents can grow bigger and get out of hand potentially leading to the same type of short nasty conflict as in 1962 he warned a report by the london based international institute of strategic studies iiss this month reached a similar conclusion the iiss stressed that the likelihood of a full scale conflict was low but added that the possibility of border skirmishes cannot be ruled out and in such an environment there is plenty of scope for misunderstandings the prestige issue was amply demonstrated last year when china complained bitterly over a visit by indian prime minister manmohan singh to the northeast indian state of arunachal pradesh which comprises much of the territory claimed by beijing china said the visit which came ahead of state elections in arunachal was provocative while india insisted mr singh was following established democratic practice by touring regions in the run up to elections such bickering was put firmly on hold during mr wen s visit when all the talk was of cooperation trade and a partnership between two rapidly emerging economies that will help define the 21st century we are friends not rivals we will always be friends never rivals mr wen said in new delhi but many observers believe a more realistic assessment was provided just days before mr wen s arrival by the chinese ambassador in delhi who described relations with india as fragile easy to break and difficult to repair while india s rivalry with pakistan has traditionally been seen as the most dangerous potential flash point in the region tensions with china coupled with the rapid modernization of their respective militaries is a growing concern china s annual defense budget is the second largest in the world after the united states and india is expected to spend 112 billion on capital defense acquisitions between now and 2016 india is particularly wary of growing chinese influence especially in the form of major infrastructure projects in surrounding countries such as pakistan nepal sri lanka and burma mr singh gave voice to these concerns in september when he said china wanted a foothold in south asia and that india would have to reflect on this reality some in the indian defense establishment believe the answer is a more muscular military deterrent along the maritime as well as land borders china s growing belligerence and steady encirclement of india has rung alarm bells and drawn attention to our historic neglect of the seas former indian navy chief arun prakash wrote in the latest editi
