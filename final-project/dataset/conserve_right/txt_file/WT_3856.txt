apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic one of the fbi s big selling points for the democratic party financed steele dossier is that its creator former british spy christopher steele had proven his veracity in previously providing information on an international soccer scandal that is what the fbi told a judge to obtain a year s worth of wiretaps on trump associate carter page it turned out it wasn t true according to the justice department s inspector general report released monday see also read the report from the doj office of the inspector general hardly any of mr steele s fifa soccer information was corroborated and none was used in court contrary to what was attested to by fbi in its foreign intelligence surveillance court fisa application according to the handling agent he would not have approved the representation in the application because only some of steele s prior reporting had been corroborated most of it had not and because steele s information was never used in a criminal proceeding said inspector general michael e horowitz we found that the team had speculated that steele s prior reporting had been corroborated and used in criminal proceedings without clearing the representation with steele s handling agent and in another glaring error mr steele s main dossier source disagreed with anti trump assertions in his dossier after it was posted online in january 2017 but the fbi failed to include that denial in subsequent wiretap renewals the source said he or she never told mr steele that mr page met with an unsavory kremlin figure while on a public trip to moscow in july 2016 in another instance of an fbi error mr page told agents he was a cia asset the cia confirmed in an email but an fbi lawyer changed the yes to a no mr steele also apparently lied to agents when they traveled to rome for a briefing in october his agent handler asked if he was involved in a yahoo news story and mr steele responded no the fbi then used the yahoo article as corroboration in the fisa application but in fact mr steele had been the yahoo source in rome mr steele described one of his main dossier sources as a boaster and egotist who may engage in some embellishment the fbi failed to include that caveat in the fisa application or tell its intelligence unit the ig said in rome agents also disclosed sensitive information to mr steele about its crossfire hurricane probe into the trump campaign an agent mentioned the name of george papadopoulos a trump adviser and fbi target some agents told the ig the disclosure was improper after the rome meeting mr steele worked for two bosses fusion gps which was being paid by the hillary clinton presidential campaign and democratic national committee and the fbi he began filing anti trump allegations that were not in the dossier being sent to fusion one was that russian military intelligence was funneling money to mr trump by way of an azerbaijani family in special counsel robert mueller s report in march there was no mention of such an arrangement mr mueller said he did not establish a conspiracy between mr trump and the kremlin as mr steele alleged in his 35 page dossier that concluded in december 2016 mr steele later came to washington to brief reporters and state department officials on all of his anti trump allegations one was that trump campaign manager paul manafort worked as a go between with the kremlin on election interference the mueller report said that didn t happen a washington times analysis found 13 conspiracy allegations inside the dossier all of which were disproven or unverified mr steele and fusion pushed another bogus story they contended that the trump organization and alfa bank russia s largest commercial bank maintained a dedicated computer server for secret communications fusion s glenn simpson sold the story to slate com and the new yorker the ig report quotes the fbi as saying the story is false the fbi investigated whether there were cyber links between the trump organization and alfa bank but had concluded by early february 2017 that there were no such links the fbi said the supervisory intel analyst told us that he factored the alfa bank trump server allegations into his asse
