the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong rep barbara comstock has done seemingly everything an endangered republican house member can do to win in 2018 whether it s raising millions of dollars for her re election campaign or standing up to president trump to endear herself to her northern virginia constituents it still might not be enough election forecasters are already penciling in a loss for ms comstock in her race against democratic state sen jennifer wexton in virginia s 10th congressional district a sign of the stiff political headwinds that suburban area republicans across the country are feeling top stories 500 doctors tell trump to end the coronavirus shutdown say it will cause more deaths oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens you are not going to die from covid 19 ms comstock a lawyer and former top capitol hill staffer says she s been counted out before and that she ll continue to fight for every vote through election day i don t think the pundits or certainly not the democrats have ever predicted i would win any of my seven races in nine years so we are doing what we always do which is we re out in the district around the clock and talking to everybody she said she acknowledges the race is close but said she s running strong against ms wexton in her campaign s internal polling in her previous races she says she s never underperformed her internal numbers ms comstock said that ms wexton would be the most left wing person to ever represent the 10th district which includes wealthy d c area suburbs like mclean as well as vast rural areas closer to the west virginia border gop rep frank wolf held the seat for more than two decades before ms comstock a former state delegate and wolf staffer was first elected in 2014 conventional wisdom says ms comstock s seat will be a casualty of mr trump with suburban voters recoiling from the over the top persona and constant clashes that have characterized this white house yet ms comstock says house minority leader nancy pelosi is actually even less popular than mr trump in her district and said that reflects on ms wexton she is a follower of the resistance of nancy pelosi ms comstock said if this seat goes nancy pelosi very well could be speaker in a cycle where gop officials have harangued many of their incumbents for getting out raised by their democratic opponents ms comstock has raised more than 5 8 million for her re election to ms wexton s 5 4 million outside groups have also poured millions more into the race with about an equal amount being spent to boost each candidate ms comstock said that she s built relationships with the northern virginia business and technology communities and says she s an important bridge to the gop without a republican voice when we have a republican administration you would have nobody who would really be able to go fight for and make the case the way i ve been able to do she said she says she s been able to back mr trump on some issues such as tax cuts and increased military spending but says she warned mr trump to his face against shutting down the government which would be harmful in a district home to many federal employees ms wexton s campaign meanwhile says voters will punish ms comstock for those times she did back the president jennifer wexton will be a truly independent voice for virginia s 10th district in congress who will fight for their priorities rather than voting with donald trump and the republican party line nearly every time as comstock has done said campaign spokesman aaron fritschner ms comstock has had to straddle a line showing some resistance to mr trump while also maintaining enough of her conservative credentials to defeat a primary challenge from the right rick buchanan who heads the virginia tea party said ms comstock s done enough to hold the right i m praying that comstock pulls this through he said i don t agree with her all the time but i got to say she is one hard worker she knows how to run a campaign and nobody beats her work ethic i can tell you that the 10th district is one of four gop held seats in virginia that
