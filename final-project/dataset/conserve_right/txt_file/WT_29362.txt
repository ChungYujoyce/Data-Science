tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion defenders of the nuclear deal with the islamic republic of iran predicted that president trump s sanctions would have little impact unless our european friends joined in they were dead wrong that same crowd is now in a frenzy over mr trump deploying military assets to the middle east to deter or if necessary punish attacks on americans by the islamic revolutionary guard corps or its many proxies they have been claiming including in paid advertisements that mr trump is leading a march to war top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning what s really happening is less dramatic but more intriguing iran s rulers are feeling intense pain from mr trump s maximum pressure campaign and they are no longer sure they can wait for what they hope will be a more conciliatory occupant of the white house in 2021 so they ve been floating the possibility of negotiating with the trump administration secretary of state mike pompeo is soon to visit switzerland where the fluctuating price of chocolate will not be the main topic of discussion swiss diplomats represent the united states in iran mohammad javad zarif the islamic republic s foreign minister has proven himself a skilled negotiator when he sat down at the table with secretary of state john kerry it was like doc holliday playing poker with a greenhorn in dodge city the pot mr zarif raked in was the iran deal formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action which promised iran s rulers sunset clauses patient pathways to nuclear weapons as key restrictions disappear what if the islamic republic remains as it s long been the world s leading state sponsor of terrorism it won t matter mr zarif now wants to play a few hands against mr pompeo but doesn t want to seem too eager so he routinely insults mr trump he recently called him a terrorist and demands that the president show respect for iran s ruling mullahs before any new talks begin what he really wants is for the united states to ease restrictions on iranian oil exports and lift other sanctions as well akin to what president obama did in 2013 after the conclusion of an interim agreement following that mr zarif made no serious concessions mr kerry made one after another i m hopeful not confident that president trump and mr pompeo won t repeat their predecessors mistakes by rewarding the mullahs for nothing more than sending mr zarif to filibuster and dine in europe s finest restaurants does that close the door on a new round of diplomacy not necessarily mr zarif s negotiating position may not be his fallback position he may after a while agree to attend talks without preconditions if not an alternative occurs to me imagine if the germans the french and the british the so called e3 were to say to mr zarif look we ve not just shown you respect we ve bent over backward for you so talk to us you claim you don t have a nuclear weapons program don t want one and oh yes threaten to ratchet up your nonexistent nuclear weapons program if you don t get some cash in your pocket soon so let s hammer out some new agreements we can take those to president trump and see if in exchange we can t get his gucci loafers off your throat such agreements would have to include eliminating the sunset clauses ending the development of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads allowing international inspectors to seriously verify that illicit research is not being secretly conducted and prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear warheads will that be enough to satisfy mr trump i d argue it shouldn t be not at this point in the 40 year old conflict with the revolutionary theocrats a year ago mr pompeo announced 12 conditions that iran s rulers must meet if they want all sanctions lifted and perhaps a restoration of diplomatic relations and economic support regime sympathizers in the media and think tanks have pronounced those conditions impossible and tantamount to surrender brian hook the u s special representative for iran has repeatedly asked is it really impossible for the theocrats to stop sponsoring terrorists holding hostages bankrolling mass murdering dictators and threatening their neighbors and were they to cease torturing and murdering ethnic and sexual minorities would that really be waving a white flag the islamic republic s enablers are in effect arguing that america and europe should accept such practices as the new normal defining deviancy down is never a good idea at present with the rulers of north korea china russia and a list of non state jihadi groups watching it would be particularly ill advised in japan on monday president trump said he was not looking for regime change in iran i just want to make that clear we are looking for no nuclear weapons yes but he should insist that the regime change its conduct in line with his administration s eminently reasonable 12 conditions to fail to do so would repeat another of president obama s most egregious errors implicitly licensing the regime to continue a range of nefarious activities including sponsoring terrorism in the middle east europe latin america and the united states is it possible for such change to come about through a new and improved round of diplomacy the odds are low but if that does happen it will not be because iran s rulers are enthusiastic about the benefits detente would bring it will be because they have been crippled by american sanctions deterred by american military might and daunted by the risks they ll run should they continue to provoke an american president who is less predictable than the others they ve encountered over the decades clifford d may is founder and president of the
