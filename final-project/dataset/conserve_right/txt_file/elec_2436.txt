campaigns has drifted toward musings about what can be done to stop or at least slow mr rubio the operatives said in a sign of a budding alliance the aides have for example exchanged news articles that raise potential areas of vulnerability for mr rubio there is no formal coordination the operatives stressed but rather a recognition of a shared agenda we do have similar goals an adviser to mr

foretell long slog for hillarya contentious sometimes nasty democratic debate between presumptive nominee hillary clinton and her rival socialist sen bernie sanders i vt foreshadowed a long ugly march to victory for clinton and a new poll out today shows just how long it might be the quinnipiac university national poll shows clinton s support has collapsed since the last survey in december losing nearly 20 points to fall into a statistical tie with sanders clinton is still popular with democrats but hard sentiment seems to be growing some 22 percent of democrats hold unfavorable views of
