apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion for over a decade china has conducted a broad campaign to reshape the international system into a new post american global order in this effort it is essential that china project an image of being supremely capable and powerful thereby demonstrating that china not europe or the united states is the best model for governance and economic development the coronavirus pandemic undermines this carefully constructed image because beijing s response to the disease enabled its spread to the detriment of public health and economies throughout the world this directly threatens china s long term goal so beijing is desperately trying to reshape perceptions of the situation to its advantage the world health organization who and its director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus appear to have been willing pawns in beijing s gambit top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey at national review online jim geraghty has laid out in a useful timeline of who s and china s actions early in the outbreak after detecting the virus in late november chinese authorities reacted by suppressing details of the disease and punishing doctors who tried to alert the public and the world china did not inform who about the virus until dec 31 beijing continued to suppress information about human to human transmission of the disease allowing infected individuals to travel abroad well into january the mayor of wuhan later admitted that perhaps 5 million chinese people had left the city before imposition of a lockdown the willingness of who to take beijing s statements at face value arguably paved the way for international pandemic on jan 23 for example who tweeted for the moment who does not recommend any broader restrictions on travel or trade we recommend exit screening at airports as part of a comprehensive set of containment measures in february after the u s imposed travel restrictions on china mr tedros publicly chastised countries for adopting the policy after visiting china in late january mr tedros announced that beijing had set a new standard for outbreak control and praised chinese actions that bought the world time even though those steps have come at greater cost to china itself it was not until the following month after weeks of negotiations with the chinese government that a who team finally was dispatched to china we now know that many people infected with covid 19 are asymptomatic but contagious and that chinese travelers spread the disease to other countries who might have known this earlier but chose to ignore warnings from taiwan about the human to human transmission of the wuhan coronavirus covid 19 in december of last year of course who does not let taiwan participate in its meetings due to chinese objections over political matters that have nothing to do with public health more recently china has claimed that it has stopped covid 19 domestically and who has warned that the u s could become the epicenter however much evidence suggests that china has underreported its covid 19 deaths and is manipulating public data by excluding a large number of asymptomatic individuals who have tested positive nonetheless mr tedros has stuck with his pro china message praising beijing s transparency calling its response impressive and applauding its claim of zero new domestic covid 19 cases as an amazing achievement leading who physician bruce aylward joined the chorus stating if i had covid 19 i would want to be treated in china who s posture here might be more understandable if china had not also concealed and failed to cooperate with who in the 2003 sars outbreak given this history who s willingness to take china s statements at face value is shocking the record over the past few months leaves no doubt as to why chinese president xi jinping has expressed his firm support for mr tedros in recent weeks beijing has engaged in a widespread propaganda and disinformation campaign to exculpate itself from its fatal mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak the truth is that china had an opportunity early on to forestall the spread of covid 19 and alert the world about the threat and chose instead to try to protect its reputation with a shameful assist from mr tedros brett d schaefer is the jay kingham fellow in international regulatory affairs at the heritage foundation s margaret thatcher center fo
