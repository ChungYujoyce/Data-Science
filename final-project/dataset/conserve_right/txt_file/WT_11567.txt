famous soviet military power series this is significant as both the george w bush and obama administrations resisted as too provocative an annual pentagon report to the congress on china s military that cast china as a cold war level challenge however it is becoming clearer that barring corrective actions by washington china s threat could grow into a global challenge to american interests justifying an annual china military power publication to warn u s policymakers the office of naval intelligence report details that china s navy and coast guard are building about 60 ships a year the u s produces 10 to 15 china eventually will have a large fleet equipped with carriers nuclear attack submarines and amphibious ships to project power in defense of ruling communist party interests top

covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed china s first priority remains the conquest of democratic taiwan but its growing navy will also be used to enforce its expansive territorial claims in the east and south china seas in the latter china is literally turning seven coral reefs into large island bases three of which will be equipped with airfields and combat aircraft when complete china will
