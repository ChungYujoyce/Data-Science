was some unidentified yellow foam on the ground at the site although it was not clear if this was contamination or part of the fire fighting efforts the ensuing fire was mostly under control by morning and the tianjin local government said further firefighting was suspended on orders of the central government so that a team of chemical experts can assess hazardous materials on site dangers

cordon about 1 or 2 kilometers about a mile from the site on china s popular microblogging platform of weibo some users complained that their posts about the blasts were deleted and the number of searchable posts on the disaster fluctuated in a sign that authorities were manipulating or placing limits on the number of posts the website of the logistics company became inaccessible thursday the tianjin government said that because of the blasts it had suspended online access to public corporate records these records might be used to trace the ownership of ruihai it was not clear whether the blackout was due to technical damage related to the explosion no one answered the phone at the tianjin market and quality supervision administration or the tianjin administration for industry and
