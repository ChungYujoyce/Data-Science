apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic alfredo ortiz president and ceo of the conservative job creators network didn t recognize the number on his ringing cellphone so he didn t answer the voicemail surprised him it was treasury secretary steven t mnuchin who was seeking his input as the trump administration and congress scrambled last week to assemble a 2 trillion package to fight the economic fallout from the covid 19 pandemic i thought it was actually a scam call mr ortiz said i listened to the voicemail and it was like hey alfredo this is steven you know the treasury secretary just trying to get a hold of you give me a buzz back when you get a chance top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century mr mnuchin is sometimes viewed warily by conservatives who consider him a democrat in president trump s inner sanctum but the 57 year old former wall street executive is getting high marks for his round the clock efforts to rescue the economy and serve as a liaison between the president and house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat the president and the speaker haven t spoken in five months he s even keeled said a republican familiar with the exhaustive negotiations he was spending long hours and really late nights at the capitol going between the minority and majority leader s office a democratic aide said of mr mnuchin you can deal with him the president said his treasury secretary lived over in that beautiful building and mr mnuchin agreed that he spent about five days in the lbj room an ornate frescoed space near the senate chamber american conservative union chairman matt schlapp said of mr mnuchin he had a big week but more importantly he did his country a lot of good mr trump signed the rescue package friday mr mnuchin now is working to make sure that direct payments of 1 200 to most americans and billions of dollars in loans to small businesses are delivered rapidly this doesn t do people any good if it takes a long time mr mnuchin said sunday on cbs s face the nation mr ortiz whose network represents small businesses did call back after that missed phone call last week to emphasize to mr mnuchin the need to get government loans to small business owners quickly he also urged mr mnuchin to extend aid to gig workers and independent contractors who usually don t qualify for help in the same week a record 3 2 million people filed for unemployment benefits we talked on multiple occasions despite the world basically collapsing around him and trying to get the left and the right together on ideas to work with the white house mr ortiz said he sounded cool calm and collected he took the time he needed to listen to our ideas and not at one moment did i ever feel rushed by him if anything i felt like i was taking too much of his time a partner at goldman sachs from 1994 to 2002 mr mnuchin later established himself in hollywood for bankrolling several successful and some mediocre movies including american sniper in 2014 and the lego movie he got an acting credit for playing himself in a nonspeaking role as a wall street banker with warren beatty in rules don t apply a film that also featured his future wife louise linton when mr mnuchin became national finance chairman of mr trump s presidential campaign in the spring of 2016 many conservatives didn t share mr trump s confidence in him he comes from the banking world and he had a reputation for being a democrat mr schlapp said he obviously earned a lot of respect and credibility from all of us with the amazing job he did on finance for the president s election in 2016 and he s figured washington out the massive cost of the rescue package including four months worth of unemployment benefits that will pay many workers 100 or more of what they were earning in their jobs isn t sitting well with many conservatives mr schlapp also pointed to dandelions in the package such as 25 million for the kennedy center for the performing arts in washington and 75 million for the corporation for public broadcasting which funds national public radio this is odious and unfortunately typical of the democratic party he said no conservative likes the price tag mr mnuchin said the administration needed buy in from democrats at a critical moment for the country there s never a deal until it s done he told fox news host sean hannity we were negotiating through the whole period we took out anything having to do with wind power and the environmental issues the president cut lots and lots of things out of this deal he added when i do business deals it s win and win but here we needed bipartisan support there was a price to pay mr schlapp said most conservatives are withholding their criticisms for now because they understand that the pandemic created unprecedented economic challenges i think most conservatives realize that never before has the government so broadly swiped away american economic rights and for good reason mr schlapp said literally not allowing people to go to work not allowing people to operate their businesses that s an economic taking and the government shouldn t be allowed to do that without a financial settlement from those who had the economic loss that s predominantly what we re seeing here one of the stickiest negotiating points with democrats was a 500 billion fund to provide loans to distressed corporations democrats wouldn t support the package until the white house agreed to a special inspector general to review how the administration allocates the loans but mr trump notified congress after signing the aid package that he will insist on presidential supervision of the yet to be appointed inspector general the development rankled democrats who said it was a retreat on the bargain struck by mr mnuchin mrs pelosi said sunday that democrats won t allow the president to have unilateral control over the loan process in an appearance on cnn s state of the union mrs pelosi also seemed to bristle at mr mnuchin s focus on the harm inflicted on financial markets during the economic shutdown she recalled a meeting with mr mnuchin a week ago sunday in the office of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell kentucky republican i said to them since this is sunday and the churches are closed i want to begin bipartisan meeting with a prayer mrs pelosi said and i quoted pope francis word of prayer under this circumstance and he said i pray that god would enlighten those who are responsible for the common good that they would take responsibility for those in their care and secretary mnuchin said well since you quoted pope francis i will quote the markets and so that has taken us to another area of values to me about this the president who hasn t spoken to mrs pelosi since a frosty meeting oct 16 as the democrats impeachment inquiry picked up steam summed up mr mnuchin s value to his administration and to the nation he s a fantastic guy and he loves our country the president said and he s been dealing with both s
