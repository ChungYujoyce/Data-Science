terrorists will exploit this privacy to plot attacks the terrorist attacks in mumbai in 2008 were planned and executed using electronic devices including cell phones and gpss six americans were among the 166 people killed in mumbai what you re seeing is a trend towards countries not just india asserting more sovereign control over communications said scott cleland president of precursor llc the internet the way it is architected is a cybersecurity nightmare it is architected in a way that allows bad actors to very easily cover their tracks so you have countries all over the world that are pulling their hair out trying to deal with the reality of bad actors on the internet he said the problem becomes how do you define what bad is in some countries bad is any opposition which isn t bad

firms teresita schaffer director of the south asia program at the center for strategic and international studies says this gets into areas that governments don t like to talk about the trade off is between on the one hand the ability of governments to potentially intercept communications between people who are planning some kind of criminal activity and on the other hand the confidence of customers that their private communications are in fact private mrs schaffer said earlier this week saudi arabia reportedly backed down from a threat to ban blackberry service in the kingdom after rim agreed to give saudi authorities codes for message users the united arab emirates is seeking similar access and has said it will block blackberry s messenger e mail and web browsing services oct 11 if access is not provided mrs schaffer said authorities in a number of countries have expected providers of electronic communications to give them some kind of electronic key which permits them in those
