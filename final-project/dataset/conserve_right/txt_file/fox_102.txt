faced off across the syrian border we aposll ask our sunday panel will this trigger a wider war and our power player of the week the changing role of the uso as the military aposs home away from home unidentified female we will no longer working with young men who were being drafted into the military all of a sudden we have families wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace hello again and happy mother aposs day from fox news in washington north korea has scheduled what it calls a dismantling ceremony of its nuclear test site ahead of president trump and kim jong un aposs singapore summit that aposs now less than one month away a plan to negotiate a nuclear deal with north korea comes as the president pulls out of an agreement with iran and mr trump says he wants to signal the kind of hard bargain he aposll demand from kim in a few minutes we aposll discuss this moment what happens next with iran and growing tensions in the mideast with secretary of state mike pompeo in his first interview since he returned from north korea this week but first to kevin corke at the white house with the impact of dramatically changing u s policy around the world kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent chris senior white house officials characterize the president aposs recent foreign policy decisions each by the way with major global implications in four simple words promises made promises kept but a more nuanced assessment might be even simpler america first that aposs because whether it aposs north korea iran syria even israel what you have no is a clear departure not just from the previous administration aposs approach but from washington orthodoxy in each case for example in north korea you also have a policy of engagement based ph in subtle aggression but also tempered by the promise of cooperation begin video clip pompeo america aposs track record of support for the korean people is second to none if north korea takes bold action to quickly denuclearize the united states is prepared to work with north korea to achieve prosperity on par with our south korean friends end video clip corke in the middle east the administration aposs rejection of washington orthodoxy also on display as jared kushner and ivanka trump represent the country as the u s embassy moves from tel aviv to jerusalem a move seen as a symbolic and a diplomatic stake in the ground and full throated support of the israelis and against the growing influence of tehran in the region which was further disrupted by the president aposs decision to break the terms of the iran nuclear agreement this week there is talk chris that decision by the president emboldened the iranians to attack the israelis as you know the israelis struck back hitting iranian targets in syria it is also certain they have tacit support in washington to do so chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks for that and joining us now the new and very busy secretary of state mike pompeo mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday pompeo good morning chris it aposs great to be with you wallace let aposs start with breaking news first of all that savage attack last night in paris a chechen knifing killing one person wounding four others what can you tell us about a possible link to terror pompeo we don apost know much more we know that the caliphate isis has claimed responsibility that he was one of their soldiers we can apost verify that yet the french authorities with all the intelligence help the united states can provide will do our best to unpack this in the coming hours wallace ok let aposs talk about some other breaking news the north koreans announced yesterday that they are going to blow up their nuclear site in 10 12 days how big a development is this and is that we believe their only nuclear test site pompeo chris it aposs good news every single site that the north koreans have that can inflict risk upon the american people that is destroyed eliminated dismantled is good news for the american people and for the world and so this is one step along the way i had a good set of meetings this past week aimed at heading exactly this direction wallace i want to go back to the comment and kevin just played it your comment on friday that if jim chooses the quote right path the u s is prepared to work with north korea to quote achieve prosperity what does that mean as far as direct u s investment in north korea and are we as part of this willing in effect to guarantee kim aposs security that regime change will be off the table pompeo chris here aposs what this will look like this will be americans coming in private sector americans not the u s taxpayer private sector americans helping build the energy grid they need enormous amounts of electricity in north korea to work with them to develop infrastructure all the things that the north korean people need the capacity for american agriculture to support north korea so they can eat meat and have healthy lives those are the kinds of things that if we get what it is the president has demanded the complete verifiable irreversible denuclearization of north korea that the american people will offer in spades wallace and as part of that are we in effect saying to kim if you give us what we want you can stay on and power pompeo we will have to provide security assurances to be sure this has been the trade off that has been pending for 25 years no president has ever put america in a position where the north korean leadership thought that this was truly possible that the americans would actually do this would lead to the place where america was no longer held at risk by the north korean regime that aposs the objectives when i said earlier this week that i think chairman kim shares the objectives with the american people i aposm convinced of that now the task is for president trump and he to meet to validate the process by which this would go forward to set up those markers so that we can negotiate this outcome wallace do you have any problem given kim aposs history and the history of his family as an oppressive regime any problems with the idea of the u s even if we get our deal in effect giving the security guarantee to the kim regime pompeo look we aposll have to see how the negotiations proceed but make no mistake about it america aposs interest here is preventing the risk that north korea will launch a nuclear weapon into l a or denver or to the very place we are sitting here this morning chris that aposs our objective that aposs the instate the president has laid out and that aposs the mission that he sent me on this past week to put us on the trajectory to go achieve that wallace let aposs talk about denuclearization the objective two weeks ago national security advisor john bolton sat in this very seat and he told me that the u s negotiating position going in is that kim has to ship out has to dismantle and take out of the country all of his nuclear weapons all of his nuclear infrastructure all of his long range missiles before the u s will grant any concessions on the other hand this week kim met with chinese president xi and he called for quote phased and synchronous measures in other words action for action have you and kim agreed with the sequencing is is it all of actions by him first or is it step by step and is that something as i said that you aposve agreed with or is it something that kim and the president will have to work out at the summit pompeo chris we aposve had discussions on how this would proceed there aposs still a great deal of detail to be worked on in the coming weeks we will continue to work on that so we can be in a good spot on june 12th in singapore for president trump but make no mistake about it we aposve done this before right we aposve done trade for trade moment for a moment you give me x i give you y and it has failed repeatedly i think chairman kim understands that i think he appreciates the fact that this is going to have to be different and big and special and something that has never been undertaken before if we are going to get to this historic outcome both sides have to be prepared to take a truly measures to achieve it wallace and how confident are you because you aposre going to be putting the president of the united states in a room with kim in singapore with the whole world watching how confident are you that not only he understands it but that he aposs going to have to that he aposs going to deliver on our expectations pompeo well to quote president trump we aposll see right we are not to the place yet but we should be remotely close to declaring that we aposve achieved what it is we want there aposs a great deal of work that remains our eyes are wide open with respect to the risks but it is it is our fervent hope that chairman kim wants to make a strategic change a strategic change in the direction for his country and his people and if he aposs prepared to do that president trump is prepared to assure that there aposs going to be a successful transition wallace all right i want to talk about that you said that we understand and john bolton talked about that nobody in the administration is starry eyed the president has been raising expectations for this summit saying he thinks that they aposre going to make a great deal now his phrase your predecessor at the cia john brennan says he thinks that aposs playing into kim aposs hands take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i think we aposre going to have a success i think this will be a very big success john brennan former cia director i think he has been masterful in how he has manipulated perceptions and how he aposs manipulated and quite frankly duped mr trump end video clip wallace is it a mistake for the president to predict a quote great success mike pompeo secretary of state i think former director brennan aposs remarks are silly on their face we are going to enter into a set of discussions with two nations doing their best to achieve outcomes for their own people that are consistent with their objectives and goals i think we now understand that there is the potential that there are shared objectives and our mission is to prepare the groundwork we are pretty far along the way in doing so and we aposll continue to work in the days ahead 30 left to prepare for june 12th so the president can have a successful outcome that the two of them can meet and see if there is sufficient overlap so that we can achieve the ultimate objective for the american people wallace after you brought the american hostages home and the whole world celebrated that president trump praised kim for releasing them in that praise not the release of the hostages but that praise upset some critics take a look at this begin video clip trump kim jong un did a great service to himself to his country by doing this sen chuck schumer d ny senate minority leader we can apost be fooled into giving the north korean regime credit for returning americans that never should have been detained in the first place end video clip wallace according to your state department aposs latest report north korea still holds at least 80 000 political prisoners in its labor camps and other facilities is human rights an issue in this summit or is this just going to be about the nuclear issue pompeo yes chris the administration is always concerned about human rights it aposs the case not only there are political prisoners that remained in north korea there are americans held around the world by other rogue regimes too i can assure you this administration i saw it in my role as director of the cia and i aposve seen it now in first two and a half weeks as secretary of state is intently focused on achieving the return of each of those as well we had a success this week we are happy for those families and for america that those three americans returned home but we recognize there is much more work to do we still have americans held and we are working diligently on behalf of each and every one of them wallace when i people found out that you were going to be on the program today they all of question i must say i did what is kim like with the possible exception of dennis rodman you had spent more time with him than any other westerner at least two and a half hours the way i figure it what is he like give us any kind of personal insight how aware is he of what president trump has been saying was there any mention of little rocket man pompeo well i aposve got a lot fewer rebounds than dennis rodman but i did get to spend a great deal of time with chairman kim the conversations are professional he knows he knows his brief he knows what he is trying to achieve for the north korean people he is able to deal with complexity when the conversation requires it he does follow the western press he will probably watch the show at some point he aposs paying attention to things the world is saying he too is preparing for june 12th he and his team we aposll be working with them to put our two leaders in a position where it aposs just possible we might pull off an historic undertaking wallace was there any mention of the exchange of insults back and forth pompeo no we didn apost cover that chris wallace that aposs probably wise i want to turn there aposs a lot on your brief iran and israel got into an armed conflict across the syrian border this week after president trump pulled out of a nuclear deal with tehran do you think that there aposs any connection that iran feels less constrained now that the u s no longer is part of this deal about iran nukes pompeo that aposs ludicrous it aposs ludicrous to suggest that iran feels less constrained when during the jcpoa they have now fired missiles into an airport where americans travel each day in riyadh they have now fired missiles into israel to suggest that somehow the withdrawal from the jcpoa is driving the iranian conduct that has taken place during the jcpoa in yemen the rise of hezbollah all of those things took place during the jcpoa indeed i would argue that they thought they could act with impunity they watched they watched europe at exactly zero sanctions on their missile program during the jcpoa i think rouhani and zarif need to explain why it aposs the case that while this agreement was in place iran continued its march across the middle east wallace president trump made it clear that he is not only going after iran but he is also prepared to sanction european companies that continue to do business in tehran here is the president begin video clip trump we will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction any nation that helps iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the united states end video clip wallace but the leaders of france of germany of britain all say that they aposre going to stay in the deal and they aposre going to look for a way to protect european companies that continue to do business the question is how hard is the trump administration prepared to go after european companies that ignore the u s pulling out pompeo two things come across first the wealth that was created in iran as a result of the jcpoa drove iranian malign activity it fueled qasem soleimani it fueled the irgc it provided resources for their work in syria and iraq president trump aposs withdrawal is denying them that wealth denying them the resources to continue their bad behavior to take the money away from them the withdrawal wasn apost aimed at the europeans i worked hard over the short time i aposve been the secretary of state to try and fix the deal we couldn apost reach agreement with our e3 partners i aposm hopeful in the days and weeks ahead we can come up with a deal that really works that really protects the world from iranian bad behavior not just their nuclear program but there missiles and their malign behavior as well and i aposll be working closely with the europeans to try and achieve that chris wallace what about if the european companies and the european countries say look there aposs not going to be a renegotiation anymore than there aposs going to be a renegotiation of the paris climate accord is the u s prepared to go after companies and our allies like britain france and germany if they try to continue to do business pompeo the sanctions regime that is now in place is very clear about what the requirements are my mission that i aposve been given by president trump is to work to strike a deal that achieves the outcomes that protect america that aposs what we are going to do and i aposll be hard at it with the europeans in the next several days wallace a couple of final questions israel the u s opens its embassy in jerusalem tomorrow the palestinians are talking about a day of rage violent mass protests and the plo won apost even talk to the u s anymore as an interlocutor in terms of the middle east is the peace process dead and given the threat of violence what are you as the secretary of state saying to americans in the middle east in those parts of the world over the next few days pompeo so the peace process is most decidedly not dead we aposre hard at work on it we hope we can achieve a successful outcome there as well with respect to security we aposre aware of the situation on the ground the united states government has taken a number of actions to ensure that not only our governmental interest but the american people in that region are secure as well and we are comfortable we aposve taken action that reduces that risk wallace finally and it aposs pretty remarkable given all that aposs happened all that is on your brief you have been secretary of state for barely two weeks now what aposs your vision for the state department pompeo well first chris i hope i haven apost peaked in my first two weeks laughter pompeo but it aposs pretty clear we aposve got to go put the diplomatic team on the playing field it should be the united states state department that is at the front of american foreign policy delivering solutions to solve america aposs problems without resorting to military force and so i aposm going to build the team we aposre going to get our swagger back and the state department will be out in front in every corner of the world leading america aposs diplomatic policy achieving great outcomes on behalf of president trump and america wallace secretary pompeo thank you thanks for your time in a very busy schedule pompeo thank you wallace always good to talk with you sir pompeo thank you chris wallace up next we aposll get reaction from the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen on the trump kim summit and growing tensions in the middle east commercial break wallace with the trump kim summit now less than one month away excitement and hopes are building but there are both risks and rewards to this high stakes diplomacy and we want to discuss that with admiral mike mullen former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under president bush and obama admiral welcome back admiral mike mullen ret former joint chiefs of staff chairman good to be with you wallace you just heard secretary pompeo and president trump is also talking with growing optimism about his summit with chairman kim take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i think it aposs going to be a very big success but my attitude is and if it isn apost it isn apost ok end video clip wallace what do you think are the prospects for a trump kim summit what is what are the prospects that this will work out that kim will give up as you just heard the secretary say give up his nuclear program and agree to give us means to verify it mullen i think it aposs really uncertain i think i want to give president trump credit for getting to this point he has moved the needle on this one that has not been done in the past but i also think given the stakes it aposs a very much higher risk high reward opportunity and i think the downsides potentially are really really significant as well wallace all right i want to talk to about that because you gave a speech in washington this week and you talked about what could happen if the summit falls apart if they walk away from singapore without a deal let me put it up on the screen if the talks do fall apart excuse me you didn apost cough i did the failure is likely to stir the president aposs most bellicose aggressive instincts are you saying that if there is no deal that we could be worse off than if there had been no summit in the first place mullen i think what i aposm saying is if the talks fail that the likelihood of options are dramatically reduced to potential conflict and that aposs a huge worry i think despite the progress that has been made to try to understand kim jong un there aposs a lot we don apost understand and that he would be significantly different from his father and his grandfather to make the kind of changes that are being discussed would be a huge huge shift and i aposm more skeptical than i am optimistic that he would do that that said it could happen but i do worry about the downside of breaking of conflict breaking out where tens and hundreds of thousands of people particularly in south korea could die very quickly and kim has a huge arsenal to include nuclear chemical biological weapons and the outbreak there could be huge i don apost know that we aposve had much of a debate in the country about the potential outbreak of nuclear war use of nuclear weapons which haven apost been used since 1945 wallace but you have said you aposre on the record as saying that you do not believe in the feasibility the utility of trying to contain north korea that we can apost live with north korea as an active nuclear threat so if this agreement were to fall apart what would you have president trump do mullen well i mean that aposs i aposm not really sure those are the stakes that we are playing for right now i would i really want this agreement i want the result to be denuclearization complete exactly with the president is seeking and also have not any outbreak of war that aposs a pretty thin lane to get into particularly if the talks break down i also think we need to put as much pressure on china to ensure that combat doesn apost there is no combat outbreak and certainly include our allies in japan as well as the south koreans in generating this kind of outcome what i aposm most concerned about is if this doesn apost result in a positive outcome the potential for i think military conflict goes up and therefore you get into whether or not he would use the nuclear weapons wallace i mean the question i have is would we be better off because you are saying if if we get together and it falls apart then there is not much more to talk about would it be better not to have the summit are you suggesting that maybe we aposre doing this too quickly mullen well i think actually that aposs hypothetical at this point i think we are going to have it it aposs another 30 days it aposs going to be 30 days of prognosis about the pluses and minuses here but i am convinced it aposs going to happen and i want to try to manage not manage i want to try to understand what potential outcomes could be both on the upside and the downside wallace let aposs turn to iran and president trump aposs decision to pull out of the nuclear deal with tehran here he is begin video clip trump it is clear to me that we cannot prevent an iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement the iran deal is defective at its core end video clip wallace you were the former chairman you were the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff with the president aposs decision to pull out of the deal has the risk of iran developing a nuclear weapon has it increased or diminished mullen i think it is increased i think has actually increased fairly dramatically i think one of the things we forget is how bright and capable the iranians are and that they can rebound from setbacks pretty quickly technically and i think their capability could be developed very very rapidly wallace but you have criticized iran for continuing its missile program its ballistic missile program and the jcpoa the iran nuclear deal did not stop that it clearly did not curtail iran aposs bad actions across the middle east and the support for terror groups in number of countries aren apost there flaws in the deal that president obama and john kerry negotiated that had to be addressed mullen i think we lose the context if you will of the jcpoa which was very specifically focused on the nuclear weapons and those weapons are so devastating that that focus i think was very well deserved the other thing that i aposm concerned about is if iran gets nuclear weapons that it will proliferate nuclear weapons in the region so that aposs one thing secondly we ought to press them as hard as possible to push back bring as much pressure on their nefarious activities with respect to terrorism and support of terrorists as well as their missile program and do that with every available capability and iran has not acted well since the implementation of the jcpoa outside its requirements everyone i aposve spoken to says iran is in full compliance with the specifics of the jcpoa which eliminates their ability to develop nuclear weapons over a period of time wallace of course the period of time ends and that aposs one of the concerns of president trump is that in 2025 you have the sunset clause and that apparently was the issue that broke us apart from the european allies and that aposs when the president decided to pull out mullen yes i think clearly eyes wide open we knew going in that there was a sunset aspect of this ten years is a long time in some ways to look at it in which case you would hope that there would be developments where they wouldn apost develop or once that sunset clause went into effect wallace i want to ask about two other issues while i have what do you think of gina haspel aposs nomination to head the cia and do you believe as some democrats made in the confirmation hearing this week that her involvement in enhanced interrogation after 9 11 somehow disqualifies her mullen i aposve aligned myself with john mccain senator john mccain for a long time on views of torture and what the standard is he is the gold standard there so i aposm very supportive of the position that he has taken in that regard and i recognize lots of intelligence professionals i talked to think that think gina is an extraordinary person with a great background that said she has a past and then recently while she stated that she was in compliance with the law where i think senator mccain is is where i am that morally it was wrong it was torture and that she should be held responsible for that wallace and therefore should not be the cia director mullen i aposm not voting i aposll let those that vote make that decision wallace but you would say that what she did was wrong mullen i just yes i aposm very much where senator mccain is wallace i aposm sure that that someone is going to note after your appearance here that back in 2016 michael bloomberg considered running for president and he at one point vetted you as a possible running mate so i aposm sure someone aposs going to say it and i want to give you an opportunity to respond hey you aposre a never trumper mullen no i aposm not actually i aposm not a never trumper i aposve never said that and i worked hard to try to stay out of the politics of all of this quite frankly wallace and so what is your attitude towards the president and the fact that you apparently were thinking of running with michael bloomberg mullen well that was that was a time that i was focused with michael bloomberg on the possibilities it never really came to fruition and in the end it i honestly came to a point with my family that it really wasn apost my kind of life or or that we would pursue anything like that wallace admiral mullen thank you thank you for coming in today and pursuing this live and talking to us we appreciate it mullen thanks chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss a foreign policy landscape that is shifting rapidly plus now that we have a date and location what would you like to ask the panel about the trump kim summit just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up president trump keeps another major campaign promise pulling out of the iran nuclear deal begin video clip donald trump president of the united states america will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the fallout and prospects to negotiate a new deal next on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states today aposs action sends a critical message the united states no longer makes empty threats when i make promises i keep them end video clip wallace president trump staking out an aggressive foreign policy as he announces the u s is out of the iran nuclear deal and prepares for talks with north korea and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove charles lane of the washington post former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and former national security council spokesperson michael anton now with hillsdale college well we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the trump kim summit we got this on facebook from wichert vanderbend what are the chances of a tying denuking to a treaty giving kim security michael you heard me ask secretary pompeo about that you heard his answer how would you answer wichert michael anton former nsc spokesman i would say that that is one of the goals and the south koreans and the north koreans the want you know the korean war never formally ended they want a peace treaty that formally ends the korean war i think if i were in the administration or giving advice to the administration i would hold that out as a carrot toward the end it aposs not something you give up front you see what you can get on the denuclearization front the destruction of that one site as the secretary of state said is very positive but for this to work they are going to have to be robust inspections the north koreans are going to essentially have to lay bare their entire program and let people crawl all over it and confirm that they aposre shutting things down destroying things they aposre not heightening wallace but but were you surprised that pompeo made it as explicit as he did in our interview look if we get all of that where willing to say kim you can stay in power anton i was not surprised just because i have known from the beginning that the policy of this administration has never been regime change i think people like such as admiral mullen who are most concerned about conflict you know the point i would make to them is making u s policy explicitly regime change that aposs how you in a way up the chances of conflict because you scare the north korean regime so much that if it thinks its survival is on the line it aposs much more likely to do risky things whereas if it thinks the united states is willing to live with it hopefully that reduces presser and calms them down a little bit and makes them less likely to do risky things wallace congresswoman edwards what do you think of the way that president trump is approaching this summit and when the president praises kim for releasing the hostages and you see democratic senate leader chuck schumer on the floor criticizing him for that doesn apost that add to the sense that the democrats won apost give credit to donald trump for anything he does donna edwards former u s congresswoman d md oh i mean i think it was positive that these three men three americans were released the question is you know that is a precursor even the dismantling of the nuclear site is a precursor my question is what are americans going to get and how are we going to verify that we aposve gotten something of substance i mean i remain a little skeptical about the ability to negotiate denuclearization in north korea but i think it would be a positive development obviously if that happened but i don apost want to hang too many hopes on what aposs going to happen on june 12th in singapore wallace let aposs also turn to iran and the president aposs decision to pull out of the iran nuclear deal here was part of mr trump aposs announcements begin video clip donald trump president of the united states if we do nothing we know exactly what will happen in just a short period of time the world aposs leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world aposs most dangerous weapons end video clip wallace karl we all understand that there are gaps in the deal gaps about iranian behavior about iran aposs ballistic missile program about the question of the sunset clause but after failing to get a deal with the europeans and that was the effort that yes we aposll keep this deal but we aposll add on these other measures you heard the president you heard mike pompeo talk about the iranians coming back to the negotiating table how realistic is that karl rove fox news contributor well actually pretty realistic if you saw the comments yesterday of the foreign minister of iran he talked first of all of the threat we aposre going to we aposre going to restart our program on a quote industrial scale but then he immediately pivoted and said basically we aposre going to be sitting down with the europeans to see if we can salvage the deal and literally this week wallace but he aposs talking about salvaging the deal with the french and the rove i i know wallace not not with the u s rove i know i know but here aposs the deal this is this is the the the risky strategy of the trump administration in my opinion the three m aposs are going to be meeting with him may merkel and macron and the question is has the united states through pompeo and others and through the president signaled we know there have been conversations with all three of them had has the administration signaled what it wants and in and then are the europeans going to be willing to carry those issues forward with the iranians and are the iranians going to be willing to do a deal the three steps could fall apart at any any one of them but i took it as a sign when the when the iranians after their typical bellicose rhetoric said we aposre going to try and salvage the deal because remember they aposve got problems they aposve got an economy that aposs in meltdown they aposve got domestic unrest and then you have the europeans concerned about the impact of the sanctions from the united states that effect companies in their countries which are already a little nervous about doing business with iran but so it aposs going to be difficult it does no no guarantee of success but if the president has been clear with the europeans as to what he wants out of a better deal whether it aposs anytime anyplace inspections get rid of some of the make prohibitions rather than caps maybe there aposs a way forward wallace chuck you think that is the the the the method here is look i aposm going to pull out and now the europeans are going to basically negotiate what the president wanted charles lane fox news contributor i don apost know if that is the conscious method but if there aposs any way out that aposs one avenue through which we aposll have to pass that aposs the the the nice the carrot the stick by the way is the hammer that israel and the kingdom of saudi arabia are putting down on the iranians the israelis with this huge massive retaliations and the threats that they aposre not going to tolerate an iranian presence in syria and the saudis didn apost get enough attention promising to turn the oil taps back on because as you know the spike in oil prices that was being caused by this you know transaction where where trump pulls out of the deal was something saudi arabia aposs now going to counteracts so that the u s economy won apost suffer from it and so the iranians won apost benefit the u s has really pivoted from europe in support of its other allies israel and saudi arabia and that aposs sort of the group u s saudi arabia and israel that aposs pressuring iran right now wallace i aposve got less than a minute left in this segment michael and i want to ask you because the president threatened iran and said look if they start their nuclear program back up they aposre going to have problems they aposve never seen before from your time on the national security council in this white house do you think that president trump is really prepared to launch a nuclear launch a strike against iran if it resumes its nuclear program anton i think he would never rule anything out for the future because ruling things out doesn apost make sense when you don apost know what wallace no but i aposm asking you and you aposre no longer a spokesman i aposm asking you a question do you really think he aposs prepared to launch a military strike to take out a new iran nuclear problem ph anton it looks to me like we aposre a ways away from that what aposs going to happen now is significant sanctions are going to be back imposed on iran which will require europe essentially to choose between access to the u s financial system and the u s economy and the iranian economy and at the end of the day that aposs not a choice the iranian economy is just too small so this will hurt iran a lot i mean what they really want most they want access to european business contracts so they can make money if they don apost have that anymore it will put pressure on the regime and it will also starve them limit them of the resources they need to fuel the program i think that aposs the next step that we aposre going to see happen if we can get a deal such as the secretary described wallace all right panel we have to take a break here when we come back president trump aposs nominee to head the cia faces challenges on the path to confirmation including opposition from senator john mccain commercial break begin video clip gina haspel cia director nominee my moral compass is strong i would not allow the cia to undertake activity that i thought was immoral even if it was technically legal i would absolutely not permit it end video clip wallace president trump aposs nominee to lead the cia gina haspel facing tough questioning at her senate confirmation hearing about the agency aposs use of harsh interrogation after 9 11 and we aposre back now with the panel well i want to play a little bit more of what haspel told congress this week begin video clip gina haspel cia director nominee after 9 11 i didn apost look to go sit on the swiss ph desk i stepped up i was not on the sidelines i was on the front lines in the cold war and i was on the front lines in the fight against al qaeda end video clip wallace karl what do you think of the approach by most of the democrats in that hearing to judge how people acted during the crisis of 9 11 or after the crisis of 9 11 by how they feel now 17 years after the fact rove i think it aposs reprehensible if people say that she is morally unfit because she was following a program that was carefully crafted by the lawyers and approved as being within our international obligations and the statutes of the united states it aposs now been ruled by an act of congress and to no longer be applicable no longer be of tool be available but if they aposre saying she is morally unfit to head the cia because she was part of that program then every one of those people who was in the united states congress at the time who knew about this program and refused to be to to condemn it and agreed with it like nancy pelosi and dianne feinstein who today find it convenient to attack haspel they are morally culpable if she aposs morally culpable she aposs the exact right person to head the cia she will be approved at least two democrats have already announced they aposll support her she will be nominated she she even with the two republicans mailing ph wallace let me let me let me pick up on that because despite strong democratic opposition it does look like haspel will be confirmed two red state democrats running for re election this year joe manchin in west virginia on the left and now joe donnelly of indiana on the right there both say that they will vote for her congresswoman edwards should directly to karl aposs point should haspel be blocked for following a presidential directive that was viewed as legal by the justice department and was briefed to democratic members of congress should she be blocked from serving as the cia director edwards well what i was hearing in the questioning was a question about whether she believed today looking back on it that the program was immoral and she refused to answer that look i think that the two joes manchin and donnelly who aposve now said that they are going to support her nomination actually opens a pathway for or a opens a pathway for confirmation but i think the question is legitimate for all of us to look back on a program that may or may not have been may have been authorized but just saying wallace but she made it clear in the sound bite that we played that she would not permit that kind of activity again edwards no well what she didn apost say and this was going directly to the question was whether looking back on it she believed the program was immoral i think that aposs a really important question to ask and she never answered it rove it aposs not an important question to ask it aposs sackcloth and ashes we want you to take out a whip and beat yourself bloody in front of the american people because we didn apost we didn apost like the war in iraq and we have now retrospectively decided we didn apost like what was done to keep america safe edwards no it tells us what we would do in this now rove this is politics pure and simple and hurtful to our country this is this discourages good people from stepping up edward karl it tells us what we would do in the future rove no she has made it clear she will abide by the laws and statutes of the united states of america approved by congress and signed by the president of the united states wallace but you know what let let me bring in our other two go ahead anton i mean i would make two points one is there aposs some you hear a lot about a supposed conflict between the president and the bureaucracy of the so called deep state yet he has nominated the first career professional to lead the cia since william colby in the early 1970s and the same people who are criticizing the president for being hostile to the bureaucracy you know the federal career civil servants are trying to block this nomination i find that surreal the other point i would make too is that i think what this is about what karl said is right and i would go a little further it aposs about trying to re litigate this issue i think there was a lot of anger about it there were investigations done people were cleared there was a hope i think at certain corners of the democratic party and on the left that when the obama administration came in some people would get punished raked over the coals investigations were launched and everybody was cleared and i think there are some people who never got over that and they want to find some way to punish somebody and gina is now the target lane the reason people are focused on this karl is not the attitude of president bush whom you work for it aposs the current president that concerns them and during the campaign he promised to do worse than waterboarding and so i think people wanted to establish gina haspel on the record about it not because of her or the past but because of the present president karl well maybe so but i i i think at the heart of this is they aposre they aposre both getting back at bush over the war and getting back at the war and then cleansing themselves this is about the people who didn apost stand up and say who today say it was immoral who back then didn apost say it was immoral anton and although the president did say that at a campaign rally he also made clear later that he had subsequent conversations with secretary of defense mattis and he changed his mind lane well he does change he does change his mind yes edwards all the more reason to have gina haspel on the record lane but on the on the other hand to be fair rove and she is now on the record so let aposs agree she aposs now said i will abide by the law of the united states of america and i will not do anything that is immoral even if it is technically allowed confirm her lane well you know something in the spy business they do immoral stuff every day of the week so i aposm not sure how important that is there is a separate category which is torture but for the rest of it i found it a little bit of a everybody was doing a little posturing when they said oh no no the head spy will never do anything immoral when in fact what they do is blackmail and extort and steal secrets and stuff every day of the week so that was a little bit of a rove in the interest of the united states lane which makes it moral yes rove yes it does wallace all right i aposm glad we aposve settled all that thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the uso you may be surprised these days it aposs about a lot more than putting on a show for the troops commercial break wallace it aposs an american institution that for years has worked to lift the morale of our troops at home and abroad but there aposs a lot you may not know about today aposs uso here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape elaine rogers president uso metro i am just so passionate about our military and their families and i get to meet heroes every single day hey hi wallace voice over elaine rogers is president of uso metro and she has been on the job since 1976 it aposs the largest uso affiliate in the country with ten centers across the d c area and it shows how dramatically the uso has changed over the years young soldiers used to go to the local uso for friday night dances bob hope lead tours to entertain troops stationed overseas bob hope entertainer i just want you boys to see what you aposre fighting for that aposs all wallace but as the military switched to an all volunteer force the uso had to adjust rogers we were no longer working with young men who were being drafted into the military all of a sudden we had families wallace uso metro now serves 350 000 troops and their families in facilities like this 25 000 square foot center at fort belvoir outside washington rogers the uso is truly saving lives today and it aposs with the services that we aposre doing whether it aposs art therapy music therapy those kinds of programs which people don apost normally think of the uso doing without you we couldn apost have a uso wallace with a budget of 17 million raised privately and 3 000 volunteers rogers offers all sorts of assistance if a family flies to washington to visit a wounded warrior or bury a fallen hero the uso meets them at the airport when a soldier is about to be deployed they can take advantage of something called united through reading rogers the active duty mother or father can come into our uso and actually read a book this is the last thing that they do before they leave the united states and then we send that book back to their families so they can see their loved one reading it wallace and yes the uso still has celebrities lifting troops apos morale working with gary sinise and his foundation to put on shows stars like tom hanks and sheryl crow visiting soldiers in the hospital fdr started the uso just before world war ii then there was vietnam when so many americans scorned the soldiers who fought there rogers it was a sad part of our history and today we find so many people wanting to reach out to the military help them be supportive wallace through it all elaine rogers has carried on the mission for 42 years rogers it is so emotional for me because i know how much that we are giving back to our m
