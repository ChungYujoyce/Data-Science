resident mike pence joins chris wallace on fox news sunday to discuss the new york times decision to publish an op ed by an unnamed senior official in the trump administration and bob woodward s portrayal of a white house in disarray this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday september 9 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i aposm chris wallace president trump calls on the justice department to investigate who wrote that essay in the new york times describing resistance inside his administration begin videotape donald trump president of the united states for the sake of our national security the new york times should publish his name at once wallace this hour we aposll discuss the 1 2 punch of the anonymous column should all top officials take a lie detector test and would you agree to take one and reports of white house disarray and bob woodward aposs new work what does it mean for the future of the trump administration we aposll ask the vice president of the united states mike pence then judge brett kavanaugh faces of grilling by democrats at his supreme court confirmation hearing sen dick durbin d illinois there are many concerns about the future of the democracy and the future of democracy and you are asking for a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land wallace we aposll ask democratic senator chris coons of his party can block kavanaugh plus barack obama steps back into the political arena and unloads on president trump barack obama former president it did not start with donald trump he is a symptom not the cause he aposs just capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years trump i watched it but i fell asleep wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel how the obama trump face off will shape the midterm election all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington any concerns president trump has had about leaks and disloyalty inside his administration were confirmed this week by that anonymous column in the new york times and bob woodward aposs new book top officials openly admit they work against presidential directives they consider dangerous and add to that barack obama back in the political spotlight hammering president trump in the run up to the midterm elections on saturday vice president mike pence invited us to his residence on embassy row in washington to push back against stories of an administration in disarray begin videotape wallace mr vice president welcome back to fox news sunday mike pence vice president of the united states thank you chris wallace let aposs start with barack obama aposs return to the campaign trail accusing president trump of practicing the politics of fear and resentment your reaction pence well it was very disappointing to see president obama break with the tradition of former presidents and become so political and roll out same tired arguments that he and liberals have made over the last eight years the truth is the american people in 2016 rejected the policy and direction of barack obama when they elected president donald trump look we inherited an economy that has grown a little bit more than 1 percent in the last quarter our economy is growing at 4 2 percent four million new jobs unemployment at a 50 year low and to have president obama come out and tout his policies that resulted in less than 2 percent growth saw tax increases obamacare regulation and doubling the national debt i think was it was very disappointing but frankly i think it just illuminates the choice the american people had in the midterm elections wallace let aposs look though at some of president obama specific charges he talks about actions like the president calling on the attorney general jeff sessions to investigate who wrote that anonymous article in the new york times begin video clip obama this should not be a partisan issue to say that we do not pressure the attorney general or the fbi to use the criminal justice system as a cudgel to punish her political opponents end video clip wallace what are the national security grounds to investigate that article what law did the writer break pence well we aposll find out if there was criminal activity involved if something will be inappropriate wallace what criminal activity could there be there was no classified information pence well we aposll see i think the president aposs concern is that this individual may have responsibilities in the area of national security and if they have no published anonymous editorial that says that they are misrepresenting themselves that they are essentially living a lie within this administration and trying to frustrate and subvert the agenda of the president was elected to advance that aposs an important issue wallace political disloyalty it certainly troubling it aposs not illegal pence well but there aposs another part of it though you know every senior official in any administration takes an oath to the constitution the constitution of the united states vests all executive power in the president of the united states to have an individual who took that oath literally say that they work every day to frustrate the president advancing the agenda was elected to advance is undemocratic it aposs not just deceitful but it aposs really an assault on our democracy and that person should do the honorable thing step forward and resign wallace i want to get into the question as to whether they are trying to thwart the will of the president in the moment but i want to look at because president obama mentioned this as well the president aposs tweet earlier this week basically chastising rebuking attorney general sessions for bringing the prosecution on charges of corruption against tow gop house members the president tweeted two very popular republican congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge just ahead of the midterms by the jeff sessions justice department two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time good job jeff the president is saying play politics protect members of congress even if they have committed acts of corruption before the election pence no i don apost think that aposs what the president was saying at all chris look the department of justice as you know has long standing guidelines through the success of the administration that says whenever possible the justice department should avoid taking actions that may impact an election now the president was referring to that and the difficulty crosstalk wallace these are two people one supposedly committing an insider trading and the other one who was living high off campaign funds are you saying that they should be protected because we are close to a midterms pence they are all very serious allegations and they ought to be pursued but i think the president was referring to the long standing tradition in the justice department to avoid unnecessarily impacting election outcomes and perhaps preventing other men and women from stepping forward and filling those slots in the future but look i think one of the virtues of this president one of the reasons why we aposve been so successful over the last 18 months is because he speaks directly to the american people you don apost have to wonder what president trump is thinking almost on any given morning because he tells the american people what aposs on his mind and it aposs that energy crosstalk wallace doesn apost mean it isn apost troubling pence well wallace when he says i mean again just forgive me sir two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time good job jeff should the attorney general be worried about that pence i think look this is a president that was elected by speaking directly to the american people and being candid with the american people in expressing what he aposs enthusiastic about what he aposs frustrated about and the american people understand that wallace this gets to the theme of both the anonymous article and also bob woodward aposs book that some officials within this administration within this white house feel that they have to act in effect as guardrails to protect against some of the president aposs more impulsive actions case in point first story in woodward aposs book september of 2017 gary cohn the chief economic advisor walks into the oval office and sees a letter on the president aposs desk that would blow up the south korean free trade deal and jeopardize one of our most important alliances and he takes it away so the president won apost sign it do have any doubt that happened pence i have every doubt that that happened i really do and the president renegotiated the south korean free trade agreement in a way that put american jobs and american workers first but look i crosstalk wallace if i may just stay on this point for one minute because bob woodward didn apost just quote somebody he has the document here this is the letter that he took off the president aposs desk mark september 2017 in which the president if he had signed it would have terminated the south korean trade deal this isn apost just talk he aposs got the goods here pence this is a president who puts people around the table around the resolute desk in the oval office that bring him all of the options they put on the table everything that he could be doing he invites a vigorous debate around the desk and then he makes a decision that aposs how it really does work and i have to tell you this entire narrative that i get from what i aposve read about the book that came out in the narrative in the rhetorical is totally foreign to me and when the president and i are both in town crosstalk pence chris i spend about four hours a day with the president and we are both in washington d c every day in and what i see is a tough leader a demanding leader someone who gets all the options on the table but he makes the decisions and that aposs why we aposve made the progress wallace but here aposs what anonymous sees he writes in that article in the new york times that is why many trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting mr trump aposs more misguided impulses until he is out of office woodward describes what he calls our nervous breakdown inside the trump administration pence it aposs absolutely absurd and i have to tell you i aposd be honest with you chris sometimes i watch a little bit of tv in the morning and then i go to the white house and i feel like i aposm in a parallel universe i walk into a white house where there is a president behind the desk he is in command he is constantly driving forward on delivering on the promises that we made to the american people and then i go home at night and i see cable tv talking about all of this stuff about disarray in the white house and it aposs just not my experience i mean but i tell people look at the results you look at the passage of historic tax cuts for businesses and individuals and the way that jobs are coming back and investment is coming back the renegotiation of trade deals our allies contributing more to our common defense all of that is happening because we have a president of almost boundless energy who comes in every day regardless of what aposs happening in the washington media culture and says what are we doing today to deliver for the american people and i think that aposs why i see such enthusiasm as i travel across the country and that aposs why i believe the american people are going to vote reelect republican majorities in the house and senate this fall wallace do you think you know who anonymous is pence i don apost i don apost know but i do know that they should resign and leave this administration wallace should all top officials take a lie detector test and would you agree to take when pence i would agree to take it in a heartbeat and would submit to any review the administration wanted to do wallace do you think the administration should do that pence well look that would be a decision for the president but look i think the honorable thing to do here is for this individual to recognize that they are literally violating an oath if they are that senior administration official that they are violating an oath not to the president but to the constitution wallace treason pence look it aposs un american and i think that aposs why using republicans and democrats condemn this the american people vote for a president they fully expect the president to be able to surround themselves with men and women who will work with them in advancing their agenda but to have someone who literally celebrates coming in every day to frustrate the agenda that the president and i were elected to advance it really is an assault on our democracy and it should be universally condemned wallace one of the more unusual words in the essay is lodestar which it turns out people have looked is a word that you have used many times pence sure begin video clip pence must again be our lodestar with vigilance and resolve as our lodestar it really was the lodestar end video clip wallace do you think someone purposely put that in the essay to try to set you up pence yes i wouldn apost know i wouldn apost know and i really do believe whether it aposs the book whether it aposs the anonymous editorial whether it aposs president obama aposs speech this week it aposs all an effort to distract attention from this booming economy and from the president aposs record of success and it aposs all very predictable we have important midterm elections coming up i get all of that but i but the american people should know president trump and i are going to remain absolutely determined to reelect this republican congress so we can continue to build on the momentum that aposs putting americans back to work wallace what did you think of the confirmation hearings for judge brett kavanaugh what did you think of some democrats who decided to break the rules into release what were committee confidential documents and how confident are you that kavanaugh will be on the supreme court when it resumes in october pence judge brett kavanaugh distinguished himself many democrats on the senate judiciary committee embarrassed themselves that aposs the truth of it wallace and pence what the american people saw in judge brett kavanaugh is a jurist just like president trump promised to appoint someone of profound intellect a judicial philosophy to interpret the laws of this country as written interpret the constitution as written but they also saw what was at times a circus in that judiciary committee people shouting behind them and histrionics in judiciary committee among democrat members you saw a judge with the temperament to make it through this 12 hour hearings with such dignity and we had every confidence that before the supreme court convenes in october judge brett kavanaugh will be justice brett kavanaugh wallace finally syria the u s has warned syria russia and iran not to launch a final assault on idlib province home to more than 3 million people they indicate that they intend to go ahead will the u s intervene militarily to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe there pence we are watching it very closely and we have made it very clear to the regime in syria to russia and iran that the united states and our allies will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons against civilians in that province there will be swift wallace let aposs say it aposs not chemical weapons let aposs say it aposs barrel bombs let aposs say it aposs conventional weapons are we going to let hundreds of thousands of people die there sir pence well we all know what happened in aleppo we aposre watching it all very closely but what aposs different with president trump from president obama is this president drew a redline and enforced it on chemical weapons president obama drew a redline and said you can apost use chemical weapons and then allowed assad and syria to go forward and victimize countless civilians wallace but sir dead is dead i understand i take your point about the chemical weapons pence i want to make it very very clear there aposs a wider world watching is that the united states of america and our allies will take swift and decisive action against any use of chemical weapons in idlib province beyond that i will tell you that we are watching very carefully as resources are being marshaled along the border of the idlib province and i aposm confident there will be a decision by the president of the united states but i aposm confident that we will be monitoring that very very carefully to ensure that we don apost see another humanitarian catastrophe like we did before wallace mr vice president thank you sir pence thank you chris end videotape wallace but even as the vice president and i were speaking syrian and russian warplanes bombed the southern edge of idlib province when we come back we aposll hear from democratic senator chris coons what about administration officials working to undercut their own president will barack obama help or hurt democrats in november and do democrats do anything to slow down brett kavanaugh aposs confirmation to the supreme court commercial break wallace this week president trump aposs nominee to the supreme court judge brett k faced two days of grilling by democrats on the senate judiciary committee but did they do anything to slow down his confirmation to the court before it starts its new session in october joining us now senator chris coons a leading member of that committee senator i aposll get to that in a moment but i want to start you just heard my interview with vice president pence your reaction to his defense of president trump against critics some of those critics inside his own administration sen chris coons d dela senate judiciary committee well what i heard the vice president say was that he was deeply disappointed and that he bought the critic within the administration who wrote the op ed the anonymous op ed in the new york times should resign i agree with that position i think the honorable thing to do is to resign and to go public with the author aposs concerns about the president aposs fitness to serve wallace and what about just the fact that between the anonymous essay and the woodward book you have so many top officials saying that they feel they have to act as a kind of guardrail against some of president trump aposs impulsive actions coons well that does raise a concern that i also made the focus of my questioning of judge kavanaugh chris i focused on ways in which judge kavanaugh has written has spoken issued decisions that suggest he has a very broad view of presidential power given our current context that could lead to a shield for president trump from accountability by the special counsel aposs investigation and that aposs something that i tried to make the real focus of my questioning of judge kavanaugh i think that ought to be a concern for everybody watching republican democratic independent because whether it aposs this administration or a future one i think all of us have an interest in the rule of law and in a president who is not above the law wallace well i want to double down on that because i want to ask you about some comments by the president this week and i aposm asking you as a moment member of the senate judiciary committee on the question of the rule of law the president as i pointed out to the vice president pence chastised attorney general sessions for the prosecution of two republican congressmen so close to the midterm election and then there also was this comment from the president about investigating who wrote the anonymous article begin audio clip donald trump president of the united states i would think jeff should be investigating who the author of that piece was because i really believe it aposs national security end audio clip wallace question senator is there any legal basis on the question of national security for a criminal investigation of who wrote that op ed in the new york times coons not that i aposm aware of i think you asked the vice president exactly the right question what aposs the basis in law for investigating who wrote this editorial look the real issue here across all of these concerns is that we have a president who in his tweets and in his statements and speeches suggests that he thinks the department of justice should act more like the in house lawyer department or legal department to the trump organization rather than what they are the independent agency charged with defending our constitution the independence of the department of justice and its prosecutorial decisions from presidential or political interference is one of the bedrocks of our democracy and the ways in which president trump continues to harass and to tweet against attorney general sessions as you just cited this last week criticizing him for the investigation and the indictment of two close allies of the president should be very troubling to all of us and the comments from senators both the republican and democrat that this is a very troubling very inappropriate break with traditional norms by president trump wallace but senator let aposs look at the larger picture of this question that we saw this week from the book from the essay about resistance to the president inside his own administration donald trump is the duly elected president of the united states no one voted for gary cohn no one voted for defense secretary mattis and there are stories in the woodward book of both of them ignoring or in the case of cohn as i pointed out to the vice president taking a letter that the president could have signed off his desk who are they to thwart the will of the duly elected president coons chris that aposs right this does raise some serious concerns every presidential administration has vigorous debates disagreements on policy priorities but this is a different sort of thing this is folks who are alleged to have taken direct action to prevent the president from carrying out some of his worst instincts or worse decisions and that should raise some concerns particularly given the anonymous editorial in the new york times i will remind you that the writer of that editorial makes it clear that he supports the president aposs policy agenda that he supports tax cuts and deregulation and building of the military and he self describes as not part of the deep state but the steady state someone who aposs trying to keep this president on course and delivering on his policy agenda but it does as you say chris raise troubling concerns if we have a president so mercurial so unable to stick to a decision within one day that his own senior aides think they are called upon as folks who have sworn to uphold the constitution to prevent the president from carrying out some of his worse decisions this really does concern me wallace i want to move to another development this week and that is former president obama returned to the campaign trail and took the opportunity to blister president trump here aposs just one example begin video clip barack obama former president it did not start with donald trump he is a symptom not the cause he is just capitalizing resentments that politicians have been fanning for years end video clip wallace senator is that smart politics for the november election yes there aposs no question that barack obama is popular with and will fire up the democratic base but isn apost there also a risk that he will fire up the republican base coons well chris my hope is that this election is going to be about the real needs and concerns of average americans in districts and states across the country where there aposs going to be important elections to determine the future of our country i do think that president obama respected long standing norms and how he handled the transition of power i think he conducted himself graciously in the inauguration of president trump and he has stayed completely on the sidelines for 18 months from what i heard of president obama former president obama aposs speech his core message was that we need to do a better job of listening to each other respecting each other and honoring our institutions and traditions and i think not to speak for him but i think former president obama because of the ways in which president trump over the last 18 months has challenged has broken some of our long standing traditions about respect for the rule of law the independence of the judiciary the independent media that he felt compelled to speak out at this point wallace let aposs turn to your day job and to the kavanaugh hearings some of your democratic colleagues on the judiciary committee released documents that the committee had deemed confidential and no one was more dramatic about it then your democratic colleague senator cory booker take a look begin video clip sen cory booker d nj senate judiciary committee i did willingly violate the chairs roll on the committee confidential process i take full responsibility for violating that sir this is about the closest i will ever have in my life to an i am spartacus moment end video clip wallace but senator booker knew and you knew that when he made such a big fuss about releasing those documents in fact the judiciary committee had already cleared those documents for release so wasn apost this just a pretty blatant stunt coons chris i have to be careful what i say here because i aposm the vice chairman of the ethics committee and in that role i can apost comment on anything that may or may not come before the ethics committee let me just say this about the whole dispute we had on the committee about documents i do think that this was an unprecedented process in which significant amount the overwhelming majority of the documents relevant to judge kavanaugh aposs service in the bush administration as staff secretary were blocked from review by the committee and there was a strong disagreement between the majority and the minority wallace but senator that aposs not up to individual senator crosstalk coons overall i agree with that concern wallace but that aposs not up to individual senators to just unilateral i mean otherwise it aposs chaos if the committee deemed something confidential rightly or wrongly can individual senators say no i aposm not going to play by those rules coons i really can apost comment to whether or not this was breaking the rules of the committee wallace i just have to ask you because you brought this up is this a matter that the ethics committee is now considering cory booker aposs behavior coons i can apost comment on that chris wallace why not coons the rules of the ethics committee prohibit any member of the committee on commenting on whether a matter is before the committee or not wallace so you cannot deny that this issue of what he did in releasing these documents is not before the committee coons i can apost comment on that chris wallace ok i have a final question and that is a general one about the kavanaugh nomination does the president deserve deference from the senate when he appoints he is elected he won and he appoints someone to the supreme court who is clearly within the judicial mainstream coons well chris as i said in a hearing i aposve known judge kavanaugh for 30 years and i know him to be an intelligent decent thoughtful person good father husband neighbor we heard a lot about what a good high school basketball coach he is and how he volunteers at a homeless shelter with his parish all of those are admirable qualities i am concerned as i said before and as i made the focus of my questioning of judge kavanaugh that he is well outside the judicial mainstream that in a decision he rendered just this year he refused to follow settled precedent and he made it clear that his views on executive power would lead to a dangerous rewriting of the core policies the core constitutional traditions and decisions of the court around presidential power i aposm going to take advantage of the opportunity today to send some questions for the record to judge kavanaugh i aposm going to continue to look over his writings his speeches but in the time that i was able to spend over four days with judge kavanaugh and with other witnesses in front of the committee i remain gravely concerned that he aposs not inside the judicial mainstream on several really important precedents that chris would have a real impact on individual rights and liberties of americans and on presidential power and i think americans of all parties particularly given our current context should be concerned about judge kavanaugh aposs decisions on presidential power wallace senator coons thank you thanks for your time and we aposll follow your committee aposs vote on the kavanaugh nominations scheduled for 11 days from now thank you sir coons thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss those shocking stories of trump appointees working against the president aposs directives when they think he aposs acting impulsively commercial break wallace coming up president trump pushes back on this week aposs damaging revelation begin video clip donald trump president of the united states the so called resistance is angry because their horrible ideas have been rejected by the american people and it aposs driving them crazy end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about any lasting effect on the trump administration commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states for the sake of our national security the new york times should publish his name at once i think their reporters should go and investigate who it is unelected deep state operatives who defy the voters to push their own secret agendas are truly a threat to democracy itself end video clip wallace president trump at a campaign rally criticizing the anonymous senior official who wrote that new york times op ed as a danger to the nation aposs security and it aposs time now for our sunday group katie pavlich from townhall com columnist for the hill juan williams liz marlantes politics editor of the christian science monitor and josh holmes mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff and now a gop strategist so katie where do you come down on the revelations both from the anonymous essay and also from bob woodward aposs book that there is a resistance inside the administration people acting to thwart the president aposs directives and overall how damaging do you think this week has been to the president katie pavlich fox news contributor well politically i don apost think it was damaging at all i think that people actually have look at this story and said it aposs more of palace intrigue we don apost know this person is if they aposre not willing to put their name on it then we aposre not going to necessarily be concerned with what they have to say inside the white house it is a huge distraction however when it comes to what this new york times op ed said they said that they were trying to thwart the president aposs worst intentions or instincts well define what that is because based on my conversations with white house officials and off the record conversations with president trump himself he actually likes to listen and invites debate from a number of advisors and then tends to make his own decision so are his worst instincts simply something that these advisors disagree with define what that actually means when it comes to the damage that aposs been done politically again i don apost think that it aposs really going to have an impact but inside the white house certainly all of the suspicion everyone looking over their shoulder a number of offices and agencies coming out with their own op ed saying it wasn apost me that certainly creates a hostile working environment that is not contingent to moving the president aposs agenda forward wallace juan is bob woodward right is this presidency serving suffering a nervous breakdown juan williams fox news political analyst a nervous breakdown i aposm a journalist like woodward and so here aposs what i see chris i see a white house that cancels meetings in a flailing manner and then convenience to try to find this anonymous source within the white house i see a president that issues are totally inappropriate call for the department of justice to somehow go after finding this anonymous person and i guess prosecuting them on the basis and this is even stranger of the national security violation simply for criticizing the president that aposs totally inappropriate and wrong i don apost know what aposs going on in the president said wallace but what what about this this larger point though that katie was talking about that you have according to woodward aposs book senior administration officials gary cohen national economic adviser taking a document off the president aposs desk the president tells defense secretary mattis lets assassinate assad after a chemical weapons attack and as soon as he gets off the call mattis says we aposre not going to do any of that is that is that insubordinate or is that responsible williams i think it aposs responsible if the people inside and here i would go along with what you heard from the vice president in her interview as well as senator coons which is that the person feels that they have to do this maybe they should come forward they mention the 25th amendment but i must say woodward aposs book fits with what we aposve heard from michael wolff what we aposve heard now from the anonymous columnist what we heard from omarosa it all fits of a white house where there is an unstable president and you see a white house that aposs uncertain and at times easily pushed off target and so at that point you start to wonder what is going on in their wallace josh josh holmes founder cavalry well you know i think a lot of this is overblown in terms of the amount of attention that we aposve the american people are far ahead of where the pundit class in d c is on evaluating where is president and where this administration is i think there aposs not a lot of people sitting around suffering under the delusion that somehow the president is up all hours over his briefing books right that aposs not why they love him williams no holmes why they love him is because he goes with his gut right you either love him or you hate him and the folks that hate president trump see what bob woodward had had written and see this new york times op ed as more evidence of what they suspect is an administration run amok for those who love them you know this is kind of what you voted for you voted for somebody who aposs going to vote out or operate outside of the box now we can now have our arguments about whether or not that aposs appropriate in these context but you know taking a memo off the president aposs desk some of us just call that staffing pavlich right wallace well quite i think that as a former chief of staff to mitch mcconnell some of us are going to wonder about this you may get a call from him i want to pick up on because it wasn apost just that there were new controversies this week liz the president sent out a tweet i think it was on monday basically chastising the attorney general for the prosecution of two republican congressman saying they these guys are running it aposs the midterm these are safe seats don apost mess around with that and then as juan points out at the end of the week say on a national security grounds he aposs he thinks that attorney general sessions should investigate who wrote this does that help him or hurt him those kinds of things liz marlantes the christian science monitor i mean again to josh aposs point i think most voters now have an opinion and this is going to either reconfirm the opinion they already have or you know on either side in terms of the you know having a department of justice investigate the anonymous op ed i went back and look at the pool report of trump aposs comments and he was asked that by a reporter he didn apost introduce it a reporter actually said do you think that session should investigate and he said yes and i you know i am i am not one to defend the president in terms of his attacks on the media but i do think sometimes the media plays a little bit of a roll here they actually kind of put that idea forward and he said yes you know i think sessions should so we aposll see what happens with that there is as far as i can tell right now no legal basis for it it was not a leak of classified information wallace katie lost in all of this is the fact that we had more great economic news this week two hundred thousand new jobs created wages up 2 9 percent but because of all of this noise all of the statements all of the tweets all of the controversies that gets lost pavlich it may get lost in conversation but when it comes to how people are feeling out in middle america the rest of the country you don apost have to tell them when they see more money in their paychecks you don apost have to tell them what a new job becomes available in their town because regulation has been pulled off that was previously put in during the obama administration for example so while there is a lot of noise politically for the president as we aposve seen in the past as these controversies have popped up his approval ratings has actually gone up in a lot of cases because people are seeing results while at the same time there is controversy here in washington d c now as we get wallace but would the president would the president be wiser to focus on the good news pavlich sure wallace you know accentuate the positive pavlich sure yes wallace eliminate the negative pavlich yes yes absolutely it would be great if he could only focus on the economy but that is something we aposve been saying since he started running for president in 2015 that is not going to happen he aposs going to focus on all the issues of the day including being involved in these controversies wallace liz marlantes i just would say you know his poll numbers actually have gone down a little bit lately williams that aposs what i aposve noticed marlantes it aposs it aposs unclear if this is the start of a new trend or if this is just sort of a bad couple of weeks but there has been actually been and his poll numbers have been remarkably stable pavlich right that aposs my ph point marlantes they haven apost been great but they aposve been remarkably stable throughout most of his presidency but there has been a dip just in the last couple weeks that we aposre starting we aposre watching wallace well the manafort the manafort cohen week was a bad week marlantes right wallace all right panel we have to take a break here when we come back the return of barack obama to the political spotlight and what it means for the november midterms commercial break begin video clip barack obama former u s president this is not normal these are extraordinary times and they aposre dangerous times end video clip wallace barack obama blistering president trump in an attack by a former president against his successor that is also not normal and we aposre back now with the panel josh what do you make a former president obama aposs return to the political spotlight how effective do you think he was in going after his successor president trump and how do you think his involvement will play in terms of the november midterms holmes well you just knew that president obama wouldn apost be able to resist the bright lights in the midterms right i mean you watched president bush go through after his administration largely stay dark start largely outside of the controversy particularly when it came to campaigns and elections you just knew president obama couldn apost do that but i think they have democrats actually have a real problem here in that what we know about the election based on the special elections is that democratic enthusiasm is at an all time high they don apost need any more enthusiasm they are right where they need to be the problem is if republicans are right where they are you know in the states that matter particularly in the senate it negates any advantage they might have and there is nobody other than perhaps president trump who motivates the conservative electric quite like president obama so i think there aposs some danger in here particularly if he continues this and that kind of rhetoric out in the midwest particularly states like north dakota indiana west virginia missouri montana all of those states have more republicans than democrats and if they show up democrats have a real problem wallace juan i want to pick up on precisely the point because i democrats have wanted this to be a referendum on donald trump do you like donald trump or are you troubled by donald trump and do you want a check by democrats taking back the house and or the senate to the degree that barack obama becomes the face of the democratic party and the opposition this fall yes of course he mobilizes a lot of people especially minorities young people but he also may mobilize a lot of conservative voters who don apost want to return to the days of high taxes and regulation that barack obama represents williams well i think you have to understand that president obama is doing this quite strategically josh is on target there are places where in fact you could anticipate that he would energize a conservative base that i think never got over the election of the first black president but remember obama aposs going to illinois he aposs going to california he aposs going he aposs doing a lot of fundraising that is basically private wallace but he but he aposs also getting national exposure when he helps out williams yes he gets national attention because he aposs the former president but i would say this that in fact historically in midterms it aposs the democrats who have a problem with turnout and i think there aposs the fear among democrats that you don apost want to count your eggs before they aposre hatched remember what happened with the polls and the 2016 presidential race and so they want to make sure they are energizing their base and critically reaching out to white suburbanites mostly women in critical congressional districts this is for the house which is really the goal that the democrats have this time around which is to capture the majority of the house wallace katie the fact is though if you look at barack obama aposs record he is a great vote getter for himself but when his name is not on the ballot and you look at the 2010 and 2014 midterms it doesn apost transfer pavlich and the 2016 presidential election with him campaigning at the last minute for hillary clinton inaudible wallace well in fairness i i think you aposve got to blame that on hillary not on on obama pavlich correct but he endorsed her and came in at the very last minute hoping to get her over the finish line with a number of groups and couldn apost get the job done now that is a reflection of her but it aposs also a reflection of his endorsement falling through barack obama essentially burned the democratic party to the ground by losing a thousand seats in the local to the federal level while he was in office he didn apost do enough with the dnc the democratic operatives that you talk to are very disappointed in how he really only focused on his operation to get re elected as president and let these other seats go by the wayside and the thing about what he said during his speech is he wasn apost just attacking president trump he was specifically attacking in the republican party trying to talk about you know how voters are essentially bigoted and they have all these fears of people who look different than them barack obama got elected twice in america by a majority and for him to go out now and continue to lecture the country about those issues when we have come so far really rubs people the wrong way and finally when it comes to whether he aposs going to be able to get back to his community organizing ways and be successful i aposm actually not so sure that barack obama is far left enough for this new democratic party he talked about the founding fathers as being people we should have followed who did good things for the country on the far left wing of the party they aposre talking about taking down the washington monument taking down any kind of remembrance of those kinds of principles and so we aposll see how he fits into this new socialism while he aposs at the same time potentially backing joe biden for 2020 wallace liz obama help or hurt the democrats in the midterms marlantes i think on the whole he aposs probably going to be a help i think they are going to use him strategically as juan said in fact you know that one speech was was the most sort of political of the speeches that he gave he gave a he went the next day and gave a speech that was way more toned down in terms of you know not attacking president trump by name that sort of thing so i think i think they aposll be careful they aposll use him they have a lot of first time candidates one of the sort of downsides potentially of a lot of enthusiasm is it got a ton of new faces new first time candidates and some of those candidates might benefit from having the gravitas of the former president standing next to them wallace in a normal week the big news would have been the confirmation hearing for judge brett kavanaugh to be a new supreme court justice and to swing the court to a solid conservative majority here is kavanaugh this week begin video clip brett kavanaugh supreme court nominee i am not a pro plaintiff or pro defendant judge i aposm not a pro prosecution or pro defense judge i am a pro law judge end video clip wallace juan how do you think kavanaugh did and it democrats do anything to derail his nomination williams no so if we aposre if you want the bottom line the final score chris i think he looks like he aposs on his way to being confirmed as the next supreme court justice and giving conservatives a solid 5 4 majority on that court for as long as we can see the man aposs in his early 50s but in answer to your question to whether or not damage was done the critical issue for me is the impartiality of the court trust in the court by the american people we see that going down this is not a popular candidate by the way so what you have and not popular among democrats or republicans i might add and what you saw the democrats do was say you know this guy was a political operative he worked for ken starr remember he was involved in the florida recount in 2000 he was involved with torture memos in the bush white house this is a guy that aposs been on the court but he aposs a political player and i think that hurts his credibility going forward and hurts the credibility of our supreme court wallace josh holmes i think the only thing that was noteworthy this week is how senate democrats handled themselves in particularly senator cory booker which is just incredibly odd behavior and the i am spartacus moment as if he aposs trying to convince democratic 2020 primary voters he aposs some sort of a bad boy i mean that aposs kind of bad boy behavior that gets you inaudible wallace well and also when he also when he said if you want to try to kick me out of the senate bring it holmes yes which is just all contrived and of course completely ridiculous but you know at the end of the day i think vice president pence said it best kavanaugh acquitted himself quite well but i think the senate democrats honestly set themselves back they reminded the american people what the dangers of a democratic majority in the senate might be wallace but but this gets to the to the point that that katie was making which is that the democrats have moved so far left does that kind of behavior actually win some support and and in what aposs going to be a very crowded field get him out of the of the chorus line holmes yes i mean that aposs clearly the calculus that cory booker took and i think kamala harris senator harris as well i mean the two of them were sort of climbing all over each other to try to get further to the left and more caustic in their approach to judge kavanaugh in the end it aposs going to be justice kavanaugh right i mean we aposre going to he did everything he needed to do in those hearings to get himself confirmed as the next supreme court justice wallace i got a little over 30 seconds and let aposs get to to juan aposs bottom line your work for mitch mcconnell you aposre a vote counter they did raise some issues about where he has on presidential power they did raise issues about where he is on abortion williams gay rights wallace thank you is there do you sense from what your sources in the senate that they did anything to shake the support of republican moderates particularly pro choice moderates like susan collins and lisa murkowski holmes you know it aposs a good question but in particularly i think they set themselves back by mischaracterizing in one sense judge kavanaugh prevented the views of the plaintiffs while providing the answer to senate democrats totally mischaracterizi
