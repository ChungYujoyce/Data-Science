investigations with fairness and impartiality brian miller a lawyer in the white house counsel s office told the senate banking committee during his confirmation hearing that independence is vital for the special inspector general for pandemic recovery the post would place him in charge of overseeing a roughly 500 billion treasury fund for industry created as part of the economic rescue law approved in late march in written testimony miller pledged to be vigilant in protecting the integrity and independence of his office and vowed to seek the truth in all matters that come before me and to use my authority and resources to uncover fraud waste and abuse top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens in a testy exchange with sen elizabeth warren d mass miller said his goal is to make all information about the 500 billion fund public warren who helped create the consumer financial protection bureau after the 2008 recession was unimpressed saying miller s time in the white house counsel s office should have disqualified him from the inspector general s role trump has repeatedly demonstrated his contempt for oversight and will be a formidable obstacle for miller or any other watchdog warren said he has already said he will muzzle you she told miller you will however have the chance to defend your independence and your integrity by your actions miller replied that it is fundamental for an inspector general to be independent he pledged to work with warren and other democrats even if she doesn t vote for him as you indicated yesterday

the senate s first virtual hearing since the coronavirus crisis largely shut down the country in march at least five gop senators attended the hearing including several who did not wear masks while questioning miller and another nominee miller and dana wade nominated as assistant secretary of housing and urban development both testified with their masks on crapo called the hearing a success in terms of technology thanks to a bevy of senate staffers and others who scrambled to put the meeting together miller and wade both acquitted themselves well crapo said and miller answered a slew of questions about his independence i think miller was very capable in his responses by showing that he s got an entire career of being an effective and independent ig crapo said i think he did very well and i expect he will be supported well on the senate floor miller has worked at the justice department and was inspector general for nearly a decade at the general services administration which oversees thousands of federal contracts miller helped force out the gsa s director during the george w bush administration drawing criticism from the white house and republican lawmakers the former administrator lurita doan called miller a bureaucratic terrorist and tried to cut his funding a fact gop senators repeatedly cited at tuesday s hearing it s a pretty good case history on independence said thom tillis r n c while he is respected in the oversight community miller s role in the white house counsel s office which led trump s defense during impeachment is troubling democrats and watchdog groups said brown top democrat on the banking panel questioned whether miller will be able to hold the trump administration accountable for how it administers the business program and guarantee that corporations getting taxpayer money put their workers first in the last 20 years brown said his staff found only one inspector general candidate who was nominated while serving in the white house counsel s office and another who served in the legal office of an earlier administration both nominees resigned one for politicizing the office and the other for a lack of independence brown said not a great track record still brown appeared to concede miller s likely confirmation by the republican controlled senate if he is confirmed brown added i expect you to follow the letter
