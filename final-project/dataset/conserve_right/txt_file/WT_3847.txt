legally changing their gender bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk both detractors and supporters of the billionaire former mayor said that if nothing else it s tough to accuse mr bloomberg of pursuing half measures he put his money where his mouth is which is a good thing said democratic strategist hank sheinkopf it was a data driven governing style that led mr bloomberg to embrace the new york police department s controversial policing policies as a means to combat crime a position he now says he regrets i can t change history mr bloomberg told a black church in brooklyn on sunday however today i want you to know that i realize back then i was wrong that was a striking about face for mr bloomberg who consistently defended the policies amid criticism from liberal activists who said the police street stops disproportionately targeted blacks and hispanics both voting blocs are considered indispensable to any candidate hoping to capture the democratic nomination and defeat president trump next november he oversaw a very toxic police force that was not mitigated that lack of maintenance for an already very problematic police force that he inherited from republican mayor rudolph w giuliani said anthony rogers wright a policy coordinator for the climate justice alliance that lack of accountability and mitigation is certainly what led to incidents like the late eric garner he said mr garner who is black died in july 2014 after a police officer put him in a chokehold on suspicion that he was selling cigarettes illegally his death has since become a rallying cry for the black lives matter movement activists who have long opposed the policy questioned whether mr bloomberg who is on the verge of announcing a 2020 presidential run had a true change of heart people aren t stupid new york mayor bill de blasio himself briefly a candidate for the democratic nomination said on cnn they can figure out whether someone is honestly addressing an issue or whether they re acting out of convenience the rev al sharpton who spoke to mr bloomberg after the church service welcomed his new position but said it would take more than one speech for people to forgive and forget about the issue whether it was politically motivated or not because clearly he s getting ready to run for president it was an important

services company that has since expanded into a far reaching business empire politically he has been notoriously hard to pin down a lifelong democrat he switched to the republican party for his mayoral run in 2001 he gave up the gop to become an independent halfway through his second term as mayor and remained independent during his third term mr bloomberg rejoined the democratic party last year as he began eyeing a presidential bid he would enter the white house race without the typical support base of many candidates for national office i don t think people loved michael bloomberg but people respected him and they thought that he was an excellent mayor said steven cohen a public affairs professor at columbia university who specializes in sustainability research mr cohen recalled delivering commentary on one of mr bloomberg s past budget briefings during a local television appearance they kept wanting me to criticize him mr cohen said i said i want to hire the guy he teaches financial management better than anybody i ve ever seen when it comes to communicating information and data i ve never seen anybody better at it mr bloomberg was first elected in the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks after pouring tens of millions of dollars from his fortune into his campaign he came in after 9 11 the economy was a disaster in new york the whole area of downtown had been wiped out said sid davidoff who was an aide to mayor john v lindsay the prospects were glum at best and he was able to really bring back the city as a businessman and to put it back on its feet rebuild the area

childhood obesity and banning smoking in bars and restaurants he also pushed for the development of subsidized art studios expanded bike lanes and more charter schools in 2007 he released planyc a comprehensive development proposal that aimed to cut long term greenhouse gas emissions in the city mr bloomberg ran for and won a third term in 2009 after city council approved an exception to the office s two term limit supporters argued that his business expertise was vital to help new york recover from the 2008 financial meltdown but mr cohen said the move lost the mayor a lot of support i think that if he wanted to leave on a high note he would have left after two terms he said i think mayors in general that go into a third term here have always had problems mr rogers wright also argued that the city s economic recovery was not felt equally across all income levels races and boroughs the vast majority of the people who benefited from his so called economic expansion were white people he said free spender since leaving office mr bloomberg has poured millions of dollars of his personal wealth into political causes such as gun control and climate change as well as

into gun control efforts through the groups mayors for illegal guns and everytown for gun safety and in june announced he would put 500 million toward efforts to combat climate change and end coal fired power plants his efforts for gun control have riled gun rights activists who frequently invoke mr bloomberg as a personification of the anti gun left just because you have deep pockets and a fat bank account does not give you the right to say gun owners have no rights said alan gottlieb founder of the second amendment foundation nobody appointed michael bloomberg as the arbiter of rights and freedoms protected by the constitution mr bloomberg has also poured more than 3 3 billion into johns hopkins university his alma mater including 1 8 billion in september for undergraduate financial
