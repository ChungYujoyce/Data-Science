debate in denver ap the late warren zevon wrote the song things to do in denver when you re dead in 1991 after wednesday s presidential debate it could be the new theme for the obama campaign and even the liberals of msnbc seemed to know it though some major media outlets attempted to limit the collateral damage when the rocky mountain debate came to an end a black cloud descended on the liberal off shoot of nbc a cnn orc poll of registered voters who watched the debate in denver showed 67 percent believe romney won the debate while just 25 percent said obama won the hill reported for msnbcers it was a sign of the end times perennial obama fan club president chris matthews lamented the whole ordeal whining this wasn t an msnbc debate was it it just wasn t matthews erupted into a vein throbbing rant about how obama should be watching msnbc to learn his debate talking points where was obama tonight he should watch well not just apos hardball apos rachel maddow he should watch you he should watch the reverend al sharpton he should watch lawrence o apos donnell he would learn something about this debate he vented perhaps the new soundtrack for hardball will be after the thrill is gone pullquote fellow msnbc host ed schultz echoed the panic and added obama created a problem for himself on social security tonight he agrees with mitt romney i was absolutely stunned tonight schultz concluded in fact msnbc s focus group of undecideds all thought romney did well throughout much of the media universe the obama faithful were equally distraught with huffington post giving the night to the gop candidate under the headline romney wins the night foul comedian and obama super pac million dollar contributor bill maher took to twitter to express his frustration i can apos t believe i apos m saying this but obama looks like he does need a teleprompter he snarked movie maker michael moore joined in the distress begging the president to do better obama please be obama you sound like a democrat wimpy the lefty propaganda site talking points memo couldn t even spin it in a good way instead it ran the headline obama camp romney won on style and featured a best zingers video that strongly favored romney washington post wunderkind ezra klein was sarcastic if the obama campaign was worried about dems being overconfident going into the final stretch tonight should allay those fears klein commented media entrepreneur and critic jeff jarvis asked if obama had anyone who would beat him up over tonight obama didn apos t just act professorial as some are calling him he acted like a prof with tenure jarvis added even maryland gov martin o malley auditioning poorly for a national spot mistakenly referred to romney as president during a live interview despite the math of the evening s results some major media outlets downplayed romney s big win new york times analysis described the debate like a seminar by a business consultant and a college professor claiming they talked over each other without connecting their ideas to voters writers jeff zeleny and jim rutenberg gave romney the mildest of attaboys if mr romney s goal was to show that he could project equal stature to the president he succeeded perhaps offering his campaign the lift that republicans have been seeking they wrote liberal nate silver the times fivethirtyeight blogger tried to put a good spin on a bad evening mitigating factor not really a lot of bad obama soundbytes he was just flat throughout he claimed times editorial page editor andrew rosenthal was skeptical of a romney victory ouch but is it a real sample hard to imagine how he commented in response to the results showing romney winning 67 25 times columnist economist paul krugman first admitted romney won before then trying to undermine that victory ok so obama did a terrible job in the debate and romney did well he wrote but then krugman went on to say it should be about substance and the fact is that everything obama said was basically true while much of what romney said was either outright false or so misleading as to be the moral equivalent of a lie on cbs time assistant managing editor rana foroohar said it all came down to taxes and questioned whether romney apos s math adds up both nbc and cnn were surprised that obama never mentioned romney s 47 percent comment nbc s david gregory seemed stunned that obama didn t use that line complaining he didn t bring up the 47 percent cnn s wolf blitzer was similarly surprised that obama ignored attack lines like that one even the post s after debate editorial took aim at romney over that number one of the surprises of the evening was the number that remained unmentioned 47 percent the paper wrote cnn s ascot wearing commentator roland martin shockingly declared there was no clear cut winner there were moments where both were sharp with zingers hard hitting lines he added but later amended his positive viewpoint with crowd commentary a number of folks coming up to me at this ny debate party stating they are obama supporters not happy with his performance he explained on twitter time s mark halperin incredibly graded the denver donnybrook as close giving romney an a and obama a b this despite time apos s senior political analyst claiming that obama surprisingly seemed more nervous and tentative than his challenger conservative response to the evening was pretty much universally positive the best evidence of that came from msnbc s resident rino joe scarborough of morning joe scarborough tweeted tonight was a big win for mitt romney he dominated the debate in every way this wasn apos t even close when even scarborough is backing romney it s a blowout but now that the debate is over the liberal media fact check machine will shift into high gear several outlets attempted to analyze the truthfulness of the debate abc news deployed a tome like fact checking page complete with video and
