stupid shallow pandering desperate and without ethics kirsten gillibrand united states senator from new york candidate for 2020 democrat presidential nomination dolt she was not initially on my radar i follow the news like a hawk but she always was so politically lightweight make that bantamweight that she did not register here in california register is a term we often use for earthquakes the northridge shaker registered at 6 7 a solid 3 5 give or take will wake you up gillibrand registers at 0 0 give or take a zero it is not that i live amid a high bar for united states senate excellence here in orange county the epicenter of the resistance within the people s republic of california reports reach us that we are represented by dianne feinstein and kamala harris one slept her way from the bottom to the top everyone here knows that she cavorted publicly with one willie brown then california democrat kingmaker even prompting willie s wife to castigate her in the same brazen open way that the affair itself was conducted in a quote published by the famous san francisco columnist herb caen in his book basic brown mrs blanche brown said on the eve of willie being sworn in as mayor of san francisco listen she may have him at the moment but come inauguration day and he s up there on the platform being sworn in i ll be the b h holding the bible as for our other u s senate star she spent nearlytwenty yearsbeing chauffeured around by aspy for the chinese government are you worried about collusion and leaks to foreign governments how about having a member of the senate select committee on intelligence talking privately on her phone for two decades with no one else listening in except for a spy planted there by china many americans outside the golden homeless state had the opportunity to witness for your own eyes and ears these two gems on full national display during christine blasey perjury day dromedary and bactrian one hump and two humps dianne and kamala so my exposure to senate excellence does not set a high bar for kirsten gillibrand to transcend or even to ascend and yet as she endeavors to ascend that is exactly the end on which she lands here is why for several years the dolt was in the house representing a somewhat moderate even conservative upstate new york theretofore republican district she won election in 2006 and retained office in 2008 by advocating conservative views she supported the national rifle association she even received a 100 rating from the nra she opposed amnesty for illegals she even opposed issuing drivers licenses to illegals she voted to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities she won the republican district because news broke days before the election that her opponent the incumbent gop congressman was abusive to his wife and even knocked her around the house the wife had phoned in a plea to 9 1 1 and the tape ended up in the news just in time that is how democracy works that is how our leaders emerge to lead us over the cliffs gillibrand was a clinton neophyte and sycophant she traveled with them campaigned for them and they for her they raised money for her despite everyone knowing about bill clinton s history with paula jones kathleen willey juanita broaddrick and monica lewinsky among others gillibrand was only too eager to associate closely with bill and it paid off when hillary was named by obama as secretary of state she had to give up her senate seat gillibrand an utter unknown in a field of possibilities that included andrew cuomo and caroline kennedy nevertheless was named by new york governor david paterson to that vacated clinton seat she has been running for president ever since gillibrand immediately ditched all her values and moved rapidly to the left as the democrats moved even farther yet to the left she kept endeavoring to outpace them when metoo erupted after harvey weinstein gillibrand played a leading role in demanding that al probing fingers franken resign from the senate to get more national attention as she ramped up her presidential aspirations she then turned on her clinton patrons and excoriated bill saying that he should have resigned from the presidency in light of all the times he abused women culminating with lewinsky yet such concerns never before had stopped gillibrand from endorsing clintons and bragging of their endorsements and of their fundraising for her during all the prior years even though all of clinton s storied abuses of women had been world famous by then in other words not only no deeply held personal values but also no loyalties just the brazen single minded pursuit of fame and power when she ran in new york for reelection to the senate in 2018 she was challenged whether she had eyes on the white house she famously and publicly promised to serve a full six year term in the senate if elected yet only two months after her november reelection she announced her presidential exploratory committee and joined the democrat clown car unlike georgia governor not elect stacey abrams she was able to fit in during the past many months gillibrand repeatedly has demonstrated two defining characteristics 1 she is the most phony of fakers 2 in the face of polling for months in the general vicinity of zero point zero she will say absolutelyanything no matter how absurd assuming she is smart and realizes what she is saying but is saying the outrageous for news making effect or outright just plain stupid assuming she actually means what she is saying 1 the most phony of fakers gillibrand is astrong supporter of the most vile bigot in america linda sarsour and likewise praises sarsour s close second in hate tamika mallory gillibrand endorses them seeks to be photographed with them and wants the democrat left to associate the name of kirsten gillibrand with linda sarsour and tamika mallory whentimemagazine named those two jew hating racist bigots among america s most influential people sen gillibrand amazingly personally authored the article sarsour openly thanks gillibrand for work ing for us on the inside yet the same gillibrand will throw around the insult racist when describing others who are not politically correct she even sees racism in being pro life but she endorses sarsour and mallory whose catalogues of prejudice bigotry and hate against jews white people and even white women are an open book although gillibrand postures as a metoo activist she has openly tolerated remarkable anti female abuse in her own office where she disregarded several women s complaints and pleas to deal with one of gillibrand s closest long time staffers who repeatedly told rape jokes in the office intimidated women sexually and created a profoundly hostile workplace environment for women only after a woman staffer resigned over the severe and persistent abuse and the story then broke inpolitico did gillibrand act to contain the political fallout 2 she will say absolutely anything to register a decimal gillibrand was a relative unknown when named united states senator as a democrat united states senator in new york she cannot lose reelection if she tries but her aught nothingness is more manifest on the national stage from the early weeks of her candidacy for the democrat presidential nomination she has been unable to register to get attention any attention at all she now will sayanythingthat comes to her unscripted mind no matter how absurd no matter how really not smart that is no matter how objectively stupid you be the judge absurd or stupid thus she has announced that if elected she will federally recognize a legal third gender option creating an x field on identification documents for people who don t identify as male or female likewise she will roll out new birth certificates replacing mother and father with gender neutral language to ensure that both members of a same sex couple can secure their parental rights from the day their child is born absurd or stupid she tweeted our future is female intersectional and we re just getting started for that she got slammed all over twitter remember she is white rich non muslim for years a friend of the tobacco lobby and although she yet may change her gender to get another vote somewhere meanwhile she is one of the two genders recognized in the bible she is not yet muslim though she works on the inside for linda sarsour tough to see how instersectionalism raises her presidential fortunes above cory black kamala female jamaican indian weed smoker sexually promiscuous when needed pete gay julian castro hispanic andrew yang asian gov non elect stacey female black non stereotypically full figured not elected and those of such ilk absurd or stupid shecomparespro life judges to racists and jew haters like uh linda sarsour tamika mallory absurd or stupid still hovering at zero point zero she pledges to legislate giving 600 to every person to donate to a candidate absurd or stupid not enough still not registering in the polls so she goes to agay bar wearing a rainbow colored love is brave t shirt get it and gets herself filmed sipping a drink at the bar as though she does this all the time a long weary day on the trail so need to relax just a bit at happy hour at the ol gay bar and then she waves at one of her many fans in the bar assuming anyone there even recognized her and did not think instead that she was signaling a desire to be picked up or to pick up and she yells gay rights think about that last one really pause a moment can you imagine someone entering a kosher deli wearing a t shirt that says i love lukshin kugel eating a piece of gefilte fish with a sour pickle and rye bread waving at people she does not know and yelling out down the room jew rights seriously i have been at a gay bar only once at an awkward moment fifteen summers ago when my wife and ten year old son were driving down to a world famous laguna arts fair and we needed most assuredly to stop at a restroom none of us ever before had been inany bar at all except a bar mitzvah and it was during the years before a starbucks bathroom was available on every block we did not want to enter a non kosher restaurant for the pit stop because it might seem we would be entering to eat there so we figured let s just go in and out of the bar as we entered i made a bee line for the men s room the first thing that seemed strange was that there was no door to the room you could see in and out of the room and then i saw something else in there that educated me rapidly beyond my yeshiva education nuff said i realized rapidly that i had entered a twilight zone that even rod serling never had imagined and although i had tried avoiding the non kosher burger place down the block i essentially just had brought my wife and young boy into a place that might as well have had that burger store s sign in and out so there is kirsten intersectionalist tight love is brave t shirt music blaring so loud that no one can hear a thing sipping a drink at a bar fake dancing in a kind of elaine benes way big inviting smile and she waves her hand at someone and yells something inviting that no one can hear at the bar except for the microphone her campaign has attached near her for her choreographed tweet so tell me what does a person there think if not that she is looking for a date invest five seconds of your life and watch this tweeted snippet absurd or stupid kirsten gillibrand will say absolutelyanythingto register a decimal even at a gay bar to get a one dollar donation she will film how many tries at beer pong for every robert o rourke video showing him getting a full mouth cavity inspection or having his ear hairs cut
