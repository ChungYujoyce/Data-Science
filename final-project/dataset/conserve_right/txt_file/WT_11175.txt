america 1 again regnery 2011 you can find out more about the trump empire at trump com decker you are one of the rare prominent voices out there insisting that rebuilding our manufacturing base is central to renewing america as an economic power as a detroiter this really jumps out at me but manufacturing is not something one hears republicans talking about very often what do you think needs to be done on this front trump the outsourcing of jobs has greatly diminished our power and has to be addressed our dealings with china have been ridiculous as i ve made clear our core as a country was built around industries that were built here and that thrived here that has eroded to such a degree that our structure has crumbled and needs to be reinforced as a builder i would compare it to a building that has been left unattended or neglected and therefore requires more attention to repair we need entrepreneurs to keep or to return our economic power to where it should be as henry ford said don t find fault find a remedy the remedy is a strong manufacturing base which means more jobs it s not complicated top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk decker you re refreshingly tough on the people s republic in your book you write get it straight china is not our friend why is beijing a menace to the united states and how should we counter this communist state trump they ve taken every opportunity possible to rip us off and they ve been given that opportunity by obama and his administration sometimes it appears obama officials are clueless but one thing for sure is that they are bad negotiators china s manipulation of currency has been consistent with obvious results to be seen in our steel industry as one example and they steal our technology the list goes on they have no scruples when it comes to business and are aggressive in their striving for power what we need is a strong leader who knows how to negotiate and who understands how business works and how businesses are built we also need a leader who understands the threat that china poses it s hard to believe the current administration is fully aware of the situation decker chapter 7 of your book is titled a safety net not a hammock the u s national debt has surpassed 16 trillion because too many people expect government to give them goodies do you worry that americans have gotten too lazy complacent or just lost the character it will take to turn this mess around trump i don t think americans have gotten lazy as many people are looking for work it s hard to go to work if there aren t any jobs outsourcing has hurt us tremendously the unmitigated greed of certain individuals such as convicted multi billion dollar fraudster bernie madoff and the rampant wall street shenanigans have damaged many people and made people untrusting and wary and rightly so but i also believe that self reliance needs to be emphasized and everyone needs to be vigilant america has been blessed in very many ways and that can t be taken for granted i know america can be great again but it will require focus and hard work decker as the son of a ford motor company executive i grew up believing that the business of america is business it now increasingly seems that government is the senior partner in the public private sector relationship how is today s out of control bureaucracy a drag on u s competitiveness and the entrepreneurial spirit that made this country great trump as you mention the entrepreneurial spirit made this country great we grew by leaps and bounds when that spirit was encouraged now look at it i built my own empire no one else built it for me i ve provided tens of thousands of jobs i was and remain competitive because that is what is required i know people are grateful to have jobs and my job is to provide those jobs i think most people would rather work than get a handout or remain idle bureaucracy has slowed things down considerably and as someone who is used to getting things done and quickly it s very apparent that the government has not been helpful they have not been encouraging to the new generation some of obama s comments have made it sound as if building something is undesirable our young people need to know what made this country great to begin with entrepreneurs my father fred c trump had a four step formula for success that works get in get it done get it done right and get out that keeps the momentum going and one thing this country needs is more momentum decker what do you think is the most imminent threat facing america today and what should be done to address the problem trump lack of leadership is the biggest threat that covers a lot of territory in order for a country to thrive there can t be weakness at the top other countries know we have a weak leader and it s easy to become a target in those circumstances china being a good example our military forces have to remain intact and effective and have the right leadership our business leaders need to be encouraged obama has not addressed our problems in a way that has produced results he has not provided us with solutions just more problems he is responsible for a decline in this country that has been unprecedented the way to address this problem is to have a strong leader who knows what is going on and has the intelligence and strength to deal with it
