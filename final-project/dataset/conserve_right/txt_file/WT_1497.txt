nistration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the most prolonged period of sustained military conflict in american history that s what we ve been living through since operation desert storm began in 1990 sadly only when flag draped coffins return from the battlefield met by mourning families saluting soldiers and remarks from a somber commander in chief do we even take notice and then only fleetingly war has become background noise to a desensitized population but why top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time the primary reason is that for a long time peace has simply not been an option available to our leaders when threats arise president trump has changed that for decades in america the gradual erosion of our freedoms and increasingly socialist tilt to our politics has led to choices that weakened our economic military and cultural strength the obama biden administration accelerated the process in particular through their high tax harsh regulation approach they damaged or destroyed thousands of small businesses they hobbled american industry in particular our energy industry as they bowed to their masters in the socialist environmental movement they hollowed out our military by failing to invest in its modernization and sadly tragedies like benghazi robbed our military of some of its spirit and gusto worst of all former president obama and former vice president joe biden served as enablers of an erosion in americans confidence in ourselves the goodness of our nation and in the culture that made us strong when the obama biden administration declared america not all that special among the nations of the world they downplayed the sacrifices of those who built and gifted this blessed land to us and they re positioned america s brand from one that wacko regimes like iran s wouldn t want to mess with to being a mark run by snobby weakling appeasers iran s leaders could and did easily manipulate to the tune of 150 billion in cash in fairness it s hard to know if the left is capable of grasping the connection between subverting our historically effective cultural norms or stopping the construction of a new domestic oil refinery and american soldiers coming home in body bags but as the left made america weaker economically culturally and militarily it made war the only option available to our presidents when things go sideways somewhere mr trump changed that he realized that the position we were stuck in was an almost laughably unnecessary self inflicted vulnerability created by our own leaders mr trump saw that war would always be the choice when peace wasn t available as an option everything mr trump has done for the past three years in terms of his policies can be summed in one simple phrase make peace an option again he lifted the harsh regulations imposed on american businesses he cut taxes unleashing american economic might the stock market jumped overnight and never stopped rising setting records over and over mr trump took government s boot off the throat of energy entrepreneurs and allowed our nation to attain its rightful status as a net energy exporter for the first time since 1953 mr trump is fixing an out of control illegal immigration problem bequeathed to him by the obama biden administration leading to more job options and faster wage growth for americans entering the job market mr trump saw through the lie that american manufacturing was doomed because of high domestic labor costs and realized that we had much greater leverage to negotiate fair trade deals on behalf of american workers this week s u s mexico canada and china phase i deals prove he was right mr trump rebuilt our military strength both in equipment and training and in the confidence that this commander in chief unlike the obama biden administration won t abandon our soldiers in the field ever mr trump started using economic sanctions rather than throwing troops at every problem he understands better than prior administrations how effective these tools can be most beneficially mr trump took on those in our society emblemized by the likes of colin kaepernick aoc the spoiled children in the liberal media and the sex predators in hollywood who see america as a cancer mr trump has refueled the notion of american exceptionalism that has been our birthright for generations mr trump has challenged the self shaming of america by reminding our people of their own individual greatness and the greatness of our society this past week s events in iran prove that if as president you believe in economic freedom and in the strength of our people and culture you can implement policies that make peace an option back in early 2016 exactly four years ago gdp growth was a pathetic 0 5 percent millions had given up even looking for jobs wages were stuck cnn business was reporting on horrific economic indicators and fear as reasons for the 5 5 percent stock market plunge that hit right after christmas in that environment america had no leverage war is all that s left to thwart our adversaries the irony here of course is that the president who won the nobel peace prize actually made our nation more vulnerable to war and the man labeled a warmonger by the fanatics on the left is the one who finally made peace a viable option for the world chris turner is ceo of stampede consulting and serves on the board of the american conservative union he can be reached via twitter ch
