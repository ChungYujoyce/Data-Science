apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic trump associates who believe they were unfairly maligned in robert mueller s russia report want lawmakers to ask one question why when the former special counsel testifies july 17 they also allege that mr mueller knew there was no trump russia conspiracy months before the march 22 completion date of his investigation but stayed quiet why they say the report contains pejorative narratives of innocent conduct for which no one was criminally charged michael caputo media adviser for the trump campaign asked on his still standing podcast when did bob mueller actually know there was no russian collusion top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by

before the 2018 midterm elections he was rather duty bound to announce that republicans lost their house majority at a time when democrats and the news media accused mr trump of being a russian agent and involved in a conspiracy with the kremlin did mueller sit on his no collusion decision mr caputo asked what did robert mueller know and when did he know it george papadopoulos one of the most fbi scrutinized trump campaign volunteers told the washington times that he has a list of questions for mr mueller u s intelligence assigned at least two spies college professor stefan halper and a supposed associate azra turk to investigate whether papadopoulos would admit to colluding with russia papadopoulos was in london trying to set up a kremlin trump meeting in 2016 papadopoulos always has maintained his innocence he was never charged in such a conspiracy but he pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi were stefan halper and azra turk working with the cia papadopoulos asked who was charles tawil working for he asked referring to an american israeli businessman who handed him 10 000 in cash in a hotel room in tel aviv as a consultant s retainer what kind of businessman gives someone 10 000 in cash without a receipt or a contract papadopoulos wrote in his book deep state target how i got caught in the crosshairs of the plot to bring down president trump a terrible one someone used to paying bribes or a businessman who is not really a businessman on returning to the u s via washington dulles international airport papadopoulos was met by fbi agents who vigorously searched his luggage for the tawil cash he said at one point the fbi threatened to charge him with being an agent of israel under that scenario the 10 000 would have been evidence of such an arrangement mr tawil has denied he is a western agent he said papadopoulos asked for the money as a down payment for energy consulting who was joseph mifsud working for papadopoulos asked referring to a maltese professor who ingratiated himself to the trump volunteer in london mr mifsud told papadopoulos in april 2016 that he had heard russia had hillary clinton emails the conversation ultimately persuaded the fbi to open an investigation trump associates say that as a general policy justice department prosecutors don t talk about unindicted people once a case is closed former new jersey gov chris christie a former federal prosecutor told abc news as the mueller report was imminent if you charge you can say whatever you are willing to do an indictment and have a grand jury sign off on if you don t charge keep quiet you re not supposed to talk about people you re unwilling to charge but that is exactly what mr mueller did in his 448 page report the special counsel made an overriding conclusion his large prosecutor fbi intelligence team failed to establish a conspiracy between the trump campaign and moscow to interfere in the 2016 election by computer hacking and trolling not one was charged in a conspiracy yet the names of about three dozen trump associates appeared multiple times often in negative ways their conduct wasn t criminal it often was simply the washington art of networking or practicing politics during an election mr mueller s mandate was to investigate any links between a trump colleague and russia a broad order that had him tracking down seeming innocuous encounters there are over a dozen trump associates never accused of any wrongdoing yet mentioned more than 100 times each in often misleading and pejorative ways said a former trump adviser who asked not to be named for fear of receiving a democratic subpoena this person wants republicans to ask why mr mueller violated the spirit of justice department guidelines the former special counsel is to appear before two panels the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the house judiciary committee in open session he is scheduled for a total of four hours of open testimony followed by closed door sessions mueller violated the civil rights of president trump and dozens of his associates the former adviser said it was a crime wave of defamation j d gordon a former adviser has said his role in a republican convention platform amendment on ukraine was skewed by omitting penitent facts the mueller report devotes an index headline about mr gordon being invited to breakfast by the russian ambassador in washington a check of that small section finds that mr gordon didn t attend john dowd mr trump s former defense attorney said the report misrepresented his discussions with counsel for former national security adviser michael flynn carter page an oklahoma city based energy investor was one of the most targeted trump advisers the fbi tapped his communications for 12 months in 2016 and 2017 it also assigned a spy mr halper who engaged him in conversations at cambridge university and at mr halper s home in virginia in the end mr page faced no charges former british spy christopher steele in a democratic party financed dossier written from june to december 2016 accused mr page of a number of felonies clinton operatives spread the false charges among journalists and the fbi used the dossier extensively the entire document was sourced to kremlin operatives whose motives to this day are not known in a footnote the mueller report refers to foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa warrants on mr page but the report doesn t point out that the evidence the fbi presented to judges was largely based on the discredited dossier two republican senators in january 2018 sent a letter to the justice department accusing mr steele of lying by telling the fbi he had not briefed reporters when in fact he had a house republican investigation last year showed that the fbi never confirmed mr steele s conspiracy allegations and gave him low marks for his russia information republicans plan to ask mr mueller why he devoted no report space to the dossier given that it had a such a broad impact on the russia investigation the justice department inspector general has been investigating how the fbi used the dossier as he left his post on may 31 mr mueller stated emphatically that he would not speak beyond the words he put into his report mr caputo is one of the most conspicuous trump investigation critics at one point he denounced the senate select committee on intelligence with god damn you to hell for putting innocent republicans through hours of questioning and legal bills house democrats have floated conspiracies around mr caputo hung on the fact that he briefly lived in russia as a post soviet proponent of democracy he has never been accused of any wrongdoing mr caputo sat down with the mueller team early in its may 2017 creation my interviewer seemed to believe there was russian collusion he said for three hours he asked me russian flavored questions i gave them nothing mr caputo found his name on page 61 in a few paragraphs about being approached by a russian absolute bold omissions and really slutty innuendo he said he told the times that mr mueller s staff of democrat aligned prosecutors omits what he considers a fact that the
