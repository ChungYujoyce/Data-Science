loaded up with cash what kind of a deal is that news conference with macron the facts it s the kind of deal that did not actually take place when iran signed the multinational deal to restrain its nuclear development in return for being freed from sanctions it regained access to its own assets which had been frozen abroad there was no 150 billion gift from the u s treasury or other countries iran was allowed to get its money back the 1 8 billion refers to a separate matter also misstated by the president going back to before the 2016 election a payout of roughly that amount did come from the u s treasury it was to pay an old iou in the 1970s iran paid the u s 400 million for military equipment that was never delivered because the government was overthrown and diplomatic relations ruptured after the nuclear deal the u s and iran announced they had settled the matter with the u s agreeing to pay the 400 million principal along with about 1 3 billion in interest the 400 million was paid in cash and flown to tehran on a cargo plane the arrangement provided for the interest to be paid later in trump s telling one cargo plane with 400 million that was owed to iran has become

energy trump i feel that the united states has tremendous wealth the wealth is under its feet i ve made that wealth come alive we are now the number one energy producer in the world news conference with macron the facts sole credit to himself is not accurate the greatest energy revolution of the past half century happened on obama s watch as u s petroleum and natural gas production achieved pre eminence in 2013 the u s became the world s top producer both of natural gas and petroleum hydrocarbons says the government s u s energy information administration as for crude oil specifically the agency says the u s became the world s top crude oil producer last year that is largely attributed to the shale oil boom that began late in george w bush s administration and proceeded apace during the obama years the boom came because of fracking and other technology such as horizontal drilling that made it possible to find much more oil and gas without drilling more holes as well obama lifted a decades long ban on shipping u s oil overseas in 2015 helping increase demand for u s crude trump on addressing climate change i feel that the united states has tremendous wealth the wealth is under
