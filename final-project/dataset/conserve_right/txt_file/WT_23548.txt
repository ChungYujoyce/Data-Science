tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn amplified by the news media and partisan outcry immigration has become a melodramatic vehicle for political posturing this is not a happy thing drama usurps both problem solving and productive compromise between republicans and democrats it also tends to mask significant poll numbers which reveal public sentiments that are often lost in the hand wringing and public accusations a slim majority of voters supports the mass deportation raids previewed by president trump last week says a new politico morning consult poll it reveals that 51 of voters support the actions by immigration and customs enforcement officers in recent days compared with 35 of voters who oppose the efforts top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free

survey of 1 200 mexican adults conducted by the washington post and reforma a widely read newspaper in mexico city last week the governors of three northern mexican states signed a document saying they could not accept any more immigrants does this mean that a majority of mexicans are racist of course not mexicans and the illegal immigrants they wish to expel are of the same race notes paul mirengoff an analyst for powerline the poll results mean that most mexicans realize that large scale illegal immigration is bad for the host nation and that a country with open borders risks no longer being a country until recently most democrats and democratic politicians understood this they weren t racists either they were simply hinged now they are unhinged writes mr mirengoff ben carson s reminder housing and urban development secretary ben carson s story of achievement as a neurosurgeon was so compelling that hollywood made a feature film out of it in 2009 with cuba gooding jr playing the lead role it stands to reason then that mr carson has some insight into certain social dynamics you watched an almost unanimous verdict of the media that president trump is a hard boiled racist what s your response to that fox news host tucker carlson asked the hud secretary i ve never seen any evidence of that whatsoever mr carson replied our conversations have frequently centered around disadvantaged people in our country and what we can do to elevate them and it seems to me like a racist wouldn t spend so much time on second chance legislation he wouldn t spend so much time with opportunity zones trying to take people who have made a lot of money and put those unrealized capital gains into areas that have traditionally been neglected so that people can rise he wouldn t spend so much time working on affordable housing these are not things that people who are racist would do people need to look at what the results are and not spend all of their time parsing every word and trying to make it fit their narrative he said would you work for a racist mr carlson asked no i wouldn t i would be out there it in two seconds and i certainly have an opportunity to see what racism is you know growing up in detroit and the 60s mr carson concluded the bookies have a say president trump s odds for a second term in the white house have shortened to his lowest ever numbers despite
