opponents underscoring both the fears he himself stoked during his unorthodox campaign and the efforts democrats are already making to try to dent his legitimacy as president in the immediate aftermath of the nov 8 vote activists demanded recounts in states where the margin of victory was close when that failed activists launched a campaign to pressure electors demanding they abandon their candidate and either back mrs clinton or vote for a third person throwing the election to the house of representatives to decide next year they were less than gracious in their defeat monday you just sold us out of this world screamed one woman protesting against the electors in wisconsin we re all going to go to war and die because of you people you have no right every one of you you re pathetic

ohio gov john kasich who was one of many republicans mr trump defeated for his party s nomination this year in colorado mayhem ensued after a democratic elector michael baca refused to cast his vote for mrs clinton who won the state s popular vote as part of what s become known as the hamilton electors strategy their idea was to convince 37 republican electors to abstain or vote for someone other than mr trump which would have left him with 269 votes one shy of the 270 electoral votes needed to make his victory official but a state judge in colorado ruled last week that any elector who broke with the popular vote could be replaced trump foes booed and jeered as mr baca was replaced by democrat celeste landry who cast her ballot for mrs clinton colorado secretary of state wayne williams

said in a statement the electoral votes will be counted by congress early next month and mr trump will be sworn in on jan 20 his election marks the second in the last five where the winner of the national popular vote did not win a majority in the electoral college americans are generally done with the electoral college a marist mcclatchy poll found 52 percent of voters want the national popular vote to pick the winner while 45 percent back the current system but efforts to undo the electoral college appear doomed to failure since they would require the agreement of the smaller states that benefit from the current arrangement instead activists are hoping to do a runaround ahead of the next election asking states to pass laws forcing their electors to vote for the popular vote winner if enough states agreed they could prevail even without changing the constitution whether it happens in four years or 40 years a national popular vote for president is coming justin nelson founder of one nation one vote said regardless of who you voted for in this election we can all agree that the candidate with the most votes should win and every vote should count equally valerie
