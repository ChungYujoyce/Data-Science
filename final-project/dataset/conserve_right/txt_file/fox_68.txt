democratic senator al franken becomes the first member of congress accused in the post harvey weinstein era leeann tweeden senator al franken accuser he thought he would get away with it and that it was ok and that it was funny nothing like that is ever funny wallace we ll discuss the allegations with south carolina senator tim scott then rep barbara comstock r virginia we really don apost have current guidelines right now that say to a member a sexual relationship with a 19 year old intern is off limits wallace will congress finally crack down on complaints of sexual harassment in its own halls we ll ask utah representative mia love and we ll bring in our sunday panel to ask if a wave of new charges will change the clubby atmosphere on capitol hill plus the house passes its tax bill rep paul ryan r wis speaker of the house from the very start we said that failure is not an option wallace we ll discuss the prospects in the senate with treasury secretary steve mnuchin it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive and our power player of the week the youngest woman ever elected to congress unidentified female i do think institutionally congress benefits from having a churn of new members and new ideas wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington from hollywood to the media and now the halls of congress sexual harassment is front and center as a political issue first with the allegations facing alabama senate candidate judge roy moore and now claims against senator al franken from his time as a comedian in 2006 we ll discuss the charges and whether congress will finally crack down on itself with senator tim scott of south carolina and utah congresswoman mia love but we begin with fox news correspondent peter doocy reporting from alabama begin videotape peter doocy fox news correspondent there are already legislative aftershocks shaking senator al franken whose immediate apology for sexual misconduct was not enough for a rape victim who was working with franken to help future assault victims abby honold penned a washington post op ed with a headline al franken wrote a bill to help rape survivors like me he can t lead on it now minnesota aposs other senator amy klobuchar has already signed on to sponsor not all democrats are distancing themselves from franken though hillary clinton appreciates that he said sorry hillary clinton former democratic presidential candidate look at the contrast between al franken accepting responsibility apologizing and roy moore and donald trump who have done neither doocy in alabama republican senate candidate judge roy moore denies charges for all my women accusing him of decades old wrongdoing he aposs challenging the legitimacy of a high school yearbook signature one accuser says proves her story and he s lashing out at senator jeff flake who said sen jeff flake r arizona if we become the party of roy moore and donald trump we are toast doocy a moore campaign advisor responded quote mitch mcconnell and jeff flake are agents of destruction within the republican party the editorial board for alabama aposs three largest papers cites sexual misconduct allegations as the primary reason for their endorsement of democrat doug jones meanwhile the surgeon jones is trying to focus on issues to engineer an upset doug jones d alabama u s senate candidate i thought roy moore was disqualified long before this came up end videotape doocy we re told the democrat jones will have about one event a day this week as for roy moore we have no idea when his next public rally will be so it seems two of the politicians with the least to say about the scandal in alabama are the two senate candidates in alabama chris wallace peter doocy reporting from birmingham alabama peter thanks for that joining me now from salt lake city utah republican congresswoman mia love congresswoman i want to start with a comment this week by one of your colleagues in the house congresswoman barbara comstock here she is begin video clip comstock the young staffer is a young woman went there and was greeted with a member in a towel was a male who he then invited her in at that point he decided to expose himself she left and then she quit her job end video clip wallace congresswoman how serious a problem is there with sexual harassment in congress and if you can tell us have you or any of your staffers been a victim rep mia love r utah well i can tell you this is been going on for a very long time and i m glad that people are speaking out about it i you know it aposs important to speak out about it nationally and also locally and in our homes i have two girls that i m racing one is going off to college and it aposs important that we have we re comfortable having uncomfortable conversations so that we can protect our young women and protect women in the work space wallace let aposs talk about your work space because it turns out that congress has protected itself with a much more challenging much more cumbersome process than we see in the private sector i want to put this up i think people will be surprised a victim who claims sexual harassment congress must wait three months to file a complaint first submit to 30 days of counseling and another 30 days of mediation then wait another 30 days to seek a hearing and congresswoman it gets even worse than that because if there is a settlement it aposs paid for by taxpayers not by the individual member of congress is this another case of the old boys apos clubby network on capitol hill protecting itself love well as the only woman in the utah delegation i have a little bit of a problem with that we our office has made sure that they have taken all of the anti sexual harassment training and i let out on that taking it myself i think we need some leadership we need people that are out there that are talking about this and talking about how situations like this behavior like this is absolutely inappropriate but i would also like to say one more thing i think it aposs important that we especially the things that are going on out there that this is not being politicized it aposs not being used for personal gain because we normalize the situation if and when that happens we have to make sure that we are not going out there doing anything that is going to further victimize people who have actually been hurt and who ve been humiliated by sexual harassment and sexual misconduct wallace well let me ask you about to specific cases do you believe that judge roy moore the candidate in the special senate election in alabama should step aside from that race to let a write in candidate try to hold the seat for republicans and what do you think should happen to senator al franken after the allegations against him this week love i m calling them all on the carpet i think that all of them should take responsibility for their behavior this is you know when you think about al franken you think about judge moore you think about all the situations that are out there they re all different and they all deserve due process and the people need to be able to have time to talk about them and process it we certainly aren apost going to be able to do that today and seven minutes on a sunday show but i think it aposs important that we end up talking about it getting comfortable having uncomfortable conversations and saying that this type of behavior is unacceptable wallace well let me ask you about one other person and whether or not he should be held accountable and that is president trump who has had very little to say about the judge roy moore case but when it comes to al franken in that picture he weighed in on that the picture of franken appearing to grope his accuser the president sent out this tweet the al frankenstien picture is really bad speaks a thousand words where do his hands go in pictures two three four five and six while she sleeps on the other hand when reporters noted that president trump faces his own allegations from a bunch of women about him allegedly groping them here aposs his spokeswoman said begin video clip sarah huckabee sanders white house press secretary i think in one case specifically senator franken has admitted wrongdoing and the president hasn apost i think that s a very clear distinction end video clip wallace congresswoman does that satisfy you the fact that president trump has denied the allegations love well again all of these situations are completely different i think people need to take responsibility for their actions not just in the future but also in the past and we can t absolutely i m not qualified nor is it appropriate for us to process prosecute judge and sentence in the seven minutes that we have here but i think it is important that we all speak out and we prevent these things from happening this is about looking towards the future and making sure that women are empowered and no longer victimized that people if they are experiencing situations in the office that make them uncomfortable that they feel empowered that they can actually speak out and stop the behavior wallace congresswoman love thank you thanks for your time love thank you thank you wallace now to south carolina and republican senator tim scott senator let aposs start with your colleague al franken sen tim scott r south carolina good morning wallace who is accused of forcibly kissing and groping leeann tweeden should the senate discipline or even perhaps expel senator franken scott we certainly should start the process of an ethics investigation as has been suggested and i think started by senator mcconnell this is absolutely the right starting point all sexual harassment is inexcusable and everyone should be punished at the same level wallace on the other hand people note that the senate ethics committee has never expelled any member for actions taken before they were senator so some people are saying well ok you put them before the senate ethics committee and that aposs where these charges go away to die scott yes i completely disagree with that this is a brand new era i know that the last time someone was expelled was like the civil war the reality of it is that we should take responsibility i m a big believer according to the good book that all folks in leadership are held to a higher standard and we will hold our members to a higher standard that aposs a fact and i look forward to the outcome of the investigation wallace well i want to ask about the standards you feel should apply to judge roy moore you have been on the record as saying if the charges are true he should step away but realistically we may never know whether or not the charges are true and we almost certainly are not going to know before the special election on december 12th so let me ask you a direct question do you think that judge moore should step aside and let a republican write in candidate try to hold onto the seat scott what i ve said in the past i want to be very clear is that the allegations are stronger than the denial and that roy moore should find something else to do which is my way of suggesting that he should not be in a race wallace so you think he should step down at this point scott i certainly think that there aposs a strong possibility with a new candidate a new republican candidate a proven conservative that we can win that race in alabama and it is in the best interest of the country as well as the state of alabama from my perspective for roy moore to find something else to do wallace so let me ask you about judge moore because he says that these accusations against him are really about the senate establishment the elite trying to keep down and take away a representative in his case of the grassroots here is judge moore begin video clip roy moore r alabama u s senate candidate this is an effort by mitch mcconnell and his cronies to steal his election from the people of alabama and they will not stand for it end video clip wallace in your view is this controversy about judge moore aposs behavior or is it a political power play by the washington post and senator mcconnell scott this controversy is over the necessity of respecting women period our response to sexual harassment should be as aggressive as possible the reality of it is when you look at those conservative lawmakers in the senate who have withdrawn their support of judge moore that should send a clear signal that this has nothing to do with the establishment republican or politics it has to do with the character that we want displayed in the united states of america and especially in our leadership role ph wallace well let me ask about what i just discussed with congresswoman love because the rules for a sexual harassment victim are really pretty challenging in congress they have to go through a 90 day period if there aposs a settlement it aposs paid for by the taxpayers not by the member does congress need to get its own house in order here scott well according to the rules that you laid out the answer is yes in my office my chief of staff she and i sat down and had a conversation at the beginning of my term designed within our employee aposs manual how to respond if you feel harassed you don apost have to go to your supervisor you can go to any supervisor in the office including my chief of staff she believes that the best way for us to make sure that the employees who work within our office are as safe and as comfortable as possible is to make sure that all routes for their challenges don apost flow through a specific person whether it s me or her but it goes through anyone that they are most comparable talking with i think that policy being adopted by the entire senate and that we accelerate the process and hold each member accountable and responsible for their actions not at taxpayers expense but at an individual expense only makes sense wallace let me turn to tax reform the senate the full senate is going to take it up after thanksgiving i want to ask you a specific area of it how do you justify that in the senate tax bill as passed by the senate finance committee it keeps the tax cuts for corporations permanent but the tax cuts for individuals expire in eight years scott well the good news is that if we are able to lower the highest corporate tax rate in the world from 35 percent to 20 percent and make it permanent the jobs of the future will be created here at home giving people tax breaks for one year or ten years on their individual taxes is a success if we can make it permanent our friends on the left can help us get there and i hope and look forward to them becoming a part of this process wallace finally one senator republican senator ron johnson has already said he is against the bill as you know a number of others have issues with it is tax reform head the way of obamacare you have a very narrow margin for error in the senate on this sir scott the good news is it aposs not the reality of it is that ron johnson aposs concerns are legitimate concerns i think we can deal with them there aposs editorial recently in the wall street journal that gives us direction on how to get that accomplished other senators have talked about the importance of parity between the corporate and the pass throughs we can t get to parity but we can get close and i think we ll get a little closer and we ll have a full team on display in december bringing a christmas present to the american people allowing them to keep more of their hard earned money wallace senator scott thank you thanks for joining us always good to talk with you sir scott thank you chris good seeing you wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss the moore and franken scandals as well as no questions about whether bill clinton should have resigned over the lewinsky affair commercial break begin video clip moore i m the only one that can unite democrats and republicans because i think i will be opposed by both laughter leeann tweeden tv and radio host before i know that he grabbed that he put his hand on the back of my head and came towards me and mashed his face against my mouth and stuck his tongue in my mouth end video clip wallace alabama senate candidate roy moore trying to save his campaign while broadcaster leanne tweeden makes allegations against democratic senator al franken and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz columnist for the hill juan williams head director of research at bustle jessica tarlov and jason riley from the wall street journal well congressman what are your thoughts about the problems with sexual harassment in general on capitol hill in particular and i ve got to say as i started this week i am shocked at the rules that members of congress as you used to be and have implemented to protect yourselves from sexual harassment charges jason chaffetz r former utah congressman yes no it aposs absolutely disgusting there aposs always somebody doing something stupid somewhere but a woman should not have to go through that process as you laid out when it happens in congress and maybe the best avenues just go directly to the police because there aposs a legal process by getting prosecutors and the law involved and i think the victims ought to have the loudest voice on that but politically i do believe that those decisions need to be made by the people in say alabama or minnesota i think it aposs very presumptuous for the majority leader to say hey we re going to work to kick you out when you aposre dealing with the same fact pattern the people in alabama and minnesota can make those decisions wallace well jessica let me ask about that should this just be left in the case particularly of alabama because judge moore faces a special election in a couple of weeks leave it to them jessica tarlov senior research director bustle com well i think obviously upholding our democracy is the most important issue at play here but i do think especially considering what aposs going on in the last couple of years the allegations in the political world and the media and entertainment world and what an important topic sexual harassment is for america generally that people like mitch mcconnell people like cory gardner need to stand up and take a stand on something like this and to say this is unacceptable behavior and we don apost want it here with us and there aposs no place for it in washington so i m torn about it obviously the voters will get their chance to vote for roy moore if they want but there should be a candidate on the ballot on the republican side who has not been accused of child molestation wallace let me ask you because this is obviously a difficult conversation but it aposs an important conversation on the other hand i wonder to some degree are we mixing up misdemeanors and felonies you got the case of al franken who allegedly forcibly kissed this woman and groped her which is clearly piggish behavior on the other hand it aposs different from the allegations against roy moore who as you pointed out allegedly was having sexual contact with a 14 year old girl should they all be career enders tarlov i don apost think so personally i think that having that nuanced discussion is what we really need to do at this point there was a good piece that came out in the new york post about this that said you know harvey weinstein aposs picture should not be next to al franken aposs picture you know roy moore aposs picture should not be next to the guy from amazon for instance this wallace but you ve got to know some people are going to say well you know maybe you re protecting tarlov no i m not it aposs not because of political affiliation i know that we will get to talk about the importance of revisiting bill clinton and what happened in the 90s and democrats are certainly taking that up right now but we need to be clear about the strength of these allegations and how important they are and what roy moore did versus what an al franken did wallace well let aposs talk about bill clinton because that was a really interesting development this week the reassessment of bill clinton aposs affair with monica lewinsky back when clinton was president kirsten gillibrand who is a senator from new york sits in hillary clinton aposs seat says that under current standards bill clinton should have resigned mrs clinton says no take a look begin audio clip sen kirsten gillibrand d new york yes i think that is the appropriate response but i think things have changed today and i think under those circumstances there should be a very different reaction hillary clinton d former democratic presidential candidate this was a painful time not only in our marriage but in our country as i have written about but it was investigated fully it was addressed at the time end audio clip wallace jason pretty interesting that kirsten gillibrand who is thinking of running for president on the democratic side in 2020 went there jason riley the wall street journal well this is pure political expediency this is not about principle this is clear it seems to me that if you are a pro choice wealth redistributionist you can also be a groper and get a pass from both of the women you played clips from hillary clinton is also partially defending al franken because of how he s responded to the charges against him versus how president trump has responded and then you have the senator from new york essentially saying you know that we live in different times well this is a woman who has associated herself with the clinton family with mrs clinton in particular has the seat mrs clinton once held and i think this is not about principle at all this is about taking advantage of the current crosstalk wallace what do you think the political expediency is in kirsten gillibrand going after bill clinton now riley it aposs now fashionable it aposs now acceptable and she pays no political cost for doing so wallace let me well she pays a little bit of political cost and let me bring this up with you juan philippe reines a longtime aide to hillary clinton blasted gillibrand for what she said he tweeted this let s put it up over 20 years you gillibrand took clinton aposs endorsements money and seat hypocrite interesting strategy for 2020 primaries best of luck this issue of sex harassment is not only splitting republicans roy moore and mitch mcconnell it aposs also splitting democrats juan williams fox news political analyst right and the power here is the charge of hypocrisy i think that aposs why clinton comes bill clinton comes to the floor so quickly because the charge would be oh democrats have you been as tough on your sexual harassers as you are asking republicans to be on theirs and so immediately you ve seen pieces in vox and the new york times gillibrand coming forward as a democratic congressman who said oh yes clinton should have been ousted i think one of the keys for me is democrats wanting to say that we retained some moral authority in speaking on this issue as republican aposs try to impose but i think at times as you and jessica tarlov were discussing a false equivalency between let s say a roy moore and even bill clinton i just think that you know at the moment the politics is so tribal wallace wait wait i can understand the difference or the distinction between moore and franken how is there a distinction between moore and williams i don t think i don t think even if you re going to say monica lewinsky was an intern a young person and there was a huge power differential between the president of the united states and an intern no one was suggesting that she was beneath the age of consent and she said unidentified male much more inaudible williams well i m just saying in the one that he was impeached for because he was impeached wallace he was impeached for lying williams well he was impeached over this case lying about this issue and i think that it aposs very important for people part of the reines response was millions of dollars were spent investigating and impeaching this man and now you have a situation here where there are some people including roy moore who want to point at mitch mcconnell and claim there is a republican much less democrats or the elite media from washington trying to tell the voters of alabama what to do chaffetz the bill clinton situation happened while he was in office and then lied about it as the president of the united states that s why it has but i do think kirsten i mean i m glad that we re elevating the debate i m glad that this is becoming totally unacceptable on both sides of the aisle and there should be a huge and massive political price if not essentially the death penalty for people who engage in this and that they cannot serve at the highest levels of government why do we i wish crosstalk wallace you re not really serious about the death penalty chaffetz well a political death penalty wallace ok fair enough laughter crosstalk chaffetz yes but no a political death penalty which is why should we put up with anybody serving at the highest level of government who engages in this whether it was 40 years ago or whether it happened while you were in office wallace thank you all this is going to be continued no question about it we re going to take a break here and we ll see you a little bit later up next an exclusive interview with treasury secretary steven mnuchin on whether a gop task reform bill that will make it to the president aposs desk by christmas commercial break wallace coming up the house passes a sweeping tax bill begin video clip rep paul ryan r wis speaker of the house i want to thank not just the members who made this possible i want to thank the president i want to thank his administration and i thank our partners in the senate who were doing their work as well end video clip wallace but what will happen in the senate treasury secretary steve mnuchin joins us next on fox news sunday commercial break chris wallace fox anchor mnuchin mr secretary i want to start with democratic criticism of the tax plan in this case by house leader nancy pelosi here she is begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d minority leader they throw a scrap to the middle class provide a banquet for the wealthy and for corporate america transform america in doing so we will not let that happen end video clip wallace secretary mnuchin where is congresswoman pelosi wrong steve mnuchin treasury secretary well i just fundamentally don apost agree with her this is about making the business tax system competitive which is about creating jobs and this is about a very significant middle income tax cut that aposs what this is all about wallace well let aposs look at the analysis by the bipartisan joint committee on taxation because here aposs what they said about the house bill they say it delivers 80 percent of its cuts to corporations businesses and wealthy families this isn apost a democratic partisan this is congress apos own joint committee on taxation mnuchin chris these numbers are very complicated and it depends on how you allocate them so one of the things they aposre doing is they aposre taking a pass through allocation which is all about small and medium size businesses and they aposre allocating it back to the wealthy and the same thing with the corporate tax cuts we don apost believe that if you look at this simply and people just look at are their personal taxes going up or down on the personal tax side middle income people are getting cuts and rich people are getting very little cuts or in certain cases increases wallace let me break that down though sir because respectfully it seems to me it aposs a little bit more complicated than that and here is one reason why the gop tax plan according to analyst favors the wealthy and corporations i want to put this up on the screen in the senate plan while the corporate tax cuts are permanent almost all provisions for individuals including rate cuts and the expanded standard deduction expire go away at the end of 2025 the result according to the joint committee on taxation by 2027 this is the senate plan anyone making less than 75 000 will see a tax hike while those making more than 75 000 will see a tax cut how do you respond to that mnuchin chris the problem is that under the senate rules and the byrd ph rule using reconciliation there aposs very specific rules because we aposre changing from an international system to a territorial system we need to make the corporate tax cuts permanent you can apost tell corporations they aposre going back to a worldwide system because of that we were forced to phase out the personal tax side but nobody thinks that aposs going to be the case of course congress is going to vote down the road to keep these cuts so it aposs not about allocating cuts to the corporations it aposs about we have to fix the business tax side and make it permanent wallace but isn apost it and this is what critics are saying isn apost it a statement of your priorities i mean the real reason that you make the individual cuts temporary and they expire after 2025 is otherwise your deficit was going to be too big it was going to go over some people say it aposs a budget gimmick but isn apost it a statement of priorities that you made the business cuts permanent and the individual cuts temporary you could have done exactly the opposite and made the individual cuts permanent and cut back on the business cuts that they were temporary mnuchin chris you can apost you can apost do that if you want to fix the business tax system and going from a worldwide system to a territorial system you can apost switch back in ten years so this is all about the byrd rule and how we calculate things this isn apost about the deficit because we think this is all about creating growth and we aposll create economic growth to pay down the deficit so this is technical issues in the senate and the corporate side is about jobs this is the tax cut and jobs bill this is about making american businesses competitive so we can bring jobs back home in trillions of dollars invested here in the u s wallace but forgive me sir what you aposre basically saying is look we have we aposre going to make the tax and it isn apost just the worldwide system you aposre also making the business tax cuts the reduction in the corporate rate from 35 percent to 20 percent you aposre making that permanent and you talk with great assurance about what aposs going to happen in 2025 the fact is you aposre not going to be office in office in 2025 even if he aposs elected donald trump isn apost going to be president in 2025 and in any case you have no idea what the political situation is going to be lent or what the economic situation is going to be and the deficit situation so when you just say well of course they aposre going to extend it in 2025 you don apost know that mnuchin i don apost know that maybe i aposll be working for president pence at the time but i don apost know that but what i do know is we think this is going to create growth and we aposll know by then whether this creates growth or not if it does create growth we aposre going to have an incredible economy and an incredible tax system for businesses and creating huge amounts of jobs and if it doesn apost congress will deal with it at the time wallace about again and not to belabor it that means as you say congress will deal with it at the time that the the tax cuts for individuals which expire in 2025 may stay expired may just go away mnuchin chris we have a lot of confidence that congress will do the right thing and again the priority for the moment is middle income tax cuts this is a big cut for the middle income and it aposs going to create jobs and growth so an average family that aposs making 75 000 a family of four they aposre going to get over 1 000 tax cut this is very significant and this is about creating a tax system that aposs competitive we have the highest tax system in the world how can our companies compete when their taxes are 35 percent and the rest of the world is in the low 20s wallace i want to ask you about another aspect of the senate bill and that is the individual mandate the not the house bill but the senate bill repeals the individual mandate in obamacare there aposs it aposs some people like it in the senate some people don apost susan collins has expressed concern about it lisa murkowski has expressed concern about it is that in effect a bargaining chip in other words if you find it aposs costing you more votes than it aposs getting you then you would support taking the individual mandate out mnuchin well let me first say this is all about getting this past in the senate that aposs the objective this isn apost a bargaining chip the president thinks we should get rid of it i think we should get rid of it it aposs an unfair tax on poor people to think that you put a penalty on people who can apost afford to buy medical policies is just fundamentally unfair that aposs what this is all about wallace but if it it does have a political impact it wasn apost in your original proposal for tax reform it aposs been added in afterwards i guess what i aposm asking is could you live with it if it aposs taken out mnuchin i think right now our objective is to keep it in it aposs a it provides a big tax cut for the middle class it gets rid of the penalty but we aposre going to work with the senate as we go through this what aposs critical here is we have the house that passed a bill that aposs a very big deal we got it done we got it out of the finance committee it aposs going to be in the floor right after thanksgiving and we aposre going to get something to the president to sign this year because this is all about creating growth in the economy and you can see what aposs going on people have a lot of confidence in the trump economic plan you see that in the market you see that in investing and this is about delivering tax cuts to the american people wallace you talk about getting it to the president by christmas i want to pick up on that because i think you aposd agree right now the republican tax plan is hanging by a thread in the senate senator ron johnson of wisconsin has already said that he aposs a no vote although yes i know he aposs persuadable at least five other republicans are on the fence and you aposre in danger of losing that alabama seat if roy moore loses in the special election on december 12th if moore stays in the race and doesn apost clear the way for a stronger write in candidate doesn apost that increase the jeopardy for tax reform mnuchin well i aposm not going to speculate on the race but what i will tell you is i aposve met with senator corker this week i met with senator johnson i met with senator collins we aposre having very good discussions with all of them we want to make sure we incorporate their views and we aposre comfortable where we are in this process this is a this is about having discussions and making sure we get something to the president to sign wallace finally i have to ask you about something that has gotten a lot of attention this week you and your wife went this week to the bureau of engraving and printing to check out the first dollar bills with your signature on it which i aposm sure was exciting the pictures went viral mr secretary some folks and i aposm looking at the picture here which you can apost see say that you two look like two villains from a james bond movie i aposm sure you aposve heard that i guess my question is what would you thinking mnuchin i heard that i never thought i aposd be quoted is looking like villains from the james bond i guess i should take that as a compliment that i look like a villain in a great successful james bond movie but let me just say i was very excited of having my signature on the money it aposs obviously a great privilege and a great honor and something i aposm very proud of being the secretary and look forward to helping the american people wallace and why just briefly did you decide that you and your wife would have fun with the money and take those pictures mnuchin well again i didn apost realize that the pictures were public and going on the internet and viral but people have the right to do that people can express what they want that aposs the great thing about social media today people can say and communicate what they want wallace and they do and i want to ask you about one other aspect of this because every treasury secretary i aposve ever known signs their name on the dollar bill you printed your name on the dollar bill i know this is a pressing question but how come mnuchin i changed my signature i had a very very messy signature that you could barely read it was very effective at signing things but i felt since it was going to be on the dollar bill forever i should have a nice clean signature wallace secretary mnuchin i think we can all agree on that it is a very clean signature thank you so much thanks for your time sir and we aposll track development in the senate as they take up tax reform mnuchin thanks chris great to be here with you wallace up next we aposll bring back our sunday group to discuss what they think are the prospects of tax reform plus hillary clinton is once again questioning the legitimacy of donald trump aposs election victory commercial break begin video clip sen sherrod brown d ohio finance committee this tax cut really is not for the middle class it aposs for the rich and that whole thing about higher wages well it aposs a good selling point sen orrin hatch r utah chairman finance committee i aposm going to just say to you that i come from the poor people and i aposve been here working my whole stinking career for people who don apost have a chance end video clip wallace a heated exchange between senate finance committee chair orrin hatch and democratic senator sherrod brown of ohio over who benefits from the republican tax plan and we aposre back now with the panel well jason where do you think the battle for tax reform stands right now how much trouble is it in in the senate and how do you see this playing out jason riley fox news contributor well it got to the house we were expecting that to happen and now we are where the health care debate was and what it went over to the senate where it died right now there are some concerns you have a bunch of senators from ron johnson susan collins lisa murkowski john mccain jeff flake are very skeptical of what they see right now but we aposre at the beginning of the process leadership thinks they can be won over and that aposs what they aposre they aposre trying to do right now wallace juan i want to ask you about this case that aposs being made by democrats we heard nancy pelosi in my conversation with secretary mnuchin that this was a giveaway for corporations and the wealthy and interestingly enough in polls that have been taken so far you can question how much people know about the details of the bill not very popular juan williams fox news political analyst no i think quinnipiac has it you know more than 50 percent so a majority of americans disapprove of the republican tax cuts right now people want tax reform chris i think they want a simpler system eased they want to do away with some of these loopholes and deductions that allow especially corporations and the rich to benefit but people want a simpler system but now we aposve gone as the republicans just try to say we aposve got to do this on a fast track jam it through we don apost want too much criticism this is very important for us to have a legislative accomplishment i think you aposre at the point where republicans are saying to each other just hold your nose we aposll see what comes out of the senate president trump has been back and forth he even said to democrats don apost worry about the house bill i don apost know what that says to house republicans but at this point it aposs just politics riley this has to go back this has to go back to the house where williams right there will be a conference riley where more than a dozen republicans voted against it particularly from blue states so this just because the senate passes a version doesn apost mean the house will pass what the inaudible wallace no and we should and we should point out that the senate version totally limits the state and local dedications riley yes williams that aposs what i was going to say wallace the house version keeps it for property taxes so it will be interesting to see how they thread the needle here let me turn to another subject the russia investigation which never seems to go away this week hillary clinton continued to question donald trump aposs legitimacy his election to be president and attorney general jeff sessions continued to deny that he misled congress here they both are begin video clip hillary clinton d former presidential candidate i think that there are lots of questions about his legitimacy and we don apost have a method for contesting that in our system jeff sessions u s attorney general and i will not accept and reject accusations that i have ever lied that is a lie end video clip wallace congressman chaffetz where are we on the russia investigation both in the house the senate and the special counsel jason chaffetz fox news contributor i thought the attorney general appearing before the house judiciary was an important step forward he was emphatic that he had not lied about lying and i still don apost see the evidence that the democrats think think is there and as long as the face of this is going to be hillary clinton i think most of the country is going to get turned off and repulsed by it wallace what do you think of the fact that she once again now she aposs saying well we don apost really have a mechanism to do this i mean president trump aposs more than a year since the 2016 election chaffetz yes wallace we aposre almost in 2018 and now she aposs saying we need to give it to an independent commission chaffetz well look he is the president of the united states i know she doesn apost like that i know she wishes it was a different outcome and there she aposs right there is no mechanism to do that but there aposs nothing to suggest that any of the votes were actually manipulated that any of the results out of 30 of the 50 states that went for donald trump would have gone a different direction because of wallace well that aposs part of the question the other question is whether there was collusion with the russians and i aposm not saying there is but that aposs the other issue chaffetz it aposs a question we have there aposs a special investigator a special prosecutor who aposs looking at that but for hillary clinton to say hey the election aposs in question it just laughable it aposs almost embarrassing wallace you know let me ask you about that jessica because i moderated the third presidential debate and if you remember i asked donald trump i was about to say president trump but he was then donald trump will you recognize the legitimacy of the election because he kept saying it was rigged and he refused to and hillary clinton went up inaudible and this is disgusting we have a tradition peaceful transfer of power does it make it at the very least hypocritical for her now to say well i aposm still questioning the election jessica tarlov fox news contributor i think that it does and to jason aposs point i agree with you that she absolutely shouldn apost be the face of this whether she likes it or not or whether a lot of democrats who supported her i was one of them and there are 65 other million americans who did as well don apost want to face it the american public has said we are done with the clintons for now that doesn apost mean that these points don apost need to be made and i think the most important issue that she aposs raising is that we had an unprecedented intervention by a foreign power into our election and we need to take stock of that and develop mechanisms to deal with that if it happens again in 2020 in 2024 wallace well in fair go ahead tarlov so that i think is really important wallace in terms of 2016 it aposs interesting jason because we keep learning of contacts between the russians and the clinton campaign now the senate judiciary committee controlled by a republican chuck grassley says that jared kushner did not turn over all the documents all the records of his contacts i aposve got to say though that when we see these contacts it aposs much more a case of the russians knocking on the door saying hey you know would you would you play with us it aposs not hey we aposre in we aposre in cahoots together here riley i agree that does sound like what was going on and it looks like kushner did what he was supposed to do in terms of trying to shut it down but it is a reminder that in addition to the mueller investigation you do have various committees in congress also investigating this this is this is not going anywhere and the idea that we aposre now talking about kushner shows that this is rising up in terms of the importance of people in the administration we aposre beyond manafort level we are now into close aides to the president even members of his family wallace juan we aposve got about 30 seconds left i mean you aposve got kushner we don apost know what manafort is going to say or not there aposs still mike flynn out there but you would agree at this point there is no evidence that the russian that the trump campaign played ball with the russians williams no i don apost see any so far but i would make this point that i think that the propaganda effort was substantial and we continue to see that they were very interested wallace by the russians williams by the russians in terms of setting various groups in the united states against each other and then you have a very thin margin in states like michigan pennsylvania wisconsin literally thousands of votes that made a difference and i think the propaganda value was substantial wallace and i think you it aposs fair to say that as the russians look at it and the fact that we aposre talking about it a year later williams wow wallace they aposve got to be happy tarlov they definitely won wallace thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week at the end of a dispiriting few days in american politics the story of a rising star in the gop bringing new ideas and leadership to congress commercial break wallace millennials have become the largest segment of our workforce and are quickly becoming the largest segment of u s voters and while they are very negative about washington one of their own is trying to change that here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape rep elise stefanik r ny youngest woman elected to congress no i wasn apost scared i wanted to get some accomplishments under my belt wallace voice over that aposs elise stefanik explaining why she turned me down for a power player profile two years ago when at age 30 she became the youngest woman ever elected to congress stefanik i wanted to make sure that my first impression to my colleagues is that i am a workhorse i invest myself in learning about the policy issues and i add substantive ideas to the discussion i rise today in strong support for the conference report for the national defense authorization act wallace representing fort drum in upstate new york stefanik is a member of the house intelligence and armed services committees and as a republican she wrote a change to obamacare that president obama signed barack obama former u s president there you go stefanik i wrote and passed the largest fix to our health care law in my first term we needed new direction wallace running on the slogan new ideas and new leadership stefanik campaigned on people aposs frustrations with congress stefanik i would ask every group that i met with raise your hand if you think washington is broken every hand would go up wallace part of her answer use technology and transparency to make congress more accountable stefanik i use the example of posting votes on facebook that aposs using a new tool to reach out directly to constituents and hear back from them on every single vote that something every member should be doing wallace on camera is there any pinch me quality of that you are a united states congresswoman stefanik there are pinch me moments every day when i walk in and see the capitol dome wallace voice over stefanik started in politics a while ago stefanik i ran for student council secretary in sixth grade and i ran on the platform of bringing a snack machine and that is very popular among wallace on camera i was going to say i figure you won stefanik i won wallace voice over she worked two years in the bush 43 white house on domestic policy stefanik and that aposs the approach i aposll bring to washington wallace then in 2014 she ran for congress wallace on camera how much pushback did you get you aposre too young you aposre too inexperienced stefanik i got a lot of pushback initially very few people took me seriously paul ryan actually was one of the individuals that encouraged me and gave me great advice you have two ears and one mouth use it in that ratio listen to what voter aposs concerns are wallace voice over stefanik won her swing district by 22 points and last year was re elected by 35 points wallace on camera is it true that when you first got here you got stopped a lot stefanik i did and i still get stopped about once a month going back and forth to the floor to vote and if i wasn apost wearing my pin there would be many votes that i would have missed wallace voice over stefanik is not just young she aposs a maverick often bucking the party lines she voted against the gop tax bill this week because it eliminates the state and local income tax deduction important to new yorkers and that aposs not all stefanik i aposve introduced the republican resolution that climate change is happening and we need to find a solution wallace while stefanik has had an impressive start in congress she doesn apost plan to be there forever stefanik i do think institutionally congress benefits from having a churn ph of new members and new ideas so i don apost see myself being here for 25 30 years wallace on camera but maybe 15 or 20 stefanik i don apost know
