d be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump on sunday ordered another pullback of u s troops inside syria as a turkish military invasion gains steam and the geopolitical situation deteriorates with american backed kurdish forces now pursuing an alliance with moscow and the government of syrian dictator bashar assad amid reports of violence against kurdish civilians and the escape of hundreds of islamic state sympathizers from a detention camp defense secretary mark t esper said the u s will move roughly 1 000 troops out of the increasingly violent and unstable region of northern syria it s unclear where the forces will go or whether they will exit syria entirely but mr esper said it had become clear that american troops faced growing danger amid the turkish assault and a burgeoning opposition force made up of u s backed syrian democratic forces mr assad s syrian government troops and russian soldiers see also trump authorizes deliberate withdrawal of all u s forces from northern syria it gets worse by the hour mr esper said during a rare sunday morning talk show appearance i ve talked to president trump and he is concerned last night he directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of u s forces from the northern part of syria it looks like the sdf is cutting a deal with the syrians and russians mr esper told fox news sunday now what we re facing is u s forces trapped between a syrian russian army moving north to take on the turkish army that is moving south it puts us in a terrible position mr trump announced last week that the u s would pull several dozen special operations troops from key buffer zones along the syria turkey border that decision paved the way for turkey to launch a military incursion into northern syria to take on the sdf which for years has been a key u s ally in the fight against the islamic state group also known as isis see also hundreds of isis prisoners escape syrian detention camp after turkey invasion ankara considers elements of the sdf to be terrorists who are responsible for an insurgency inside turkey the white house has come under intense bipartisan fire for the troop withdrawal critics say the u s is abandoning an ally essentially giving turkey permission to slaughter kurds and paving the way for an isis resurgence mr trump defended the decision sunday arguing that it s simply not america s role to get into the middle of a long standing dispute between the turks and the kurds very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the turkish border for a change those that mistakenly got us into the middle east wars are still pushing to fight they have no idea what a bad decision they have made why are they not asking for a declaration of war the president tweeted although the president is clearly intent on getting the u s out of the conflict in syria his administration last week announced the deployment of additional american troops to saudi arabia the pentagon said roughly 1 800 more troops along with missile systems and other defensive equipment will be moved to saudi arabia to defend against possible iranian aggression over the past month the defense department has deployed or re upped the deployments of about 3 000 u s troops to saudi arabia saudi arabia is a long standing security partner in the middle east and has asked for additional support to supplement their own defenses and defend the international rules based order mr esper told reporters at the pentagon on friday afternoon the u s and saudi arabia blame iran for an attack on a key saudi oil facility last month u s troops in danger in syria the decision to again move american troops reflects a growing belief that the situation is increasingly dangerous and will only get worse in the coming days reports late friday said turkish artillery hit targets just a few hundred yards from u s positions in northern syria a handful of lawmakers praised mr trump s decision to withdraw from the fight and argued that it s clear turkey was dead set on invading syria regardless of whether american forces were in the way i think a lot of people are not acknowledging that turkey was coming in one way or another sen rand paul kentucky republican told nbc s meet the press on sunday but mr paul is firmly in the minority most lawmakers have accused the president of abandoning the kurdish led sdf in the face of turkish aggression after the group suffered thousands of casualties helping the u s take on isis what we re seeing on the ground right now is absolutely sickening sen chris van hollen maryland democrat told fox news sunday amid reports that turkish troops have begun executing kurds all the administration is doing is talking while people are being killed heavy fighting continued between the two sides sunday as turkish president recep tayyip erdogan rejected the idea of diplomacy with the kurds he said his country won t negotiate with terrorists meanwhile sdf officials told the washington times late last week that they were open to a dialogue with the assad government u s officials now say there are clear signs that the sdf is on the verge of accepting a deal with mr assad and his ally russia an sdf assad russia axis could dramatically reshape the power structure in the region at the same time turkey s military ambitions appear to stretch beyond simply crushing the sdf to possibly taking over large swaths of northern and western syria u s officials say there is virtually no appetite to use the u s military to stop the turkish advance we didn t sign up to fight turkey a long standing nato ally on behalf of the sdf mr esper said we re not going to go to war another war in the middle east against turkey a long standing nato ally that has fought alongside us from korea all the way to afghanistan but there are growing signs that u s national security could be at risk as the turkish military advances the sdf had been primarily responsible for guarding thousands of isis fighters captured in recent years but the group says it must divert resources away from prison camps and toward the fight with turkey the guarding is very weak now said sdf spokesman marvan qamishlo according to reuters on sunday as many as 950 islamic state supporters including some wives and widows of the terrorist group s fighters escaped from a prison camp in ain essa according to the sdf that figure could not be immediately confirmed as many as 12 000 people are said to be held at the camp heavy fighting between turkish and kurdish forces in the area reportedly led to the escape the u s has insisted that turkey is responsible for securing those isis prisoners but former military officials say the current situation all but guarantees that the terrorist group will mount a comeback it s absolutely a given that they will come back former defense secretary james n mattis who resigned in protest last year when mr trump first announced a syria withdrawal told meet the press in an interview that aired sunday white house and pentagon officials said they were still trying to persuade turkey to pull back its forces if ankara continues ahead administration officials said then the u s is ready to pull the trigger on economic sanctions we are ready to go on a moment s notice
