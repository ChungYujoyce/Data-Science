apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap with release of the special counsel s fuller report looming president donald trump and his campaign are twisting the words of his attorney general and the facts of the russia investigation his 2020 campaign is telling supporters in fundraising pitches that attorney general william barr had revealed illegal spying against trump during the 2016 presidential race but it s not true while barr told lawmakers that he believed spying took place he never concluded it was illegal and made clear several times he was not suggesting a crime had occurred meanwhile trump kept up his refrain that special counsel robert mueller had totally exonerated him despite mueller s exact quotes in barr s summary that he did not a redacted version of mueller s full report is expected in the coming days top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots the misstatements were among a number of factual faux pas and flips in rhetoric this past week with his government seeking to prosecute wikileaks founder julian assange trump seemed to draw a blank on a hacking organization he praised to the rafters during the 2016 campaign because of the discomfort it caused his democratic opponent hillary clinton and speaking before monday s tax filing deadline trump seemed to change the grounds upon which he is refusing to release his taxes it s not because he can t but because he doesn t want to a look at the claims russia investigation trump campaign just this week attorney general william barr said what the president has thought all along he believes unlawful spying did occur against donald j trump s presidential campaign fundraising email sent saturday to trump supporters trump campaign ag barr believes the obama admin illegally spied on pres trump text sent friday to trump supporters the facts the email puts words in barr s mouth and seeks to raise money in doing so barr never said there was illegal spying during a senate hearing wednesday the attorney general actually made clear he had no specific evidence to cite that any surveillance was illegal or improper i think spying did occur barr told lawmakers but the question is whether it was adequately predicated and i m not suggesting it wasn t adequately predicated but i need to explore that he later added i am not saying that improper surveillance occurred i am saying that i am concerned about it and looking into it trump i ve been totally exonerated no collusion no obstruction remarks wednesday at the white house trump i m not concerned about anything because frankly there was no collusion and there was no obstruction remarks thursday with south korea s president the facts barr s four page summary of mueller s nearly 400 page report did not totally exonerate trump mueller specifically states in the report as quoted by barr while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime it also does not exonerate him the summary of principal conclusions by barr released in late march notes mueller did not draw a conclusion one way or the other as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction but rather set out evidence for both sides leaving the question unanswered of whether trump obstructed justice barr said ultimately he decided as attorney general that the evidence developed by mueller was not sufficient to establish for the purposes of prosecution that trump committed obstruction in senate testimony wednesday barr acknowledged that mueller did not ask him to draw a conclusion on the obstruction question nor did he know whether mueller agreed with him barr said he would be able to explain more fully after releasing a public version of mueller s report wikileaks trump asked if he still loves wikileaks

assange hung backstage at the republican s debate war room at no point from a rally stage did trump express any misgivings about how wikileaks obtained the emails from the clinton campaign or about the accusations of stealing sensitive u s government information which led to the charges against assange on thursday the u s is seeking assange s extradition from britain asked sunday about trump s claim he knew nothing about wikileaks white house press secretary sarah sanders told fox news the president was making a joke during the campaign and was talking about the specifics of the case at that moment tax returns trump as you know i got elected last time with this same issue i would love to give them but i m not going to do it while i m under audit remarks wednesday to reporters at the white house the facts nothing s preventing trump from releasing his tax returns being under audit is no legal bar to anyone releasing his or her returns asked repeatedly at a house hearing tuesday whether any regulation prohibited a taxpayer from disclosing returns when under audit irs commissioner charles rettig responded no trump declined to provide his tax information as a candidate in 2016 and as president something party nominees have traditionally done in the name of the transparency by withholding his tax returns trump has not followed the standard followed by presidents since

of countries have greater population density it s only full in terms of the people trump doesn t want his claim of a u s with no vacancies for more immigrants is at odds with his own statement two months ago that encouraged the largest influx of legal immigrants ever it also belies a u s reality of aging baby boomers and falling birth rates which make immigrants increasingly important to sustain a level of population growth for the u s economy to keep expanding the nation s population growth is at its lowest since 1937 with the 18 and under population declining both nationally and in 29 states according to william h frey of the brookings institution economists say that restricting immigration would probably weaken economic growth a shrinking labor force could also harm the health and stability of safety net programs such as social security and medicare trump himself seemed to acknowledge the realities during his state of the union address in february declaring i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally he s now describing a u s bursting at the seams unable to take any immigrants including those seeking legal asylum immigrants as a whole make up a greater percentage of the total u s population than they did back in 1970 having grown from less than 5 percent of the population to more than 13 percent now in 2030 it s projected that immigrants will become the primary driver for u s population growth overtaking u s births trump on separating migrant children from their parents when caught crossing into the u s illegally i m the one that stopped it president obama had child separation remarks to reporters tuesday the facts no he s the one who started it on a broad scale he instituted a zero tolerance policy aimed at criminally prosecuting all adults caught crossing into the u s illegally that meant detention for adults and the removal of their children while their parents were in custody during the obama administration and the early trump administration such family separations were the exception they became the rule under his policy he suspended the practice in june because of a public uproar trump on the family separations president obama had the law we changed the law and i think the press should accurately report it but of course they won t remarks to reporters tuesday the facts this is false trump did not achieve any change in the law trump s zero tolerance policy was of his own making his administration is operating under the same immigration laws as obama s during the obama administration and before trump s zero tolerance policy was introduced migrant families caught illegally entering the u s were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings not requiring separation unless they were known to have a criminal record then and now immigration officials may take a child from a parent in certain cases such as serious criminal charges against a parent

many times before trump is crediting himself with things that happened under obama here s what the government s u s energy information administration says the united states has been the world s top producer of natural gas since 2009 when u s natural gas production surpassed that of russia and the world s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013 when u s production exceeded saudi arabia s as for crude oil specifically the information agency says the u s became the world s top crude oil producer last year that is largely attributed to the shale oil boom that began during the obama administration which has sent production from the permian basin in the southwest surging trump under this administration we have ended the war on american energy like never before signing ceremony the facts it wasn t much of a war u s petroleum and natural gas production has increased by nearly 60 since 2008 according to the energy information administration achieving pre eminence during the obama administration that said the trump administration is more closely aligned with fossil fuel interests as it works to restrain environmental obstacles and the power of states to stand in the way of
