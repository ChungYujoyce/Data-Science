v hayden said in an interview in which he criticized beijing s failure to act as a responsible global power mr hayden also criticized china s pursuit of sudanese oil supplies even at the cost of backing a government that the united states accuses of participating in genocidal activities in the darfur region of sudan but in a nuanced appraisal of the asian communist giant mr hayden also expressed professional admiration for the speed and sophistication of its military buildup suggested its behavior is an outgrowth of its historical role in asia and opined it is not inevitable that they will be an enemy top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens chinese communist leaders have not yet stepped up to the responsibility of a major power and so far have failed to understand they actually have some responsibility for the maintenance of the global system mr hayden said tuesday during a meeting with reporters and editors of the washington times when you go and essentially corrupt an island nation in the south pacific with massive infusions of aid no matter how appropriately or inappropriately it will be used and you strangle nascent democracies in their crib by doing so just so you can get that island nation s vote in the general assembly that s pursuing it for a very narrow base mr hayden said if you want to be a great power you ve got be thinking more broadly you cannot be acting just on those kind of narrow considerations on china s support for sudan s government mr hayden said it is only the olympics and the potential embarrassment to come out of the olympics that convinces them to do more of the right thing there than they ve previously done china recently pressed the khartoum government to permit the african union force in darfur to be resupplied a defense official said mr hayden s criticism of chinese international behavior is refreshingly candid he contrasted it with a recent pentagon report on chinese military power that he said was altered by state department and national security council officials to play down similar criticism on chinese activities china s government has sent large amounts of aid to several south pacific states as part of efforts to outflank taiwan which is recognized as being under china s jurisdiction by several island states among the targets of chinese influence buying are the governments of vanuatu samoa fiji and papua new guinea taiwan similarly has used aid to try to win support from small countries for its bid for membership in u n organizations on china s military buildup mr hayden said the modernization of the 7 million member chinese army is impressive and he agreed with recent senate testimony by mike mcconnell director of national intelligence that the buildup is part of china s maturation as a state china today is a competitor but it is not inevitable that china will be our enemy mr hayden said there are a lot of policy choices that they and we can make over the coming year decades and so on that i think can lead us in far more constructive paths mr hayden added the air force general expressed a professional admiration for the buildup of forces i stand back in admiration at how the chinese have constructed built technology integrated the technology trained to the technology modernized their forces opposite taiwan he said and the development or stealing of the technology in order to underwrite that from our perspective it s been a very integrated master plan china s military is accelerating the buildup of its military forces with new weapons systems and technology including computer warfare skills and anti satellite weapons according to a pentagon report made public last week mr hayden said u s intelligence analysts have differing views on the motives behind the buildup which has entailed more than a decade of double digit increases in military spending he also said the buildup appears to have much to do with china s historical role as the dominant power in asia a position it has held for millennia when you sit back and see what they have done in terms of a big military shifting its weight from an army that had little red books and stressed the importance of manpower and political ideology to one that has absorbed the lessons of both gulf wars it is a remarkable remarkable accomplishment he said china s strategic nuclear forces buildup based on numbers of long range missiles does not appear to be a first strike capability mr hayden said meanwhile adm timothy j keating commander of the u s pacific command said at a senate hearing tuesday that military relations with china are growing but that there are miles to go before we sleep in our relationship with china we want a mature constructive cooperative relationship he said we are making progress but as i said we have a long way to go china s military goals include seeking to expand influence throughout the pacific adm keating said they are working all throughout oceania the area that is australia s front porch if you will on through the indian ocean and all the way into internal africa to develop these ports of call so as to provide some it would seem some sort of foothold in the area not just a military port presence so as to be able to protect that which is theirs and to ensure access to those maritime domains adm keating said we are watching that and not necessarily attempting to counter it but just serve as a balance to those countries who are subjected to the chinese pressure offering them some sort of balance on a military basis at
