criticism pelosi she s a waste of time we have not touched upon the details of our cooperation mostly we are focusing on naval cooperation vice foreign minister liu zhenmin told reporters afterward as china and malaysia are both south china sea coastal nations we need to enhance our naval cooperation to ensure peace and stability in the south china sea and enhance our mutual trust he said beijing asserts that virtually all of the south china sea is chinese territory but an international tribunal ruling in july invalidated those sweeping claims china has ignored that ruling six other asian governments also claim part of the south china sea and some observers see it as a potential flashpoint that could spark conflict one day najib is the second leader of a nation with rival territorial claims in the south china sea to visit beijing in two weeks the first philippine president rodrigo duterte played down his country s dispute with china the international tribunal case was initiated by duterte s predecessor and duterte has sought to cast himself as far more conciliatory an approach that appears to have paid off while chinese coast guard ships continue to guard a tiny uninhabited

stolen from the fund and diverted through a web of shell companies and bank accounts in singapore switzerland luxembourg and the united states malaysia s attorney general has defended najib even as his popularity at home has plummeted in recent months james chin director of the asia institute at australia s university of tasmania said najib wants to attract more chinese money to make up for a drop in foreign direct investment from western countries spooked by the scandal he said najib also wants to show that there are still powerful countries around the world that are still willing to give him the five star or red carpet treatment he s showing the malaysian domestic audience that a new upcoming power like china is still willing to host him because it is quite obvious that he can t get the same treatment in western capitals anymore chin said while najib has more riding on the visit the chinese government is also eager to increase its clout with malaysia as it looks to develop its
