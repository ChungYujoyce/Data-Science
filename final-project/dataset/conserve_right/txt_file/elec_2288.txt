national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge what s your pitch to the swing voter on the fence abc s george stephanopoulos asked president trump in an interview that aired sunday questions of this sort are gifts to politicians but interviewers ask them for a couple of reasons one they re civic minded politicians deserve the opportunity to make their cases straightforwardly and voters deserve to hear them second they save time if you give your subject a free shot to get the talking points out of the way you can move on to the more interesting stuff trump s initial answer started off following the standard script he got four words off that must have had his political advisers cheering safety security great economy ideally this is where trump should have stopped talking but the president kept going boasting that he won 52 percent of the women s vote in 2016 he didn t that was the white women s vote he got 41 percent of women overall according to exit polls then trump talked about how the economy would help him with minorities jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription false playlist https cdn

have the economy is phenomenal we ve rebuilt our military we re taking care of our vets we re doing the best job that anybody s done probably as a first term president this was another good place to stop but he was only getting warmed up i have a phony witch hunt which is just a phony pile of stuff mueller comes out there s no collusion and essentially a ruling that no obstruction and then trump was off to the races fighting with stephanopoulos about what the mueller report did or didn t say the facts weren t on trump s side as virtually every news outlet was eager to trumpet but politically that s not the important part impeachment is catnip to the mainstream media and democrats whether trump was set up by the deep state and their dirty dossier is catnip to republicans and right wing media but it seems a fair bet that the swing voters stephanopoulos asked about aren t intoxicated by either topic and that s the problem for trump when you talk to people who think trump will be re elected they point to conventional rules about how a good economy makes voters want to stay the course that s superficially plausible but it leaves out the single most important fact of the political landscape trump s personality a good economy doesn t necessarily speak for itself normal presidents stay on message to deny the press the ability to talk about more interesting stuff the only talking point trump can be counted on to stick to is himself hence his claim to stephanopoulos that no one has been treated worse than him trump doesn t want the election to be about the economy he wants it and everything else to be about him his exchange with stephanopoulos was an analogue of every trump rally he runs through the talking points about the economy or conservative judges as quickly as possible so he can get to the really important topic donald trump the problem for trump is that if the central question of the election is him he will lose because he is not popular the trump campaign s internal polling which was leaked last week showed him trailing joe biden in several must win states by wide margins brad parscale trump s campaign manager said the polls were irrelevant because it was ancient data from last march taken before he was exonerated by the mueller report but trump s post mueller report approval ratings haven t improved trump s sub 50 percent approval rating has had the least variation of any president since world war ii most people have made up their minds about him and most of them don t like him the campaign responded by saying it had fresh data showing solid support from informed voters parscale told abc news that since march we have seen huge swings in the president s favor across the 17 states we have polled based on the policies now espoused by the democrats the key words there are informed voters according to the new york times the polls parscale described were informed ballot polls that described democrats in negative ways before asking about support for trump the common wisdom among pollsters is that if you re citing informed ballot polls you re losing but even taken at face value the meaning of these polls is that some voters could be persuaded to vote for trump if they could be convinced they were voting on issues rather than trump for that to work trump would have to stop acting like trump and make the message about something other than him that s a tall order 2019 tribune content agency llc get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
