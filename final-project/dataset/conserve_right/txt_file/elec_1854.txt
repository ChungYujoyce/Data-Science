the obama campaign made clear this weekend that president obama will be more aggressive in his second debate with mitt romney hinting that he will go after the republican presidential nominee at several angles from women s issues to romney s tax plan and his tenure at bain capital i think he apos s going to be aggressive in making the case for his view of where we should go as a country senior obama campaign adviser david axelrod said on fox news sunday axelrod argued that republican vice presidential nominee rep paul ryan failed during a sept 30 appearance on fox then during his debate last week to detail how romney would pay for his 5 trillion tax plan so we apos re going to give gov romney another chance on tuesday to try and square this impossible circle axelrod said he also said obama plans to be more aggressive and is making adjustments before the debate then seemed to refer to romney apos s investment capital career before entering politics he is a great salesman axelrod said that is what he did as a professional he is very good at it romney campaign adviser ed gillespie said romney will handle the expected attack by doing what he did in the first debate he apos s going to talk about his agenda gillespie said on fox he apos s going to talk about his policies whatever political tactic the president settles on as being in his best interest for the debate he can apos t change his record and can apos t change his policies republican sen rob portman who has played obama during romney s debate rehearsals said sunday he also expects the president to come out swinging the ohio senator told abc s this week such a tactic will be consistent with what the obama campaign has been doing the entire election cycle running a highly negative ad campaign they apos ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars around the country including a lot in ohio mischaracterizing gov romney apos s positions and misrepresenting him he said and i think you apos ll see that again at the debate on tuesday night the debate will be held at hofstra university in long island n y the president has acknowledged giving a lackluster performance during the first debate oct 3 in denver and appears eager to even the score and erase the bounce in polls romney got after his well received effort the final debate is oct 22 in florida just two weeks before election day in a tight race that likely will be decided by who wins in several battleground states including ohio nevada florida and virginia campaign spokeswoman jen psaki this weekend appeared even more clear about where obama would attack gov romney has been making pitches all of his life and he knows how to say what people want to hear whether that was during his time at bain or during the dozens of town halls he did during the primary she said saturday psaki argued ryan left romney vulnerable on the issue of women s health care by failing to explain the tax cut which she said has left female voters worried about their ability to make choices about their own health care on sunday psaki pointed out women apos s health care issues were left out of the first debate which again appeared to suggest obama would raise the topic this time the american people should expect to see a much more energized president obama making a passionate case for why he is a better choice for the middle class she told fox news he will continue to hold mitt romney apos s feet to the fire on the facts about his policies whether that is his 5 trillion tax cut plan that will leave the burden on the middle class his plans to voucherize medicare or his belief that women should not be able to make choices about their own health care obama critics have said that biden apos s aggressive performance against ryan is exactly what the campaign needed however top democrats say the obama campaign realizes that in tuesday apos s debate which will feature actual voters in a town hall format the president has to be careful not to mimic biden too closely or he risks coming across as too negative obama has been hunkering down for three full days of debate prep at a resort in williamsburg va romney practiced for several hours saturday in ohio with portman before making two campaign stops then returning to massachusetts for more practice it apos s no accident that obama chose this battleground of virginia for debate preparations again in the run up to the first debate obama did his prep sessions in nevada which enabled him to visit a campaign office there to thank his volunteers and fire up his base at a large rally in las vegas this time he spent his time holed up at the popular kingsmill resort along the james river which aides say he values for its ability to provide some quiet time his prep sessions took place in the main building of the resort while the president is staying in a house on the campus the sessions consisted of a combination of studying up on what romney and ryan have said in the debates so far and on the campaign trail in addition to actual practice despite the weak performance in denver campaign officials have suggested there has been no major shakeup to the sessions sen john kerry d mass once again playing romney in the mock sessions though there has been at least one minor change ben rhodes a national security aide at the white house has been added to these sessions
