tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn talk radio kingpin rush limbaugh is not overwhelmed by requests to appear on tv news and opinion shows but he is the centerpiece of their discussions most days and talked about nonstop pundits analysts commentators and anchors constantly claim that mr limbaugh is conferring with president trump about policy and strategy and is thus running the country or something like that it is a repeat narrative day in day out and it happens so much that mr limbaugh has compiled a collection of high profile news folk making this claim which sounds like they re all reading from the same set of talking points but something is missing here top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey if these people in the media really thought that i was telling trump what to do they d be asking me about it they would want to get down to the dirty details i haven t had one call i haven t had one inquiry mr limbaugh said in an on camera interview with fox news sunday host chris wallace ah but they have a motive it s just another effort to continue to try to diminish the president to diminish trump as somebody that doesn t know what he s doing can t do it without guidance from the so called wacko right that s not at all the way he s governing and there isn t anybody doing what i do who has a thing to do with actually making policy for this president mr limbaugh declared but one has to wonder why don t the network s seek him out there s a likely reason why all those bookers and producers shy away mr limbaugh has 14 million listeners each day and they hang on his every word seeking to make sense of a caustic alarming political landscape they listen because mr limbaugh has institutional knowledge of the forces that drive politics for better or worse his predictions are often right as is his insight into strategy or why elected officials do crafty things he is a formidable unflinching media presence particularly when talking of the southern u s border we have an emergency this is an invasion the very existence and definition of american culture american society the rule of law why does nobody talk about the fact that millions and millions and millions of people are breaking the law coming here illegally and that the democratic party wants that to happen we can t have the breakdown of rule of law and law and order this way mr limbaugh told mr wallace yes well there may be another reason why the network bookers don t call mr limbaugh they re afraid to 245 non presidential rallies happy

remain upset with president trump s determination to secure the porous border between the u s and mexico and have already garnered 85 000 signatures on a public petition to be delivered to none other
