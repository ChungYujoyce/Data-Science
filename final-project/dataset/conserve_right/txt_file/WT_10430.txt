criminalization increases vulnerability to hiv said cherie hart a spokeswoman for the u n development program undp describing the dangers of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus hiv which

trade has prevented hiv epidemics among sex workers and their clients the report also called for euphemisms the terms prostitution and prostitute have negative connotations and are considered by advocates of sex workers to be stigmatizing said the 210 page report authored by australian human rights lawyer john godwin the term sex work is preferred said the report issued by the undp the u n
