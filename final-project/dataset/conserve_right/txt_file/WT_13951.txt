said the five emphasized that the issue should only be settled through peaceful means and direct dialogue of all the parties concerned they called for comprehensive reform of the u n and the u n security council with a view to making it more representative effective and efficient and to increase the representation of the developing countries so that it can adequately respond to global challenges no proposals on specific reforms were offered china the world s second largest economy wants brics to play a more important role in international affairs but some observers suggest the group s influence is waning given the ongoing political and economic rivalry between china and india and the economic woes faced by brazil russia and south africa in addressing terrorism the declaration named organizations including the pakistan based militant groups lashkar e taiba and jaish e mohammad the islamic state group and al qaida saran said it was the first time there had been a

ally s role in countering terrorism said sreeram chaulia dean of the jindal school of international affairs near new delhi the inclusion of the two pakistan based groups in the declaration shows that india has finally succeeded in persuading all brics members that islamist fundamentalists pose a universal threat chaulia said that came despite comments by chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying on thursday that china did not consider pakistan s counter terrorism efforts to be an appropriate topic at the summit saran said modi and putin discussed oil and gas cooperation and how to promote trade and investment between their two nations xi and modi are expected to hold a meeting on the sidelines of the summit tomorrow the declaration also expressed concern about the haqqani network that is active in afghanistan and the eastern turkistan islamic movement accused by beijing of fomenting unrest in china s northeastern region of xinjiang the declaration said nations should unite to fight terrorist groups in accordance with the principles of international law but emphasized the importance of not interfering in the sovereign affairs of individual states xi announced in
