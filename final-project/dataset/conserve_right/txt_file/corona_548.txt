france is removing all military forces from iraq then nato scaled back its war games in europe because of the pandemic russia reciprocated moscow announced it would cancel its war games along nato s border nations seem to be recognizing and responding to the grim new geostrategic reality of march 2020 the pandemic is the real enemy of us all and while we fight it each in his own national corner we are in this together never allow a serious crisis to go to waste said barack obama s chief of staff rahm emanuel during the financial crisis emanuel was echoed this month by house majority whip rep james clyburn d s c who called the coronavirus crisis a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision what clyburn had in mind is what democrats advanced as their alternative to the 2 2 trillion emergency bill it was designed to force president trump either to swallow it whole or to take responsibility for vetoing a critical transfusion of federal funds to keep the economy alive among the items stuffed in the democrats proposal a 15 an hour minimum wage imposed on companies receiving funds blanket loan forgiveness of 10 000 for students new tax credits for solar and wind energy full funding of planned parenthood federal dollars for fetal tissue research 300 million for pbs which has been promoting the lbgt agenda to school kids mandating diversity on corporate boards as a condition of companies receiving funds election reforms to increase democratic turnout insistence that airlines to get a bailout offset carbon emissions from jet engines 35 million for the kennedy center majority leader sen mitch mcconnell r ky and congressional republicans ash canned almost the leftist wish list but trump should go further turn the tables and seize this crisis to do what he was elected to do impose a new foreign policy isolate america not from the world but from the world s wars the new york times and washington post editorialized thursday for an easing of the economic sanctions we have imposed on iran this would be a humanitarian gesture when iran is suffering more than any country in the mideast from the virus more than that it would be a statement that america is not at war with the iranian people this unilateral gesture by trump asking nothing in return except negotiations would put the onus for iran s isolation squarely with the ayatollah and his regime as for vladimir putin s cancellation of war games in response to nato s cancellation trump could seize upon this as an opening to engage russia as candidate trump promised to do does anyone believe putin wants a war with nato should he do so does anyone think italy and spain two of the largest nato allies but both suffering greatly in the coronavirus crisis would invoke article v and declare war on russia when hitler was our foe america created a wartime alliance with stalin in the common cause of crushing the axis powers liberals and leftists yet defend the popular front between the democracies and stalin if we could unite with bolsheviks to defeat nazis surely we can join with iran s rulers to cope with and crush the coronavirus when if ever will there be a better time to make good on trump s campaign pledge to extricate america from the wars in syria iraq and afghanistan consider also the korean peninsula kim jong un has been testing rockets again over the sea of japan transfixed by the coronavirus crisis however the world is paying him no attention we should make a final offer to kim jong un to pull our u s forces from south korea and lift sanctions for verifiable reductions and restraints on his nuclear arsenal we are ready for a deal but if pyongyang refuses to talk we should tell him we are going home and are allowing south korea and japan to develop their own nuclear weapons and let kim deal with them the coronavirus pandemic is the greatest crisis since the cuban missile confrontation of 1962 after that crisis john f kennedy sought to use the world s brush with armageddon to establish a detente with the soviet union of the communist dictator who had put the missiles in cuba following our cold war victory we have not done that instead we plunged into wars that were none of our business to deal with imagined threats and advance utopian causes like establishing jeffersonian democracy in lands where tribalism and dogmatism are rooted in the very soil the coronavirus is the enemy saddam hussein never was and the ayatollahs never had tens of millions of americans sheltering in place what the coronavirus crisis tells us is not that we should turn our backs on the world but that in engaging with the world we should put our own interests first as every nation in the world is doing now patrick buchanan has been an adviser to three presidents a two time candidate for the republican presidential nomination and the nominee for the reform party in 2000 he was also a founding member of the mclaughlin group which began on nbc
