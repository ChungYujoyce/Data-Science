secution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic when the best table tennis player in north america is ranked 149th in the world and that player is canadian it means that any american player with hopes of qualifying for this year s london olympics really is just playing for the chance to get a first hand view of the olympic experience that s a major accomplishment of course but it also means american table tennis players have to treat their sport with a little less medal fever and a little more objectivity for us the end goal is just participating said han xiao 25 of germantown md if you could win a match it would be amazing top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed the best case scenario is that the u s will send three men to london xiao hopes to be one of them but he ll need to finish in the top four at the american trials next month in cary n c and then win one of three spots available to north americans in a showdown with canada in april xiao who was born in china but came to the u s as a toddler picked up the sport as a boy and quickly progressed to the point that he spent his teenage years traveling to the pan am games and multiple world championships he won three national titles in doubles and was named the sport s u s player of the year at 15 he was a prodigy and served as the poster boy for a new generation of players that was raised in the american system instead of imports from china or other countries who became american citizens he was so highly regarded in fact the washington post magazine wrote a cover story on him titled the golden child in 2007 that chronicled his preparation for the tournaments that served as qualifiers for the beijing olympics xiao was at his peak then but still lost a seven game match for the final north american olympic berth to david zhuang a chinese import american who was in his 40s sitting at a table in the maryland table tennis center in gaithersburg just before christmas xiao described the 2008 match as a psychological battle won by zhuang due to a mix of maturity and gamesmanship the umpiring wasn t good i wasn t as experienced as he was there was a let service that kind of messed with my rhythm he said ticking off a list of things that went wrong i came back but it wasn t quite enough he beat me 11 8 in the seventh game but the loss wasn t a major setback xiao got on with his life and graduated from the university of maryland later that year with dual degrees in computer science and business i have been focusing on my job and career said xiao of the past four years table tennis is a smaller sport you can t really make money doing it he s dedicated himself to learning the computer programming business working on what he calls big data cloud type stuff perhaps applying the same principles to his career that made a teenage table tennis star he doesn t flaunt his pingpong prowess most of the people he works with at texeltek in columbia don t even know he s one of the top players in the country he avoids comet ping pong the d c pizza parlor where patrons kill time after ordering by playing pingpong if he s not playing with someone of his caliber he s generally not playing it s not a party trick if i m somewhere there s a pingpong table and some cheap rackets i ll avoid it he said i know as soon as i get on there i won t be able to get off the table so i just avoid it i don t even mention that i know how to play in fact xiao has become involved in growing the sport as a member of usa table tennis board of directors and most of his matches the past few years have been with serious up and coming youth players such as tong tong gong 14 of ellicott city he s also served as a practice partner for peter li 18 of scaggsville it wasn t even until a few weeks before the u s national championship event in early december that xiao began to put in some serious training part of being competitive he said over the steady rhythm of balls being hit back and forth at the table tennis center is that i was tired of being terrible by my standards at the game so even if i didn t try out for the olympics i wanted to try to get back to somewhere close to where i was before while practicing with gong and li xiao realized he might be good enough to make some noise at the national event but he didn t even commit to playing until he did well at a small tournament thanksgiving weekend so he made his way to virginia beach and proceeded to win the doubles national title with timothy wang which set him up for a run to the national singles final where he lost 4 0 to li we say the scaggsville table tennis center li s basement might be the best in the country because it produced two finalists at nationals xiao said with a laugh the runner up finish secured xiao a spot in the american top 10 which qualified him automatically for the u s singles trials event feb 10 12 in north carolina the top four finishers from that event will qualify for the continental trials back in cary in april li who has been training with a provincial club team in fouzhou china for the past 30 days said yiyong fan the top ranked american who also is training for the trials in china should get one of the continental berths among the next nine it s a toss up as to who might make it there s no player who s dominant over everyone else li said in a skype call when we play it will probably be a big mess i don t think anyone will have a clean record maryland based hall of famer larry hodges said xiao has as good a chance of any of those players to advance to the next round one advantage he has is experience hodges said he has one of the two best backhands in the country and i think he was spurred on by how well he did at nationals li who knows xiao s game better than anyone else agreed he s got a special gift li said of xiao s backhand loop most u s players are trying to avoid letting him have that shot he s probably the most talented homegrown american player in the field but because he hasn t been playing full time for the past six months like some of his competitors xiao only puts his odds of getting through to the continental qualifier at about 50 50 i m going to try to do my best there and not think about anything else he said when i m there i m just thinking about a point at a time but would xiao feel guilty about making it out of next month s tournament when he s only been seriously training since october i ve always prided myself on training smart and being really cerebral about it rather than making it a grind i get bored easily he said i would feel a little bit guilty but at the end everybody has the same opportunity to make it it s just if i work smarter than you for five months i d feel proud i could
