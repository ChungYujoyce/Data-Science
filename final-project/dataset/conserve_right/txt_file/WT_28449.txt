tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn house speaker nancy pelosi insisted wednesday her newfound focus on impeachment won t prevent democrats from tackling the big issues they promised voters in last year s elections but president trump said there s fat chance of that mrs pelosi kicked off her weekly press conference by ticking off the agenda items she says she still wants to pursue this year including a bill to give the government a greater role in setting prescription drug prices and negotiations over a trade deal she has kept in limbo for months but even she made clear her focus was impeachment bringing one of her top investigative lieutenants intelligence committee chairman adam b schiff to the press conference to deliver an update on democrats efforts to oust mr trump top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick we feel a real sense of urgency here mr schiff said of the impeachment inquiry which mrs pelosi unilaterally announced last week and which is now the work of multiple committees mrs pelosi insisted the impeachment effort can be kept separate from democrats day jobs they have nothing to do with each other she said she said her caucus members who are home for a two week vacation are supposed to be talking with constituents about the prescription drug price bill and she said that will be the top legislative business when congress returns the california democrat said she also wants to revive negotiations on an infrastructure package those collapsed this year when mr trump furious are a previous round of house investigations walked out of a meeting with mrs pelosi and senate minority leader charles e schumer mrs pelosi said ground is quietly being gained on the u s mexico canada free trade deal mr trump negotiated though the speaker has blocked a vote for months she insisted wednesday that her side is trading offers with the administration the quiet you hear is progress she said mr trump tweeted that mrs pelosi was creating a smoke screen by talking about drug prices and trade deals she is incapable of working on either he tweeted it is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment the do nothing democrats are stuck in mud he warned democrats in his state of the union address in february that they had to make a choice if there is going to be peace and legislation there cannot be war and investigation it just doesn t work that way he said democrats have tried anyway but they ve been far less successful on the legislative front passing a torrent of liberal wish list items through their chamber only to see them bottled up in the republican controlled senate perhaps the most consequential bill to pass this year has been an emergency border funding bill which was written in the senate and was forced on mrs pelosi and her caucus mr trump s approach saying he can t work with a party that is trying to oust him is starkly different from the way president bill clinton handled impeachment in 1998 and 1999 mr clinton went about his business as if impeachment wasn t happening making the case that he had a job to do as president and would do it no matter what congress was interested in polls taken in the days since mrs pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry show most americans don t expect mrs pelosi to make good on her claim that she can legislate and investigate at the same time one cbs survey found 58 said congress will be too distracted to make headway on bills before they left for the two week vacation some house democrats feared that eventuality this is going to suck all the oxygen out of the room said rep jeff van drew a new jersey democrat it is the focus of the media it is the focus of the legislature it is the focus of just about everyone in washington mr van drew who opposes impeachment though he doesn t object to the investigations said his constituents rarely approach him urging impeachment and said
