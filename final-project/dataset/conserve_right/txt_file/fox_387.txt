to admit to breaking the logan act when he spoketo russia aposs then ambassador sergey kislyak during the presidential transition period the logan act has never been successfully used in a criminal prosecution and has a questionable constitutional status itwasenacted in 1799 in an era before telephones and was intended to prevent individuals from falsely claiming to represent the united states government abroad priestap aposs memo conspicuously surfaced only this month even though the justice department and fbi had been under an obligation to turn over all relevant potentially exculpatory materials to flynn aposs legal team since february 2018 attorney general bill barr had appointedu s attorney jeff jensen to review the doj aposs handling of the flynn case and jensen apparently unearthed the documents obama knew details of flynn case shocking top doj official docs show meanwhile top doj prosecutor who had repeatedly told the court that the fbi had complied with the order to turn over exculpatory materials brandon van grack was abruptly pulled from the flynn case after fox news pointed out his apparent misrepresentations where is christopher wray jordan tweeted monday night where is christopher wray flynn ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of lying to pientka and anti trump fbi agent peter strzok in that white house interview as his mounting legal bills forced him to sell his home and prosecutors floated bringing foreign agents registration act fara charges for his unrelated work in turkey flynn is now seeking to withdraw his guilty plea and the doj has agreed that the case should be dismissed citing the new exculpatory evidence d c district court judge emmet sullivan however has indicated he may not dismiss the casewithout hearing more argument from third parties sullivanpreviously suggestedflynn may have committed treason in a bizarre 2018 courtroom outburst and seemingly confused key details about flynn aposs overseas lobbying work more recently sullivan has suggested he isn apost bothered by the fbi aposs missing fd 302 witness report of agents apos january 24 2017 white house interview with flynn that comey has previously said was prepared within days of the interview as required by policy t hings happen and documents are lost sullivan stated i mean it just happens former fbi swat agent james gaglianocalled that a shockingly cavalier reactionby sullivan gagliano who initially defended the fbi aposs flynn probe has more recentlysaid flynn was railroaded after this month aposs bombshell revelations during the white house interview flynn told the agents not really when asked if he had sought to convince kislyak not to escalate a brewing fight with the u s over sanctions imposed by the obama administration according to a later contested fd 302 witness report prepared by the fbi weeks after the interview flynn also reportedly demurred when asked if he had asked russia to veto a u n security council resolution that condemned israel s settlements in the west bank flynn issued other apparently equivocal responses to fbi agents apos questions and at various points suggested that such conversations might have happened or that he could not recall them if they did according to the 302 but questions remained as to the strength of the fbi aposs case then fbi director james comey admitted in 2018 that the flynn interview at the white house didn apost follow protocol and came at his direction he said it was something i probably wouldn apost have done or maybe gotten away with in a more organized administration and then fbi deputy director andrew mccabe later said the interview was very odd because it seemed like flynn was telling the truth to the two agents who interviewed him flynn the interviewing agents told mccabe had a very good recollection of events which he related chronologically and lucidly did not appear to be nervous or sweating and did not look side to side all of which would have been behavioral signs of deception further the fbi 302 indicated that flynn apparently was aware his communications had been monitored and at several points he thanks the fbi agents for reminding him of some of his conversations with russian officials a washington post article published one day before flynn aposs white house interview with the agents citing fbi sources publicly revealed that the fbi had wiretapped flynn aposs calls with kislyak and cleared him of any criminal conduct it was unclear who leaked that information to the post or why the fbi would need to question flynn about his contacts given that the bureau had already recorded them file in this june 7 2017 file photo then fbi acting director andrew mccabe listens during a senate intelligence committee
