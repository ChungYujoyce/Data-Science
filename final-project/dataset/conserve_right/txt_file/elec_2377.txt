trump can do anything to women because he s powerful hillary clinton s private positions aren t the same as her public ones in public politicians mostly get away with spouting talking points and clamming up about questions that really matter when clinton was asked if she agrees with trump s approach to terrorism and immigration she confidently replied this is a serious challenge we are well equipped to meet it and we can do so in keeping with smart law enforcement good intelligence and in concert with our values that s meaningless do we have dumb law enforcement now bad intelligence what will clinton do about it she doesn t say reporters don t ask when trump was asked how he ll handle terrorism he replied i am very unhappy when i look at the world of radical islam i m very unhappy with it we re going to find the problem and we re going to come up with a solution obama could never come up with a solution number one he s incompetent and number two the solution just is never going to be out there for him trump wants us to trust that he has the solutions he ll give us details later i guess the media should talk more about the clintons foundation it s raised billions but gives little to outside charities a measly 6 percent of their assets according to the foundation s last filing it s apparently a pay to play operation donors get meetings with clinton clinton family cronies get well paid jobs neither candidate wants us looking too closely at their financial records but both leading candidates say we should trust them with money and power clinton promises more than 1 trillion in new investments free day care maternity leave an expansion of obamacare more funding for veterans new solar subsidies new bridges and tunnels and college tuition free then she says we re not only going to make all these investments we re going to pay for every single one of them but that s absurd sometimes she says money will come from new taxes on the rich but america s rich aren t rich enough to fund her grand schemes even if they were they d move out of the country or use tricks to evade her high taxes even the new york times admits that clinton s tax plan adds so many new layers of complexity that it would be a huge boon for tax lawyers trump is as bad promising tax cuts and new spending on the military infrastructure and that giant wall other than promising that mexico will pay it won t he never says where he ll get the funds the biggest chunk of america s budget is entitlements medicare social security medicaid trump never talks about making those benefits sustainable in fact he says he won t touch social security clinton rarely talks about entitlements at all since we re 20 trillion in debt you d think journalists would press candidates to explain how they ll pay the bills but they don t so the candidates talk and talk and there is so much they don t say neither candidate will say much about how huge government bureaucracy has gotten they never talk about the constitution and what it says presidents cannot do they almost never talk about the horrible violence that drug prohibition causes instead we get promises trump will make american great again clinton will get your kids the opportunities they deserve platitudes but voters prefer them to ugly truths if you look at the details you realize the candidates can t be trusted to do very much our government is already broke someone should level with the public about that instead of promising new free stuff both leading candidates hide from the truth it s one more reason i ll vote libertarian gary johnson has looked dumb when he s been asked about foreign affairs but he does say what needs to be said about social security medicare our ruinous debt and the limits of government those are not popular things to talk about but presidential candidates ought to talk about them anyway copyright 2016 by jfs productions inc advertisement next drug sentences will never be fair john

tells the truth will lose to the candidate promising to be santa claus hillary s private position is always doggie style with two bags if you guys are really board robert the great found a stupid video about teaching consent https www youtube com watch v pcjtqou 67o i m feeling more like plywood than board so i think i will pass sounds like personal problem you pulled a john are you doubling down or did you just miss it wood feeling is a very personal matter i m going to log my complaint about this sub thread hear please sloopy just leaf it anywhere you like i ll lend you my ear lumbers by looks at discussion this whole thread has gone to seed i pine for an edit button 1 colorado kool aid i don t think these wood puns are going to be very poplar it is obvious that america will not willingly solve its debt problems they are guaranteed to crush us people will be amazed at how far the us can fall people willl be shocked at how cruel the world will be to us when that happens the politicians who guarantee this fate will be so surprised when the inevitable happens they ve done everything to make it worse and nothing to make it better resigning in disgrace would be too kind a fate for them ritual suicide for their wrongdoings would be admirable but they have no honor and will cling to their power to the very end we have been betrayed by our supposed elite leaders they are the most despicable people imaginable we don t have leaders we have rulers rulers are by definition despicable and they always betray the people thus history repeats itself yeah the tree of liberty is looking pretty rough it may need a good watering the tree of liberty died a long time ago i kept a few seeds let s burn the progressive fields to the last of them and replant the liberty seeds it need a good pruning a purge good more people finally ready to euthanize all the progtards we don t have leaders that s actually a good thing i don t need a leader i know where i m going i ll vote for the first politician who says that he just wants to be the hired help resigning in disgrace would be too kind a fate for them ritual suicide for their wrongdoings would be admirable but they have no honor and will cling to their power to the very end most of them deserve no less than the full mussolini treatment instead of giving foreign aid we should demand tribute then lay off the debt with the tribute shorter stossel politicians know that you can t handle the truth or that m any are too lazy to listen to it which fits when i try to discuss facts and analysis of said facts with average people their eyes tend to glaze over like a donut although donuts are tastier america would solve its debt problems if it had politicians and a media who didn t spend every waking moment thinking of way to divide it by race and various bullshit culture lines it is almost as if they use those issues to keep that from happening or something unfortunately the masses keep watching those media types and voting for those politicians i do appreciate stossel noting an evergreen leftist tactic calling their preferred policy smart smart power smart diplomacy smart growth smart law enforcement who are they try to convince us or themselves if you have to constantly remind people how smart you are perhaps you really aren t that smart to begin with it s like the rule to never trust a piece of legislation that has freedom justice patriot or child in the title but they both know where aleppo is and can name a world leader the admire that s all that matters 1 indefinite article and we can do so in concert with our values what are these values of which you speak gary johnson has looked dumb when he s been asked about foreign affairs i don t see that either hillary or trump has looked one bit smarter but voters prefer them to ugly truths so true so sad stop you re listening to rush a tad too much stossel you ve got plenty to complain about clinton but the foundation s work isn t one of them 6 try closer to 90 at least as rated by the most trusted rating organizations for charities you should read politifact when they took priebus to task for using a number around 20 http www politifact com trut ndation c from politifact the clinton foundation is an excellent charity charity watch president daniel borochoff said aug 24 2016 on cnn they are able to get 88 percent of their spending to bona fide program services and their fundraising efficiency is really low it only costs them 2 to raise 100 88 according th charity watch http www charitywatch org ra dation 478 wrong

us capabilities otoh clinton as secstate had all that and still doesn t have any real solution she s going to do business as usual the pc leftist route btw trump is smart to not detail what he d do because then the left begins maneuvering to derail or block what he d do sabotage him even at the expense of america i hate to admit it but your right o bama did the same thing and won details don t matter when likability is in play i m convinced most voters make up their minds from second hand news at either the water cooler or government trough as ralph explained i m shocked that anyone can
