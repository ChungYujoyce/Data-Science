business leaders told him they need more coronavirus testing and personal protective equipment before people can safely go back to work the industry executives cautioned trump that the return to normalcy will be anything but swift the new guidelines expected to be announced thursday are aimed at clearing the way for an easing of restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus

news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time we ll be opening some states much sooner than others trump said wednesday but in a round of calls with business leaders earlier in the day trump was warned that a dramatic increasing in testing and wider availability of protective equipment will be necessary for the safe restoration of their operations the new guidelines come as the federal government envisions a gradual recovery from the virus in which disruptive mitigation measures may be needed in some places at least until a vaccine is available a milestone unlikely to be reached until next year trump said at his daily briefing that data indicates the u s is past the peak of the covid 19 epidemic clearing the way for his plans to roll out guidelines to begin to reopen the country he called the latest data encouraging saying the numbers have put us in a very strong position to finalize guidelines for states on reopening the country dr deborah birx the white house coronavirus task force coordinator added that data from across the country showed the nation improving but that americans had to recommit to social distancing to keep up the positive momentum she said nine states have fewer than 1 000 cases and just a few dozen new cases per day she said those would likely be the first to see a lifting in social distancing restrictions at the direction of their governors under the guidelines set to be released thursday birx said the white house was particularly concerned

reopening businesses in phases or in one fell swoop the participant said those on the call noted to the administration that there was about to be a massive rush on personal protective equipment many businesses that are now shuttered will need the protective equipment to keep their employees and customers safe trump was told the economy will look very different and operations will look very different one participant said mark cuban the billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the dallas mavericks was among several representatives from major sports leagues to speak with trump during a fox news channel interview ahead of the calls he credited the president with gathering some of the best of the best to help shape his approach on reopening the economy still cuban did not embrace trump s push to reopen parts of the economy may 1 this is such a moving target that i think the biggest mistake we can make is rush to a decision said cuban who previously had been critical of trump s response to the pandemic but i m going to help him in every way i can whatever he needs me to do the panel which trump dubbed the new great american economic revival industry groups also could help give trump a measure of cover if cases surge once restrictions are lifted as many experts have warned trump will be able to tell the public he didn t act alone and the nation s top minds from
