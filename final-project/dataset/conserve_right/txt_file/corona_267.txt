we have to get back to work taking questions before trump vice president mike pence said the administration isnot considering a nationwide coronavirus lockdown like some states and cities have taken i can tell you that at no point has the white house coronavirus task force discussed what some people call a nationwide lockdown or as you describe a stay at home order pence said pence also noted thatthe federal government sent 2 000 ventilators from the national stockpile to the state of new york which has become the epicenter of coronavirus in the u s and vowed to send 2 000 more on

the other is just not helpful fauci said during the rose garden interview trump also called on the senate to pass a massive stimulus bill that is currently being debated between senate minority leader chuck schumer d n y and treasury secretary steve mnuchin the president blamed house speaker nancy pelosi d calif for demanding a number of additional stipulations to the bill for the delay in its
