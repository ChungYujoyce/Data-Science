apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap more americans approve of the impeachment investigation into president trump than disapprove of it though only about a third say the inquiry should be a top priority for congress according to a new poll from the associated press norc center for public affairs research that solid if measured support serves as a warning sign for trump s white house and reelection campaign which have insisted that pursuing impeachment will end up being a vulnerability for democrats heading into 2020 but the findings present some red flags for democrats too more people say house members are motivated mainly by politics rather than by duty as they investigate the republican president s dealings with ukraine and whether he abused his office or compromised national security when he tried to pressure the country to dig up dirt on a political rival top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century and assessments of the president s performance generally have remained remarkably stable even as the investigation has unfolded at a rapid clip overall 47 said they support the impeachment inquiry while 38 disapprove like most assessments of trump and washington views of impeachment are starkly polarized a vast majority of democrats approve of the inquiry including 68 who strongly approve among them is sandra shrewsbury 70 who lives in greencastle indiana she said that trump s impeachment is long overdue i am really concerned about our country if this does not stop she said of trump s time in office she voiced concerns that trump doesn t have the temperament to be the nation s commander in chief and is doing serious damage to the country s standing she was relieved she said that after months of hemming and hawing impeachment proceedings were finally underway i was getting very frustrated with congress and those investigating because i felt like they were just dragging their heels she said i wish they d stop worrying about getting reelected themselves and get down to the business they re supposed to be doing we pay them to do this job they should have done it a long time a way long time ago agreed monica galindo 32 who lives in camilla georgia it s another story among republicans who overwhelmingly disapprove of the inquiry including 67 who do so strongly i think its garbage said sara palmer 42 a staunch trump supporter who lives in pocatello idaho and accused democrats of wasting time and money trying to take down trump when there are far more important things they should be doing for the country i mean come on she said there s nothing there he didn t do anything wrong that s a sentiment shared by a majority 64 of republicans yet even among members of trump s party a modest share think he did do something wrong about a quarter 28 think he did something unethical while 8 think he broke the law the public overall has mixed views of whether the president committed any wrongdoing most say his interactions with the president of ukraine were at least unethical that includes about 4 in 10 who think he did something illegal about another 3 in 10 think what he did was unethical but not illegal trump has insisted he did nothing wrong but nearly all democrats think the president crossed a line including roughly 7 in 10 who say that he broke the law still not all democrats think the inquiry should be congress top priority a quarter think it should be an important but lower priority and 1 in 10 say it should not be an important priority at all and while most democrats support the inquiry 27 think the house is acting mainly on political motivation to challenge trump s presidency even as americans express strong opinions about the inquiry many have mixed assessments of their own understanding of the impeachment process just about 3 in 10 say they understand the process very or extremely well while roughly as many describe their understanding as limited skylar iske 22 who voted for trump in 2016 but has grown weary of him said it was difficult for him to oppose the process given his limited awareness of the case for impeachment i don t feel like he should be but then again i also don t know what they re investigating said iske who lives outside des moines iowa and there are rare areas where republicans and democrats actually agree majorities across party lines
