ould be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion president obama s most recent visit to asia probably struck many americans as simply the latest round of executive level diplomacy basically the kind of trip abroad that chief executives have been making for decades he s been to the region six times as president after all not much different than president bush at a comparable point in his presidency there was more to it than that though the unstated mission seemed to be to reassure our nervous allies that we remain committed to their security and that we re ready willing and able to defend them against escalating threats unfortunately it s not hard to see why our allies and friends in japan south korea malaysia and the philippines the four countries the president visited would need such a message top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey for one thing china has been aggressively asserting its sovereignty using its military to try to enforce specious claims to territory throughout the east china sea and south china sea this explains why for example mr obama made a point of saying that the senkaku islands fall under the defense treaty between the united states and japan let me reiterate that our treaty commitment to japan s security is absolute and article 5 of the bilateral security treaty covers all territories under japan s administration including the senkaku islands the president said during a news conference with japanese prime minister shinzo abe though this marked the first time a president had expressly pointed out that the treaty covers the islands it was hardly a new message during a flare up of tensions between china and japan over the senkakus in 2010 then secretary of state hillary clinton noted that the islands are part of our mutual treaty obligations in 2004 former deputy secretary of state richard armitage made the same point yet it was necessary to say it again mr obama also gave clear public statements in support of our treaty commitments to the philippines forging a deal that will result in a greater u s military presence at philippine bases and signed up malaysia to a bush era program known as the proliferation security initiative it s not just china s latest round of bellicose behavior that led to such reassurances troubling cuts in the u s defense budget especially in the wake of last year s sequestration haven t gone unnoticed by our allies they can count warships and bombs as easily as the rest of us and they aren t happy about what they re seeing well before sequestration writes asia expert bruce klingner it was clear that the administration was underfunding defense requirements in a way that would undercut its commitments he points out the fact that the navy s shipbuilding budget has been too low for years resulting in fewer vessels than we need to fulfill our obligations in asia and elsewhere gen john m paxton jr assistant commandant of the marine corps asked in a recent speech do we have enough people and enough ships to do it the answer was clearly no the asia pivot or rebalance has always been more hype than reality mr klinger adds the policy is a sound one only if sufficient resources are devoted to deploy the requisite military forces in the pacific so if reassurances were needed the obama administration has itself to blame the most successful part of the trip soothing our worried allies shouldn t have been necessary the trip wasn t solely about security however it was also supposed to be about free trade the president however failed to get an agreement with japan on the trans pacific partnership which is meant to expand trade in the asia pacific region expanding economic freedom there and elsewhere requires strong presidential leadership but his track record on this issue isn t nearly good enough mr obama is good at campaigning though and that s exactly what his administration s the u s is back in asia sounds like feel good sloganeering the fact is the united states never left asia however unless we fully fund our defense commitments and get serious about promoting economic freedom we might as well have doing those things though takes true leadership right now our allies in asia aren t the only ones who need reassurances on that score ed feulner is founder of the heritage foundation her
