challenges overseas from allies saudi arabia and adversaries like north korea we sat down with mr trump friday in the roosevelt room just across from the oval office hoping to explore a presidency at a turning point begin videotape wallace mr president thank you for talking with us trump thank you chris very much wallace let aposs start with the state of donald trump trump right wallace there are a number of stories out there that you aposre angry about the mid terms about your treatment in the media about the way you were treated when you were in paris one story even said that you were in a quote cocoon of bitterness and resentment trump right wallace we aposll get in to all the details later but how dark is your mood trump it aposs very light it aposs fake news it aposs disgusting fake news i read a front page here in the washington post they never even called me nobody ever calls me you know they hear i don apost even think they have sources i think they just make it up like it aposs fiction and i will tell you i aposm extremely upbeat the white house is running like a well oiled machine it aposs doing really well i have great people i will make some changes but not very many i aposm very happy with my cabinet other than you know a couple of exceptions and even then i aposm not unhappy and i will tell you that it aposs so wrong the reporting about me is so wrong i aposm loving what i aposm doing i did well in france i did have a problem where i wasn apost able to go to a cemetery because the secret service would not let me do it wallace we aposll get in to all of this in trump no but i aposm just saying the secret service would not let me do it and they made it a big deal wallace you said a lot of things there let aposs try to unpack them there aposs a lot of talk about staff changes your deputy national security advisor was moved out after your wife did something i aposve never heard of a first lady doing before publicly calling for her removal are you comfortable with the way that went down where it kind of looked like your wife was firing one of your advisors trump well i didn apost know the advisor well really and i know they had a lot of problems my wife did a great job in africa and she was not treated properly by the press she really worked so hard they came to me they wanted to go a little bit public because that aposs the way they felt and i thought it was fine i met with mira two days ago and we aposre going to move her around she was with me for a long time although i don apost know her she aposs really somebody i don apost know very well but we aposre going to move her around because she aposs got certain talents but frankly she is not she aposll never be put in the united nations let me put it that way wallace meaning she aposs not too diplomatic trump she aposs not too diplomatic but she aposs talented wallace are you happy with kirstjen nielsen at dhs trump well i like her a lot i respect her a lot she aposs very smart i want her to get much tougher and we aposll see what happens there but i want to be extremely tough wallace what are the chances she aposll be dhs secretary trump well there aposs a chance but there aposs a chance everybody i mean that aposs what happens in government you leave you make a name you go the people that have left have done very well the people that have left have done very well from my white house i like her very much i respect her very much i aposd like her to be much tougher on the border much tougher period wallace back in july you said that chief of staff john kelly will be here through 2020 trump well wallace can you still say that trump we i wouldn apost look we get along well there are certain things i love what he does and there are certain things that i don apost like that he does that aren apost his strength it aposs not that he doesn apost do you know he works so hard he aposs doing an excellent job in many ways there are a couple of things where it aposs just not his strength it aposs not his fault it aposs not his strength wallace such as trump but i haven apost even thought about john in terms of this but john at some point is going to want to move on john will move on wallace so 2020 is no longer written in stone trump it could happen yes it could i mean it could be but let aposs see what happens i have not look i have three or four or five positions that i aposm thinking about of that maybe it aposs going to end up being two maybe but i want to i need flexibility wallace you have already made at least one big change naming matt whitaker as your acting trump yes wallace attorney general he has a long record of speaking out against the special counsel and his probe begin video clip matt whitaker acting attorney general i could see a scenario where jeff sessions is replaced in a recess appointment and that attorney general doesn apost fire bob mueller but he just reduces the budget so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt the truth is there was no collusion with the russians and the trump campaign end video clip wallace did you know before you appointed him that he had that record and was so critical of robert mueller trump i did not know that i did not know he took views on the mueller investigation as such wallace and when you found that out trump i don apost think it had any effect if you look at those statements those statements that can they really can be viewed really either way but i don apost think will have anything crosstalk allace well he says there aposs no collusion and he says trump chris i aposll tell you what crosstalk wallace he says you can starve the investigation trump what do you do when a person aposs right there is no collusion he happened to be right i mean he said it so if he said there is collusion i aposm supposed to be taking somebody that says there is because then i wouldn apost take him for two reasons but the number one reason is the fact that he would have been wrong if he said that there aposs no collusion he aposs right wallace he is going to have to make or could potentially make a lot of big calls in the mueller investigation if mueller decides that he wants to subpoena you the attorney general whitaker can block that if mueller issues a final report he can decide how much goes to congress or doesn apost go to congress you tweeted this week about quote bob mueller and his gang of democrat thugs trump right wallace if whitaker decides in any way to limit or curtail the mueller investigation are you ok with that trump look he it aposs going to be up to him i think he aposs very well aware politically i think he aposs astute politically he aposs a very smart person a very respected person he aposs going to do what aposs right i really believe he aposs going to do what aposs right wallace but you won apost overrule him if he decides to curtail trump i would not get involved and all these people that say i aposm going to end the investigation you know they aposve been saying that now for how long has this witch hunt gone on it aposs gone on for what wallace since may of apos17 trump ok but how long have i been looked at you know when i aposve been looked at from the day i wallace since july of 2016 trump from the day i announced i was looked at as a candidate with nothing no proof with phony people like mccabe and strzok and his lover you had lisa page his lover these people were looking at me they wanted an insurance policy just in case i won or hillary lost and this was the insurance policy it aposs a scam there was no collusion whatsoever and the whole thing is a scam wallace your team is preparing written answers to questions about trump no no no not my team i aposm preparing written answers my i i aposm the one that does the answering yes are they writing them out wallace yes trump yes they aposre writing what i tell them to write wallace are they going to be submitted trump at some point very soon yes i aposve completed them wallace so you aposre you are submitting trump and it wasn apost a big deal by the way it wasn apost a big deal the answers the questions were asked and answered it wasn apost a big deal you know they make it like i had meetings for many many hours i got the questions i responded we read them out i read them once i read them a second time we made some changes that aposs it they aposre very simple wallace ok trump you know why i did nothing wrong wallace here aposs my question though you were submitting written answers trump yes wallace to the special counsel about the issue of collusion but not on obstruction of justice trump well there was no obstruction of justice wallace i i aposm let me if i may sir just ask trump i think they aposd probably agree with me crosstalk wallace is that your final position that there aposs going to be no sit down interview and nothing written or in person on obstruction trump i would say probably probably i mean i can change my mind but probably i think we aposve wallace no crosstalk trump i think we aposve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably we aposre finished crosstalk wallace what are the odds one in a hundred what trump i don apost do odds we would i gave very wallace you ran a casino sir trump you aposre right and very successfully actually we gave very very complete answers to a lot of questions that i shouldn apost have even be asked and i think that should solve the problem i hope it solves the problem if it doesn apost you know i aposll be told and we aposll make a decision at that time but probably this is the end wallace turkish president erdogan says that he has shared a tape with the u s and other countries that is of the killing of jamal khashoggi inside the saudi consulate in istanbul trump right wallace have you one either heard the tape yourself or been briefed on it and if so to your mind what does it show trump we have the tape i don apost want to hear the tape no reason for me to hear the tape wallace why don apost you want to hear it sir trump because it aposs a suffering tape it aposs a terrible tape i aposve been fully briefed on it there aposs no reason for me to hear it in fact i said to the people should i they said you really shouldn apost there aposs no reason i know exactly i know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it wallace and what happened trump it was very violent very vicious and terrible wallace a month ago you said you had spoken with saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman and that he had told you directly that he had no knowledge of this trump that aposs right that aposs right and still says that wallace but we now know that some of the people closest to him some of his closest advisors were part of this question did mbs lie to your sir trump i don apost i don apost know you know who can really know but i can say this he aposs got many people now that say he had no knowledge wallace but what if the crown prince speaking to you the president of the united states directly lied to you trump yes he told me that he had nothing to do with it he told me that i would say maybe five times at different points wallace but what if he aposs lying trump as recently as a few days ago wallace do you just live with it because you need him trump well will anybody really know all right will anybody really know but he did have certainly people that were reasonably close to him and close to him that were probably involved you saw we put on very heavy sanctions massive sanctions on a large group of people from saudi arabia but at the same time we do have an ally and i want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good wallace so if congress were to move to either try to cut off any u s involvement in the war in yemen or to block any arms sales you won apost go along with it trump well i want to see yemen in but it takes two to tango iran has to end it also and iran is a different country than it was when i took over it aposs far weakened because of what i did with the iran so called iran deal iran nuclear deal which was one of the great rip offs of all time but i want saudi to stop but i want iran to stop also wallace when democrats flipped the house back in 2006 and picked up 30 seats president bush 43 had a news conference the next day and said we had a thumping last week in this election the house picked up so far it aposs 36 seats it may be on the way to 40 seats and your reaction was that it was almost a complete victory trump i won the senate you don apost mention that wallace but well i trump excuse me i won the senate in wallace i understand that but trump i think they said 88 years wallace but this was a this was a historically big defeat in the house you lost 36 maybe 40 seats some would argue that it was a thumping and i want to talk about some of the ways in which you lost you lost in traditionally republican suburbs not only around liberal cities like philadelphia and d c but also red state big cities like houston and oklahoma city you lost among suburban women you lost among independents and in three key states that i think you remember pretty well wisconsin pennsylvania michigan you lost both the governor seats and the senate seats trump are you ready i won the senate and that aposs historic too because if you look at presidents in the white house it aposs almost never happened where you won a seat we won we now have 53 as opposed to 51 and we have 53 great senators in the u s senate we won that aposs a tremendous victory nobody talks about that that aposs a far greater victory than it is for the other side number two i wasn apost on the ballot i wasn apost wallace wait wait a minute you said you kept saying trump no i said look at me i said look me wallace you said pretend i aposm on the ballot trump but i had people and you see the polls how good they are i had people that won apost vote unless i aposm on the ballot ok and i wasn apost on the ballot and almost everybody that i won i think they said it was 10 out of 11 and i won against president obama and oprah winfrey and michelle obama in a great state called georgia for the governor and it was all stacked against brian and i was the one that went for brian and brian won look at florida i went down to florida rick scott won and he won by a lot i don apost know what happened to all those votes that disappeared at the very end and if i didn apost put a spotlight on that election before it got down to the 12 500 votes he would of lost that election ok in my opinion he would have lost they would have taken that election away from him rick scott won florida he kept the state excuse me a man named ron desantis is now your governor your new governor of florida a wonderful man named dewine is your governor of the great state of ohio remember what they used to say before my election you cannot win unless you win ohio i won ohio we had a tremendous set of victories you look at the victories wallace but if you can apost carry and you certainly didn apost carry it two weeks ago michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania you aposre not going to get reelected trump i didn apost run i wasn apost running my name wasn apost on the ballot there are many people that think i don apost like congress that like me a lot i get it all the time sir i will never vote unless you were on the ballot i get it all the time people are saying sir i will never vote unless you aposre on the ballot i say no no go and vote well what do you mean as much as i try and convince people to go vote i aposm not on the ballot end videotape wallace up next much more from our exclusive interview with president trump we have a spirited exchange about is calling fake news the enemy of the american people and mr trump makes a rare admission he aposd like a do over commercial break wallace we aposre back now with more from our exclusive interview with president trump about an hour before we sat down with the president there was breaking news a ruling on the cnn lawsuit against the white house for pulling a reporter aposs press pass cnn argued that trump administration violated its first amendment rights administration lawyers said mr trump can exclude any reporter he wants from the white house grounds and that aposs where we started in the second part of our interview with the president begin videotape wallace a federal judge who you appointed has just ruled that you must give cnn reporter jim acosta his press pass back your reaction to the ruling trump i it aposs fine i mean it aposs not a big deal what they said though was that we have to create rules and regulations for conduct et cetera et cetera we aposre doing that we aposre going to write them up right now it aposs not a big deal and if he misbehaves we aposll throw him out or we aposll stop the news conference actually wallace what are your rules going to be what is it that you aposre saying this is over the line and you trump yes they aposre doing them now i mean we aposll have rules of decorum you know you can apost keep asking questions you have we had a lot of reporters in that room many many reporters in that room and they were unable to ask questions because this guy gets up and starts doing what he aposs supposed to be doing for him and for cnn and you know just shouting out questions but i will say this look nobody believes in the first amendment more than i do and if i think somebody aposs acting out of sorts i will leave i aposll say thank you very much everybody i appreciate you coming and i aposll leave and those reporters will not be too friendly to whoever it is that aposs acting up wallace why didn apost you call on acosta in the first place i mean it seems to me there aposs a simple solution here so don apost call on him trump actually i like to do it but in many cases i don apost he aposll stand up he aposs unbelievably rude to sarah huckabee who aposs a wonderful woman unbelievably rude and i see that and i actually ask her the same why do you call on these people that are so nasty i think one of the things we aposll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them because then they don apost have any air time although i aposll probably be sued for that and maybe win or lose it who knows i mean with this stuff you never know what aposs going to happen wallace let aposs get to the bigger issue in 2017 last year you tweeted this and i want to quote it accurately the fake news media is not my enemy it is the enemy of the american people trump that aposs true 100 percent not the media wallace i trump i aposm glad you aposre finally calling it correctly because they like to leave the fake news wallace ok but that aposs what you said trump fake news so the people wallace but trump that are supporting me in particular they aposre very smart people they aposre hard working brilliant great people they know when the news is fake and they get angry when they see all of the fakeness that i frankly crosstalk wallace but there have been people who have been critical of other presidents they aposre no president has liked his press coverage john kennedy in your oval office canceled the subscription to the new york herald tribune nobody called it the enemy of the american people trump chris i aposm calling the fake news is the enemy it aposs fake it aposs phony crosstalk wallace but a lot times it aposs news you don apost like trump no it aposs not no no i don apost mind getting bad news if i aposm wrong if i do something wrong like for instance the cemetery i was not allowed to go because of the secret service because they expected to take a helicopter wallace ok trump they had zero visibility they said sir we are totally unequipped for you to go in addition to that the cemetery was far too far away from air force one which is sort of like a control center where you had to be near not one paper that i saw wrote it that way they said i stayed out of it because of the rain and yet the following day i made a speech at the american cemetery wallace i understand trump it was pouring it wasn apost even really raining the first day but the fog was tremendous ok wallace but sir leaders in authoritarian countries like russia china venezuela now repress the media using your words trump i can apost talk for other people i can only talk for me i will tell you wallace but but you aposre seen around the world as a beacon for repression not for crosstalk trump chris chris i aposm not talking about you but you sometimes maybe but i aposm not talking about you the news about me is largely phony it aposs false even sometimes they aposll say sources say there is no source in many cases in cases there is but wallace i understand you don apost like the coverage trump no no no it aposs not crosstalk wallace can i just bring the can i just bring the bigger trump ninety four percent negative wallace can i bring the the bigger issue up trump yes wallace bill mcraven retired admiral navy seal 37 years former head of u s special operations trump hillary clinton fan wallace special operation trump excuse me hillary clinton fan wallace who led the operations commanded the operations that took down saddam hussein and that killed osama bin laden says that your sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy in his life trump ok he aposs a hilary clinton backer and an obama backer and frankly wallace he aposs a navy seal trump would it have been nicer if we got osama bin laden a lot sooner than that wouldn apost it been nice living think of this living in pakistan beautifully in pakistan and what i guess in what they considered a nice mansion i don apost know i aposve seen nicer but living in pakistan right next to the military academy everybody in pakistan knew he was there and we give pakistan 1 3 billion and year and they don apost tell him they don apost tell him crosstalk wallace you aposre not even going to give them credit for taking down bin laden trump they took him down but look look there aposs news right there he lived in pakistan we aposre supporting pakistan we aposre giving them 1 3 billion a year which we don apost give them any more by the way i ended it because they don apost do anything for us they don apost do a damn thing for us i aposm totally in favor of the media i aposm totally in favor of free press got to be fair press when it aposs fake wallace but the president gets ph to decide what aposs fair and what aposs not trump i can tell what aposs fair and what aposs not and so can my people and so can a lot of other people wallace i understand that but trump when you do something very good and they write it badly and this is consistently when you as an example rarely do talk about wallace barak obama whined about foxnews all the time but he never said we were the enemy of the people trump well no he didn apost talk about the news he didn apost talk about anything i aposm only saying it very differently than anyone aposs ever said it before i aposm saying fake news false reporting dishonest reporting of which there is a lot and i know it see i know it because i aposm a subject of it a lot of people don apost know but when i explain it to them they understand it and chris you know that better you don apost have to sit here and act like a perfect little wonderful innocent angel i know you too well i knew your father too well that aposs not your gene but let me tell you wallace look i take some of the coverage of you sir and i aposve said it on the record is biased but i don apost think that they are trump most of it is biased most of it wallace i don apost know but the idea that you call us the enemy of the people trump i aposm not calling you that wallace i aposm talking about we aposre all together trump i aposm not calling you you don apost understand it wallace we aposre all together trump no no no i aposm not calling you wallace it doesn apost matter what you call when you call cnn and the new york times and we aposre in solidarity sir trump i am calling fake news fake reporting is what aposs tearing this country apart because people know people like things that are happening and they aposre not hearing about it wallace where do you rank yourself in the pantheon of great presidents there is lincoln and washington there aposs fdr and reagan do you make the top 10 trump i think i aposm doing a great job we have the best economy we aposve ever had wallace so where do you rank yourself trump we aposre doing really well we would have been at war with north korea if let aposs say that administration would have continued forward i would give myself i would look i hate to do it but i will do it i would give myself an a plus is that enough can i go higher than that wallace can you envision a situation you talk about six more years can you envision a situation well into your second term where you think you aposre so good for the country and so essential to the progress of the country that you would try to amend the constitution so you could serve a third time trump no no wallace why not trump just won apost happen it aposs not i think the eight year limit is a good thing not a bad thing wallace you aposve talked a lot all ready about the cemetery and the fact that you didn apost go because it was security concern and you did go the next day here aposs the thing trump excuse me not security concern they wouldn apost allow me to go they said sir secret service said sir you cannot go we are not prepared you cannot go because it was supposed to be helicopter but the helicopter couldn apost fly because of zero visibility wallace ok trump they said sir you can not go wallace but here aposs the question you aposre back in washington on monday veterans day why don apost you go across the river to arlington for that ceremony barack obama went every year he was here in d c trump i should have done that i was extremely busy on calls for the country we did a lot of calling as you know wallace but this is veterans day trump i probably you know in retrospect i should have and i did last year and i will virtually every year but we had come in very late at night and i had just left literally the american cemetery in paris and i really probably assumed that was fine and i was extremely busy because of affairs of state doing other things wallace why trump but i would have i would have done it wallace why haven apost you visited our troops serving in war zones in iraq and afghanistan in the two years you aposve been in office as commander in chief trump well i think you will see that happen there are things that are being planned we don apost want to talk about it because of obviously because of security reasons and everything else but there are things that are planned as you know i was very much opposed to the war in iraq i think it was a tremendous mistake should have never happened wallace but this is for the soldiers sir trump you aposre right i don apost think anybody aposs been more with the military than i have as a president in terms of funding in terms of all of the things i aposve been able to get them including the vets i don apost think anybody aposs done more than me i aposve had an unbelievable busy schedule and i will be doing it on top of which you have these phony witch hunts on top of which i mean we aposve just been very busy but i will be doing that wallace just before the midterms you said your biggest regret is that perhaps you should have had a softer tone in your two years as president but since then some could argue you aposve been on a tear at the press conference the day after the election you mocked some of the republican congressmen who lost not embracing you begin video clip trump mia love gave me no love and she lost too bad sorry about that mia end video clip wallace you went after two african american reporters and basically said that they were dumb begin video clip trump the same thing with april ryan i watch her get up i mean you talk about somebody that aposs a loser she doesn apost know what the hell she aposs doing abby phillip cnn white house correspondent do you want him to reign in robert mueller trump what a stupid question that is what a stupid question but i watch you a lot you ask a lot of stupid questions end video clip wallace question i was in saint joe aposs ph missouri this last week and i was talking to a lot of loyal republicans they love what you aposve done to the economy they love the fact that you have basically put isis out of business the one thing they say is why do you have to be so divisive why don apost you do more to bring the country together trump i think that if i was very different i wouldn apost have gotten what we had to get we got the biggest tax cuts in history we got anwr approved we have we got rid of the individual mandate which was the most unpopular thing you can imagine health care i got rid of it everybody said it would be impossible to get rid of it and many many you know the regulations i think if i was a you know more modified more moderate in that sense i don apost think i would have done half of the things that i was able to get completed with that being said other than you have to have a certain ability to fight back and as you know people have you know they take strong stance on me both ways you know love and hate i aposd like to see it a little bit maybe more right down the middle but tone is something that is important to me but a lot of times you can apost practice tone because you have people coming at you so hard that if you don apost fight back in a somewhat vigorous way you aposre not going to win and we have to win this country has to win we have a lot of victories coming and i think if i if i go too low key we aposre not going to have those victories wallace mr president thank you trump thank you thank you very much chris wallace very much appreciate it sir trump appreciate it thank you end videotape wallace one point of clarification admiral mcraven never endorsed a candidate for president in 2016 but in a hacked e mail clinton campaign chair john podesta discussed mcraven as a possible running mate after the interview president trump took us into the oval office to talk about how he makes those tough decisions that come across his desk every day that aposs next commercial break wallace next the president takes us on a tour of the west wing and describes how he aposs adjusted to life in the white house after two years in office begin video clip wallace so have you gotten comfortable with the place yet sir end video clip wallace and then reaction to our exclusive interview for with the president from our sunday panel all that coming up commercial break wallace after our interview president trump took us across the hall to the oval office in the room where it happens the president discussed his transition from real estate tycoon to leader of the free world and he gave some insight into how he makes the tough decisions he faces every day begin videotape wallace so have you gotten comfortable with the place yet sir trump i have i feel very comfortable it took me a little while you know it aposs sort of incredible you say you aposre the president of the united states and i say wow and it takes a little while to get over that wallace i was going to ask you the first time trump yes wallace that you aposre in the oval office trump right wallace by yourself everybody aposs gone you aposre looking around the room trump that aposs right wallace the the iconic room the most famous trump here we are you know i aposve had people come into this the biggest people in the world presidents prime ministers the heads of the biggest companies in the world and they always stop and they say this is the oval office wallace yes trump this is the oval office wallace it i think trump there aposs nothing like it in the world this is the resolute desk very famous this is where john john at the time right wallace right trump john kennedy was right here that aposs a little door that opens up wallace right trump and that was the famous picture i could show you that picture in fact i aposll give it to you but this is a very important desk fdr john kennedy you know we have seven desks and as president you can choose any one of the desks this is to me i think the most beautiful in terms of its carving i also think in many respects it aposs you know just some people that i respect used this desk wallace how when you aposre sitting at the desk how do you make decisions i mean do you agonize over them do you second guess yourself how does trump i don apost think about it i don apost think about you know how i make them i i make what i consider the right decision i have great people working at the white house they don apost get enough credit i have some tremendously talented people and i will talk to them and sometimes i aposll have them go at each other i do like that you know let them go at each other and they do they aposve very competitive people and at the end i make a decision and it aposs certainly on the economy a lot of things we aposve been we aposve made a lot of good decisions and i want to keep it that way wallace do do you ever second guess yourself do you ever trump yes all the time wallace and do you sometimes change your trump i aposve i aposve done things where i wished i went a different route but then what you do is you change course and you you bring it back you stabilize it out but wallace toughest decision you aposve had to make as president trump well i think north korea aposs been very tough because you know we were very close when i took that over president obama right in those two chairs we sat and talked and he said that aposs by far the biggest problem that this country has and i think we had real decision as to which way to go on north korea and certainly at least so far i aposm very happy with the way we went i have a very good relationship with kim wallace even though there aposs talk that they aposre putting up new sites trump yes maybe they are maybe they aposre not i don apost believe that i don apost and you know could and which is if it if that aposs the way it goes that aposs the way it goes you know i go with the way we have to go but so far it aposs been good we have a very good relationship we made i think some great decisions for the for the people of this country and i do you know i put america first and other countries should put themselves first it aposs not like we aposre we should put and everybody else should be second to us no other countries are proud of their countries and their leaders should put their countries first but we were putting out country in many cases last we were more worried about the world than we were worried about the united states that aposs not going to happen with me end videotape wallace we want to get some reaction now to our interview with president trump from our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz jonathan swan who covers the white house for axios former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and gerald seib from the wall street journal well jonathan i was struck by a lot that the president said first he really seems to be closing the door to any interview with robert mueller he said probably it aposs finished and he seemed to be opening the door to possible oversight of mueller by the new acting attorney general matt whitaker jonathan swan national political reporter axios yes this is the first time i aposve ever heard him acknowledge on the record what has seemed to all of us to be reality which is that there was no intention of him sitting down we aposd heard for months that he wanted to trump had said publically that he wanted to but his team really didn apost want him to that aposs the first time i aposve ever heard him basically shut the door to that and with whitaker it aposs interesting i don apost know that it aposs credible when he told you that he wasn apost aware of the statements that whitaker had made about robert mueller but it seems that trump is very happy with him and his job and i think it was it was notable that he sort of left it open that he could you know constrain budget or other things he didn apost shut that off wallace he said his decision i aposll leave it to him then gerry there was the president aposs refusal to acknowledge any defeat in the midterms and when it came to the losses that republicans did sustain he absolutely flipped the script from the campaign and the rallies at the end to say i wasn apost on the ballot gerald f seib the wall street journal yes no it was it was the election is about me the election wasn apost about me turn which is probably what you would expect but he does seem fairly sensitive about the outcome but i thought the fascinating part of that conversation was the fastening part of the midterms which you tried to draw him out on is the details it aposs not just the number of seats it aposs where the it aposs where the defeats happened for republicans happened in suburbs that they really need to win and in three states you correctly pointed out that are crucial to the trump coalition so this wasn apost just a defeat it was a defeat in some places that are very sensitive politically i will say though he aposs right that we says held the senate we aposve added a couple of seats that builds a firewall against overturning the tax cuts against overturning the regulation in that part the president aposs right that is a significant achievement wallace and and he also he said i aposm not going to say which house is more important but he made it clear the appointments i want to make to the bench to the to the cabinet whatever i can get through the senate i don apost have to deal with the house seib and by the way both the republican caucus in the senate and the republican caucus in the house will be more pro trump now than they were before the election the trump enemies and critics and moderates are pretty much the ones who washed out wallace corker flake people like that gone congresswoman edwards what struck you about the president aposs reaction to the midterms and do you see in what you heard from him any basis to believe that there aposs going to be any serious deal making compromising governing with the house democratic majority donna edwards former u s congresswoman d md well i mean i heard the president acknowledge his mistake on veterans day but he wouldn apost acknowledge his mistake when it comes to the elections i mean we had bush who described it as a thumping obama a shellacking and the president victory is mine and so you know i look at this and say well what the president has underscored is the ability of the house of representatives now to embark on investigations that they want in a measured kind of way but also possibly doing something on prescription drugs on infrastructure on immigration even if the president is willing to negotiate with the house but i think we aposll have to see and right now the house of representatives is i think not in a in a mood to to negotiate at least the base of the democratic party but we aposre going to come to a time where that aposs going to be true wallace congressman chaffetz i want to switch to still another subject the president had some interesting things to say about the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi he says he won apost even listen to the tape he aposs been advised it aposs too violent it aposs a suffering tape he said he left open the possibility that the crown prince may have been involved but he made it really clear that he aposs not going to do anything to jeopardize relations with saudi arabia jason chaffetz former congressman well the president aposs in a very difficult spot because there is so much on the line i thought it was very interesting what he was saying about yemen again focusing back on iran that yes he wants to get rid of what aposs going on in yemen but they aposve got to get the iranians and you need saudi arabia to triangulate them i think that was that was pretty fascinating and i was also fascinated about what he said about about pakistan i thought that was very newsworthy about the foreign aid that does not look good for pakistan which has nuclear capabilities and it will be interesting to see where that goes wallace and then jonathan there was the president aposs decision not to go to the cemetery in paris i should say the order he got from the secret service on saturday and you know and he brought that up several times on his own i wasn apost asking him about it and a rare admission of a mistake by this president in not going to arlington this last monday swan this is the second time i aposve seen the president acknowledge a mistake on camera the only other time i can recall was after access hollywood when he did what looked to many of us like a hostage video and ultimately sort of after he apologized flipped right back and brought the clinton accusers to the debate so it is like it aposs unheard of for him to acknowledge a mistake these are the matters that though that really he fixates upon it aposs it aposs the optics of the presidency it aposs the ceremony of the presidency it aposs the visuals of the presidency and the symbolism of the presidency and this was such an obvious mistake that it aposs clearly gotten under his skin wallace gerry you want seib well no i was going to say that there was that but there was also this fascinating biplay ph you had with him about tone in which you tried to get him to talk a little bit about why doesn apost he moderate his tone even though he aposs hinted at it a few times and he said essentially this is the way i succeed this is what i do and i thought that was fascinating so he admits a mistake but he aposs not really going to change his style don apost expect that at all and he said essentially it aposs that aposs the formula for success for me wallace he all right panel we have to take a break here but when we come back there is some other news the race for a house speaker nancy pelosi meets with a potential challenger plus election drama in florida who would have thunk the senate race between rick scott and bill nelson goes to a hand recount commercial break begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif house democratic leader i say to everybody come on in the water aposs warm rep marcia fudge r ohio i don apost know about bluffing ph but i would say this if the vote were taken today she does not have the votes to be the speaker of the house end video clip wallace house democratic leader nancy pelosi and a potential challenger ohio congresswoman marcia fudge engaging in a little trash talk about who will be speaker in the new democrat controlled house and we aposre back now with the panel well congresswoman edwards 17 house democrats have signed a letter saying that they oppose the election of nancy pelosi as speaker and marcia fudge who we just heard there is one of them but you have an article today in the washington post with this provocative headline don apost blow it democrats there aposs only one choice to be the next speaker and you say that choice is nancy pelosi edwards well that aposs right wallace why edwards well i mean coming out of the 2018 election where you win the most historic victory that democrats have had since watergate led by nancy pelosi staying on message raising health care as an issue around the country and democrats need to come back and get to work on health care on infrastructure on immigration on government accountability and instead they aposre having a fight about the speaker well the rest of the country i think doesn apost really share that at least among democrats and it aposs time for democrats to you know to get together and i aposm convinced that nancy pelosi is going to be the next speaker of the house i think that she aposs going to come out with an overwhelming majority in the caucus and that that is going to follow her to the floor and it should she aposs a tactician she aposs a strategist she aposs held democrats together and you know look she raised more than half of the money that democrats took in to get this house majority wallace gerry as we say a number of house candidates democrats campaign pledging it was an issue in the campaign and certainly it was an issue in campaign ads they would not support nancy pelosi for speaker do you think she aposs in any real trouble getting elected seib she aposs in some trouble but not real trouble i think look it you it aposs hard in politics to beat something with nothing and there aposs no viable alternative nobody aposs built the groundwork nobody aposs laid the predicate for for over no one person has and i think in the end their the the new members who said they don apost won apost support or can vote against her when the democrats decide who their choice is but then can vote for her on the floor because there aposs no alternative and that gives them a way out so again if you don apost have something you can apost beat something with nothing wallace well i mean marcia fudge is at least toying with the idea seib but not there yet wallace and and if she were would she be a serious contender seib again no groundwork has really been laid for the the serious opposition swan and and here aposs what we know i mean when they vote as a caucus she aposs going to win so then she goes to the floor so then you have a choice what are they going to do are they going to not vote for her are they going to you know sit silent are they going to vote for kevin mccarthy i think it aposs a very it will be a very clarifying choice wallace let aposs turn to the recount the continuing recount in the florida senate race where there are continuing claims of fraud from both sides take a look begin video clip gov rick scott r fla u s senate candidate he can apost stand the fact that he aposs not going to be elected for what the first time in decades and he won apost he aposs just here to steal this election sen bill nelson d fla he aposs been using his power as governor to try to undermine the voting process end video clip wallace congressman chaffetz there are growing signs as the vote start to come in now from the manual recount that rick scott is going to be able to hold onto his lead which is about 12 500 votes is this over is he going to take the senate seat and replace bill nelson and why not that you aposre an expert on florida but i guess to a certain degree all of us are why are florida elections so often a mess chaffetz i don apost know it aposs embarrassing in florida we aposre having the same problem in utah where there are still thousands of votes that have not even been counted for the first time so it it the margin is so great for for i think we aposre looking at senator scott because 12 000 votes is insurmountable historically these hand recount maybe sway 100 or 200 votes here and there but not the 12 000 that would be necessary wallace and and do you have any insight into why why florida chaffetz well i think a governor ron desantis has a big job and task in front of him that since 2000 you think we would have cleaned this up i don apost understand why all the counties are going their own their own direction when somebody in a documented way who aposs leading elections has the types of problems that she had she should have been pushed out of office a long time ago but hopefully wallace you know who could have done it was governor rick scott chaffetz yes wallace and they didn apost do it chaffetz i think he aposs re i think there aposs a lesson for all the governors out there to pay more attention to this going into not only the elections of 2020 but also the census which is right on our heels as well wallace jonathan let aposs look ahead to 2020 because that one election aposs over so the next election begins and that aposs not just a congressional election that aposs the presidential election it is interesting that the the blue wave and it aposs become more of a blue wave as we see the final victories i mean it aposs astonishing i read today that the entire congressional delegation from orange county in california swan reagan democrats wallace is going to be democrats swan yes wallace reagan country goldwater country it aposs all going to be democrats but the blue wave did not hit in in florida which as we always think of as the key swing state what does that tell you about 2020 that it looks like they aposre going to elect maybe by small margins a republican senator and a republican governor well it tells you one thing which is that i mean one thing trump is right about is that he does have an impact in florida ron desantis would not be governor without donald trump he wouldn apost have got through that primary and most republicans consider him a horrible candidate and trump got him right through trump aposs numbers aren apost terrible in florida but where his problems exists is there is now a very clear path for democrats to take back the white house which is through the upper midwest and you identified those three states and yes donald trump wasn apost on the ballot but geez he didn apost even go to those three states for the very reason that his numbers had fallen so much so you know there is this sort of perennial democratic fantasy about arizona and texas but they don apost need to do that they can just go through the midwest wallace but you know we talked about the speaker aposs race you aposve got to beat somebody with somebody we don apost know who the democratic candidate is going to be so yes there certainly there were warning signs in the suburbs in the upper rust belt but it aposs donald trump against the unknown at this point seib well and who rides the wave is it somebody who speaks to those voters in those three industrial states that you spoke of or is it somebody who speaks more to the coastal enclaves where the real strength of the party is and by the way is texas a swing state ohio doesn apost look like a swing state anymore ohio looks republican florida looks like a swing state texas is a great question mark nevada looks more blue but arizona looks like a swing state it is going to be a slightly different if not significantly different presidential map in 2020 than the one we aposve been used to seeing the couple years wallace i aposm glad to see th
