apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic billed as the most important and substantial military exchange visit with the united states in nine years the grand tour from friday through thursday by a large chinese military delegation led by defense minister gen liang guanglie received royal treatment at the pentagon this week u s defense and military authorities appear eager to establish a credible and reliable means of communication with the highest echelons of the world s largest and strongest military and the pentagon s method is to try to make the chinese happy by allowing visits to key u s military facilities the americans are giving us a very substantial agenda allowing us to see their front line units especially front line operational units said rear adm yin zhuo of the people

dialogue between our two militaries maintaining open channels of communication the official said the visit offers opportunities to build mutual understanding improve and build towards greater mutual
