national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge donald trump just loves to talk about hiring magnificent people i m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people he told the washington post in august from his current campaign staff to his future adoring presidential coterie we are told all trump political entities will be filled with the finest most competent human beings planet earth has to offer so terrific in fact they ll resemble those sexy yet logical aliens on star trek with this grandiose vision in mind it s always a bit jarring to see trump s actual surrogates in action stumbling through an unending trail of hilarious horrifying and jaw dropping moments all aired on live tv it s almost like all four seasons of here comes honey boo boo combined take the soft spoken surgeon and former evangelical darling ben carson if you ve been paying attention throughout this ramshackle election you ve probably noticed that carson is a bit of an odd duck beyond his baffling crusade to elect a man who once implied he was a child molester carson offers offbeat theories about the pyramids he wistfully discusses childhood knife fights his maryland house is filled to the gills with shrines to you guessed it ben carson including a plaque with proverbs misspelled and an oil painting featuring carson posing with a very approving jesus many cnn viewers alas were less than approving this week when carson sleepily took to the airwaves to defend trump from his latest scandal to clarify this would be the scandal in which trump was taped saying he could forcefully grab women by their private parts and get away with it because he s a star it is also the scandal that many prominent republicans dismissed as simple locker room talk leading me to wonder if those same republicans had been unknowingly sharing locker rooms with the crotch grabber the notorious sexual predator who haunted my college campus for two terrifying quarters in the late 1990s related bending to trump s star power carson for his part gave a similar line on cnn waxing poetic about power trip crotch grabbing is common banter he said it is distasteful he argued but certainly not rare anchor brianna keilar looking slightly perplexed informed carson that few normal people have heard locker room talk of this amped up variety i haven t heard it she said and i know a lot of people who have not heard it well maybe that s the problem maybe that s the problem carson replied calm as a xanax factory people have not heard this maybe that s the problem keilar stared in wonderment yes folks this was happening carson was blaming america for failing to frequent scarier locker rooms viewers scratched their heads wondering why carson couldn t just call the remarks a mistake and move on carson after a pause started to ramble about a train going off a cliff which to be fair seems appropriate enough related the tenth life of donald trump at least ben carson didn t blame the lyrics of beyonc for trump s remarks like surrogate betsy mccaughey nor did he blame the tawdry women s book club hit 50 shades of grey like spokesperson scottie nell hughes he did not credit the donald s remarks to an alpha personality as did trump s son eric but let s move on to rudy giuliani a semi tragic figure who has morphed from competent new york city major and 9 11 hero into a lively trumpian opening act here s a quiz question your boss has been dogged by a crotch related scandal for days your poll numbers with women have dive bombed evangelicals are getting edgy mike pence the sincere cop is busy telling people that trump is dreadfully sorry ashamed and that his heart has changed since those days long ago it s all very unconvincing but at least he s trying what do you do related well if you re rudy guiliani you get up at a rally and make a joke about hillary clinton stuffing socialized medicine up her you know what no seriously on wednesday giuliani stopped short of specifically where clinton should shove said medicine i didn t say it i didn t say it he joked throwing his hands in the air i suggested it but i didn t say it but the meaning was quite clear in pure trumpian style it was a not so subtle middle finger to all the prudes and haters and losers out there but no one should be surprised should they once you ve defended trump for so long past the clinton donations the abortion flip flops the call for war crimes the praise for authoritarian governments the admiration for single payer health care the never ending conspiracy theories the personal instability the compulsive lying the statist urges you ll defend anything and with relish hence we continue to witness the embarrassing spectacle of trump s line of surrogates buckle up it will likely get worse before it gets better get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
