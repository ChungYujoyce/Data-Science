apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic cyberwarfare is the hot topic in military and intelligence circles at the pentagon amid unrelenting cyberattacks from china russia iran and elsewhere but for the super secret national security agency cyberwarfare is nothing new the electronic spying and code breaking agency provided a rare public look at its views on cyberwarfare by releasing this month redacted copies of its internal newsletter which show that nsa has been engaged in cyberwarfare for more than a decade see also massive cyberattack slows world s internet traffic a 1997 article published in the once classified newsletter cryptolog was written by legendary nsa official bill black he stated that the agency received the mission for computer network attack cna offensive cyberwarfare on march 3 1997 from then defense secretary william s cohen this delegation of authority has added a new third dimension to nsa s one mission future mr black at the time a special assistant to the nsa director for information operations stated in the spring 1997 issue that is in the networked world of cyberspace cna technology is the natural companion of nsa s exploit and protect functions other sections of the newsletter were heavily redacted and labeled top secret umbra the code word used to protect electronic intelligence see also homeland security seeks hackers for good to help with cybersecurity under a section headlined the future of warfare is warfare in cyberspace mr black who rose to nsa deputy director before retiring said information warfare provides digital coercion as a military and political option for leaders the primary target of this option is the information infrastructure of an adversary he said such information infrastructures are expected to be primarily computer controlled operated by the commercial civilian sector unprotected and the primary infrastructure upon which military forces almost totally depend future warfare will involve attacking computer controlled infrastructure with the aim of degrading disrupting or destroying networks and rendering computers intelligence targets of the highest priority he said there are specific types of weapons associated with information warfare mr black wrote these include viruses worms logic bombs trojan horses spoofing masquerading and back or trap doors they are referred to as tools or techniques even though they may be pieces of software they are publicly available very powerful and if effectively executed extremely destructive to any society s information infrastructure as a result information warriors will need to be expert in understanding the virtual world and have extensive knowledge of non military targets military cyberwarriors will be the tooth and civilians will be the tail in what the military calls the tooth to tail frontline and support relationship in warfare mr black stated that the new information age that has emerged since the end of the cold war is engulfing every aspect of society including electronic spying it has produced the need to consolidate what he termed cyberology along with cryptology cyberology s central activities i e exploitation protection and attack will be worked together thus benefiting all of them he stated just as many viewed industrialists and capitalists during the industrial age as the problem in today s age the public has centered in on government as the problem he wrote specifically the focus is on the potential abuse of the government s applications of this new information technology that will result in an invasion of personal privacy he said for us this is difficult to understand we are the government and we have no interest in invading the personal privacy of u s citizens critics have disagreed including several nsa whistleblowers who accused the agency of violating the law by intercepting americans emails in the early 2000s as part of the terrorist surveillance program mr black acknowledged that public worries are real and will impact nsa operations if legislation is used to prevent potential nsa involvement in the public sector that problem persists today as most u s infrastructure is held by the private sector which remains wary of inviting nsa to help counter or disrupt foreign cyberattacks the nsa documents were obtained by the website governmentattic org u s national security officials are warning that jihadists are planning a major cyberattack against vital infrastructure soon the alert was sent following a report on a jihadist website monday by two groups that announced in arabic an open invitation for all hackers to participate in operation black summer to target u s vital services the attackers plan to use the twitter hashtag opblacksummer to wage electronic warfare against the united states with other jihadists it is also essential to note that this raid will be a global one in which all the enemies of the united states whether muslims or non muslims will take part the posting stated noting that osama bin laden had advocated such attacks the message said one group involved in the attack is the al qaeda digital army and appeared on the al qaeda linked website ansar al mujahideen network russian president vladimir putin and chinese president xi jinping issued a statement during the chinese leader s visit to moscow that mentioned the problem of other nations missile defense seen as a reference to u s and nato defenses in europe the statement released friday called for building a new type of great power relations and called on all nations of the world to deepen mutual understanding coordination and cooperation on the question of missile defenses the statement urged states to be prudent in deploying and cooperating on missile defenses and to oppose one nation or a group of nations from taking steps to unilaterally and unlimitedly strengthening missile defenses harming strategic stability and international security we stand for the collective confrontation of the challenges and threats from ballistic missiles preferring to confront the proliferation of ballistic missiles within the framework of international law and political diplomacy where the security of one group of nations cannot be sacrificed at the expense of another group of nations the statement said the statement while couched in diplomacy speak appears to reflect russian and chinese opposition to u s missile defenses that both governments have said threatens the offensive missiles of russia and china during the visit mr xi was shown how u s and nato missile defenses will impact russian strategic missiles according to russian press reports white house national security adviser thomas e donilon will visit moscow april 15 for talks on missile defenses the pentagon announced earlier this month that it is canceling a long range missile defense interceptor that moscow saw as a threat to russian intercontinental ballistic missiles and opposed russian officials have said the cancellation of the sm 3 iib interceptor did not resolve their opposition to joint u s nato missile defenses in europe moscow is demanding legal restrictions on u s defenses something the obama administration has opposed on monday defense secretary chuck hagel and russian defense minister sergey shoygu discussed missile defenses during a telephone talk the donilon mission to moscow prompted criticism from rep mike d rogers alabama republican and chairman of the house armed services subcommittee on strategic forces in view of the president s latest concession to russia on missile defense it s fitting that mr donilon now heads to visit with mr putin mr rogers said in a statement much like president obama asked former president dmitry medvedev to transmit his promise of flexibility after his last election mr donilon now goes to see what that flexibility has earned our president mr rogers said i predict nothing just as i predicted in two letters before the march 15th announcement that obama would make this unilateral concession to russia he said the president could at least have the courtesy to share with congress the same proposals his national security adviser is sharing with putin a white house spokesman had no c
