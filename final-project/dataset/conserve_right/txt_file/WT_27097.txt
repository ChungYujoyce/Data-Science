s bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn a top house democrat accused the administration thursday of stonewalling a probe into a national security whistleblower s complaint against president trump by raising executive privilege but presidents bill clinton and barack obama also insisted on the right to privilege in such cases emerging from a three hour closed door briefing with an inspector general rep adam b schiff california democrat and chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence said the justice department is shielding the white house by barring disclosure of details about the whistleblower s complaint this shows someone is trying to manipulate the system to keep information about an urgent matter from the congress mr schiff told reporters there is no privilege that covers whether the white house is involved and trying to stifle a whistleblower complaint there s no privilege to be corrupt see also hakeem jeffries trump could have potentially exploited ukraine vulnerability mr schiff is demanding that the administration turn over the complaint which reportedly says the president made an unspecified promise to an unspecified foreign head of state during a phone conversation sometime this summer intelligence community inspector general michael atkinson deemed the complaint credible and of urgent concern turning heads on capitol hill mr trump on thursday rejected accusations that he made an inappropriate promise to a foreign leader he said he wouldn t be dumb enough to take such action while other officials were monitoring his phone conversations virtually anytime i speak on the phone to a foreign leader i understand that there may be many people listening from various u s agencies not to mention those from the other country itself no problem the president tweeted mr trump added knowing all of this is anybody dumb enough to believe that i would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially heavily populated call i would only do what is right anyway and only do good for the usa the president characterized the report by the washington post as another fake news story out there it never ends mr atkinson told the committee that the whistleblower s complaint was related to multiple acts not one phone conversation lawmakers said but he wouldn t discuss specifics or confirm that the complaint targeted the president he didn t talk about anything about the allegations where he was very protective said rep mike quigley illinois democrat but he did mention that this complaint was based on a series of events more than one to get the exact wordage right rep val butler demings florida democrat said we heard the word privilege a lot this week his answer centered around the word privilege that it might be privileged information ms demings said of mr atkinson on cnn while he did not say it involved the administration it certainly led me to believe that his instructions may have been coming from the administration but she disputed the characterization of multiple events saying mr atkinson wouldn t discuss specifics some analysts say there are legitimate questions about the balance of power and what acting director of national intelligence joseph maguire is required to disclose to congress given presidential authority robert litt who served as general counsel to the office of the director of national intelligence in the obama administration noted that mr clinton asserted the right to executive privilege when he signed into law the intelligence community whistleblower protection act of 1998 the executive branch has always maintained that it does not consider the statutory language mandatory mr litt wrote on the lawfare blog in signing the original intelligence community whistleblower protection act of 1998 president clinton stated that it does not constrain my constitutional authority to review and if appropriate control disclosure of certain classified information to congress president obama reiterated this limitation in 2010 he said congress no doubt disagrees with this interpretation but the president s ultimate control over classified information has been a consistent position of every administration jack goldsmith a harvard law professor and senior fellow at the hoover institution said the president s power to act in confidence is at its absolute height when he has a classified conversation with a foreign leader a president cannot conduct foreign policy if his or her controversial secret foreign policy communications can be disclosed at the determination of an intelligence employee mr goldsmith tweeted putting it brutally article ii gives the president the authority to do and say and pledge awful things in the secret conduct of u s foreign policy he said in a twitter post that is a very dangerous discretion to be sure but has long been thought worth it on balance the whistleblower is being represented by andrew p bakaj a former cia officer and managing partner at the compass rose legal group a national security law firm mr atkinson has agreed to appear in an open session with lawmakers thursday mr schiff is scolding mr maguire for refusing to share details of the complaint which was filed aug 12 saying he is required to notify committees because of the inspector general s determination given the inspector general said this is urgent it can t wait mr schiff said even if you could make a colorable claim of privilege over the subject matter of the complaint given that it involves something that the ig has already found to be serious and credible and evidence of wrongdoing on one kind or another there is no privilege that covers that there s no privilege to conceal that we can t get an answer because the department of justice and the director of national intelligence will not authorize the ig to tell us rep jackie speier a california democrat who attended the briefing called the administration s actions deeply troubling and a violation of the law mr schiff indicated that the spy community s inspector general would not reveal to lawmakers whether the president is the target of the complaint i don t know whether the white house is directly involved because we can t get an answer to that question but we do know that they are making some claim that a privilege may apply he told reporters well that narrows the categories who may be intervening here former fbi and cia official phil mudd said on cnn that the whistleblower had no right to raise concerns about mr trump s calls with foreign leaders the president can say what he wants mr mudd said it s not the responsibility of the intel guys to go police the president and go snitch on him to the congress ridiculous some allies of the president said the complaint was another example of the federal bureaucracy and the intelligence community s long running opposition to the president judicial watch president tom fitton called it another deep state attack on mr trump democrats and their pro impeachment allies said the developments are more troublesome for mr trump than the now discredited russia investigation former nixon white house counsel john dean said attorney general william p barr is protecting trump from a whistleblower complaint this may take impeachment in a totally new direction he tweeted obama administration acting solicitor general neal katyal said the justice department and the administration are contorting themselves backwards to try to hide this there are probably tapes and transcripts documenting a gross abuse of power by trump mr katyal tweeted gonna be ugly tom howell j
