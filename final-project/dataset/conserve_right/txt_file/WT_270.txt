apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the unusual move by attorney general william p barr to open an independent review of the prosecution of retired army lt gen michael flynn came after months of legal broadsides from defense attorney sidney powell but it may have been ms powell s first salvo a private letter to mr barr in june that alerted him to what the flynn team believes is a miscarriage of justice in her first paragraph ms powell requested an outside auditor not associated in any way with former special counsel robert mueller s team she argued that mr mueller s lawyers threatened flynn s son with prosecution to persuade the retired officer to plead guilty to lying to the fbi top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal

associate has been charged in an election conspiracy for which mr mueller was tapped to uncover we request the appointment of new government counsel with no connection to the special counsel team of attorneys or agents to conduct review of the entire flynn case for brady material that has not been produced and prosecutorial misconduct writ large ms powell wrote to mr barr brady is a term of exculpatory evidence to which the defense is entitled ms powell also asked for a determination of when how and on what basis the first investigation of general flynn began reads the letter stamped confidential from that day forward ms powell an appeals court specialist and longtime justice department critic filed a series of arguments accusing the fbi and the special counsel team of gross misconduct she told the washington times she doesn t know exactly why mr barr acted but i am guessing it is from what has been revealed in my filings she said for one she said the fbi officially put flynn under investigation in august 2016 in its russian election interference probe but didn t tell him during two encounters over six months an agent visited the trump presidential campaign under the guise of a defensive briefing on russian interference in fact the agent was there to surreptitiously investigate flynn according to a report by justice department inspector general michael e horowitz six months after opening the probe into flynn two fbi agents including trump antagonist peter strzok on jan 24 2017 visited flynn at the white house under the guise of a friendly chat about national security at that point the fbi had no evidence of a trump russia conspiracy outside of the christopher steele dossier which republicans say turned out to be a kremlin hoax during the presidential transition the u s had intercepted calls between flynn and the russian ambassador in which they talked about sanctions inside the obama justice department there was talk of investigating flynn for violating the logan act a 1799 law barring civilian interference in foreign policy for which no one has ever been convicted the call was leaked to the washington post whose story mentions the logan act flynn defenders say it was a sure sign that obama administration holdovers were trying to destroy flynn mr trump s first national security adviser in her june letter to mr barr ms powell recited her version of events she said prosecutor brandon van grack later acknowledged that the flynn call was perfectly legal it did not violate the logan act which appeared to be the basis for the fbi visiting flynn that day there was no logan act violation and everyone knew it ms powell wrote yet general flynn was illegally unmasked by the obama administration and his call leaked to explode the russia collusion narrative in the press the fbi interview was worse than entrapment he was led to believe he was having a casual conversation with friends about a training exercise from a day or two before when in truth it was a set up tantamount to a frame manipulated by yates comey strzok mccabe and others to take general flynn out of the administration mueller team then used it to pressure him to try to take out president trump yates is sally yates who was mr obama s deputy attorney general comey was fbi director james b comey mccabe was fbi deputy director andrew mccabe it was mr mccabe who set up the jan 24 meeting with flynn telling him that if he consulted with the white house counsel the fbi would have to get its general counsel involved flynn said he would not consult a lawyer later mr comey fired by mr trump bragged that he was able to send two fbi agents to the white house without resistance because the place was still in formative disarray the inspector general report said the fbi targeted flynn because as the head of the defense intelligence agency and during retirement he had had contacts with russians there was no evidence he had been engaged in a conspiracy and in fact after nearly three years of probing there was no such finding in the final mueller report the barr intervention came after u s district judge emmet g sullivan had rejected all of ms powell s arguments to date she claimed that the mueller team withheld exculpatory evidence and that the fbi maliciously edited 302 interview reports to hurt flynn flynn last month moved to rescind his december 2017 guilty plea of lying to mr strzok and the other agent the flynn decision is not the first time mr barr has distanced himself from the mueller prosecutors who remained on the russia beat to complete criminal cases he disagreed last week with their sentencing recommendation of up to nine years in prison for former trump adviser roger stone the four prosecutors promptly quit the case mr barr told abc news he thought the prosecution of stone was just but the sentence recommendation was too severe he thought he had worked out a deal that would let the judge decide mr barr has taken other steps that have rankled democrats last spring he appointed john durham the u s attorney for connecticut to investigate how the obama justice department began the probe into the trump campaign in 2016 he has said the fbi spied on the campaign a description that also angered democrats he questioned why it opened such a momentous probe into a presidential campaign based on a conversation over drinks in london between trump campaign volunteer george papadopoulos and australia s ambassador the horowitz report said the fbi never interviewed the ambassador before opening crossfire hurricane the inquiry s code name on july 31 2016 in tv interviews mr barr said the fbi acted in bad faith mr horowitz said the fbi committed 17 inaccuracies or omissions of exculpatory information in four wiretap affidavits submitted to judges to spy on trump volunteer carter page an fbi lawyer altered a cia email so it said mr page wasn t an agency asset when in fact he had been mr van grack ended up publicly filing ms powell s letter in october perhaps because it contained criticism of judge sullivan probably thought it would embarrass me or give him some kind of leverage didn t work ms powell told the times ms powell filed a new motion in late january this time asking judge sullivan to dismiss the charges she relied heavily on the horowitz report the ig report is a scathing indictment of the conduct of the leadership and small group in the fbi that ran this operation against mr flynn she said this is especially true for the two fbi agents who interviewed mr flynn on january 24 2017 ig report evinces that mr flynn has still not been provided with all the evidence of egregious government misconduct dishonestly wielded to destroy the national security advisor to president trump as part of their larger anti trump scheme she said the horowitz report focused on four foreign intelligence surveillance act warrants on mr page the ig said the fbi met the relatively low standard for opening a counterintelligence investigation into flynn and did not seek fisa spying mr van grack filed a response to ms powell s motion arguing that none of her examples of fbi maneuvering amounted to egregious misconduct he said no material exculpatory evidence has been withheld with which judge sullivan agreed in a december ruling the new york times reported friday that mr barr tapped jeffrey jensen a former fbi agent who serves as u s attorney for the eastern district of misso
