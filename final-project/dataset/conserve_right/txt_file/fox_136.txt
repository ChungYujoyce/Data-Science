thank you joining us live here in washington white house national security advisor general h r mcmaster general welcome back to fox news sunday gen h r mcmaster white house national security advisor thanks james it aposs a pleasure to be here rosen it aposs an honor to have you the president called this new strategy towards iran a two step process step one is withholding the certification as you aposve done with an eye toward potentially securing some changes to the iran nuclear deal and some changes in iran s behavior outside of the deal step two as the president made clear in the remarks we are about to hear is that if the first step doesn apost work we cancel the deal begin video clip donald trump president of the united states in the event we are not able to reach a solution working with congress and their allies then the agreement will be terminated end video clip rosen so while we re in this first phase seeking changes to the nuclear deal is that the policy of united states government that we continue to implement fully all existing u s obligations under the deal mcmaster yes it is and what the president though has done is he has set out a marker a marker to iranians and to our allies and partners that we have to fix fundamental flaws in this deal it aposs a weak deal that is being weakly monitored and so the president has made clear that he will not permit this deal to provide cover for what we know is a horrible regime to develop a nuclear weapon rosen so two of the men in government today whom i think you most admire and respect advise the president against making this decision begin video clip gen joseph dunford chairman joint chiefs of state iran is not a material breach of the agreement and i do believe the agreement to date has delayed development of a nuclear capability by iran james mattis defense secretary i believe at this point in time absent indications to the contrary it is something the president should consider staying with end video clip rosen and our allies have weighed in right about where you would have expected them to be with britain france and germany issuing a joint statement and i quote we stand committed to the jcpoa that aposs the technical name of the iran deal and its full implementation by all sides preserving the jcpoa is in our shared national security interest unquote so general isn apost it farcical to imagine that the iranians or the p5 plus 1 allies are going to be willing to revisit the terms of this deal mcmaster no they already are revisiting the terms of the deal and implementation of the deal and our european allies the e3 they re called france germany and the u k are supporting much more rigorous enforcement of the jcpoa and monitoring one of the real problems with this deal is we can apost really say with confidence that they are complying and we know from their behavior their behavior broadly in the region and their behavior within the agreement where they have walked up to the line they have crossed the line several times in terms of the restrictions that this is not a trustworthy regime so much more comprehensive monitoring is in order rosen what parts do you see the iranians being willing to revisit mcmaster well it aposs not even revisit it aposs just implement the agreement by going to sites to fully implement the inspections of sites the monitoring of suspicious sites within iran rosen the things you find most objectionable about the deal which is the restrictions on military sites for access for inspectors the sunset causes the iranians are not going to revisit any of that are they willingly mcmaster well they have to revisit it because otherwise what you do is you just give the iranians the opportunity to develop the nuclear capability their programs can advance and then they can go to industrial scale enrichment of uranium within a very short period of time and then bridge into a weapon and that is just an unacceptable risk in the world rosen isn apost that precisely what they can do if you walk away from the deal mcmaster well the president is not walking away from the deal yet so if he sees some real change if he sees the ability of the congress within u s law to address some of these problems associated with the deal so this in our legislation the domestic law about the deal was really flawed because it was really just about cost reporting to each other so what the president has done is met with congress to ask congress help fix this domestic legislation and let aposs work on as secretary tillerson has said a deal that can lay alongside the jcpoa and address its fundamental flaws one of which you already mentioned which is the sunset clause where iran can just wait for a little while and reap all the benefits of sanctions relief to enrich the islamic revolutionary guards corps which is on a murderous brutal campaign across the middle east crosstalk mcmaster and then they re going to breach in to a nuclear weapon yes rosen which is designated as part of this initiative correct mcmaster because i think what s really important about the president s speech is to pay attention to the whole speech because what the president has done is he has laid out a strategy for dealing with iran aposs destabilizing and dangerous hate filled behavior its behavior toward its own people and its behavior towards the region and i would ask as we always pay attention to our european allies and others pay attention to our allies and partners in the region what they said the people who were under the gun of this regime israel and saudi arabia in particular rosen all right let aposs turn to a country that many believe iran has actually been helping advance towards a nuclear weapons capability and that aposs north korea the stalinist regime in pyongyang this past week reissued its threat to move militarily against guam a u s territory we have heard you and the president and others in the administration reaffirm many times that the so called military option remains on the table what would you like our adversary in this instance kim jong un to know about that military option is it the same option military that was on the table when i used to hear condoleezza rice talk about it in 2005 or has in fact the north koreans nuclear progress in that time served to constrain the military options that we have today mcmaster our president has been really clear about this he is not going to permit this rogue regime kim jong un to threaten the united states with a nuclear weapon and so he is willing ph to do anything necessary to prevent that from happening and what kim jong un should recognize is that if he thinks the development of this nuclear capability is keeping him safer it aposs actually the opposite it s having the opposite effect rosen what about the military options are they the same ones we had in 2005 mcmaster well they were under constant refinement so we have a broad range of new capabilities coming into our armed forces thanks to the president aposs focus on modernizing the armed forces addressing what had been a bow wave of deferred military modernization so our military is getting stronger and stronger under military leaders are refining improving plans every day plans we hope we don apost have to use but we must be ready we have to be ready and so all of our armed forces are getting to really a high high degree of readiness for this mission if it aposs necessary rosen this tweet by president trump instantly became one of his most memorable it was posted just after 11 00 p m on the night of september 23rd and it read and i quote just heard foreign minister of north korea speak at u n if the echoes thoughts of little rocket man they won apost be around much longer general did you receive advance warning that that tweet was going to go out mcmaster well the president doesn apost have to clear anything with me but what the president s tweet is it s very consistent with this policy i think what aposs important to understand with both the iran policy and with the north korea policy the president gave us very clear guidance at the outset we delivered as the national security team multiple options to the president had broad ranging discussions the president has made decisions on very coherent well laid out strategies and that aposs what we re executing now rosen i want to ask about the tweet though do you and the president perceive ph from a shared view that public integrations of another head of state an attempt at publicly humiliating an adversary on the world stage with a derisive term like little rocket man that that can have some positive strategic impact mcmaster i think with a real danger is in terms of communicating with kim jong un is that he doesn apost understand how serious we are about his behavior and behavior of the regime and the president has been very clear on that and i think that is it s beneficial to the safety and security of not only the united states but our great allies in south korea and japan and the world rosen all right we just have about a minute left i want to ask about your 1997 book dereliction of duty johnson mcmanara the joint chiefs of staff and the lies that led to vietnam i was a big admirer of the book it s a deep archival study of how the joint chiefs were systematically excluded from policy making in the process that gave us the quagmire in vietnam you wrote at the time those who question the direction of lbj aposs policy were excluded from future deliberations on vietnam the president got the military advice he wanted so having made wartime dysfunction on the national security council your area of academic study how do you apply the lessons you learned about the process in the vietnam era to the running of the national security council today mcmaster well it was a real gift to be able to study the national security council and decision making within that national security council and with its interaction with the president from historical perspective and i think history can apost give you the answer to today aposs problems but it can help you maybe avoid some mistakes of the past so it really highlighted for me what we owe the president within the national security council is to coordinate and integrate efforts across all departments and agencies and provide the president with multiple options options that are based on clearly articulated goals and objectives that we derive from an understanding of vital interests with u s vital interest rosen would there be any policy stakeholders with equities in the process who would complain they aposve been excluded in any way under h r mcmaster mcmaster no what we have done is we are running a fully transparent process that empowers president s very talented cabinet to bring forward to him their best assessments and their best recommendations what the president does is he asks very tough questions and i think you aposve seen this in the development of a broad number of strategies from cuba to north korea to south asia and so what i think the president has done is helped us restore our strategic competence he got the national security council out of the tactical day to day business and supervising cabinet officials who don apost need supervision they need they need support and they need effort to help in integrating their efforts with others rosen we will pursue all of this more with you the next time you come back here mcmaster thanks it was a privilege to be with you rosen thank you general up next the fate of the iran deal now in the hands of congress and what the president aposs actions on health care might mean for you two key senators join us to discuss the looming battles on capitol hill just ahead commercial break rosen president trump aposs frustration with the republican led congress for failing to help them deliver on some of his key campaign promises could mean an uphill battle ahead on capitol hill on everything from the iran deal to health care to immigration two key senators republicans bill cassidy of louisiana excuse me and democrat chris murphy of connecticut are here to discuss we begin here in washington with you senator murphy thanks for being here you are a member of both the foreign relations and the health committees so firstly what did you make of the remarks that you heard from general mcmaster sen chris murphy d conn foreign relations committee well you were right to point out that there aposs not a single advisor around the president that advised him to decertify the iran deal the fact of the matter is iran is complying with the agreement the white house is required to tell congress if they are not and they have submitted absolutely no submissions there is no chance that the deal is going to be renegotiated the iranians will not renegotiate it and neither will the europeans and so if we were to pull all of this agreement as the president is threatening iran would get everything they want they would be able to restart their nuclear program because we would be in violation of the deal the europeans would continue to grant them sanctions relief their economy would continue to grow and they would look like the victim in this situation so there is absolutely nothing that accrues to our national security benefit if we ultimately fall out of this deal and it is an absolute fantasy to suggest that we are going to be able to restart negotiations rosen still even the obama administration conceded a year ago that the nuclear deal far from having a salutary effect on the iran s regional behavior might actually have been emboldening it begin video clip rosen you can t rule out that in fact this deal has served as a cause for this more aggressive posture unidentified male i mean i can apost rule that out end video clip rosen so was in it high time senator that the nuclear deal specifically the threat of abrogating it be used to try to curb iran aposs more aggressive regional behavior murphy so importantly those of us that supported the iran deal did so with the knowledge that we could continue to pass additional sanctions to stop their other nefarious activity in the region and we did that earlier this year republicans and democrats joined together to pass new sanctions against iran aposs ballistic missile program but you know what the president hasn apost implemented those sanctions so the white house can apost complain that iran is still acting in the deleterious manner in the region and then not implement the powers that we have given him to try to stop that behavior we should be working together to take on their support for terrorism their ballistic missile program their miserable human rights record but if you allow them to get back on the path to a nuclear weapon their activity in the region supporting our enemies is even worse it aposs even more threatening to us if they become a nuclear power in that region that should be unacceptable and that aposs what the deal was about rosen you heard the president say the list of things that iran has been doing that had been not in compliance with this deal exceeding some of the enriched uranium stockpiles and so forth you aposre not bothered by any of that murphy the president and his advisors have made it absolutely clear notwithstanding the president s bizarre speech the iranians are in compliance with the agreement to the extent that there have been instances of noncompliance they ve gotten right back in compliance now the president s national security advisor is right military sites are not automatically subject to inspection but we have the right at any time if we believe that there was nuclear activity happening on those sites to request access we have never had a problem with a request we have never had an incident of noncompliance because of a request we made to get into those sites rosen all right let aposs move to health care you serve on the senate health education labor and pensions committee the trump administration as you know this past week directed the federal government to stop payments of cost sharing subsidies under obamacare the president called it a payoff to the insurance industry why do you and your fellow democrats oppose doing away with that murphy so this is the equivalent of health care arson he aposs really literally setting the entire health care system on fire just because the president is upset that the united states congress won apost pass a repeal bill that is supported by 17 percent of the american public these subsidies going to the insurance companies help very low income people afford insurance and without the subsidies there will be many people who won apost be able to provide insurance and afford it and the other set of subsidies that go to individuals to access coverage will actually increase meaning that the deficit goes up the amount of money that we spend overall on the affordable care act goes up because all that happens is the payments that used to be going to insurance companies now get substituted with increased tax credits for individuals to afford the coverage the fact of the matter is the president is trying to sabotage the american health care system trying to put a gun to the head of our constituents by taking away their health care or raising their costs in order to force us to repeal a bill that the american public doesn apost want us to repeal rosen arsons guns to the head this is pretty strong medicine in terms of the rhetoric in you know i remember after gabby giffords was shot we all wanted to tamp down the rhetoric and the use of these kinds of imagery and metaphor but let aposs move to in fact the atrocity out in las vegas where authorities are still investigating and trying to find a motive for this deadliest mass shooting in american history we re just two weeks away from that sickening event do you sense that the momentum on capitol hill to enact legislation to restrict gun ownership rights in some form or fashion perhaps the bump stocks has already subsided murphy i think there is willingness to take on this very narrow issue bump stocks which allow you to take a semiautomatic weapon and turn it into an automatic weapon but i do think that you re seeing the same pattern play out here thoughts and prayers from congress a little nibble of interest at legislative action and then we go back to the status quo i just think that we can t we can apost continue to pretend that are loose and lax gun laws don apost contribute to the rate of gun crime in this country nobody should have that kind of powerful weapon to be able to kill 50 people in a period of 10 to 15 minutes nobody should be able to turn that kind of weapon into an automatic weapon the vast of gun owners in my state support commonsense gun restrictions because they don apost need those kind of weapons to hunt and they don apost think that criminals should be able to buy weapons rosen would you be willing to accept new regulation of this bump stocks issue through atf instead of congressional action murphy my worry is that the atf didn apost do it in 2010 because the law is actually ambiguous and so i think if we all agree that people shouldn apost be able to turn these weapons into automatic weapons then let aposs just pass a law through congress i think that it aposs a punt for congress to tell the atf to do it when we know that the underlying problem is that the statue itself is very unclear on this matter rosen punting as a metaphor on a football infested sunday now that s appropriate senator murphy thank you very much for joining us here on fox news sunday murphy thanks a lot rosen coming up from baton rouge republican senator dr bill cassidy all right senator cassidy we appreciate you re there you re live in studio given that the republican led congress could not coalesce behind a legislative measure to repeal and replace obamacare something that congressional republicans and the president spent 2016 vowing that they would get done do you support the president s use of executive authority effectively to gut the affordable care act through administrative action sen bill cassidy r la health committee the president first james let me just push back the president is not gutting the affordable care act let aposs just take the cost sharing reduction payments as one example they re unconstitutional a court has said so and with the president focusing on middle class families who are paying 30 000 to 40 000 a year for premiums plus deductibles on top of this think about that 30 000 to 40 000 a year if there aposs something which is damaging the credibility of the affordable care act is these premiums which are unaffordable not that which the president is doing rosen senator not so long ago you counseled the president against the very health care decision that he made this week let aposs listen begin video clip cassidy we ve got to continue to think about that family around the kitchen table who cannot afford their premiums under the affordable care act as it now is so we do not wish to do anything we don apost want to make it worse for them now the short term continuation of the csr payments we call ph cost sharing reduction would be a part of that end video clip rosen so senator do you still believe today as you did just two months ago that termination of these payments is going to make things worse for that family around the kitchen table cassidy but first as i said they re unconstitutional if you played a little bit more of that clip you would have heard me say that i think congress should pass that short term extension and that s actually what the president is asking the payments are unconstitutional according to a court and his first responsibility is to uphold that but we absolutely have to think about that family around the kitchen table which is why i think congress should pass them republicans have been trying to do so but coupled with flexibility so that premiums can come down keep in mind with those payments that family is paying 30 000 to 40 000 a year we ve got to do something to lower their premiums and so if we continue on the short term have the regulatory flexibility to lower those costs and then do something like graham cassidy to correct things long term i think that aposs a good direction rosen but again in the absence of the congressional action that you advise the president now ordering the federal government to stop payments for these reimbursements is that going to help or hurt that family around the table yes or no cassidy if you if you take the totality of what the president did i think it actually helps the family so those who are lowest income the payments will still the subsidies will still go to insurance companies for them to buy their coverage and someone told me that the cbo said they might pay a little bit less if you speak about that family who s just above federal poverty level according to ehealth com a family of three making 82 000 a year according to the affordable care act definition cannot afford their current policy on the exchange they re making 82 000 a year and so 30 000 to 40 000 is beyond their reach the president also allowed flexibility for their employer to perhaps ban together in association health plans are for short term insurance to be sold that would be much lower in cost to allow them to purchase that which they can afford rosen all right cassidy right now they can apost afford let aposs give them a chance to buy something they can afford rosen senator some remarks made yesterday at the values voters summit here in washington by steve bannon president trump s former chief strategist is generating a lot of buzz online this morning particularly the threat that mr bannon issued to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell let aposs hear it begin video clip steve bannon former white house chief strategist up on capitol hill because i aposve been getting calls it aposs like before the ides of march they are just looking to find out who aposs going to be brutus to your julius caesar yes mitch the donors the donors are not happy they ve all left you we ve cut your oxygen off mitch end video clip rosen senator cassidy i need a quick answer from you do you regard steve bannon as a real threat to mitch mcconnell and the republican establishment cassidy i think where there aposs a real threat to the republican establishment is not addressing the needs of that family around the kitchen table if we take care of that family good policy is good politics rosen all right we ll await your thoughts on steve bannon for another occasion senator cassidy thank you for your time today up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss how the president s bold use of executive authority will impact obamacare and the americans who rely on it plus three weeks after maria puerto rico remains a disaster zone with most of the island still without power we ll assess the president aposs response to the crisis next commercial break james rosen fox anchor coming up president trump seeks the support of chuck and nancy begin video clip donald trump president of the united states what would be nice if the democratic leaders could come over to the white house we aposll negotiate some deal that aposs good for everybody end video clip rosen we aposll ask our sunday panel if a bipartisan deal can be reached on health care next commercial break begin video clip trump democrats should come to me i would even go to them because i aposm only interested in one thing getting great health care for this country end video clip rosen president trump calling for bipartisan support on health care reform just hours after he used executive authority to terminate payments for obamacare and it is time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove marie harf a state department official in the obama administration gerald seib from the wall street journal and the head of heritage action for america michael needham friends all welcome karl it aposs estimated that three out of five customers who rely on healthcare gov also rely on subsidies and the kind that the president ordered the federal government to stop paying this week that amounts to about 6 million people with our eyes on the 2018 midterms does that make smart political sense karl rove fox news contributor well the real question is did it make constitutional sense article one section nine of the constitution says no money shall be drawn from a treasury but in consequence of appropriation made by law senator murphy said this was health care arson i wonder what he would think if president trump said you know what i don apost need an appropriation from congress i aposm going to build a wall by just sending the money out of the treasury what if he said you know what i think the military needs more money i don apost care that the congress won apost appropriated it i aposm going to spend more money that aposs exactly what happened on this rosen all right rove so so yes it it it is constitutionally wrong now we aposve got to fix it and when we fix it we ought to simply piling more money into the subsidies into the insurance companies is not going to fund and fix the fundamental flaw to the affordable care act which is it is it is structured so that we don apost get enough younger healthier people in the process to subsidize the older less healthy people rosen those 6 million people might not make the subtle distinctions about article one that you just did and by the way we want the viewers to know that karl was reading from notes he did not have article one memorized michael needham i dug up i spent the weekend digging up old quotes of yours reliably criticizing president obama over the years for his use of executive authority here and there as unlawful a threat to our separation of powers government i will spare you the reading of these old quotes of yours i just want to know if president trump aposs use of executive orders and administrative authority on everything from health care to environmental policy troubles you just as much michael needham ceo heritage action for america no i mean it goes back to what karl just said nobody has a problem with executive action we have a constitutional system that sets up a very robust executive branch of government people had a problem with unconstitutional executive action obamacare is very clear there is no appropriation for bailouts to insurance companies now because obamacare is unstable the assumption that those bailouts would be given is critical to it and what president trump has done has said is that he aposs not going to continue to make those unconstitutional bailouts similarly president obama regulated short term limited duration health plans which are a great life boat away from obamacare for people who are suffering under it president trump is putting forth a proposal to allow those lifeboats to be used the challenge of obamacare is that it aposs so fundamentally unstable that when people start getting into the short term limited durations like boats it further destabilizes an incoherent plan when you stop making unconstitutional payments to insurance companies it starts destabilizing in a coherent plan the challenges with obamacare is not what the president faithfully executing the duties of his office rosen so the frequency of mr trump aposs resort to executive orders doesn apost bother you needham well i think the frequency of executive orders which has gotten you know much worse under president obama is obviously something that we need to go back to a constitutional system where the congress steps out does its job rosen all right needham both trump and president obama have been frustrated by a congress that can apost do its job we all want to get back to that separation of powers we should look at each of these individually and see whether the president is acting safely within the powers given to him and i think that this past week the president has rosen i aposm going to turn to iran and marie i aposm very happy for this opportunity to add to the existing body to rosen harf transcripts from all of those state department briefings we were in together marie harf fox news contributor i know i know rosen in withholding certification of iran aposs compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal the president and we aposll listen to him do it cited multiple violations begin video clip trump on two separate occasions they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water until recently the iranian regime has also failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges the iranian regime has also intimidated international inspectors end video clip rosen so does that sound like compliance to you harf well i think president trump is taking a few liberties here with some of the facts it is true on heavy water that when they were very briefly out of compliance they immediately came back in compliance rosen twice harf as you know twice that aposs right as you know these are very complicated arms control agreements and when there are implementation issues how you can judge an agreement is whether they can be resolved resolved quickly and today everyone including general mattis a number of other people general dunford have been very clear that iran is in compliance the president just doesn apost like the agreement i think because president obama was the one to do it also because he he wishes that it looked at things like ballistic missiles or support for terrorism and the fact is there are better ways to deal with all those other issues and to make sure iran is complying and crossing every t and dotting every i there are better ways to do that than threatening to blow the whole thing up or kicking it into congress which really throws it into this really uncertain place and i don apost have any faith that congress is going to do the right thing here rosen jerry seib is the president backing himself into a corner in essence by making his his sole leverage on this whole deal his willingness to walk away from it when if he does that the iranians can just flip the switch and made the mad dash towards a towards a bomb gerald f seib the wall street journal well look i mean we are entering a six month period of great uncertainty in which that question is going to be answered i mean especially what happens now is the guys behinds you ph in congress have to decide if they aposre going to re impose sanctions ironically people who don apost like the deal starting with senator tom cotton of arkansas do not want to move immediately to imposing the additional sanctions on iranians because that will blow up the deal the europeans will stay in the agreement the u s will walk away from it whether the iranians continue to comply with at that point or not who knows i think what aposs going to what the attempts now is going to be to get the iranians to renegotiate parts of this agreement i agree with senator murphy i don apost think that aposs very likely to happen so i think we aposre headed toward a situation in which congress is going to do what it usually does which is not very much and it will be six months from now in a situation which as you suggest the president aposs going to have to decide now do i pull the plug on the deal entirely or not i don apost know how that changes between now and then rosen all right panel we aposre going to take a break right here but when we come back president trump and republican senators bob corker aposs ongoing war of words the senate foreign relations chair now claiming the president is undermining his own secretary of state aposs diplomatic efforts that plus puerto rico when we come back commercial break begin video clip john kelly white house chief of staff i was not sent into or brought into control him and you should not measure my effectiveness as a chief of staff by what you think i should be doing end video clip rosen white house chief of staff general john kelly making a surprise appearance at thursday aposs daily press briefing in part to dispel speculation about his future in the west wing we are now back with our panel karl as a veteran of the katrina experience i do just want to ask you how you feel that president trump is responding he posted a tweet on thursday after he had already received a fair amount of criticism for his response to that crisis saying we cannot keep fema the military and the first responders who have been amazing under the most difficult circumstances in puerto rico forever how is he doing and what do you make of the criticism karl well this followed on his comment when he was on the ground in puerto rico saying well you know fortunately for you this isn apost a real disaster like katrina was which didn apost sell very well in a in an island that has 80 percent of its power gone in 40 percent of its water on and 80 percent of its cell phone towers down so my understanding is my sense is the administration aposs moving to rectify this by appointing a by appointing a recovery czar and they aposd be smart to do so rosen interesting all right a little bit of news here on the program that epic feud between president trump and its fellow republican bob corker of tennessee chairman of the senate foreign relations committee only intensified this past week with corker openly fretting that mr trump might be setting us quote on the path to world war iii for his part the president disparaged corker on twitter as little bob corker begin video clip unidentified female is that helpful to your agenda rep paul ryan r wis house speaker it aposs what he does and we aposve kind of learned to live with it rosen jerry seib we aposre all chuckling but i gather you have never seen anything like this in all your years in washington it is almost a mathematic certainty that one of these two men will pay a heavier price than the other for this who will that be seib well it aposs hard to see what bob corker has to lose at this point i mean he aposs not running for re election he aposs you know he barely considers himself part of the same party as president trump right now i think the odd situation is that the president has gotten himself alienated from bob corker who aposs the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and john mccain who aposs chairman of the senate armed services committee at a time when two very big national security issues the iran deal and north korea are coming to full blow i just don apost think that aposs a good situation now having said all that i think one of the things we aposve learned in the last eight or nine months is that you have to step back from the kind of junior high level rhetoric and look at what people do not what they say and my guess is bob corker will continue to work with the administration on the iran deal and john mccain will continue to work with the administration on north korea and in fact he had some good things to say about the president on his iran speech already this week so the rhetoric is probably worse than the reality but i don apost think the reality is perfect by any means rosen michael the president aposs supporters seem to like it seem to view it as kind of harry truman giving them hell when he goes after establishment figures in this way even when they are in his own party so my question to you is is there political capital to be derived from the president in his public criticism of a bob corker or a jeff sessions or a rex tillerson needham well i think the president is channeling a frustration that many americans around the country have both at a congress that is not capable of legislating of getting tax reform done of getting obamacare done and a republican establishment that has often been out of touch with the real anxieties that people face lest they be economic anxieties or a feeling that in washington d c that they don apost have voice and i think that aposs what the president is frustrated by that aposs what he aposs articulating by and we need to figure out as a party how do we come together how do we accept that this is a president who made a more correct diagnosis of where the country is than any of the establishment republicans who typically run for party or run for president how do we come alongside that diagnosis how do we tie it to principle and come forward with an agenda that unifies the party that aposs the act that we need to be involved in right now and it aposs a frustrating process and it aposs not going as well as it needs to be rosen but he was also more accurate than a lot of the posters and other wielders of big data who are supposed to have the answers of everything in advance all right let aposs turn to the democrats now senator dianne feinstein the 84 year old democrat from california who is the senate aposs oldest member announced this week she will seek re election for a fifth full term which if served in full would take ms feinstein past her 92nd birthday not long after announcement published reports indicated a likely primary challenge from this man kevin de leon leader of california aposs state senate mr de leon represents the los angeles area is 50 years old has close to a decade of experience in state politics and is latino marie harf as a democrat is it healthy for the party to have leaders like nancy pelosi and steny hoyer and dianne feinstein all of whom are in their late 70s even their mid 80s for a party that places such a premium on progressivism and novelty and youth harf well i don apost think age is the question right i think that any party that rosen that is my question harf well i aposm saying it shouldn apost be the question rosen all right harf any part that loses like we lost in 2016 should do soul searching i think that aposs natural right it always happens what aposs been interesting is that the republican party who won has this really serious level of infighting too that actually i aposve been a little surprised about so yes i think the democratic party needs new leaders we need a message that makes clear to middle class voters around the country why i believe and we believe our policies are best for them but look if the republican party is going to spend its time and it aposs money primary challenge and a bunch of republican senators instead of putting that money into ten democratic senate races where there are states where donald trump won in 2016 and we have venerable senators i aposm not sure this is going to be a win for the republicans sure we have problems on the democratic side but speaking to what we were just talking about the republican party has its own problems and 2018 at this point could really go either way rosen karl needham i appreciate the attempt to concern ph the republican party in response to a question about the attempted harf that in turn inaudible rosen it is now harf i like it needham i think it aposs interesting but i don apost think the debate is actually an unhealthy thing it aposs only liberals on college campuses who are afraid of a debate about the harf whoa the college campus liberals needham it aposs interesting actually if we want to talk about the democratic party that dianne feinstein who is a fierce opponent of the second amendment and has been fiercely against free speech on college campuses is insufficiently liberal for the hash tag left inaudible harf i don apost think it aposs i don apost think it aposs sufficiently liberal rosen so let me let me jump in here just to ask karl given your great vast experience with with campaigns and elections do you think that mr de leon would you place odds on him since he does seem to embody the more the current demographics of california would you place odds on him defeating senator feinstein karl i think she aposs formidable but look this isn apost just i agree with marie this is not just a question of age but i disagree with marie perhaps that age is not important age is important if you take a look at the age break that was in the democratic party in washington it is between people like seth moulton and tim ryan who say we need to have a message like marie said that appeals to a middle class that aposs not the big division of the democratic party an interesting piece in this week aposs new republican says can apost a socialist and the liberals get together and work together the democratic party outside of washington is split between a very hard left the resistance that has energy and enthusiasm and then you have the traditional liberals like dianne feinstein so de leon is going to going to appeal to the hard left of the democratic party that in opposition to this president is going even more hard left and spinning out of control rosen all right we have to leave it there just for the moment i too by the way am a newcomer to this term concerned troll ph it aposs time for a quick break but when we return president trump starts a new front in his culture war from the nfl to his pledge to return the country to its religious roots that aposs just ahead commercial break begin video clip trump before watching a football game you want to see those players be proud of their country respect our country respect our flag and respect our national anthem and we think they will we certainly hope they will end video clip rosen president trump using his weekly address to go after nfl players kneeling during the playing of the national anthem this a day after appealing to his evangelical base at the values voters summit promoting a return to traditional american values and we aposre back now for some bonus time with our panel jerry this week saw president trump become the first sitting president to visit the values voter summit here in washington let aposs listen to what he said begin video clip trump the american founders invoked our creator four times in the declaration of independence four times how times have changed but you know what now they aposre changing back again just remember that end video clip rosen so jerry are the times changing back again or do we see it as we look around us in america that it aposs more progressive than ever and perhaps accepting of things like same sex marriage seib yes it is both those things at the same time and that aposs why this was an interesting presentation by the president i mean the values voter and by the way who would have guessed this a few years ago that donald trump was the champion of the value voters but that aposs kind of what happened and they form a large part of the trump base right now and he is speaking to them and obviously the nfl protest which you referred to is an attempt to say something i think which was very important in 2016 and under appreciated which is a large part of the divide between hillary clinton voters and donald trump voters was cultural it was not economic it was cultural and this is now shot through every political issue we aposve seen it in our polling and you know conversations about issues like the nfl now play into that as well and i think it dominates the entire political conversation in some ways rosen karl it was at values voter where we saw steve bannon issue that direct threat to mitch we aposre turning off the spigots mitch et cetera we aposre cutting off your oxygen is steve bannon a genuine threat to mitch mcconnell and the republican establishment rove not really think about the candidates he aposs recruited the first candidate he went out and recruited to run for the house just got out of federal pen where he was for tax evasion michael graham rosen from my home town of staten island by the way rove exactly danny tarkadian ph he blessed him for a race for the united states senate he lost a race for state senate secretary of state a u s senator and two races for congress may be the sixth time will be the winning time for him rosen right rove how about the guy running in wyoming who lives in abu dhabi where he runs a security firm underwritten by a chinese company with state ties that provides security to chinese oil projects in africa i aposm not certain that people will want will be ready to elect somebody who aposs from abu dhabi rosen that aposs the first sentence in my life i aposve heard that name checks wyoming abu dhabi and china right all in the same sentence seib and karl does not have strong feelings about that at all rosen he wasn apost reading from notes michael the president in the remarks we just heard appear to be teeing up perhaps as his next culture class issue the so called war on christmas the real clear politics average of major reliable polling where the president aposs job approval rating is concerned places him right now at 38 percent briefly are these kinds of appeals going to be the thing that brings them above 50 percent needham well i think the number one challenge that our country has right now is a civic coming apart where there is not trust between our nation aposs elites and the rest of the country the rest of the country feels that our elites would rather be at davos or worrying about the problems of the world than worrying about real economic and other anxieties that people fell in this country there aposs not a lot of charities being funded by our nation aposs donor class that are dealing with mountain dew mouth in kentucky and so i think dealing with that culture war figuring out a way that instead of having a civic breaking we can have a civic reawakening that brings us apart is the most important challenge that we have as a nation clearly the president aposs doing it in a pretty very divisive way which i don apost think is going to be the way that we come together as a nation but we need to figure out how we pull ourselves together how we fight battles between a progressive left that does want to tear us away from our civic ties and do it in a way that aposs tied to policy and where the president can use that momentum to get things done rosen very quickly today aposs football games are the first sunday matchup since the league the commissioner wrote to team presidents and league executives urging them to try to persuade their players to stand during the national anthem marie harf two parts very quickly we have about 60 seconds do you believe racism to be endemic in american society yes or no harf in parts of it yes rosen and do you believe that these athletes are correct to use this pressure point of the playing of the national anthem in order to press their point harf absolutely and i think that they should be listened to i think that the issues they aposre raising should be discussed in a serious sustained way and not just be put aside because the president is trying to make this about patriotism and it aposs not these players have said we are patriotic we love this country but there are serious issues we have to talk about and we aposre not as a nation having that conversation i want that to be the conversation not these divisive cultural wars that the president aposs trying to rely on because he aposs got nothing else done like health care or tax reform or infrastructure that aposs what i want to see rosen he aposs got some things done his name is neil gorsuch and he sits on the supreme court harf and that aposs the that aposs the only thing that people can point to in terms of legislative accomplishment they haven apost done health care they haven apost done tax reform they haven apost done a number of things that he ran on and promised and so i think he aposs going back to these cultural war to get his base fired up it aposs not
