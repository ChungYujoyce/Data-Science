tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap president donald trump has a silent partner behind several of the accomplishments he likes to boast about barack obama despite assailing his democratic predecessor for waging a cruel and heartless war on american energy for example trump can brag about u s energy supremacy thanks to the sector s growth in the obama years and the obama trump decade is soon to yield an economic record if things stay on track a little longer the most sustained expansion in u s history though trump claims all the credit the expansion started in obama s first year continued through his presidency and has been maintained under trump top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey there are no fist bumps in the offing however the past week saw the kickoff of trump s 2020 campaign with a rally in florida and interviews outside his usual comfort zone on fox news such events provided trump a platform that he used to exaggerate what he s done take some factually challenged swipes at obama and democrats at large and make promises that will be hard to keep a sampling migrants trump on separating children from adults at the mexican border you know under president obama you had separation i was the one that ended it interview broadcast sunday on nbc s meet the press trump when i became president president obama had a separation policy i didn t have it he had it i brought the families together i m the one that brought em together now i said something when i did that i m the one that put people together they separated i put em together interview with telemundo broadcast thursday jose diaz balart interviewer you did not the facts trump is not telling the truth the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents resulted from his zero tolerance policy obama had no such policy after a public outcry and a court order trump generally ceased the practice and reunited families his policy had driven apart zero tolerance meant that u s authorities would criminally prosecute all adults caught crossing into the u s illegally doing so meant detention for adults and the removal of their children while their parents were in custody during the obama administration such family separations were the exception they became the practice under trump s policy which he suspended a year ago before trump s zero tolerance policy migrant families caught illegally entering the u s were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings not requiring separation unless they were known to have a criminal record then and now immigration officials may take a child from a parent in certain cases such as serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns trump on detention centers at the border president obama is the one that built those prison cells telemundo interview trump president obama built the cages remember when they said that i built them meet the press interview the facts he has a point whether they are called prison cells or something else obama held children in temporary ill equipped facilities and built a large center in mcallen texas that is used now democrats routinely and inaccurately blame trump for creating cages for children they are actually referring to chain link fencing inside the mcallen center obama s creation conditions for detained migrants deteriorated sharply during a surge of central american arrivals under trump particularly in el paso texas trade trump this will be the largest trade deal ever made and it won t even be close if you take a look at the numbers second is so far away you don t even call it second so it s very exciting and very exciting for mexico very exciting for canada remarks thursday with canadian prime minister justin trudeau the facts that s wrong simply by virtue of the number of trade partners involved the proposed new agreement replacing the north american free trade agreement covers the same three countries the trans pacific partnership negotiated by the obama administration included the three nafta partners united states canada and mexico plus japan and eight other pacific rim countries trump withdrew the united states from the pact on his third day in office even the pacific deal pales in comparison with one that did go into effect with the u s on board the uruguay round concluded in 1994 the round of negotiations created the world trade organization and was signed by 123 countries the federal reserve bank of boston said the wto s initial membership accounted for more than 90 percent of global economic output trump on his tariffs we are taking in billions and billions of dollars into our treasury we have never taken 10 cents from china rally tuesday in orlando florida the facts it s false to say the u s never collected a dime in tariffs on chinese goods before he took action they are simply higher in some cases than they were before it s also wrong to suggest that the tariffs are being paid by china tariff money coming into the treasury is mainly from u s businesses and consumers not from china tariffs are primarily if not entirely a tax paid domestically iran trump president obama made a desperate and terrible deal with iran gave them 150 billion dollars plus i 8 billion dollars in cash iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out gave them a free path to nuclear weapons and soon instead of saying thank you iran yelled death to america i terminated deal tweet friday trump on his accomplishments and then terminating one of the worst deals ever made the iran deal that was made by president obama paid 150 billion paid 1 8 billion in cash i terminated that and iran is a much different country fox news interview wednesday the facts there was no 150 billion payout from the u s treasury the money he refers to represents iranian assets held abroad that were frozen until the international deal was reached and tehran was allowed to access its funds the payout of about 1 8 billion is a separate matter that dates to the 1970s when iran paid the u s 400 million for military equipment that was never delivered because the government was overthrown and diplomatic relations ruptured that left people businesses and governments in each country indebted to partners in the other and these complex claims took decades to sort out in tribunals and arbitration for its part iran paid settlements of more than 2 5 billion to u s citizens and businesses the day after the nuclear deal was implemented the u s and iran announced they had settled the claim over the 1970s military equipment order with the u s agreeing to pay the 400 million principal along with about 1 3 billion in interest the 400 million was paid in cash and flown to tehran on a cargo plane which gave rise to trump s dramatic accounts of money stuffed in barrels or boxes and delivered in the dead of night the arrangement provided for the interest to be paid later not crammed into containers energy trump since i came in we re the number one energy producer in the world ok meet the press interview trump we ve ended the last administration s cruel and heartless war on american energy what they were doing to our energy should never be forgotten the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world orlando rally trump we re now no 1 in the world in energy fox news interview wednesday the facts as he s done many times before trump is crediting himself with things that happened under obama here s what the government s u s energy information administration says the united states has been the world s top producer of natural gas since 2009 when u s natural gas production surpassed that of russia and the world s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013 when u s production exceeded saudi arabia s jobs trump almost 160 million people are working that s more than ever before orlando rally the facts true but that s a tribute to americans making babies and immigrants coming to the country population growth in other words other than during recessions employment growth has been trending upward since 1939 when the labor department started counting the phenomenon is not a marker of leadership it has spanned successful and failed presidents more on point the annual rate of job growth has been within the same range since roughly 2011 it was 1 6 through may another measure is the proportion of americans with jobs and that is still below record highs the labor department says 60 6 percent of people in the u s 16 years and older were working in may that s below the all time high of 64 7 percent in april 2000 during bill clinton s administration though higher than the 59 9 percent when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 trump women s unemployment is now the lowest it s been in 74 years orlando rally the facts no the jobless rate for women of 3 1 in april was the lowest in 66 years not 74 and it ticked up in may to 3 2 economy trump it s soaring to incredible new heights perhaps the greatest economy we ve had in the history of our country orlando rally the facts the economy is not one of the best in the country s history it expanded at an annual rate of 3 2 percent in the first quarter of this year that growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under trump growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and simply hasn t hit historically high growth rates trump has legitimate claim to a good economy but when it comes to records there s one he will have to share with obama the economy is on track to achieve its longest expansion ever in july much of that decade long growth came during obama s presidency an achievement that trump so far has largely sustained other than in its durability the economy is far from the finest in history the wall trump we ll have over 400 miles built by the end of next year fox news interview wednesday trump we re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year it s moving very rapidly orlando rally the facts that s highly unlikely and even if so the great majority of the wall he s talking about would be replacement barrier not new miles of construction trump has added strikingly little length to barriers along the mexico border despite his pre eminent 2016 campaign promise to get a wall done even to reach 400 miles or 640 kilometers he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to find more money to get anywhere close so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but that initiative has been constrained by court cases that are still playing out in any event all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts so far would replace existing barriers taxes trump we ve done so much with the biggest tax cut in history orlando rally the facts his tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in u s history it s a 1 5 trillion tax cut over 10 years as a share of the total economy a tax cut of that size ranks 12th according to the committee for a responsible federal budget president ronald reagan s 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed world war ii post reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant president george w bush s cuts in the early 2000s and obama s renewal of them a decade later environment trump our water and our air today is cleaner than it ever was our air it s the best it ever was fox news interview wednesday trump our air and water are the cleanest they ve ever been by far orlando rally the facts not true about air quality which hasn t gotten better under the trump administration u s drinking water is among the best by one leading measure after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled over the last two years the u s had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier federal data show there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 the four years when america had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980 the obama administration in fact set records for the fewest air polluted days in 2016 on water yale university s global environmental performance index finds 10 countries tied for the cleanest drinking water the u s among them on environmental quality overall the u s was 27th behind a variety of european countries canada japan australia and more switzerland was no 1 judges trump on the confirmation of federal judges president obama was very nice to us he didn t fill the positions orlando rally the facts trump s sarcasm aside he does have a better success rate than obama in filling judicial vacancies the republican controlled senate in obama s last two years avoided taking action on many of his nominees republicans still control the senate and have been able to confirm about 120 of trump s picks despite their slim majority that s about 35 more than obama had confirmed at this point in his presidency health care trump we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions always orlando rally the facts his administration s actions say otherwise it is pressing in court for full repeal of obama s health law which requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who had medical problems before or when they signed up trump and other republicans say they ll have a plan to preserve protections for people with pre existing conditions but the white house has provided no details abortion trump leading democrats have even opposed measures to prevent the execution of children after birth orlando rally the facts executing children is already a crime trump is offering here a somewhat toned down version of a distorted story he s been telling for months that falsely suggests democrats are ok with murder his account arises from extremely rare instances when babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion when these cases occur execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age veterans trump we passed va choice they ve been trying to get that passed also for about 44 years orlando rally the facts no congress approved the private sector veterans choice health program in 2014 and obama signed it into law trump signed an expansion of it associated press writers josh boak christopher rugaber matthew daly seth borenstein ricardo
