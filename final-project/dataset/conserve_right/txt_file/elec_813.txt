hillary plays to dem base with gun control pitch survey says d oh check your privilege gop establishmentevery republican can be happy that there will not be a runoff election in north carolina s senate race while not all are thrilled that the nominee is state house speaker thom tillis the moderate favorite of the gop establishment his convincing win shows party unity and avoids an expensive damaging 10 week runoff election democrats meanwhile can be uniformly glum that the gop settled on a nominee quickly and one who sounds an awful lot like republican sen richard burr who has twice won handily in the light red state but rather than showing a little patriotic grace some in the republican establishment gave in to the temptation of smack talk against the insurgency struggling for

mcconnell i have always thought was a principled force for good in an evil evil place which is why it is so shocking to see the senate minority leader knee deep in the manure of slanderous lies being

obamacare insurance dumpdaily beast patients with preexisting medical conditions like diabetes drive health spending but those who undergo expensive procedures such as organ transplants are a burden to the company as well since most big corporations are self insured shifting even one high cost member out of the company plan could save the employer hundreds of thousands of dollars a year while increasing the cost of claims absorbed by the marketplace policy by a similar amount and the health law might not prohibit it opening a door to potential erosion of employer based coverage it s unclear how many companies if any have moved sicker workers to exchange coverage which became available only in january but even a few high risk patients could add millions of dollars in costs to those plans the costs could be passed on to customers in the form of higher premiums and to taxpayers in the form of higher subsidy expense moving high cost workers to a marketplace plan would not trigger penalties under the health law as long as an employer offered an affordable companywide plan with minimum coverage experts said a new forecast from the nation s leading small business group

of administration foreign policy david ignatius tells the president to suck it up everything he says is measured and most of it is correct but he acts as if he s talking to a rational world as opposed to one inhabited by leaders such as russia s vladimir putin in the realm of power politics u s presidents get points not for being right but for being or appearing strong presidents either say they re going to knock the ball out of the park or they say nothing the intangible factors of strength and credibility so easy to mock are in fact the glue of a rules based international system under obama the united states has suffered some real reputational damage i say that as someone who sympathizes with many of obama s foreign policy goals this damage unfortunately has largely been self inflicted by an administration that focuses too much on short term messaging at key turning points in egypt and libya during the arab spring in syria in ukraine and yes inbenghazi the administration was driven

early psychologists who studied trauma were concerned about its negative effects and not surprisingly that is what they learned about but more recent studies have searched for positive outcomes of
