media are furious accusing mr trump of politicizing the annual celebration of the country s founding msnbc host chris matthews said mr trump s vision for independence day bears a closer resemblance to the chest thumping displays put on by authoritarian regimes like china msnbc pundit jeremy bash said mr trump s tribute to the military is dangerous it s fundamentally un american mr bash said on hardball it politicizes a nonpartisan celebration of we the people of our declaration of independence the top house democrat with oversight over the national mall said wednesday she will probe the administration s decision to shift money to pay for the celebration rep betty mccollum minnesota democrat and chairwoman of the subcommittee that oversees national park service spending called the president s plans to tap park user fees absolutely outrageous these fees are not a slush fund for this administration to use at will ms mccollum said they are meant to improve our national parks keep them safe and protected for americans to enjoy and are clearly not to be used for a political rally mr trump downplayed the cost of the event tweeting that the expense will be very little compared to what it is worth we own the planes we have the pilots the airport is right next door andrews all we need is the fuel the president tweeted we own the tanks and all fireworks are donated by two of the greats nice rep don beyer virginia democrat said the president s plan reveals an insecure man displaying his need for celebrity i grew up here in washington and i ve been to the salute on the mall many many times and it s always been nonpartisan mr beyer said on cnn this must be the most insecure man i ve ever seen because everything has to be about him this bringing in the military we ve never seen something like that it reminds me of some small autocratic country trump campaign national press secretary kayleigh mcenanany tweeted leave it to the left to find a reason to hate on the salute to america july 4th celebration literally anything involving realdonaldtrump they resist obstruct from humanitarian aid for illegal immigrant s to a 4th of july celebration featuring our military she

billion of the chronically underfunded park system sierra club executive director michael brune said mr trump is stealing nearly 2 5 million from the country s people and parks on a day intended to celebrate america s freedom from tyranny donald trump is putting on an authoritarian circus for his wealthy circle of donors once again showing his complete lack of understanding of who and what america is and should be mr brune said trump is putting himself above the people the future of the lands americans have fought for and our history a new gallup poll this week found that only 22 of democrats feel extremely proud of the u s the lowest reading in the survey s 19 years of measurement gallup found that 76 of republicans feel extremely proud of their country overall 45 of u s adults said they are extremely proud to be americans also the lowest since gallup started asking the question in 2001 record low american patriotism is the latest casualty of the sharply polarized political climate in the u s today gallup said the decline reflects plummeting pride among democrats since trump took office even as republican pride has edged higher most republicans have remained extremely proud of their country over the years even when barack obama was president republicans extreme pride never fell below 68 gallup said bailey vog
