apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap frustrated by a divided congress and rifts within his own party president donald trump is giving little indication in his latest budget proposal of any new policy ambitions for the coming two or six years trump s budget plan increases spending on his border wall and the military but is light on fresh ideas heading into his re election campaign his budget for the next fiscal year which has little chance of advancing in congress largely focuses on deep spending cuts and pushing more money toward established goals such as his long promised wall improving care of veterans and combating opioid abuse budgets may offer a president s vision for the direction of the nation but trump s latest also offers an early window into his upcoming campaign top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots with the democratic race to unseat him heating up trump is contending with middling approval ratings energized democrats and political vulnerabilities in critical states like his predecessors he ll soon be called on to complete the politically loaded phrase send me back to the white house so that i can i think as he gets closer to 2020 he will need to lay out what a second term would look like said republican consultant alex conant voters always want to know what have you done for me lately if he doesn t paint a picture of what his second term will look like then the democrats will do it for him the white house argues that trump isn t just advancing the same policies a second time over he s enhancing them with more detail than his first go round particularly in the area of trade policy following a state of the union address that contained little new policy the budget is hardly a surprise still the budget can serve more than one political purpose argued former trump campaign aide barry bennett who said the document highlights trump s clashes with democrats over border and military funding he argued that the democratic tilt to the left also will benefit trump as he seeks to frame the argument bennett said trump s pitch can be if your paycheck likes what i ve done send me back if you don t they ll undo it all trump has already addressed much of his laundry list agenda from 2016 notching victories in many areas while seeking to minimize losses and mixed results he has cut taxes exited global accords and installed conservative judges on the courts including two supreme court justices he has not succeeded in replacing president barack obama s health care law is still working on renegotiating trade deals and has struggled to secure all the funding he wants for his border wall in all the efforts have largely pleased his political base but satisfaction with past performance is hardly a reliable tactic for expanding your support thus far trump s re election campaign moves have been laser focused on maintaining his most ardent supporters it s a risky wager laid down by the president himself that he can overcome weakness with moderate and independent voters by turning out even more loyalists in 2020 than he did in 2016 during his aggressive push to maintain the gop s hold over the senate during the midterm elections trump emphasized his hardline immigration rhetoric above all else he has returned again and again to his long promised border wall even forcing the government to partially shut down in an effort to win funding the latest budget also calls for repealing obamacare limiting future federal spending on medicaid for people with lower incomes as well as breaking out the new space force as its own military branch we believe that every budget is an opportunity to put forward our vision for the next 10 years said acting budget director russell vought trump s gamble has skeptics among some in the president s inner circle who have pushed the president and the white house to embrace larger policy ideas designed to win over moderates and independents aides point to trump s cautious embrace of a family medical leave policy pushed by his daughter ivanka trump as the sort of proposal trump s team should spend more time developing ahead of 2020 she is backing new funding for child care in the current proposal a white house backed infrastructure plan the hobbyhorse of washington election year policy appears no closer to fruition than when trump first raised it two years ago with his budget allocation unchanged from previous years trump s nascent re election campaign has just begun staffing up for 2020 with a focus on developing a more professionalized operation than 2016 but has yet to announce a policy staff trump s light policy load is also a function of his increasingly strained relationship with congress under divided control the white house views it as unlikely that any new proposals can win legislative approval and plan to be judicious
