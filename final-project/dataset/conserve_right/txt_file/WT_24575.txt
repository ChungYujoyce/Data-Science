tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn new york wherever cnn white house correspondent jim acosta goes he s followed by the g word grandstand he even heard it when he met ted olson the former u s solicitor general who was part of the legal team that beat back president donald trump s attempt to pull acosta s reporting pass i can t believe there is grandstanding going on at the white house olson told him and they both laughed acosta recounts in his new book usually it s no laughing matter trump s detractors love acosta s willingness to talk back to the president in attention getting confrontations trump s supporters seethe acosta takes trump on again with the book the enemy of the people which uses as its title the derisive phrase the president calls the press top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick the incident that required olson s intervention came after a contentious white house news conference last november at which acosta was called on and said i wanted to challenge you on one of the statements that you made in the tail end of the campaign in the midterms here we go trump said and off they went it ended with a back and forth about how many questions acosta got to ask and a white house intern unsuccessfully trying to grab acosta s microphone the administration later pulled acosta s pass to the white house grounds triggering the court battle won by cnn jim acosta is just somebody who gets up and grandstands trump later told the daily caller in an interview he doesn t even know what he s asking you half the time conservative activists l brent bozell and tim graham unloaded on acosta in their own book unmasked big media s war against trump no man in the world of journalism has made a mockery of his profession quite like this man they wrote he lives to be obnoxious washington post media columnist erik wemple countered that news organizations are free to choose reporters with their own styles yes it s grandstanding and who cares wemple said in an online commentary acosta mostly deflects the question in an interview although he said he takes exception to the characterization he takes it on much more strongly in his book call me a showboater or a grandstander or fake news he wrote i will go to my grave convinced deep down in my bones that journalists are performing a public service for the good of the country the country is better off with reporters in the white house briefing room asking the hard questions even if we sometimes sound a little over the top that noise is the sound that a healthy functioning democracy makes after a series of unexploded pipe bombs were sent to cnn and others acosta tried to get white house press secretary sarah sanders to state publicly which outlets and journalists the administration considered enemies of the people if anyone thinks he was showboating acosta writes they can shove it acosta said he wrote the book because he didn t want his two

and subject to angry chants when they work a trump rally acosta criticizes sanders and her predecessor sean spicer with whom he had plenty of verbal sparring matches when the white house conducted regular press briefings he s offended by his sense that trump aides aren t motivated to serve the public that pays their salaries acosta also writes that there are not two sides to a story when it is a matter of right and wrong as examples he cites the separation of migrant children from their families and trump s comments after a demonstration that included white supremacists in charlottesville virginia that there were good people on both sides so will acosta takes sides when right and wrong are not clear cut he said he s not referring to debates over tax policy or climate change for example but he said he had no problem telling trump in one encounter mr president there are no fine people in the nazis white house reporters never expected to spend so much time fact checking an
