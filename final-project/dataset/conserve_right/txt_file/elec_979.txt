trump took the stage thursday at the republican presidential debate delving into policy avoiding personal insults and refusing to take the bait when prodded by his rivals the billionaire businessman and front runner for the nomination made good on a pledge to adopt a softer tone cognizant that his rebellious persona threatened to become a liability and he needed to act presidential so far i cannot believe how civil it has been up here mr trump said at the university of miami in a debate sponsored by the washington times cnn and salem media group see also donald trump doubles down on islam hates america claim he adopted the new debate style at an opportune moment the debate just days before big primaries in florida and ohio marked a crucial juncture in the race when either mr trump will solidify his lead or opposing forces will come together to block him the winner take all contests tuesday also promise to narrow the field if sen marco rubio of florida and ohio gov john kasich can t win their home states that would put mr trump and sen ted cruz of texas in a mano a mano fight for the republican nomination it was a dramatic change from the rowdy tenor and personal barbs traded at the debate last week in michigan where mr trump alluded to the large size of his penis and branded mr rubio as little marco see also donald trump says he doesn t condone violence at rallies this time the candidates sparred over trade immigration social security and who has the wherewithal to stand up to the washington establishment mr trump moved quickly to preempt attacks on his business using immigration laws to bring highly skilled foreign workers into the united states often at the expense of american workers it s something that i frankly use and i shouldn t be allowed to use it he said we shouldn t have it very very bad for workers and second of all i think it s very important to say well i m a businessman and i have to do what i have to do he called for a one or two year halt on the visa program for highly skilled workers known as h 1b early in the debate mr trump made a plea for the republican party establishment which has skewed the tycoon to embrace the movement he spurred and brought millions of new voters into the process to support him they re voting out of enthusiasm they re voting out of love mr trump said we re taking people from the democrat party we re taking people as independents and they re all coming out and the whole world is talking about it it s very exciting i think frankly the republican establishment or whatever you want to call it should embrace what s happening he said that his army of new voters would beat hillary clinton or whoever it may be and we re going to beat them soundly mr rubio challenged mr trump s plan to leave social security intact and shore up the retirement program by cutting fraud and making foreign governments pay for u s military protection it s my absolute intention to leave social security as is mr trump said mr rubio who wants to gradually raise the retirement age and reduce benefits said the savings identified by mr trump were a mere fraction of the deficit that will bankrupt social security in 20 years you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficits you have to make up he said mr trump responded that he can save money throughout the government by making good deals that are not manipulated by lobbyists i m self funding my campaign i don t take anybody s money said mr trump mr cruz was the one to launch the sharpest attacks on mr trump including a challenge of the businessman s willingness to stand up to lobbyists the washington establishment and democrats whom mr trump funded in the past if you are fed up with washington you should ask who is willing to take on washington he said if you are funding the democrats and funding washington establishment it s hard to imagine how this person will stand up to washington mr trump wasn t fazed i will say this we are all in this together we are going to come up with solutions we are going to find the answers to things mr trump said at one point mr rubio schooled mr trump on a foreign policy question asked whether the u s should open relations with cuba mr trump remained vague saying he would make a strong solid good deal he added that he would close the embassy in cuba until such a deal was met as to avoid reparations and litigation i don t know that cuba is going to sue us but if they sue in a court in miami they are going to lose mr rubio said to thunderous applause and laughs from the audience nothing will change for the cuban people said mr rubio the son of cuban immigrants things are worse than they were before this opening we re getting nothing in return mr cruz whose father is cuban joined in against mr trump saying the businessman simply doesn t understand the issues his answer to everything is that everything would be better if only someone smarter were in government he said mr trump kept mum but in another exchange mr trump doubled down on his claim that islam hates america asked whether he meant that all 1 6 billion muslims worldwide hate the united states mr trump replied i mean a lot of them i mean a lot of them there s tremendous hatred and i will stick with exactly what i said mr rubio criticized mr trump saying his comment has a real impact with muslims worldwide and pointing out that muslims serve in the u s military they love america mr rubio said as far as i know no one on this stage has served in uniform in the united states military mr cruz challenged mr trump on his trade policy noting that his proposed 45 percent tax on imports would hurt american consumers if you can t pay the bills how does it help you to have a president to then come and say i m going to jack up i m going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers on automobiles when you buy automobiles on clothing when you buy clothing mr cruz asked mr trump hit back saying his trade policy would actually have the opposite effect but on the curious grounds that it s only a threat the 45 percent tax isn t a tax it s a threat it will be a tax if they don t change mr cruz a tea party champion who nevertheless emerged as the establishment s best bet to derail the runaway trump train has increasingly called for the party to unite behind him and possibly deliver him the nomination at a brokered convention in july in cleveland mr cruz has been the only contender to keep up with mr trump in the delegate race the big contests tuesday will determine whether the texan narrows the gap or falls further behind head to head not only do i beat donald trump but i defeat him resoundingly mr cruz said wednesday at a fox news forum for mr rubio the debate was a last chance to salvage his flagging campaign he has been losing ground in the polls and recent primary elections if he can t pull off a comeback win in his home state of florida he will likely drop out of the race marco s going to be a different person he will be mortally wounded mr trump told cnn heading into the debate the billionaire businessman and reality tv star topped most polls in florida with double digit leads dave boyer and kelly riddell contributed to this report from washington copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view
