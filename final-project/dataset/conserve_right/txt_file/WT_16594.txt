apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the 10 minute maiden test flight of china s newest stealth fighter jet the j 31 sparked intense debate among the world s weapons and intelligence communities that s because little is known about the aircraft which china boasts is the only other fifth generation stealth light combat aircraft in the world after the u s air force f 35 on oct 31 the shenyang j 31 also known as the falcon eagle took off after some high speed runway taxiing it was accompanied by two of china s j 11 fighter jets video clips released by chinese authorities indicate that the j 31 is a twin engine midsized fighter jet with a stealth design similar to that of the f 35 it too has forward swept engine intake cowls and is significantly smaller than china s first stealth combat aircraft the much touted chengdu j 20 top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore the released videos also show dense smoke trailing from the aircraft a sign of incomplete burning of fuel international attention has focused on two major issues surrounding the j 31 first china appears to have encountered major technical problems in developing its own jet engines for combat aircraft many analysts think the j 31 is powered by a russian designed engine known as the klimov rd 93 a second issue is the mission of the j 31 with china facing international embarrassment over its inability to deploy carrier based planes aboard its much glorified aircraft carrier the liaoning which was commissioned in late september design features of the j 31 suggest that the aircraft is being considered for use on the liaoning it is significantly lighter than the j 20 it also has a twin engine power plant twin forward wheels and rear wheels that are in the kneeling position as analysts

in orphanages and adoption agencies have been alarming virtually all children adopted overseas from chinese parents are girls china also possesses the dubious honor of having the world s highest
