later the longest living chief executive in american history is re emerging from political obscurity at age 94 to win over his fellow democrats once again a peanut farmer turned politician then worldwide humanitarian carter is carving out a unique role as several democratic candidates look to his family run campaign after the watergate scandal as the roadmap for toppling president donald trump in 2020 jimmy carter is a decent well meaning person someone who people are talking about again given the time that we are in minnesota sen amy klobuchar said in an interview he won because he worked so hard and he had a message of truth and honesty i think about him all the time top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed firm

carters including attending the former president s sunday school lesson in plains carter had planned to teach at maranatha baptist church again sunday but he is still recuperating at home days after being discharged from a georgia hospital where he had hip replacement surgery following a fall as he was preparing for a turkey hunt an extraordinary person buttigieg told reporters after meeting carter a guiding light and inspiration booker said in a statement klobuchar has attended carter s church lesson as well and says she emails with him occasionally he signs them jc she said with a laugh it s quite a turnabout for a man who largely receded from party politics after his presidency often without being missed by his party s leaders in washington where he was an outsider even as a white house resident to be sure more 2020 candidates have quietly sought counsel from trump s predecessor former president barack obama several have talked with former president bill clinton who left office in 2001 but those huddles have been more hush hush disclosed through aides dishing anonymously sessions with carter on the other hand are trumpeted on social media and discussed freely suggesting an appeal that obama and clinton may not have unlike clinton impeached after an affair with a white house intern carter has no metoo demerits he and rosalynn married since the end of world war ii didn t even like to dance with other people at state dinners and unlike obama popular among democrats but polarizing for conservatives and gop leaning independents carter is difficult to define by current political fault lines he s an outspoken evangelical christian who criticizes trump s serial falsehoods yet praises trump for attempting a relationship with north korean leader kim jong un carter touts his own personal relationship with russian president vladimir putin another trump favorite i have his email address carter said last september for years carter has irked the foreign policy establishment with forthright criticism of israel and its treatment of palestinians he confirms that he voted for vermont sen bernie sanders a democratic socialist over hillary clinton in georgia s 2016 presidential primary in 2017 carter welcomed sanders who s running again this year to the carter center for a program in which the two men lambasted money in politics carter called the united states an oligarchy yet carter has since warned democrats against too liberal a program lest they ensure trump s re election klobuchar credited carter with being ahead of his time on several issues including the environment and climate change he put solar panels on the white house health care a major step toward universal coverage failed mostly because party liberals though it didn t go far enough and government streamlining an effort that angered some democrats at the time but she also alluded to how his presidency ended a landslide loss after gas lines inflation then unemployment and a 14 month long hostage crisis in iran their administration was not perfect she said it s enough of an enigma that carter is the only living president not to draw trump s ire or mockery even if republicans have lambasted carter for decades as a liberal incompetent trump and carter chatted by phone earlier this spring after carter sent trump a letter on china and trade both men said they had an amiable conversation nonetheless 2020 candidates cite carter s juxtaposition with trump there was a feeling that people had been betrayed in our democracy by someone who wasn t telling the truth she said referring to president richard nixon s resignation in 1974 buttigieg said he and carter talked about being viewed as coming out of nowhere and how carter ran two general election campaign entirely on the public financing system that now sits unused as candidates collectively raise money into the billions klobuchar recalled carter telling her that family members would disperse to different states and then they would all come back on friday go back through the questions they had gotten then he would talk about how he would answer them so they d all be prepared on their next trips she said it was a different era klobuchar added recalling that carter said he felt hi tech because they had a fax machine on his plane indeed klobuchar born in 1960 wasn t old enough to vote for carter until he sought a second term booker 50 recalls voting for carter but in a grade school mock election buttigieg 37 wasn t even born when carter left office nonetheless klobuchar said she regularly meets iowans who remember carter and his family members campaigning in 1975 before his rivals and national media recognized his strength and she said she sometimes references on the campaign trail how her fellow minnesotan and carter s vice president walter mondale remembers their term we obeyed the law we told the truth we kept the peace whatever the reasons for the renewed attention carter allies say they hope the 2020 campaign is part of bolstering his reputation as a president people are tired of hearing that he was a better ex president than president said dubose porter a former georgia democratic chairman who has known the carters for decades of course he s done amazing things at the carter center
