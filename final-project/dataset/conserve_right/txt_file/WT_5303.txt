service higher costs and other problems and taxes will go up on the middle class under their plan their government run health care plans would eliminate private health insurance plans for 150 million

america when barack obama and joe biden were in office many areas of the country were a mess unemployment was high and wages were down under donald trump and mike pence the country is on the right track we faced similar challenges when i was running for governor in wisconsin back in 2010 the unemployment rate at the start of that year was 9 3 percent the state faced a 3 6 billion structural deficit they raided the transportation fund and the fund to pay patients and families for medical malpractice in 2010 there was a waiting list for people living in poverty to obtain health coverage under medicaid the democrats cut aid to schools and other local governments forcing layoffs and program cuts and property taxes went up 27 percent during the decade prior to our tenure after the 2010 elections republicans in the state legislature and i took over state government the unemployment rate dropped to an all time low of less than 3 percent and more people were working in the state than ever before our state budget had a surplus every year in office the rainy day was 190 times larger than when we first took office and we paid off the raids on segregated funds schools and local governments saved billions of dollars that went into services we eliminated the waiting list for health care coverage property taxes actually went down and the overall tax burden is more than 13 trillion lower than when we took office common sense conservative reforms work in wisconsin and in washington we just need leaders who are not afraid to implement them scott walker was the 45th
