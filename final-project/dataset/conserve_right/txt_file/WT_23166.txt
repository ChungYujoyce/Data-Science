apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion south korean newspaper chosun ilbo reported last week that north korea executed five foreign ministry officials in march because of the collapse of the february 2019 vietnam summit between president trump and north korean leader kim jong un in addition kim yong chol secretary of state mike pompeo s counterpart reportedly was sentenced to forced labor two press reports indicate the chosun ilbo story was at least partially erroneous kim yong chol was spotted at an event with kim jong un on june 2 according to the new york times cnn reported on june 4 that another north korean official who reportedly was executed special envoy to the united states kim hyok chol is alive but in state custody this official reportedly is under investigation for his role in the failure of the vietnam summit and could face heavy punishment top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore mr kim s reported backlash against officials who supported him at the vietnam summit is consistent with what i was told in meetings with south korean and u s military officials during a washington times foundation fact finding trip to south korea last month our delegation learned that mr kim s anger and humiliation over the failure of the summit was much worse than was generally known in the united states we were told the kim government probably launched missiles into the sea of japan on may 3 2019 and increased its criticism of senior u s officials to express its displeasure over the collapse of the summit we also were told there would be a staff shake up of officials who advise mr kim on relations with the united states in response to the summit outcome the reports of kim jong un executing diplomats for displeasing him were believable due to his regime s savage record of killing and jailing government officials and kim family members according to a 2016 south korean intelligence report mr kim ordered the execution of at least 340 people since he took office in 2011 an estimated 140 were senior officers in the country s government military and ruling korean worker s party also executed were mr kim s uncle jang song thaek and five of his aides who reportedly were executed in 2013 with anti aircraft guns in 2017 the north korea leader s half brother kim jong nam was assassinated at the kuala lumpur malaysia airport when vx nerve agent was smeared on his face kim jong un had been led to believe by his advisers that he was on the verge of a huge diplomatic victory with the united states at the vietnam summit by making a modest offer to dismantle some nuclear sites in exchange for full sanctions relief the summit collapsed because this offer was unacceptable to mr trump who has consistently called for complete denuclearization of north korea although kim advisers clearly misread mr trump there also were indications before the summit that low level u s officials probably at the state department led the press to believe mr trump was prepared to be more flexible in reaching an agreement than he actually was obviously the united states strongly disapproves of the kim government retaliating and killing its diplomats and will raise concerns about this in future meetings but mr trump knew the nature of the north korean government when he decided to pursue bilateral talks with mr kim the president has taken a pragmatic approach the united states must talk with this regime to prevent it from having nuclear weapons as a result mr trump was careful not to overreact to recent north korean missile launches because he is hopeful the kim government will soon resume negotiations a cnn source seemed to suggest this was the right call when he recently said north korea trotted out kim yong chol as a signal to washington that the north korean leader was not breaking off negotiations over denuclearization while mr trump has made significant progress in lowering tensions with pyongyang and creating the possibility for a peaceful resolution of the threat from north korean nuclear and missile programs he knows that progress made so far is fragile and an agreement is still a long way off by not condemning north korea for its recent belligerent acts mr trump is giving mr kim an opportunity to blow off steam and hopefully resume negotiations with the united states over the summer such a gamble is not surprising for a president who prides himself as a dealmaker fred fleitz president of the center for security policy served as deputy assistant to president trump and to the chief of staff of the national security council he previously held national security jobs with the cia the dia the department of state and the house intelligence committee staff f
