withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender mr trump and house democratic leaders engaged in another day of trading angry accusations as several house committees demanded documents from the administration and questions persisted over whether the state department would allow employees to cooperate with the probe the president even blamed the accelerating impeachment inquiry for a nearly 500 point drop in the dow jones industrial average all of this impeachment nonsense which is going nowhere is driving the stock market and your 401k s down he tweeted but that is exactly what the democrats want to do they are willing to hurt the country with only the 2020 election in mind mr schiff said democrats have a real sense of urgency to impeach mr trump and they won t stand for delays in getting the information they are seeking from the administration he said the more obstruction they see the more they ll consider it an admission that the president did try to pressure the president of ukraine in a july 25 phone call to investigate democratic frontrunner joseph r biden and his son hunter mr schiff suggested efforts to delay witnesses or documents from reaching congress could itself become an argument for impeachment on obstruction they will be strengthening the case on obstruction if they behave that way mr schiff said of course that was an article of impeachment against president nixon mr trump said he will cooperate with requests and possible subpoenas from three house committees working on the impeachment inquiry despite his outward contempt for the process i always cooperate mr trump said this is a fraudulent crime on the american people but we ll work together with shifty schiff and house speaker nancy pelosi and all of them currently mr trump s personal lawyer rudy giuliani secretary of state mike pompeo and the white house itself are facing subpoenas from house democrats as the ukraine allegations take center stage in their impeachment inquiry mr schiff s threat came a day after mr pompeo accused house democrats of attempting to bully his officials and said they might not appear before the committees several trump associated witnesses including attorney general william p barr former white house counsel don mcgahn and former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski have refused to work with house democrats who are pressing them for answers meanwhile the state department s inspector general steve linick presented congressional staffers a packet of information containing what sen bob menendez new jersey democrat called long debunked and false statements addressed to secretary of state mike pompeo with the white house listed as the address at least some of the information pertained to former ukrainian ambassador marie yovanovitch and the biden family in a news conference at the capitol mrs pelosi pledged a fair investigation but both she and mr schiff said they view the ukraine phone conversation as evidence of wrongdoing in that telephone call the president undermined our national security she said noting that mr trump had been withholding military aid to ukraine at the time said mr schiff you have the president using the full power of his office to try to effectively coerce a foreign leader that is completely dependent on our country to intervene in our election to help his campaign it s hard to imagine more corrupt conduct mr schiff said the still anonymous whistleblower who initiated the investigation approached a staffer on mr schiff s committee days before filing the complaint the new york times reported wednesday the paper said mr schiff learned about the outlines of the complaint before it was filed whistleblower attorney mark zaid said that neither the whistleblower nor his lawyers has ever met or spoken with congressman schiff about this matter but the news that mr schiff had received an early heads up about the matter emboldened the president and his allies who said it was evidence of partisan motives at the least and possibly a rigged impeachment investigation i think it s a scandal that he knew before the president said that s a big story it s a scam house minority leader kevin mccarthy california republican said mr schiff just got caught orchestrating with the whistleblower before the complaint was ever filed democrats have rigged this process from the start republican national committee chairwoman ronna mcdaniel called it a stunning indictment of this impeachment charade who s colluding now she tweeted even before the fresh suggestion of partisan motivation by the whistleblower the president renewed his call to uncover the identity of the government employee and to catch the spy or spies within the white house who fed information to the whistleblower mr trump said the whistleblower fabricated details of the july 25 phone call or the person giving the information to the whistleblower was dishonest this country has to find out who that person was because that person s a spy mr trump said during an oval office meeting with the president of finland sauli niinist mr schiff said the president is trying to bully the unidentified person this is a blatant effort to intimate witnesses he told reporters it s an incitement to violence as mr trump held a news conference with mr niinist later in the ornate east room of the white house the finnish leader offered an outsider s perspective on the political turmoil roiling washington he marveled at his experience this week of visiting several museums on the national mall and receiving an invitation to a ceremony at arlington national cemetery turning to mr trump he said mr president you have here a great democracy he said keep it going on mr trump came back to his guest s observation near the end of the press conference in which he gave another combative defense of his actions and excoriated democrats trying to impeach him we are a great democracy mr trump agreed i m airing what i m airing because we are a great democracy jeff mordock stephen dinan and tom howell j
