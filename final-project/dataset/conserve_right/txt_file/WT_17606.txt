body following liu s death u s secretary of state rex tillerson urged beijing to release liu s wife from house arrest saying she should be allowed to leave china as she wishes norway s nobel committee said beijing bore a heavy responsibility for liu s death but it also leveled harsh criticism at the free world for its hesitant belated reactions to his serious illness and imprisonment it is a sad and disturbing fact that the representatives of the free world who themselves hold democracy and human rights in high regard are less willing to stand up for those rights for the benefit of others

troops and tanks into beijing to quash the protests on the night of june 3 4 liu persuaded some students to leave the square rather than face down the army the military crackdown killed hundreds possibly thousands of people and heralded a more repressive era liu became one of hundreds of chinese imprisoned for crimes linked to the demonstrations it was only the first of four stays in prisons
