agreement she s got to get up to snuff learn the bill she s a mess i don t think nancy pelosi understands the deal it s too complicated for her he lodged the presidential barb a day after his confrontation with the speaker at the white house that ended with his vow not to work with house democrats until they complete multiple investigations of him but the president still wants congress to approve the usmca the acronym for the trade agreement with canada and mexico that he negotiated to replace the 1990s era north american free trade agreement top stories democratic clerk charged with

time referring to himself tongue in cheek again as an extremely stable genius mr trump said he could work with democrats on trade and other issues so quick your head will spin if he were free from partisan investigations one thing they can do is approved the usmca so we have our farmers taken care of mr trump said not only the farmers it s every industry mrs pelosi responded on twitter when the extremely stable genius starts acting more presidential i ll be happy to work with him on infrastructure trade and other issues the sparring over the trade deal for north america erupted as mr trump announced his second bailout in two years for farmers and ranchers who have lost business from his tariff war with china he was joined by about 20 farming industry heads representing corn and soybean growers hog farmers and others the agriculture department said direct aid payments totaling up to 16 billion will begin in late july or early august after a 12 billion farm bailout last year agriculture secretary sonny perdue said the aid which will be delivered in up to three installments through january is in line with the estimated impacts of unjustified retaliatory tariffs on u s agricultural goods and other trade disruptions trade negotiations between the u s and china broke off may 10 with no further talks scheduled after the administration accused beijing of reneging on earlier commitments mr trump then raised tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods from 10 to 25 china retaliated with tariffs on 60 billion of u s products aimed largely at the agricultural sector the president said of the bailout i don t consider it a gift at all we will ensure that our farmers get the relief they need and very very quickly the president said it s a good time to be a farmer we re going to make sure of that our farmers will be greatly helped we want to get them back to the point where they would have had if they had a good year mr trump said tariffs on chinese goods are bringing in far more than the 16 billion we re talking about he insisted again that the tariffs are paid for largely by china it all comes from china he said tariffs are taxes imposed on imports and costs are mostly borne by u s consumers rep jim costa california democrat and chair of the house agriculture subcommittee on livestock and foreign agriculture called the latest round of farm aid a rushed and poorly planned bailout for more than a year now producers of every commodity have said the same thing they want long term access to export markets not hasty attempts by the federal government to clean up its own mess mr costa said i urge the white house to rescind the tariffs and sit down in a constructive manner with the chinese to address issues that will actually improve the market for our farmers rep marcia l fudge ohio democrat and chairwoman of the agricultural subcommittee on nutrition and oversight criticized a pattern of a president making impulsive decisions that damage the farm economy only to just as impulsively direct usda to spend billions in taxpayer money on a temporary fix that s as irresponsible as it is inept and it takes time money and energy away from things usda should be doing like implementing the farm bill and feeding hungry americans she said mr perdue said direct payments of up to 14 5 billion will go to producers of corn soybeans cotton wheat rice and a variety of other grains dairy and hog farmers also will receive payments mr perdue said the government aid will begin as soon as practical after farm service agency crop reporting is completed by july 15 the second and third installments will be evaluated as market conditions and trade opportunities dictate and will be made in november and early january he said under the commodity credit corp s market facilitation program eligible farmers must have an average income of less than 900 000 last year direct payments under the market facilitation program were made to farmers based on production records hog farmers received 8 per head and soybean farmers received an initial payment of 1 65 per bushel said robert hensley a partner at the law firm dorsey whitney and co chair of the firm s food and beverage industry group mfp payments were capped at 125 000 per farmer for dairy production hogs corn cotton sorghum soybeans and wheat mr hensley said americans for prosperity a free trade group backed by industrialist charles koch said the bailout is a concession for harm created by flawed trade policies the administration should allow farmers to
