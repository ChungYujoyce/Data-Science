apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic bangkok in a deal that has raised eyebrows around the region thailand s coup installed regime is on the verge of purchasing three attack submarines from china for 1 billion after the country s navy received exclusive anti submarine warfare training from the u s 7th fleet criticism of the deal has been strong in bangkok s media with some skeptics saying it would waste money because thailand has no enemies and the military previously bought an unimpressive aircraft carrier and blimp plus fake bomb detectors royal thai navy officials selected china over competing bids from russia sweden france germany and south korea bangkok has long been a key u s ally in the region but it has been stepping up economic and transportation ties with beijing

country is good to us except those who are still stuck on the word democracy he said the government as it makes its final recommendation would consider if it were necessary to buy the submarines if we can afford it we would have to think about the necessity he said is it for battles or for protecting our maritime interests how can we protect fishing navigation you see that other seas have these issues you think we will not have this problem there if a war breaks out nearly all of our surface ships will be wiped out submarines are what will survive thailand s navy commander adm kraisorn

the massive annual cobra gold u s thai military exercise was held this year after being sharply scaled back in 2014 in the aftermath of the coup unlike the obama administration china has not criticized mr prayuth s coup or his crackdown on free speech and political activity instead china hosted the junta s top officials during trips to beijing and offered sweetened military and commercial

xu qilang visited thailand six months after his first trip in february china s defense minister chang wanquan came to bangkok china s bid for expanded trade and expanded security links with thailand

5 thailand vietnam laos cambodia and myanmar the chinese sub deal has also sparked some unusually open criticism in the thai press with many saying the submarines are not needed for the country s defense and that the deal was only approved in part because of the heavy military influence in the junta s cabinet mr prayuth likely lacks the political confidence to say no to the navy s request for subs the nation newspaper wrote in an editorial this week can he and his cabinet be brought to their senses with protest barred in this benighted kingdom a public uprising is out of the question sink these submarines the headline of a bangkok post editorial said on july 1 warning the navy s actions on subs remain opaque unexplained and quite possibly wrong the three chinese attack subs costing 355 million each are reportedly the quiet non nuclear yuan 041 which boasts an advanced air independent propulsion system allowing the vessels to stay submerged for an extended time neighboring countries such as vietnam malaysia indonesia and singapore have had submarines in their arsenals for many years adm kraisorn said in april as opposition mounted to the deal new submarines would be a strategy to improve our armed forces he noted that even with the purchase it could be up to six years before the submarines are actually manned and deployed if we do not start now we have to wait for a long time
