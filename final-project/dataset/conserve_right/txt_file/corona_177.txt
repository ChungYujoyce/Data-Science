may tee up a battle between health and economic officials on what to do next kristin fisher reports from the white house it s not much of a shock to discover that rachel maddow doesn t like president trump s daily briefings on the coronavirus i feel like we should inoculate ourselves against the harmful impact of these ongoing false promises and false statements by the president by recognizing that when he s talking about the coronavirus epidemic more often than not he is lying she told her msnbc viewers what is rather surprising is what maddow wants to do about it an idea that is gaining cachet among other commentators on the left as well forget the debt why trump and pols want a trillion dollar bailout if it were up to me and it s not i would stop putting those briefings on live tv she said not out of spite but because it s misinformation think about that for a second some liberals who ordinarily cast themselves as champions of free speech now want to suppress speech because of their animus toward donald trump yes trump would still be able to hold white house briefings but they would literally pull the plug on live coverage depriving millions of americans of the chance to see not just him but the vice president surgeon general and assorted medical experts this is the height of condescension what they re saying is that americans are too dumb to understand that some of what trump says might be positive spin or factually inaccurate only the pundits and the press are smart enough to figure that out so they will watch the president and then filter what you need to know if the president does end up saying anything true you can run it as tape maddow allows but beyond that all of us should stop broadcasting it honestly it s going to cost lives washington post columnist margaret sullivan whose writings drip with disdain for trump and for media people who she believes enable him says efforts such as fact checking don t go nearly far enough to counter the serious damage this man is doing to the public s well being radical change is necessary the cable networks and other news organizations that are taking the president s briefings as live feeds should stop doing so just censor him that s what the argument comes down to and what s revealing is that the people who are making this case have spent years denouncing the president in ever harsher terms sullivan recently wrote that trump is so dangerous that we need to abandon neutrality at all costs journalism to replace it with something more suited to the moment the larger message is a clarion call for journalists to crusade against trump abandoning such niceties as fairness as a luxury we can no longer afford the president tweeted monday that he watches cnn msdnc abc nbc cbs some of fox desperately foolishly pleading to be politically correct the nytimes the washingtonpost and all i see is hatred of me at any cost don t they understand that they are destroying themselves i was struck when trump used that word hatred to describe his media detractors in a 2016 interview with me while it s true in certain cases it is far too broad a brush and of course the president goes out of his way to slam the media as a way of discrediting their legitimate criticism of him he did that last week in accusing without evidence the new york times washington post and wall street journal of siding with china on the virus story he called nbc s peter alexander a terrible reporter for pressing him aggressively to be sure on whether he was offering false hope on two unproven drugs and then asking him to address millions of scared americans stephanie grisham the president s press secretary told me sunday on media buzz that his job is to try to calm the american people and so alexander s false hope question was wildly inappropriate she called on journalists to set aside their bias against this president and they need to do what this white house is doing and show leadership and try to get information to the american public subscribe to howie apos s media buzzmeter podcast a riff of the day apos s hottest stories now i think it s perfectly fair to point out as i did in the interview that trump spent weeks minimizing the impact of the coronavirus it s all on tape she disagreed i think it s perfectly fair to point out that despite his appeals to private business the president still can t tell us when the medical system will have enough masks ventilators and respirators and that by not invoking the defense production act he is largely pushing it off on the states i think it s perfectly fair to point out that some of trump s claims are contradicted by anthony fauci that some of what he says is overly optimistic that experts don t believe things will start improving after the current 15 day period that the president has embraced in fact the situation is expected to get worse in short i think that good journalists can hold trump accountable for what he says and does or does not do without bearing a personal grudge and recognizing that an abc poll has approval of his virus management up sharply to 55 percent what i do not think is fair is for television to impose a blackout on the president of the united states because some on the left don t think the public can handle hearing from him in this crisis get all the stories you need to know from the most powerful
