national review ending the dangerous u s dependence on china how to avoid a china led world order flynn was not masked because the fbi framed him as a clandestine agent of russia fbi says texas navy base shooting terrorism related twenty questions for barack obama donald trump says that the same experts and pollsters who incorrectly predicted that british voters would vote to stay in the european union are now dismissing his chances to win the white house that s mostly true before the brexit vote predictwise a website that aggregates data on the likelihood of events found that there was a 21 percent chance of its being approved early on the night ofjune 23 when britons voted it pinned the chances of brexit s passing at only 12 percent over the last month predictwise has placed trump s chances of winning at between 19 percent and 30 percent other american prediction outlets give trump only a 15 to 25 percent chance of victory nigel farage who as head of ukip uk independence party helped launch the campaign for the eu exit 20 years ago thinks there is a parallel appearing at a trump rally of 15 000 people in jackson miss wednesday farage told the crowd we saw experts from all over the world giving us project fear telling us if we voted to be run by a bunch of unelected old men in brussels our economy would fall off a cliff they told us there would be mass unemployment and investment would leave our country we saw the commentariat and the polling industry doing everything they could to demoralize our campaign farage believes that it s possible for a similar populist rebellion to succeed in america and elect trump he overstates the parallels but he is spot on when it comes to ridiculing the experts on brexit a new analysis by the guardian a left leaning newspaper concludes that british employment is up post brexit retail sales have rebounded the budget deficit is lower than it was last year inflation remains low the stock market is near an all time high and a weaker pound has boosted british tourism market watch recently published a scathing critique of the project fear doom mongers concluding with a very few exceptions economists forecast the u k would go straight into recession as a result of brexit as it turns out however britain is doing just fine and so is the rest of europe that is surely a calamity for which the profession deserves a beating and at the very least should start asking itself some serious questions most economists within the banks fund managers and policy institutes were so personally committed to staying within the eu that they couldn t imagine anything other than a catastrophic outcome if the u k left but that surely is not acceptable economics is not a hard science like physics but it should be capable of more objectivity than that but if there are any architects of project fear who are now expressing regret or apologizing for their error their voices are barely above a whisper far more common are the likes of james moore of the independent newspaper who wrote this week that there is a reason that almost every respected economist supported remain with only the neo thatcherites nobodies and right wing nodding dogs who make up the membership of economists for brexit speaking up for leave while conceding that things have stabilised since the initial panic he insists without presenting any evidence that theuk is still in the midst of suffering an economic shock for drama he adds the fear has become our reality over the next ten weeks we will no doubt see a domestic version of project fear accelerate in the presidential race as in britain the liberal establishment and its media allies will paint a dystopian vision of what america would be like under president trump as my readers know i am no fan of donald trump who is neither a conservative nor a truth teller but i am confident that the attack on him will be well over the top and it could easily backfire in britain anti brexiters predictions of economic disaster didn t persuade a majority of voters because only two regions of the country london and the southeast had seen average incomes rise above the levels they were before the 2008 recession as larry elliott the economics editor of the guardian noted this week after weighing up the pros and cons plenty of voters didn t think they were risking all that much related a dynamic similar to what we saw in britain could happen in the united states democrats rail against trump as a con artist while their own nominee is a proven prevaricator they accuse trump of being a danger to national security but every single day she served as secretary of state and also afterward hillary clinton put our national security at risk by relying exclusively on her private server for e mail trump s business dealings are suspect but hillary clinton s relationship with the clinton foundation was unseemly and probably corrupt it s true that any other republican would probably be ahead of hillary clinton right now and trump s unique negatives areweighing him down but that doesn t mean he can t win a battle of the evil of two lessers this november if hillary clinton s reputation is further damaged by wikileaks recall the parable of the two hikers who encounter a dangerous bear one of the hikers laces up his boots and prepares to run the other hiker protests that he can t outrun the bear to which his companion replies i don t have to i just have to outrun you get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
