underground faithful for whom the deal represents a sell out to the communist government and betrayal of their decades of loyalty to the pope francis acknowledged these chinese sense themselves somehow abandoned and expressed his sincere admiration for their fidelity over the years but he asked them to trust him the aim he said is to initiate an unprecedented process that we hope will help to heal the wounds of the past restore full communion among all chinese catholics and lead to a phase of greater fraternal cooperation the letter follows the deal signed saturday governing the naming of bishops in china an issue that has split the church and vexed relations for decades the agreement regularizes the status of seven bishops who had been appointed by beijing over the years without papal consent and sets out a process of dialogue going forward to name new ones francis says he not beijing ultimately will name new bishops while the deal addressed a crucial aspect of church governance in china it didn t address more pastoral issues of unifying split communities which the letter published wednesday aims to do the catholic community in china is called to be united so as to overcome the divisions of the past that have caused and continue to cause great suffering in the hearts of many pastors and faithful francis wrote all christians none excluded must now offer gestures of reconciliation and communion francis and before him pope benedict xvi and st john paul ii had tried to unite the two communities including a letter benedict penned to the chinese faithful in 2007 years of negotiations kicked into high gear over a year ago culminating in the deal signed saturday unlike benedict s 2007 letter which labeled the patriotic association incompatible with catholic doctrine and took a hard line in asserting the exclusive right of the pope to name bishops francis tone was far more conciliatory and focused on moving past previous differences he didn t even name the patriotic association or insist on his right to name bishops he has told reporters however that after a period of dialogue he would ultimately name new leaders of the church the letter provided

authentic shepherds committed to working generously in the service of god s people especially the poor and the most vulnerable speaking to reporters tuesday francis acknowledged that both sides lost something in the talks and said members of the underground chinese church will suffer as a result of the deal the text of which has not been released but he took full responsibility for it and said he had already received messages attesting to the martyr like faith of chinese catholics and their willingness to accept whatever was decided he urged prayers for the suffering of those who don t understand or who have so many years behind them of living clandestinely it was a reference to the underground faithful who endured decades of persecution for refusing to join the patriotic association and staying loyal to the holy see their cause has long been championed by hong kong cardinal joseph zen who has called francis deal a sell out of the church to china s communist rulers the issue of bishop nominations had been the main stumbling block to restoring diplomatic relations that were severed nearly seven decades ago when the chinese communists came to power the holy see
