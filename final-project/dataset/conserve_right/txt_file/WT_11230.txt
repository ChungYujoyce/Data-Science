apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic maya moore has excelled everywhere she s played winning championships from college to the wnba and europe now she s leaving her mark on the chinese women s basketball league averaging 45 points a game for the shanxi flame moore has helped bring new fans to the women s game in a basketball crazed nation they show maybe five nba games a week here moore told the associated press in a phone interview they get a good amount of coverage and people love it we are starting to get a little more interest about our game top stories ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed the nba long has seen china as a place for huge growth it was evident at the beijing olympics in 2008 with the basketball games sold out and the contest between the u s men and china having nearly 100 million viewers with europe still feeling the effects of the financial downturn china s competitive salaries and shorter season have made it one of the top destinations for the world s elite women basketball players the former uconn star is earning mid six figures which is on a par with european salaries while most european leagues go from october to may china only plays till february this will give moore time to rest before the minnesota lynx open training camp in may it also will provide the young face of women s basketball the opportunity to participate at the nba all star game in february and be around for the women s final four besides moore the talent is improving throughout the league tamika catchings elizabeth cambage sophia young and jayne appel are all playing this year swin cash has played there in the past i think it s been a good introduction for a lot of the fans seeing some of the olympic level women over here moore said to see the talent it s been i think very surprising thing for the fans interest will continue to spark more of a demand for players and the basketball level will rise this area of the world will continue to want basketball even more elevating that market the wnba has taken notice of the recent boom in china we know the sport of basketball is on the rise in china and the wnba has already had great success on the international stage wnba president laurel richie said i am really encouraged that there are now many more millions of people around the globe including china who know what the wnba is all about we ve exposed more people to the game to the players to the story both on and off the court and this will only help grow our league both domestically and abroad while moore has definitely brought interest with her play catchings has tried to mentor her teammates i think my approach is probably different then the approach of some of the younger players catchings said in an e mail to the associated press i feel like my job is to teach my teammates how i play and how to have fun doing it it didn t take long for moore to endear herself to her new team moore the first woman basketball player to be signed by the jordan brand gave a pair of yellow and red sneakers to each of her teammates then she started playing and the team only has lost once since moore introduced herself to the chinese fans almost immediately with a 60 point performance in her third game which just happened to be nationally televised the game was against one of the army teams moore said they don t have a foreigner and they are very prideful the first quarter i was in a zone feeling good i hit seven 3 s in the first quarter it gave me a jump start on the 60 moore was hard pressed to remember ever scoring close to that before she had 48 in high school and 48 was her college best connecticut and olympic coach geno auriemma wasn t surprised by his former star s success maya is maya he said her scoring that many points isn t a real shock she can really do whatever she wants basketball has been the easy part for moore since coming over to china communicating with teammates has taken a little more work with up to four languages being spoken in team huddles it s pretty comical moore said laughing i speak english one of my teammates is korean that s two languages two of our coaches are spanish one is the spanish national team head coach the first couple days i was there my head was spinning on the court there don t seem to be many communication issues the team uses hand signals numbers and moore said she learned some basic words to get through i m getting better i know about 10 words so far i m learning new ones every day she said moore also has a personal assistant assigned by the team to help her with basics like grocery shopping and getting around i think the success to your playing overseas really relies heavily on your translator and how well the team is able to help you adjust to them and being in a foreign country said catchings who also has spent time playing in korea it s definitely an adjustment your team and the organization becomes your family while you are over here moore who played in spain last winter also has had the benefit of having her mom with her she came over in october and has spent most of the first two months in china including thanksgiving the two have been put up in a western style hotel for the four month season it s really been great having her around and she ll be here for christmas moore said she s experiencing china herself among the things moore has learned to appreciate while being in china are some of the freedom she has in the u s it s kind of hard not having unrestricted internet she said there s certain things you can t view certain liberties you don t have youtube twitter things like that there are certain social medial sites you re so used to having access to whatever we need it s different that way follow
