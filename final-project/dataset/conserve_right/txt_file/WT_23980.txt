journal com aug 2 the bowling green daily news on displaying in god we trust at kentucky schools our national motto in god we trust is something that we should be proud of and not be ashamed to display it appears on our currency on license plates in kentucky on two state flags in courthouses in the legislative chambers in frankfort and in the congressional chambers in our nation s capital we have no problem with this being displayed on our currency on cars courthouses or in state and federal buildings buildings that display in god we trust are simply displaying a phrase whose official use dates to the 1800s and was adopted as the national motto in 1956 supporters of displaying the motto are not trying to ram religion down people s throats as some groups like the american civil liberties union and others would have you believe we are very proud that the kentucky legislature and the majority of our area legislators voted this past session to require that all public schools display the national motto in prominent places before classes begin except state rep patti minter d bowling green who voted against the bill according to house bill 46 which was introduced early this year and signed into law by gov matt bevin in march local school boards shall require elementary and secondary schools to display the motto in a prominent location in the school the display can take the form of but isn t limited to a mounted plaque or student artwork for example the prominent location as defined by the legislation refers to a school entryway cafeteria or common area where students are likely to see the national motto we re glad that kids will who will be starting school will actually be able to walk under or near where our national motto will be posted both city and county schools have been preparing to get the signs and have said that they will have them posted by the start of school kentucky isn t the only state to have passed such a law at least a half dozen states passed in god we trust bills last year and 10 more have introduced or passed the legislation so far in 2019 critics have argued the measures violate the first amendment we couldn t disagree more the state legislature passed this bill not only because it is our national motto but also because it in fact does represent free speech placing in god we trust in our state s public schools is a form of free speech and not an endorsement of a religion plain and simple online https www bgdailynews com aug 1 the louisville courier journal on u s sen rand paul s comments about u s rep ilhan omar dear sen rand paul hello from your constituents in kentucky the state that ranks ninth in the nation for the number of refugee arrivals you may remember we re the commonwealth proudly known for feeding and clothing people from war torn areas providing health care education and the path to citizenship you should know this of course because bowling green the city you ve called home for more than 25 years is one of the primary cities in kentucky where refugees resettle that s why we re so distressed and frankly puzzled about what you said in a recent breitbart interview about being willing to pay for a plane ticket to send rep ilhan omar of minnesota back to her native somalia so she can learn to be grateful to america for taking her in when she was a child what like many americans including president donald trump rep omar who gained her american citizenship in 2000 made the mistake of criticizing some aspects of her country and questioning some of its policies isn t that something you ve done repeatedly over the years senator over your career we recall you slamming the environmental protection agency questioning parts of the civil rights act of 1964 and railing against u s foreign aid and even military involvement in conflicts overseas as a member of congress elected by the voters an accomplishment shared by rep omar by the way you have criticized the federal reserve former attorney general jeff sessions the war in afghanistan and even the supreme court on the affordable care act you said just because a couple of people on the supreme court declare something to be constitutional does not make it so the whole thing remains unconstitutional but you were born in pittsburgh so we guess that makes it ok there s no need for us to question your patriotism or send you back to your ancestral home right president trump started this absurd controversy on july 14 when he tweeted that progressive democratic congresswomen referring to rep omar and three other democrats reps alexandria ocasio cortez of new york ayanna pressley of massachusetts and rashida tlaib of michigan should go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came instead of criticizing the united states we can t ignore the irony didn t the former reality tv star land in the white house after vehemently slamming american policies dissing respected politicians on both sides of the political aisle and trumpeting a campaign slogan that screamed make america great again but apparently rep omar and the other three congresswomen singled out by trump even those diverse women born in america aren t truly americans is that how you see it senator we believe it must be because instead of calling out trump s comments as being un american you sided with him and even offered money to help send rep omar back to somalia regretfully it appears you too have decided only those born here in this nation of immigrants get to be real americans with full rights privileges and a platform to question decisions made by our government first amendment be damned or maybe those principles apply only to certain immigrants who come to america from other countries say melania trump or elaine chao sen paul we discussed your reckless remarks with folks around the state including with some of your constituents who have resettled in kentucky one is farhan abdi director of the somali community center in louisville he s disturbed by what he heard your words seem to say if you are not born here and came from another country you don t have the right to talk about our politics you don t have the right to speak up for your people he said abdi came to louisville from somali 11 years ago and is now a u s citizen he says it s not right to call people ungrateful for speaking out about issues in our country we re being told be quiet like a baby abdi said sen paul you say that rep omar called america a terrible country did you actually read her new york times op ed column we did and here s what she said the america we arrived in was different from the one my grandfather had hoped to find the land of opportunity he imagined was in fact full of challenges people identified me in ways that were foreign to me immigrant black i learned that these identities carried stigmas and i experienced prejudice as a visibly muslim woman but the beauty of this country is not that our democracy is perfect it s that embedded in our constitution and democratic institutions are the tools to make it better she wrote and this the proudest moments in our history from the emancipation proclamation to the civil rights movement to the struggle against fascism have come when we fight to protect and expand basic democratic rights today democracy is under attack once again it s time to respond with the kind of conviction that has made america great before she hardly sounds like someone who is about as ungrateful as you can get she sounds like an american let us remind you of your response well she came here and we fed her we clothed her she got welfare she got schooling she got health care and then lo and behold she has the honor of actually winning a seat in congress and she says we re a terrible country i think that s about as ungrateful as you can get and so i m willing to contribute to buy her a ticket to go visit somalia and i think she can look and maybe learn a little bit about the disaster that is somalia that has no capitalism has no god given rights guaranteed in a constitution and has about seven different tribes that have been fighting each other for the last 40 years and then maybe after she s visited somalia for a while she might come back and appreciate america more those aren t the words of someone who embraces a libertarian point of view sen paul sounds more like an authoritarian to us america belongs to all u s citizens whether we were born in pittsburgh or mogadishu you have no greater right to it than rep omar one of two muslim women in the house in fact abdi says it s you sen paul who should be grateful you should appreciate that so many people from different countries have settled in kentucky and elsewhere in the nation bringing so many interesting cultures to our land we are working hard abdi said we are doing the best we can to make this state and this country better so here s our offer senator we stand ready to buy you a ticket to come visit abdi and others at the somali community center here in louisville we will invite rep omar too and perhaps then we can have a reasoned productive conversation with constituents in kentucky about our country s biggest challenges and those issues that unite all americans that would be far better than the destructive and irresponsible sound bites you offered to a far right media source to curry favor with president trump we look f
