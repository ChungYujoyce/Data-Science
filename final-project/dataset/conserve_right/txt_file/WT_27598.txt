tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap house speaker nancy pelosi still isn t ready to impeach president donald trump even after special counsel robert mueller essentially called on congress to pick up where his investigation left off pelosi isn t budging scores of her democratic lawmakers do want to start impeachment proceedings outside groups say it s time but pelosi is carrying on as she has since taking the speaker s gavel in january promising the house will methodically pursue its investigations of trump wherever they lead this is pelosi s balancing act toggling between mounting pressure from other democrats and her own political instincts she s sticking with her plans for a more measured ironclad investigation that makes it clear to americans the choices ahead it s uncharted territory for the speaker and this congress with both high risks and possible rewards ahead of the 2020 election top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free

declared his own challenge on thursday he called impeachment a dirty filthy disgusting word and said courts would never allow it many constituents want to impeach the president pelosi acknowledged shortly after mueller s remarks wednesday but we want to do what is right and what gets results her calculus is political as well as practical knowing that even if democrats in the house have the votes to approve articles of impeachment the republican majority in the senate is hardly likely to vote to convict him opinion polling does not favor impeachment and a full blown but failed effort might well help the president win re election rather than go it alone she is urging democrats to build the case so the public is with them whatever they decide nothing is off the table pelosi said but we do want to make such a compelling case such an ironclad case it has been this way for weeks as more and more democratic lawmakers and presidential candidates call for impeachment proceedings pelosi is urging restraint those around her say she s feeling no pressure on wednesday many democrats took mueller s words as an invitation to impeach mueller told the country as he said in his 448 page report last month that while charging the president with obstructing justice was not an option under department of justice guidelines he also did not exonerate trump instead mueller said the constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing without saying the word mueller was pointing to impeachment more

other house democrats not just the liberal left flank are on board at a town hall meeting that night rep pramila jayapal told voters in seattle said the road ahead weighs on me she is among those who want formal impeachment proceedings not everybody in the caucus is there yet that is why speaker pelosi has a difficult role and she has been trying to figure out exactly how we will move forward she

henderson nevada presidential hopeful bernie sanders who favors impeachment said nancy pelosi does not have an easy job but this isn t entirely new for her she witnessed the efforts to impeach richard nixon and bill clinton and as speaker a decade ago tamped down cries to impeach george w bush over the iraq war also the voices for impeachment make up just a slim fraction of the broader democratic

a cure all he said impeachment doesn t remove this president there is only one way to remove this president and that s by voting him out of office six committees in the house are pushing ahead with investigations of trump s actions his business dealings his actions during the russia probe his running of the government and many of their inquiries are moving into legal battles where so far courts
