assure voters they didn t mean your guns seem to be in the past during the second hour of thursday s democratic primary debate former rep beto o rourke of texas cut to the chase hell yes we re going to take your ar 15 your ak 47 he said to be fair it s not the first time o rourke has displayed remarkable frankness on the topic debate moderator david muir had asked o rourke about comments he made last month shortly after the mass shooting at a walmart in his hometown of el paso texas in which he promised that anyone who owned an ak 47 or ar 15 would have to sell them to the government in passionate answer on gun violence beto o rourke says when we see that being used against children hell yes we re going to take your ar 15 your ak 47 we re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow americans anymore https t co indrxliwfs demdebate pic twitter com xqcbtwvr0m abc news abc september 13 2019 but o rourke also promised that he would make the process an inclusive one saying that he would bring everyone in america into the conversation republicans democrats gun owners and non gun owners alike other candidates on the stage thursday night were less interested in what their opponents or the constitution might have to say moments before o rourke s comments former vice president joe biden had challenged sen kamala harris d calif about the unconstitutionality of her promise to issue an executive order that would limit access to guns during her first 100 days in office in response the former prosecutor literally laughed biden said a president has no constitutional authority to ban guns via executive order a rare moment in which one of the candidates on stage admitted there are limitations to presidential power some things you can do with executive orders many things you can t said biden i would just say hey joe instead of saying no we can t let s say yes we can retortedharris borrowing president barack obama s famous campaign line then she cackled hysterically while biden responded let s be constitutional sen kamala harris people asked me in el paso do you think trump is responsible for what happened and i said well look obviously he didn t pull the trigger but he s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition https t co indrxliwfs demdebate pic twitter com hhkpdlyw8u abc news abc september 13 2019 harris added that she would not wait for congress to act because that was leaving americans at risk from gun violence and she pointed out how mass shooter drills are traumatizing school children on that second point she s absolutely right mass shooter drills are terrible and should not be conducted in schools but the reason why cuts directly against her first point mass shootings are exceedingly rare events ones that do no justify traumatizing schoolchildren or seizing legal gun owners firearms o rourke s idea of forcing americans to sell their guns to the government has a similar gaping hole in it what about the people who don t want to sell as jon stokes one of the founders ofars technicaand one of the people behindopensourcedefense org a post culture war gun rights collective recently wrote at reason gun buyback programs are mostly futile my point is that regardless of what you think of the gun owners who won t comply or the cops who ll inevitably let them off without even a verbal warning there is no gun registration gun ban or gun confiscation that a u s congress can pass and a u s president can sign that will be even close to fully complied with or enforced not one promising to smash the second amendment and laughing at the right of americans to protect their homes and loved ones while being unable to fully think through the implications of gun confiscation plans that s an interesting strategy for turning red states blue advertisement next calling out kamala harris record as a draconian prosecutor isn t a distortion eric boehm is a reporter at reason show comments 225 editor s note we invite comments

or reason foundation we reserve the right to delete any comment for any reason at any time report abuses promising to smash the second amendment and laughing at the right of americans to protect their homes and loved ones while being unable to fully think through the implications of gun confiscation plans that s an interesting strategy for turning red states blue it s encouraging to see the democratic party embracing the common sense gun safety proposals advocated by longtime libertarian activist michael hihn and if that won t turn red states blue no problem you know what will the koch reason open borders agenda we re going to invite millions more black and brown bodies into this country thereby creating millions more democratic voters in fact reason regular old mexican has been quite explicit that this is the longterm plan as much as i dislike trump these people can t help but talk themselves out of winning talk themselves out of winning nah i guarantee a democratic victory in the 2020 presidential election i admire your faith as long as we aoc biden harris maduro yang libertarians stick together we can win something i m with you gun nuts on this one if you all want to blow your heads off why should i talk you out of it well we could overdose on anti anxiety pills and box wine like you leftists but where s the fun in that won t be our heads that we re blowing off if robert francis were to become president and get confiscation legislation passed what number would you choose in the number of days remaining before the vice president was sworn in bonus questions how many cops do you think would be killed trying to confiscate firearms and how many cops do you think would resign before beto s passing how many people said exactly the same think in 2016 you can guarantee nothing when it comes to elections and professing to be able to do so just makes you look stupid except trump seems to have broken that mold he must not understand politics he s actually doing what he said he would what are you smoking and can i have some it is a sad commentary on some libertarians and the democrats in general when even obl s parodies are so believable that newbies by his schtick much like obl s archetype that only happens in your own head really considering two people just fell for his schtick and thought he was being serious is reading comprehension to hard for you seem to remember you making same guarantee in 2016 i thought the obl parody account didn t start till after the 2016 election not a fan of trump either not by a long shot but the dems look so so much worse pretty much this i really dislike trump but all these democrats are nauseatingly atrocious i started out not liking trump thought he might be almost as bad as hitlery i have been very pleasantly surprised what i initially thought was just a vain narcissistic flim flam man has turned out to be a vain narcissistic champion of america and easily the best president in 3 decades the boorish rhetoric and confrontations over minutiae that i originally thought was just poor judgment and breeding has turned out to be a very effective weapon for keeping the socialists spun up over nothing his tweets are like the decoy balloons on an incoming nuclear missile and the demoncraps don t have any clue what to shoot at so they make fools of themselves by shooting at everything meanwhile all the indicators for america seem to be static or improving in some cases beyond the belief of his predecessor who said the jobs were gone and not coming back and laughed at the idea of 4 growth the major down side is that he s done little to rein in spending maybe in the second term a modest proposal anyone who advocates for gun confiscation should be compulsorily drafted by the government into a gun confiscation squad given a uniform and a gun and sent from door to door to confiscate guns from tens of millions of angry owners beta can have jersey 1 i think the sidearms of such a squad should be airsoft guns you know to avoid bruising the principals of the squadmembers but don t tell them we wouldn t want to hurt their feelings few people mention this but one of the reasons for a second amendment is that the founders felt that militias might be needed as a bulwark against tyranny are we so complacent that we believe that our democracy will never become a dictatorship if americans ever had to revolt en masse or make revolution i would hope that it could be achieved in a non violent gandhian fashion but the world doesn t always work that way as jefferson famously said the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants i don t hold with ghandi if they pass gun confiscation string them all up at lamp posts or just butcher them in the streets makes no difference to me lol 1 000 meghan mccain had a good zinger at beta o rourke the only man in texas who would revise come and take it to please come and take it he already says that whilst wiggling his ass high up in the air his damper pen to all cummers libertarian activist michael hihn please direct all correspondence to arkham asylum as dana loesch asked on twitter he s going to use guys with guns to seize legal property and is beto even allowed to own guns with his dui record and all he was never convicted it s getting serious now y all obl can t even put forth a comprehensible mock support of this the candidates have gone so far off the deep end that you can t even mock them it s not just a second amendment issue beto would crush the fifth amendment as well i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of gun dealers suddenly cried out in terror and raised the price of 5 54 and 7 62mm ball ammo 5 54 what s that a wildcat caliber and i don t use ball sometimes it s armor piercing sometimes it s hollow point ball ammunition is to satisfy the geneva convention and i don t much care about that i can t help but notice nobody bothered pointing out the difference between an ar 15 an ak 47 and a br 549 and how beto doesn t seem to know the difference which suggests none of the rest of them know the difference either most of their followers are too lazy to work and too nervous to steal most felons identify as democrats so that s clearly not true missed the br 549 reference junior samples thank you i bought my last rambler from samples sales don t kid yourself most of their followers are self styled intellectuals many have jobs of the sort one would expect from people with bachelors degrees in modern lit most of their votes are electronic phantoms democrats not knowing the first thing about guns has never stopped them from trying to steal them hell they have even argued knowing about guns isn t a prerequisite to discussing gun control that offering facts is a distraction from their goals lol they call it gunsplaining beto doesn t seem to know the difference not surprising he doesn t know much about anything else either jcr he tweeted about having a ban for that showed a gun that is already quite illegal to possess or even bfg 9000 ever see the clip of congresswoman mccarthy discussing her proposed gun ban legislation on tucker https www youtube com watch v ospnrk2um3u oh wait here s a bunch of them https www wideopenspaces com top 10 most idiotic anti gun quotes from politicians beto simply must be a rnc plant you re at least half right because he s a vegetable or being paid by gun mfrs hell he prob managed to sell 1 million guns with that statement right barbara streisand effect lol i wish i thought the rnc was that clever this buyback scheme requires a the theft of money through deadly force or threat of deadly force then b confiscation of guns enforced through deadly force of threat of deadly force then c returning a portion of the money stolen in step a above to the victim the important thing is for congress to set an example showing the initiation of deadly force is good it sends those shooters a message the same message they get in gubmint schools hmmm d spending more money on funerals for the dead victim from step a flavored vapes though that we gonna take here ya go the flavored vape and outright vape bans like nj is talking about show how bad government is at problem solving the recently highlighted health problems were linked to black market sales so government wants to ban them which will make the black market sales go up not down it s never about health it s about control as wilfred brimley might have put it what do you plan to do after your campaign ends beto because you got 30 days i like another wilford brimley quote hi this is wilford brimley welcome to retardation a celebration now hopefully with this book i m gonna dispel a few myths a few rumors first off the retarded don t rule the night they don t rule it nobody does and they don t run in packs and while they may not be as strong as apes don t lock eyes with em don t do it puts em on edge they might go into berzerker mode come at you like a whirling dervish all fists and elbows you might be screaming no no no and all they hear is who wants cake let me tell you something they all do they all want cake the cake is a lie it is almost like they want to see if they can lose all the states hillary lost while also putting minnesota which was close and very likely could go republican colorado new mexico nevada and possibly virginia oregon and washington into play hell vermont new hampshire and maine could also be up for grabs is the dnc holding it s convention in chicago by any chance because that would be the capstone if we had a repeat of that fiasco i have two theories which could both be in operation 1 i think the dnc shaken by their screwup in 22016 nervous about their positions in the party and aware that the party has the bench strength of the little sisters of the poor tackle football team have written off 2020 and are allowing the party rebels who might otherwise try to oust the dnc from their in party sinecures to break themselves on trump 2 i think that the far left of the democrat party still expects trump to act like a gentlemanly republican loser you can see their shock every time he doesn t they are fully delusional and don t learn they think they can pull off a massive enough vote fraud that their lack of appeal with the vermin who disagree with their wonderful selves won t matter and they think that when such a scheme becomes obvious trump won t take the whole thing and ram it up their collective backside why the schemers in 1 haven t called the twits in 2 is something i can t quite figure out maybe the dnc wants the loons in prison for vote fraud and think the party could re brand as we policed our own and move forward maybe they are oblivious it wouldn t be the first time after all they nominated granny maojackets von pantsuit maybe the far left of the party is running fully amok and is becoming any ability they might have to rein it in or i may be full of hot air and the whole party really does think this idiocy is a winning strategy i think it s all three to some degree the old guard who is playing the long game are in column 1 and 2 the newer breed is definitely column 3 thing is with social media there to simply amplify their mania studies have shown that progressives consume basically only leftist media while conservatives and actual moderates consume rightist and leftist media i m not sure they have a way to keep the rebels back they have talking points that trump logic it s why some dems can bemoan how gerrymandering cost abrams her governor s seat and why no democrat will outright say she lost it s why the same people who lord over their degrees from elite schools also expect those they view as beneath them to cover the costs for those degrees they can do nothing with hell aoc can actually call for congressional payraises and sees nothing remotely untoward about it she s been in office for six months and is paid many times more than she has been aoc is being paid many times her worth but that was true when she was screwing up her customers orders as a barista indeed and if she decided to spend thousands upon thousands to attend bc and develop zero skills in the process why should i have to bail out somebody who makes more than i do i cannot fathom a more regressive program in the world than this social security is more regressive take from the working poor to give to the idle rich maybe they have a plan to make the electoral college irrelevant by 2020 which i think would be too fast even if it eventually happens did you miss all the wonderful things the demoncraps are going to get for you free school student debt forgiveness free medical care a pollution free planet more benefits from taxing the rich perfect safety just ban the guns a cure for cancer free child care free abortions guaranteed income slave reparations free housing this is the same old demoncrap playbook but they re running out of free things to promise so the current selection is looking silly it s all they have left sadly there are people who believe they ll get more free stuff with the demoncraps so that s how they ll vote and some people just believe in government for government s sake but yeah to any sane person the demoncraps are in shit thyself mode californication has consequences colorado is a permanent pinko loss i d be gobsmacked if it ever again goes for an r presidential candidate i m hoping musk hurries up with that mars colony when they try this stuff on mars it will still be rough and tumble enough for throwing the sjw s out an airlock in some fairness i m pretty darn conservative and i just moved to colorado from texas while i have to agree colorado is pretty fucked up politically we can hope texans moving here helps to balance out the californian s moving here well at least that s what i tell myself at night at least i live in one of the few conservative area s of the state so there s at least some local support for more liberty i also met wayne harlos recently seems to be a pretty nice guy and he s working locally to make the area a bit more libertarian who s wayne harlos and is he in el paso county i recall roadside signs as far as 50 years back on highway 95 north of jordan valley saying don t californicate idaho a mystical heckler was baiting beto for not forcing women to reproduce the obvious comeback was all persons born in the 14th amendment but that would open the door for someone to bring up shall not be infringed in the bill of rights lyin ted beat beto on bill of rights and energy and crushed neal dikeman on global warming hysteria the gop really needs some competition a mystical heckler so dr strange was there so is the dnc then dormammu i think this confiscation plan might fly in about four states the others not so much you know i ve always felt that personally i never had much of a use for a ar type platform rifle i might have to reevaluate that position which four states they can t even get new yorkers to register their guns new jersey residents have refused to turn in their high capacity magazines washingtonians openly flaunt their universal background check laws as do coloradoans not sure which state this would actually work in yeah in any state once you leave the cities you aren t going to find many who will get behind gun confiscation and they really have no way to know who has guns to confiscate or if they do how many guns anyone has even in states that have attempted registration i m sure compliance is very low i would bet they have a list of names based on background checks i would also bet that they would comb through electronic money transactions for ammo and gun purchases then the government s assumption is if you have a gun you probably have more than one that is assuming the government that had lost multi million dollar probes because they didn t convert imperial units to metric couldn t find bin laden for a decade who misplaced billions of dollars in war funding and defense funding and missed the build up to 9 11 is competent enough to do this don t underestimate your adversary there are plenty of single shot rifles on the market that use teh same ammo as all teh scary guns do so buying ammo is not a precurser to owning an ar especially of teh 308 variety of course but do you think the government will consider that when going after gun owners the government hasn t been able to get more than a trivial number of firearms out of the hands of criminals so why would it have more success against formerly law abiding gun owners we haven t had anyone go full retard on gun control yet once the feds go full retard they will use every federal resource to their advantage beto seems qualified for the job they cannot keep records of gun sales so if they have the records it is a violation of federal law also police cannot look at electronic sales records unless they have a warrant any move to create some type of gun registry was specifically prohibited by congress in last gun laws passed unless the retailers willingly cooperate like hotels and internet service providers and social media companies the retailers will be held hostage by banks visa mc and amex who will revoke their merchant privileges unless they comply with their new policy of cooperating fully with batfe so we re just pretending that the nsa doesn t suck up vast amounts of patently illegal information for them to have we re also pretending they don t turn around and mete that information out to the alphabet soup for parallel construction when it comes to the law there s always a three letter agency there to go around it they cannot keep records of gun sales so if they have the records it is a violation of federal law if you purchase with credit or debit card the record of that transaction is kept and the feds have already argued that banking records are administrative and they can get then with a national security letter also byodb s post actually i was being generous i am pretty sure that not even the das and cops in ca outside of maybe a county or two would be down with enforcing this law i feel that you re gonna have a lot of cops who d at the very least be uncomfortable not that i m gonna trust law enforcement to do the right thing but if oregon is anything to go off of rural law enforcement might just tell dc where they can shove it palmetto state armory is a good choice for budget ar 15s https palmettostatearmory com ar 15 pa 15 rifles html upper barrel length 1380 still cheaper rifles are available but these are a good price point think honda civic i ve got a couple and wish i d gone up caliber a bit more 223 556 is kinda puny i m really more of a 308 30 06 guy the man is aware of 3d printers no should we tell him about the british sten gun a machine pistol specifically designed so that it could be made with everyday parts found in a hardware store or the m3 grease gun machine pistol made from all stamped metal in a gm headlight factory and even if you have no machining skills or tools you can make a reasonably effective 12 gauge shotgun for about 25 of stuff from a hardware store can i be there when you print it out and then fire oh the 2nd or 3rd bullet do you have a ballistics shield by any chance yes 3 d printed guns will always fail after the first or second shot because technology never improves over time nah that s a fundamental limitation of the soft low melting point plastic that a true 3d printer uses soft easily melting plastic just doesn t hold up well when you are putting literal explosions inside of it any 3d printed gun will be a single shot hand cannon a single shot hand grenade that you can t throw more like ever hear of laser sintering they re already 3d printing model 1911s https www nextbigfuture com 2013 11 metal 3d printed gun which proves laser html it s like the liberator pistol you re only supposed to use it once or twice and then take a nice gun off the corpse of the government goon who came after you australian outlaw motorcycle clubs bikies went into the business of making copies of the mac 10 submachine gun in their workshops after the government of oz confiscated legal and registered military style rifle from the australian public funny thing is the number of registered sks rifles was about half the number of known legal sks imports yea they believe there are now more full auto guns in australia than before the ban you clearly have zero understanding of firearms or how they work 3d printed lowers are just as reliable as machined aluminum ones there is an entire pistol industry created by the polymer lower it is called a glock upper parts and barrels are not regulated and can be easily machines from bar stock guns like everything else are most reviled by those most ignorant of them meant for the fuck puppet troll not naaman brown if communities want to elect people who don t want guns in their community why should some asshole lawyer be able to wave the 2nd amendment in their face and shout uh huh fuck off slaver because federalism is dog whistle racism because rights are not subject to violation simply because democracy says they are if every single person in the us were to vote that some random person be killed democracy would not make the violation of that random person s rights by any more justified than if a single person were to kill that random person cool now do abortion i ll try hey poor lady we know that you got pregnant because you re boyfriend got sick of waiting and decided to date rape you but we can t let you abort the kid you don t want because some jesus freak taliban guy doesn t want you to do it oh and btw if you decide to do it the old fashioned way with a coat hanger and we find out about it we ll cast you down with the sodomites you ll think you ve been fucked by a train good woooosh that s actually pretty good brah really captures the mindset i m pro choice myself too bad you re a gutless anti gun beta cuck you d think you wouldn t want righties to be the only ones bearing arms other than pigs of course but i guess some people are just submissive by nature yes you have indeed proven that you re an annoying retard because if south carolina wants to maintain there peculiar institution why should they be forced to end it oh wait i think this was settled in 1865 why should some asshole lawyer be able to wave the 2nd amendment in their face because the constitution supersedes state and local law in certain specific areas it s funny how all you libertarians use federalism when it suits you and almost in the same breadth talk about how you don t like the government how do you do that you seem to miss the point of the written constitution which by design limits the government to a small list of activities disarming the populace is not one of them more to the point the bill of rights doesn t create any rights it only enshrines protects pre existing rights take away the entire document the rights remain their inconsistent grasp of the central government securing abortion rights with federalism securing drug rights makes me completely sick of their hypocrisy it s almost like they see government as a means to an end or something cool now do jim crow for the same reason that if communities want to elect people who want to outlaw all churches except the 7th day adventists some asshole lawyer will be able to wave the 1st amendment in their face and shout uh huh so yeah fuck off slaver eloquent argument for racial segregation there promising to smash the second amendment i m actually for burning it and then throwing amendments 1 3 26 in the fire along with it this dumb country deserves to go the way of the soviet union along with its thousands of nuclear weapons and 19 20ths of its despicable military i m actually for burning it shut up you whiny asshole don t you have something better to do like shooting up a school or running for the democrat nomination meant as a reply to ltal beta this republic remains one of the few places on this planet that still has any true respect for the individual rather than a collection of adult sized infants looking to suck off of the public teat while willingly supporting their abusive provider co dependence yes that would be the clinical diagnosis i believe at least we pay our mortgages as tempting as it is to believe that the brass at the democratic party are all either insane or a few standard deviations below average iq i don t think that s the case the chance of winning a presidential election from an incumbent in the last 100 years is less than 40 add in to that a pretty healthy economy low unemployment across the board for all demographics etc and you have to assume their chance of winning is maybe 10 15 so strategically if you are probably going to lose a fight what do you do first is you try to lose as little as possible second is you start looking for opportunities where losing is actually gaining you a bit in return so to address lose as little as possible they won t put their all stars in the wings up in likely losing battle it makes no sense to open them up to a long bloody battle where their reputation could be sullied they could make some big gaffes on tv etc to address the second point about gaining a bit in return this is a perfect opportunity for the moderate democrats to let the far left hang themselves with their own words after an abysmal showing next fall the far left democrats will be removed from committees the party will take a new direction back to fundamentals and if the far left members object their quickly be able to mention the disaster of 2020 incidentally this is similar to what happened 3 years ago hillary was finally given her chance during an election which was 90 in the bag for republicans she lost and now is relegated to knitting tweeting and doing book signings in blue states the clintons lost their power exactly like the dnc brass wanted them to they won t put their all stars in the wings up in likely losing battle it makes no sense to open them up to a long bloody battle where their reputation could be sullied so you re saying that sanders warren biden are not the all stars after obama no longer eligible and clinton she he s no longer eligible either really who might these shining stars patiently biding their time be to address the second point about gaining a bit in return this is a perfect opportunity for the moderate democrats to let the far left hang themselves with their own words this part may be true good analysis but the dems all stars in the wings are the lady who lost the governor s race in georgia the beto who lost the senate race in texas and aoc who is too young to run for prez try it beto sst other than that how was the play mrs o rourke mr o rourke whose mandatory buyback programme is a part of his comprehensive gun control plan has also called for a ban on assault style guns and high capacity magazines which he has also said would be required to be sold to the us government under his administration after he confiscates your ar and ak he ll want your handguns then your shotguns then your knives molon labe dems molon labe mid 1990s i watched the waco hearings on cspan charles schumer was ok with jack booted thugs burning babies at in the gas and tank attack on the davidians mt carmel center outside waco in the name of gun control 1970 gun controllers admitted that ken ballew shot in an atf raid over alleged illegal weapons that turned out not illegal may not have done anything wrong but they praised atf for responding vigorously to reports of illegal weapons and if us gun nuts did not like the prospect of having our doors knocked down in the night and shot if we defended ourselves maybe we should rethink the wisdom of owning guns in their america it was 1970 they passed the 1968 gca giving them the power they set gun policy not the nra then after several election losses over gun rights issues gun control became a dangerous untouchable third rail for the democrats with the 2020 election results i guess we will find out if the third rail is still live as it will be in the future it was at the birth of man there are only four things certain since social progress began that the dog returns to his vomit and the sow returns to her mire and the burnt fool s bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the fire gun control is the democrats fire that they can never keep their fingers out of for long they so desperately want it that they keep forgetting that it burns them at the ballot box reading us v miller 1939 i noticed that the 1934 national firearms act was justified by the legal theory behind the federal harrison narcotics act the war on guns is based on applying the tactics of the war on drugs allegedly to reduce crime since uk gun laws are usually cited for decades as the example we should follow in this democrat war on gun owners i have looked at uk gun policy for years now gavin hales chris lewis and daniel silverstone gun crime the market in and use of illegal firearms home office research study 298 home office research development and statistics directorate december 2006 conducted about ten years after the much ballyhooed uk handgun ban 1996 this study into the criminal gun culture in england and wales included a short survey of 80 incarcerated gun criminals and gives a good snapshot of the street criminal view of guns in the uk uk inmates told interviewers that they could have a gun within a week of release including submachine guns if they had the money and wanted one i come away from reading home office research study 298 with the impression that banning civilian guns has not disarmed uk criminals but created a class of criminal known as armourer who serves as a source for criminal weapons trafficking stolen or smuggled guns repairing or modifing old used guns converting blank guns or deactivated guns to fire live ammo or using replicas or air guns as frames for zip guns it became easier to get an illegal handgun on the street than before the ban it has also made having a functioning pistol of some sort a street status item among the people in uk emulating the american gangsta culture reminded me of the michael cain movie harry brown 1997 british handgun ban and british murders and robberies o six years before the handgun ban 1991 1996 total murders 4 240 handgun murders 176 total robberies 358 178 handgun robberies 17 321 o six years after the ban 1998 2003 total murders 5 103 handgun murders 255 total robberies 576 218 handgun robberies 17 047 one point i saw about the uk handgun ban use of sawed off shotguns in murder dropped after the handgun ban substitution of sawed off shotgun for handgun is a measure of illegal handgun scarcity i argue that the increase in handgun murders from 176 in the six years before the handgun ban to 255 after is a measure of illegal handgun availability but after 1996 the british olympic pistol team were forced to leave their handguns at gun ranges in belgium and to commute to belgium to target practice what a victory for the gun banners colin greenwood superintendent west yorkshire metropolitan police writing in 1972 about the effects of half a century of uk gun control from the 1920 firearms act to the uk 1968 firearms act in firearms control routledge kegan paul london 1972 no matter how one approaches the figures one is forced to the conclusion that the use of firearms in crime was very much less when there were no controls of any sort and when anyone convicted criminal or lunatic could buy any type of firearm without restriction half a century of strict controls on pistols has ended perversely with a far greater use of this class of weapon in crime than ever before the democrat national party tone deaf in its echo chamber has branded itself the party of gun bans these idiots make donald trump look like a better choice i apologise accidentally flagged this proving that guns don t cause crime criminals cause crime the uk government banned guns but imported more criminals and made the police force into useless hall monitors chasing thought criminals the numbers show the result correct at the turn of the 20th century the uk had virtually no gun control laws and very little crime any person could buy and carry a revolver in his pocket anywhere in the uk the right to keep and bear arms was slowly extinguished over the 20th century while the crime rate has soared see page 14 of this uk parliamentary report for a fascinating graph it shows that the number of indictable offences per thousand population in 1900 was 2 4 and in 1997 the figure was 89 1 an increase of 37 fold since the early 1960s the homicide rate has more than doubled uk house of commons library a century of change trends in uk statistics since 1900 see page 14 but o rourke also promised that he would make the process an inclusive one saying that he would bring everyone in america into the conversation republicans democrats gun owners and non gun owners alike a one sided conversation to be certain open the door or we ll break it down at best beto believes that it s time to start shooting gun owners in order to end gun violence after all it s perfectly ok to kill terrorists and now that he nra and most gun owners are terrorists it s time to declare open season on gun owners now the swat teams that have practiced by shooting dogs can start shooting people there are two types of leftists those who admit they want to take your guns and those who claim non leftists who argue against this group are crazily fighting strawmen because no one wants to confiscate guns jeffrey goldberg of the atlantic is one of the latter i wonder what he has to say to dear beto however i do not wonder what he ll say if it ever happens he ll say great this is entirely appropriate and anyone against it is a neanderthal this group s position has been summarized as that will never happen and when it does you ll totally deserve it reference the outrage when meghan mccain stated that o rourke s gun confiscation would result in violence someone actually argued that her statement of fact proved that gun owners aren t stable enough to own guns to the author of the aforementioned article to his credit he admitted that o rourke s plan would not pass the legislature and even if it did the courts would kill it usurping the 13th amendment should also produce violence beto sort of looks like the straw man though and no one outside the lunatic right gives two shits about your assault rifles most americans want those guns outlawed most americans aren t obsessed with guns fuck your guns you know if you troll here you could at least try to make your comment cogent or clever it is revealing you want to fuck guns that generally have a barrel diameter between 1 4 and 1 3 of an inch if your equipment is that small i understand why you might be angry what is an assault rifle how is it different than my savage a22 anyone who uses that term doesn t know what they are talking about what i find funny is that they think people that don t know shit about the subject matter should be front and center in the process yet they complain when trump does this in washington state it s not different i wanted to buy a ruger 10 22 target rifle uh uh you haven t passed the background check to own an assault rifle ahhh show us on the doll where the lower receiver touched you most americans want those guns outlawed then most americans need to amend the constitution of the federal government and those of the several states via the methods written into them and no one outside the lunatic right gives two shits about your assault rifles most americans want those guns outlawed virtually no americans legally own assault rifles and effectively no one is arguing for any change to their legal status is this the same most americans who want greater restrictions on access to abortions and no one outside the lunatic right gives two shits about your assault rifles oh and libertarians but you could never understand the difference between the right and libertarians could you tony guess in your mind anyone opposing giving all power to your precioussss governmentsesss is right wing also you ignorant turd assault rifle ownership is already de facto outlawed ooooh thcary gunth limp wrist flippers flapping if that were true it would be easy to repeal the second amendment how s that going so far well so much for the we don t want to take your guns we just want common sense gun laws line from the democrats at least we can thank beto for revealing their true colors they ve been saying shit like this for ages but when it s pointed out they insist we re being paranoid yeah i was tired of listening to that few reasonable gun laws horseshit i d rather the wankers just be honest about it i have noticed it s been awhile since brian posted no one is going to take your guns you can try beto i d love to see you make the attempt personally i like to ask gun grabbers if this gun http www montanatactical com ruger precision rifle 6 5 creedmoor should be banned as an assault rifle under their definitions every single one so far has said yes the see a magazine barrel shroud adjustable stock and a scary black gun military style completely overlooking the manual bolt action at this point they are advocating banning things because they look scary not on anything concrete albeit still ridiculous like caliber or rate of fire easier to ask them what gun they won t ban maybe a radar gun they do not care semi automatics are just the low hanging fruit as far as they are concerned they will not rest until all such firearms including bolt actions and single shot break actions are banned or otherwise restricted to the greatest extent possible picture having to check your rifle and ammunition out immediately prior to going hunting and then checking it in immediately afterwards along with a formal accounting for piece of fired brass heaven help you if you do not return every unfired round so you served in the army too because they were so afraid of military grade ammo btw us military ammo is so much shit that most our nato allies forbid their troops from using it except in emergencies the powder burns dirty that we either had to account for every round checked out or fire every single round so if you were the last guy on the shooting line after firing your required qualification rounds they d start handing you every magazine that hadn t been fired at the end of an 3 day ftx that involved live fire i calculated i fired over 1000 rounds through my 16 being the last guy to fire at the last range hell they didn t even raise the targets and we just fired away my barrel was to hot to touch despite it being in the low 20s for about ten minutes after i left the range the amount of waste was simply astonishing not to mention the damage to the barrel and how much shit i had to clean out of my rifle the next day how much shit i had to clean out of my rifle the next day neither myself nor any other marine i served with would fire blanks on training exercises for this reason we would yell bang bang seriously been there done that got the fucking t shirt we sometimes slap our miles sensors to to trigger them rather than firing the rifle i actually killed an op for this way once i wonder if a bushmaster xm15 varminter will fall under this regulation it is easily a 1500 gun without much modification btw this example kind of dispels the idea that you can t hunt with an ar style rifle out of curiosity what is the fair price of a now banned gun when it comes time for the government to buy it back from me i cannot legally purchase a new one for any amount of money effectively making it priceless to replace right they better be offering me tens of millions of dollars per banned gun for that to be even reasonably considered a fair market value i m pretty sure they take the position that once they ve banned a gun it becomes contraband and the legal value of contraband is zero yes one of the first things the state does is ignores the laws of economics which cannot be stopped by man s laws economic law is as impossible to change as laws of physics hmmmm fdr and gold coinage comes to mind oh damn reading about his manipulation of the gold market is still mind blowing also how he could legally just force all contracts to be changed cause fdr sure as shit did so the first generation or so of the republic would have never elected him or impeached him had he somehow weasled his way into power personally i d like to see his picture replaced by reagan s on the dime not that reagan was perfect but he s the best we ve had in a long long time reference adams and his administration then see if you want to stand by that assertion i considered that adams was a single termer deservedly so so dropping my hyperbole fdr would never have been re elected to a second term he still should have been impeached for not understanding the limits of his job and the authority granted the federal government i believe beta is estimating at around 500 or half of what i paid for mine so fuck him what a dummy if you vote dem you are my enemy i considered selling my guns to the government but after a thorough background check i ve determined that they have a history of violence and are a danger to everyone they interact with wouldn t be prudent for me to sell firearms to such an entity ahahaha well said man look i m just trying to be a responsible gun owner like the left wants don t want any blood on my hands from lack of universal background checking particularly since some of my guns are of the scary black gun variety selling those to such a known violent entity would basically make me a child murderer yep sell it to the government and it might end up in the hands of mexican cartels that ll be an interesting day when the fascists go door to door in my neighborhood confiscating guns bloody but interesting it will be even more interesting when the neighborhood is the west side of chicago in fact i think that s where they should start in point of fact they won t be going after illegal guns those would be dangerous to try and confiscate and cops already fail miserably at that task right now today what they are talking about are taking legal guns and i would wager there aren t a whole lot of those in chicago welcome to eastern montana fed where you can see your dog run away for a week oh like i like to say a wide open field of fire is your neighborhood a predominantly black neighborhood maybe it is just me but i have a much more practical outlook on this last night we started with ten n 10 democrat candidates beto just blew himself out of the running with his mandatory gun grabbing nfw he wins so now there are nine please if there is a god in heaven please please please have 3 4 of these communist dwarves with roughly the same number of delegates head into a contested convention next summer castro and harris are likely done too guess it s time to buy another gun more ammo and some high capacity mags if the government isn t going to respect my rights then i will have to defend them myself gosh it wasn t too long ago that gun control proponents were telling us no one s going to take your guns away begs the question were they lying then or is this a real change i predict a uptick in molon labe merchandise being sold presidential candidate promises to violate his oath of office before he s even elected people cheer what did padme say about how liberty dies but o rourke also promised that he would make the process an inclusive one saying that he would bring everyone in america into the conversation republicans democrats gun owners and non gun owners alike inclusive in this case simply means everyone gets their guns taken away over their protestations i think starting from the position of we are going to take your guns automatically makes this non inclusive in terms of decision making came here for the ammo sexual comments wasn t disappointed love all of the people who imagine themselves becoming the next malheur standoff derp derp you won t take my guns jesus christ like stereotypes of stereotypes another anti gun person fascinated with other peoples genitalia what was the compliance rate in new zealand and australia less than 50 and we already know what happens when the government tries to confiscate guns ask thomas gage how that turned out robert francis o rourke is a douche and he is going to get innocent people and police killed really beto almost makes me ashamed to be a texan however the price to the u s government for my ar style long gun just went up to 2 500 and my ak 47 just went up to 2 000 meantime my soviet and chicom 7 62x54r rifles which actually are assault rifles some potentially with actual battlefield service remain unaffected by assault rifle laws even though they are military grade weapons and were released for service unlike my consumer market ar and ak neither my ar nor my ak ever got within a million miles of actual military use but beto can still pay me for them if he pays me enough waitwait what about my taurus pt 9 9mm semi auto pistol which once was brazil s standard issue military sidearm and is a clone of the the us army s beretta sidearm doesn t it count as an assault weapon or my vietnam era surplus navy seal dive knife how about my navy colt 1851 revolver i have provenance tracing this cool cap and ball pistol to an 1861 us army contract it surfaced in texas in about 2005 with provenance potentially linking it to teddy roosevelt s rough riders but where it was between 1861 and 1899 our best guess is that it was stolen off a dead yellow leg on a southern battlefield in the war of northern aggression so it most unconditionally is an assault weapon i think beto needs a semester or two of military arms history before he flaps his gums again beto if you or any of your people see this please feel free to contact me first things first gun violence two words first word guns pass a law that successfully takes all guns from the hands of private americans voila no more gun violence only violence remains psychopaths who would have used guns turn to bombs ieds trucks and perhaps chemical or biological weapons all of which are readily available to anyone of average intelligence and potentially far deadlier the greatest mass murder in a school in bath mi google it was by bombs in europe where gun control is strict isis has been schooling its cadre in the construction and use of remote controlled bombs triggered by cell phones the school mass shooters in santa fe nm and columbine co also had bombs and the parkland fl shooter has researched nail bombs on a school computer before settling for a gun second word violence if a law could be enacted that successfully eliminated violence gun violence would be a thing of the past even if every person in america owned a dozen assault rifles and a half dozen automatic pistols logical conclusion there is no gun violence problem the problem is violence a ban of any type of guns is just doing something that won t reduce gun violence and will certainly increase it because some gun owners believing in the constitution won t allow anyone to take their guns without a gun fight more logic gun control is a euphemism for people control people control by government is accomplished by force force is violence gun control freaks are violent people your appreciation of the destructive power of explosives is reasonable however bombs can t compete with guns for coolness and sexiness there s a reason james bond went about toting his little pistol rather than a pair of grenades his walther ppk was sexier and cooler than any grenade on the market i m confident in asserting won t allow anyone to take their guns without a gun fight just take the damn gun after the gun fight when the deceased gun owner is no longer in a position to fire or fondle the thing correction to my previous comment pass a law that takes all guns from the hands of private americans and the only gun violence remaining is that committed by government agents which is plenty undoubtedly government agents kill far more people throughout the world than all private mass murderers kamala harris is a cunt nothing more needs to be said about someone desiring to be the president while laughing at their intent to violate the constitution they would be asked to preserve protect and defend cunt who is going to protect you better a gun or government at least with a gun you have a fighting chance beto is a marxist along with the entire gaggle of dem candidates nuff said the government can kill you from the sky before you even know what s happening the five steps is missing one step well a few an amendment is also needed to grant congress the power to regulate firearms which is not listed as a power they have in article i section 8 the tenth amendment makes it clear that such regulation is therefore left up to the states and the people respectively so if just the second amendment is nullified probably the 8 states who still basically ban concealed carry by ordinary non politically connected residents will ban guns but it s unlikely the other 42 will to avoid the interstate commerce clause it may be necessary to set up independent gun manufacturing business in each of those 42 states but people would be free to cross state lines with guns they own carrying something you own across state lines is not commerce and certainly not interstate commerce please log in to post
