without preconditions in a bid to ease tensions those tensions have been mounting since trump last year withdrew the u s from a global nuclear deal with iran and began pressuring tehran with economic sanctions a fresh round of iran sanctions is to be announced monday in a bid to force the iranian leadership into talks they know precisely how to find us pompeo said it was a week of topsy turvy pronouncements on u s policy toward iran that careened between the bellicose the conciliatory and back again after iran shot down an american military drone and boasted it would not bow to washington s pressure trump initially said iran had made a very big mistake and that it was hard to believe that shooting down the drone on thursday was not intentional he later said he thought it was an unintentional act carried out by a loose and stupid iranian and called off retaliatory military strikes against iran on saturday trump reversed himself and claimed that iran had acted knowingly but trump also said over the weekend that he appreciated iran s decision to not shoot down a manned u s spy plane and he opined about eventually becoming iran s best friend if tehran ultimately agrees to abandon its drive to build nuclear weapons and he helps the country turn around its crippled economy then trump s national security adviser john bolton stepped in sunday with a blunt warning from jerusalem where he was traveling bolton said iran should not mistake u s prudence and discretion for weakness after trump called off the military strike trump said he backed away from the planned strikes after learning that about 150 people would be killed but he said the military option remained a longtime iran hawk bolton emphasized that the u s reserved the right to attack at a later point

others according to the saudi military such attacks have been cited by saudi and u s officials as examples of iran s malign behavior in the middle east pompeo who addressed reporters from the tarmac before he boarded his airplane in washington declared the goal of his talks with the saudi kingdom and the uae is to deny iran the resources to foment terror to build out their nuclear weapon system to build out their missile program we are going to deny them the resources they need to do that thereby keep american interests and american people safe all around the world said pompeo who was due to

against iranian military computer systems according to u s officials the cyberattacks disabled iranian revolutionary guard corps computer systems that controlled its rocket and missile launchers the

interested in a dialogue with trump his administration is aiming to cripple iran s economy and force policy changes by re imposing sanctions including on iranian oil exports associated press writers
