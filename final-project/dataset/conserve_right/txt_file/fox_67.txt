of the week a 100 year old hat maker she and her designs are one of a kind all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington the spread of the coronavirus here in the u s has dramatically changed the way americans live it aposs shaking the markets and left washington scrambling to provide care for the sick and ease the financial fallout here is the latest the president aposs doctor announced mr trump tested negative for the virus after coming into contact with several people who tested positive the president also expanded the european travel ban to now include the u k and ireland in a moment we aposll speak with the government aposs top expert on infectious disease dr anthony fauci and treasury secretary steven mnuchin but first let aposs bring in kristin fisher reporting from the white house with the latest on the effort to stem the outbreak kristin kristin fisher fox news correspondent chris life is changing across the country and here at the white house just yesterday journalists were required to have their temperature taken before they were allowed into a briefing with president trump and other senior administration officials even president trump decided it was time that he should be tested for the coronavirus begin videotape trump i also took the test last night fisher the test came back negative according to a letter released last night from the white house physician but nearly 3 000 other americans have tested positive and that number is only expected to rise as the country aposs ability to test for the virus accelerates so far more than 50 americans have died millions of students are out of school and 39 states plus the district of columbia have declared a state of emergency president trump declared a national emergency on friday and yesterday he expanded the travel restrictions he placed on most of europe to include ireland and the united kingdom as americans racing to get home face lines that stretched for hours at u s airports for enhanced health screenings the president also confirmed that he was considering implementing domestic travel restrictions trump specifically from certain areas yes we are and we aposre working with the states and we are considering other restrictions end videotape fisher and on capitol hill house speaker nancy pelosi and treasury secretary steven mnuchin hammered out a release deal which includes free coronavirus testing and two weeks of paid sick leave for workers that bill is now heading to the senate and it could be taken up as early as tomorrow chris wallace kristin fisher reporting from the white house kristin thanks and joining us now dr anthony fauci the government aposs top official on infectious diseases and doctor welcome back to fox news sunday dr anthony fauci director national institute of allergy infectious diseases good to be with you chris wallace i want to start with those videos that kristin fisher just showed of those thousands of people at airports over night rushing to beat the travel ban waiting on line for hours you can see them here in close proximity one assumes coming back from europe some of them have the coronavirus as an infectious disease doctor are you troubled seeing this fauci yes i mean we aposd like to not see crowds like that i think what people need to understand if you aposre an american citizen if you are a family member that you can get back you don apost need to rush back you aposll be able to get back but it aposs understandable how when people see a travel ban they immediately want to hunker and get home hopefully we don apost have more of that but i think we probably unfortunately will see that wallace and is that a problem in terms of the spread of the disease fauci obviously whenever you have crowds i mean that aposs the thing we aposve been talking about and that we really want to implement is to have that kind of social separation that is countermanding that and hopefully that people will understand that you don apost have to rush back wallace and to what degree is it on the airports to prevent that and not have those big crowds of people waiting for hours fauci i don apost know chris what the airports can do about that to try and encourage people to tell them that if you are an american citizen you will be able to get back it aposs not going to be a problem wallace you testified before congress this week and you made i think what most people would consider some pretty chilling comments here they are begin clip fauci bottom line it aposs going to get worse the flu has a mortality of 0 1 percent this has a mortality of 10 times that end clip wallace what aposs different about this virus what aposs different in how contagious it is and how lethal it is fauci well the i would say three things chris one it aposs brand new so we don apost have any prior experience about what it aposs going to do what it aposs dynamics are going to be number two it spreads very easily there aposs no doubt about that it isn apost like some of the other outbreaks that we had that just didn apost adapt itself to spread among humans and number three it aposs very serious in the sense of morbidity and mortality particularly among and very heavily weighted towards individuals who are more susceptible the elderly and those with underlying conditions wallace and in terms of contagiousness and lethality worse than the flu fauci well yes i mean it just is and we aposve got to face that fact we aposve got to be realistic i mean we aposve got to realize and i said that at the hearing that things are going to get worse before they get better but the kinds of things we aposre doing now will hopefully mitigate that i showed that curve crosstalk fauci but that aposs important because to think that right now everything is going to be ok if you don apost do anything that aposs absolutely incorrect we aposve got a really always be ahead of the curve i mean i was i say now in a way that people can understand i aposd like to be the fact that we aposre criticized for being over reactive because when you aposre dealing with a virus outbreak you are always behind where you think you are so therefore you aposve got to jump ahead and stay ahead of the curve wallace i want to ask you about this on friday both you and the president at one point mentioned eight weeks fauci yes wallace now you weren apost saying it aposs all going to be over in eight weeks but are you suggesting that if we do everything right that we could be on the other side of the curve in eight weeks fauci yes the first of all we have to say that people don apost misunderstand we are not sure what the duration is going to be number one number two if you look at what happened in china where they had that peak and then they are coming down there were only 11 new cases in china they dominated the new cases just a few months ago so it started off china you know two or three months ago they started coming down within a two month period so if you aposre talking about reflecting what went on there it aposs going to be about that time that we hopefully in the next couple of months are going to see the direction it aposs going to go hopefully what we aposre doing in a very aggressive way of containment and mitigation we aposll be able to not only flatten it in the sense of not as many cases but also diminish the duration wallace president trump announced a public private partnership on friday and made it sound like the serious testing around the country that we aposll be seeing it soon first there was this begin video clip trump i want to thank google google is helping to develop a website it aposs going to be very quickly done unlike websites of the past end video clip wallace but google aposs sister company verily put out a statement later that said this test which according to him and other officials first of all will let you sort of check whether your symptoms indicate you have it and two if you do seem to have it will tell you where you can get testing fauci right wallace in fact is just starting and is just in a pilot program for the bay area and that it aposs going to take over time they said for it to be applied nationally and while the president made it sound like mass testing is going to start very soon there are a lot of experts who say that whether it aposs staffing public health staffing or the products or the chemicals needed for mass testing that we aposre very behind the curve on that so i guess my question is how soon can people across the country expect mass drive thru testing fauci ok so there are two issues here chris there aposs a website and when it aposs going to be fully open versus the availability of testing they really are somewhat separate so put aside the website and how it aposs going to be fully operational the ceos of the companies that we had at the white house that the president met with it aposs very clear that when i specifically asked them when can we get started to start doing this where you can really have availability in a much easier way implementing not just saying that it aposs out there they aposre telling us that that will be starting up within the next week or so that it aposs going to go up now in the reality there are going to be people a week from now who are going to say i tried to get a test but i couldn apost get it but the totality of the picture is going to be infinitely better than it was a few weeks ago wallace i want to talk to you about a few weeks ago because there are continuing questions about why other countries south korea maybe the best example are testing thousands of people a day and so far the cdc says that it and state labs total the whole crisis have tested 13 000 people here aposs how you and the president answered questions about the testing lag this week begin video clip fauci the idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it we aposre not set up for that do i think we should be yes but we aposre not trump no i don apost take responsibility at all because we were given a a set of circumstances and we were given rules regulations and specifications from a different time end video clip wallace the president says the obama administration set up rules and regulations that made it impossible to do testing you were in the same position under the obama administration is that true is that what stopped it fauci you know chris to be honest with you i aposm not sure what regulations or what it was that they aposre talking about i really mean that i mean i aposm trying to figure out what it is that these things were in place that were able to or inhibiting but one thing that i do know now is that the ability to get a test had some regulatory and other restrictions on it that the fda now has just gotten rid of wallace i mean they could have done that day one fauci well yes they could have but the fact is it wasn apost so i tend to like to instead of looking back look at where we aposre going wallace all right you talk about slowing the virus down you talk a lot and i aposve very used to this now you can either have a bump like this of cases or you could make it maybe the same total cases but it aposs a much more gradual and slower and longer curve i want to put up some numbers we have in this country about 950 000 hospital beds and about 45 000 beds in intensive care unit how worried are you that this virus is going to overwhelm hospitals not just beds but ventilators we only have 160 000 ventilators and could we be in a situation where you have to ration who gets the bed who gets the ventilator fauci ok so let me put it in a way that it doesn apost get taken out of context when people talk about modeling where outbreaks are going the modeling is only as good as the assumptions you put into the model and what they do they have a worst case scenario a best case scenario and likely where it aposs going to be if we have a worst case scenario we aposve got to admit it we could be overwhelmed are we going to have a worst case scenario i don apost think so i hope not what are we doing to not have that worst case scenario that aposs when you get into the things that we aposre doing we aposre preventing infections from going in with some rather stringent travel restrictions and we aposre doing containment and mitigation from within so at a worst case scenario anywhere in the world no matter what country you are you won apost be prepared so our job is to not let that worst case scenario happen wallace and final question three countries now in europe italy spain and france are basically in total lock down people not allowed out and in italy i think only pharmacies and grocery stores are open you see people on their balconies singing songs and banging pots could that happen here either nationally or in some regions and what about the possibility that we might have to have travel bans inside the country fauci well a couple of questions there so let me take one at a time wallace yes fauci the idea what aposs going on in europe is that they have been they got into that escalation phase so what they aposre doing now is playing catch up we feel that with rather stringent mitigation and containment without necessarily complete lock down we would be able to prevent ourselves from getting to where unfortunately italy is now with regard to domestic travel bans we always talk about it consider everything but i can tell you that has not been seriously considered doing travel bans in the country would it might be some time we always leave an open mind wallace dr fauci thank you thanks for coming in an awful lot of people are relying on what you have to say and of course we aposll be tracking what the president aposs task force does this week thank you sir fauci thank you good to be with you chris wallace up next the threat to the u s economy as parts of everyday life shut down to contain the outbreak treasury secretary steven mnuchin joins us live next commercial break wallace the coronavirus pandemic is not just a threat to the nation aposs health but also our economy joining us now to discuss that is treasury secretary steven mnuchin mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday steven mnuchin treasury secretary thank you great to be you wallace a growing number of financial experts say now that the u s and the world are headed into a recession this year and they talk about an expanding hit both on the demand side and the supply side are they right mnuchin well chris what i would say is i wouldn apost focus on the technical issue of where whether we aposre going to be in a recession or not what i aposd focus on is one what do we need to do right now because it aposs clear we need to get economic relief to the economy and two where are we going to be later this year if the medical professionals are correct and we aposre doing all the things i expect we aposll have a big rebound later in the year so this isn apost like the financial crisis as i aposve said this will have an end to it as we confront the virus wallace i aposm going to press a little bit on this and then we aposll move on but you aposve got disruptions to the global supply chain and even more important you aposve got consumers who have been the main drivers of this economy and their consumer spending is grinding to a halt i understand as a secretary of the treasury you don apost want to predict a recession but it could happen mnuchin chris what i aposd focus on is that we need to get economic relief to the people that are impacted by this and as i aposve kind of described this we aposre in the second inning the first inning was the 8 billion the second inning we passed bipartisan legislation to make sure that workers that need to be home and small and medium size businesses will get paid we are now going back to congress and focusing this week on the airlines industry the hotel industry the cruise ship there aposs no question that the travel industry has been impacted like we aposve never seen before the president is absolutely determined that we will use whatever tools we have and whatever tools we need we will go to congress and get and there aposs a lot of bipartisan support wallace that aposs an important message and we aposre going to get into that in detail but you know people are living in the here and now and i have to ask you people looking at their 401 k s we look at that number in the corner of the screen and the dow jones dropping according to one estimate the market has lost almost 8 trillion in value from its record high which was just a month ago how much further are the markets going to drop mnuchin you know i aposve always been one to say i can apost predict where the market is today this week what i can tell you is people who bought stocks after the crash in apos87 people who bought stocks after the financial crisis did really well so in terms of long term investors i have every confidence that this market is going to be higher down the road and the u s is still the greatest place to invest wallace but you talk about who bought after the crash when is after the crash mnuchin chris we can we can never predict the bottom of the market or the top of the market and that aposs why investors need to focus on the long term but again let me go back and say there aposs no question they are businesses that will be severely impacted we are focused on helping those businesses that need liquidity there are some businesses that are booming i mean you look at the stores and people who are buying certain consumer products what we aposve seen from the credit card data is travel is down extraordinary almost corresponding is an increase in purchases of food pharmacy good and supplies and again what we aposre focused on and the president wants us to look at a big stimulus program because we need to help american workers now wallace let aposs talk you aposd be happy to know now about some of the things that you were doing to try to alleviate the issue early saturday morning the house passed a relief bill and i want to put up on the screen some of the measures that it includes free coronavirus testing two weeks of paid sick leave for workers it extends unemployment insurance and it expands food assistance it also provides aid to small businesses two questions for you first of all any idea because no one seems to have figured this out yet how much is that bill going to cost the federal government well let me ask you that first mnuchin well chris as you know it aposs hard to model some of these things because you don apost know how many workers are going to be home so i want to be careful of throwing out numbers i think based upon the numbers that we aposre going to see it aposs going to have costs that are significant but not huge but wallace can you give us a ballpark mnuchin again i think you know this again just let aposs focus this focuses on employees that are employers that are 500 and less people wallace right mnuchin that aposs a portion of the economy but that aposs the economy that is going to be hit the hardest obviously big companies can afford these things for health care workers so i want to be careful to throw out a number we are modeling it we will have it this week but the important issue is whatever we need we are going to get from congress wallace all right well that aposs what i want to pick up on next the president tweeted friday evening that he will sign this bill that the house passed how confident are you that the senate will pass this bill this week and send it to the president mnuchin well let me just say the president tweeted that because we kept the president and the vice president involved in all of the details of this and the president drafted the tweet a little bit earlier but we asked them not to send it out until we had the final language that we were working on i aposve been speaking to senators all day yesterday we had conversations with mitch mcconnell and team along the way one of the things i will tell you is we are hearing feedback that certain small businesses are concerned about the burden of this we were very focused we need to get the money to people quickly we don apost want them to have to deal with big bureaucracy and one of the things i put out a statement last night that small businesses will be able to go to the irs and use the deposits that they put with the irs and if they need a cash advance they aposll get it from the irs wallace but what i aposm getting at is the senate you think likely to pass this bill or pass a different version and then we aposre back in legislative sausage making on capitol hill mnuchin i aposm speaking to senators i i don apost want to predict ok i think there aposs a lot of bipartisan support we hope they pass this bill if not we aposll work with the center on whatever minor changes we need wallace all right you said mnuchin but chris let me just say wallace yes mnuchin again you know we aposre going back to the senate this week on other things airlines very focused on airlines hotels cruise ships workers for these industries so we aposre going to get this bill done and we aposre going to get more bills done on a bipartisan basis crosstalk wallace let me ask you about that the help for specific industries that are obviously going to be hard hit you keep saying it aposs not a bailout how is it different then what the bush and obama administrations did for the banking and auto industry in 2008 and 09 mnuchin well the good news is the banks are extraordinary conditions in both capital and liquidity there were concerns at the time because of the housing crisis that banks weren apost going to make it through i mean there crosstalk wallace i guess my question is those were those were bailouts why aren apost these bailouts mnuchin again what i would describe is if you aposre providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for three to six months where you aposre taking collateral and you have security that aposs not a bailout to the extent that we need to support different businesses that are impacted again our focus is going to be on stimulus for the workers and getting money to the workers that impacted wallace let aposs talk about one of the controversial parts of a possible plan a relief plan the third effort by your administration and the congress there aposs been a lot of talk you and the president have both pushed the idea of a payroll tax holiday a payroll tax suspension until the end of the year which according to one estimate would cost somewhere between 800 and a trillion 800 billion and a trillion dollars but you aposre getting pushback from democrats and republicans in congress who say it aposs not helping the people who need it most who are going to be thrown out of work or who work in the gig economy and don apost pay payroll taxes given that pushback are you considering instead of the payroll tax suspension another tax measure mnuchin chris the president wants to get economic relief to the right people the payroll tax is one way of doing it and he likes that the president is also willing to consider refundable tax credits which in essence are another way of getting money to people that has certain advantages of we can inject money really quickly but the president is focused that we work on a bipartisan basis to make sure we combat the economic situation that is here and now but that we expect as we do the medical things to combat this virus the economy will bounce back wallace so you aposre not locked in to the payroll tax mnuchin again the president likes that idea but if there aposs other ways working with congress we can get money to people the president will absolutely consider that wallace finally there was a report that you met with the president and some other people on monday and that he erupted and he urged you to go to jay powell the federal reserve chairman and do more to stop the stock market from declining and to stimulate the economy first of all did that happen and secondly have you asked the fed reserve chairman to do more for instance cutting interest rates more mnuchin chris let me just comment first of all i knew the president before i came into work for him i worked for him on the campaign i aposve known him for 15 years no the president didn apost erupt at me ok the president and i i give him my honest opinions and i respect that he tells me what he wants us to do so no there wasn apost erupt ph now as it relates to the fed chair just a matter of policy i don apost comment on my conversations with the fed chair i can tell you i am in daily conversations with jay powell we aposre looking at the tools we have they aposre looking at the tools they have certain tools were taken away from both of us after the financial crisis with dodd frank if we need more tools we aposll go back to congress and get bipartisan support to get that wallace and in 30 seconds very quickly when people are scared to go out to a restaurant or to get on an airplane if you were to cut the interest rate half a point is that going to make any difference mnuchin well let me just say again and i want to be careful because i don apost comment on specific fed actions but the market has already reacted so as an example our treasury borrowing cost on a short term basis is down to 25 basis points so we have a lot of flexibility to inject things in people are focused on interest rates people are also focused on other actions the fed putting the trillion and a half dollars into short term liquidity was obviously an extraordinary move wallace we aposre going to leave it there secretary mnuchin thank you so much obviously people concerned as i say about the economic as well as the public health aspects of this thank you for coming in today and sharing your time with us mnuchin great to always be with you wallace thank you sir mnuchin thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss how the white house and congress are responding to the crisis plus what would you like to ask the panel about how the pandemic will impact the nation aposs health and economy just go to facebook 930 chris wallace fox news anchor house and congress are responding to the crisis plus what would you like to ask the panel about how the pandemic will impact the nation aposs health and economy just go to facebook or twitter at fox news sunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up the democratic candidates for president look to show leadership at a time of crisis begin video clip sen bernie sanders i vt presidential candidate we must prepare for this response in an unprecedented way joe biden d presidential candidate we have to get to work immediately end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel how the coronavirus is changing the race for the white house commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states to unleash the full power of the federal government to this effort today i am officially declaring a national emergency end video clip wallace president trump on friday stepping up his administration aposs response to the spread of the coronavirus in the u s and it aposs time now for our sunday group senator mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff josh holmes charles lane from the washington post fox news correspondent gillian turner and executive director of the serve america pac marie harf gillian 52 days more than seven weeks after the first coronavirus case was diagnosed in this country the president on friday declared a national emergency how do you assess the administration aposs response over those seven weeks and how do you assess it in the last few days gillian turner fox news correspondent well i think the first thing that bears repeating again and again its 50 plus days into this there aposs still a widespread testing shortage across the nation we aposre not saying that that aposs president trump aposs fault absolutely we aposre not putting the blame on any one government agency but it aposs a reality that needs to be repeated at the end of the day every country in the world chris is going to get a coronavirus report card right they aposre going to get a grade on how their government responded to this public health crisis if that report card was happening today we would look at the fact that i think there are now almost 130 countries that have been infected in most cases clustering mount italy china and iran they each have 10 000 plus so they would fail we don apost know how the u s would do if we had to grade them today because again without widespread testing the epidemiologists say they don apost know the real numbers so they can apost model future accurate predictions so it aposs still a big question mark we aposll hopefully know in a couple of weeks wallace marie i think it aposs fair to say there have been some strong points in the government aposs response like the early decision to ban travel to and from china and there have been some weak points as gillian suggested like the really quite remarkable lag in testing in this country you know they say that there are 3 000 cases in the u s we don apost know if that aposs true or not because no almost nobody has been tested only 13 000 test so far how do you assess the administration aposs response so far marie harf fox news contributor dr fauci said several interesting things well many interesting things with you this morning but two that stuck out to me one is that you are always behind where you think you are when it comes to fighting these outbreaks of disease and the second when you pressed him on the regulations that perhaps prevented the tests from being more widely used early on he said yes we could have changed those regulations on day one we aposre now several months into this there has been a lag in parts of the administration and i think for the general public when you talk about the reactions of the administration president trump has the bully pulpit and he for months was saying this isn apost anything to worry about there aposs only a few cases it will go away now you see the private sector and governors taking on responsibility for cancellations for social distancing and you aposre still getting a little bit of a mixed message out of the white house people are looking for leadership from the top about what exactly they should be doing wallace as we have been saying the pandemic is not only a threat to our health but also to our economy we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of of the threat the dual threat we got this on facebook from john shulfer does president trump deserve any blame for the new bear market did he deserve any credit for the bull market should and the answers for both questions be the same josh how do you answer john josh holmes former chief of staff to sen mitch mcconnell well look i think there aposs a really low tolerance for partisanship at this point i think as gillian said in the opener that there will be a time and a place for report cards on all of this and this isn apost it we are at the opening stages here of a pandemic in this country we aposve seen what it aposs done to the economies of china we see what aposs happening currently in europe this is a huge problem without which you can legislate right i mean you can apost just pass a bill and make a pandemic go away what we aposre looking at is a government that is trying to respond proactively to stop not only the health crisis that that could be affecting this country but the economic impact over a period of time you heard secretary mnuchin talk about we aposre in the second inning the first inning was an 8 billion bill that tried to get as many tests out there as possible the second was all of this that you aposve seen being negotiated with speaker pelosi over the last week about proactively making sure that people who are in small businesses employees have paid medical leave all these things kind of things that can help kind of bridge the gap where hopefully we come out and emerge out of the back end of this with an economy that we can kick start repeatedly through more action so i don apost think anybody is to blame for this i what i think is we aposve got all got to pull together to try to figure out how you as a country get from what is potentially a huge problem to you know hopefully this summer an economy that resembles the one we went in with wallace chuck how big a threat do you see now it was interesting the treasury secretary understandably didn apost want to predict a recession he didn apost want to predict there wouldn apost be a recession he didn apost it seemed to me want to come down on either side of that how big a threat is this pandemic right now to the economy of this country and how would you assess not finding blame just trying to understand how would you assess the government aposs response the white house and congress to the economic threat so far charles lane fox news contributor so it aposs been remarkable to watch this threat assessment evolve over the last seven to ten days very specifically we had two business leaders visit the washington post in the week before this from silicon valley and wall street this issue barely came up in those conversations hour long conversations and by wednesday we were receiving phone calls from people who were in high levels in both the bush and obama administrations telling us hey guys this is getting terrible this could be a hit of like 5 percent to gdp you guys need to be writing about this so it evolved the threat assessment evolved very very suddenly and i spent a long time on the phone yesterday with an investment advisors who i think presented a very realistic picture which is we could have a very very short sharp bad as he said ugly quarter as we aposre as we aposre sitting here right now but if all goes well on the public health side that could then be a v shaped recovery so what a lot of economic experts are telling me is actually it aposs the public health response that will determine how well we do economically wallace oh absolutely i mean this is all it is as the treasury secretary said this isn apost a financial crisis this is a public health crisis leading to economic problems final question for you josh which i was trying to press the treasury secretary on from your experience with mitch mcconnell and the senate will the senate passed the bill the house passed on on early saturday morning to provide relief to to people who are thrown out of work people that need expanded food aid or do you think they aposre going to pass something else and this is going to ping pong back and forth holmes oh i think the vast majority of what was in the house passed bill will pass the senate i don apost know if there will be some slight tweaks you know there aposs a technical correction bill that also needs to be passed in the house on monday as well so look i this is a little different legislative environment and the one we aposve been used to over the last 15 years when you have a crisis like think of tarp with the financial crisis or budget control act all of these various things had a hard deadline and your economy was basically we were told in 2008 if you didn apost pass a bill in 72 hours you wouldn apost have an economy on monday we aposre not in that situation we are in the situation that secretary mnuchin just lined out which is we have to take this step by step we have to get the help for the middle class which is the next step the third step what he was talking about with travel industry airlines things of that nature this is going to go on for a while and i imagine they aposre going to address each of these incrementally over a period of time wallace and in ten seconds will they pass a payroll tax suspension or something else he was talking no ph about tax rebates holmes yes i don apost i don apost think that aposs clear what is clear is that there is a broad bipartisan views that when you get to the back end of this health crisis to restart to jump start the economy to make sure that people have more money in their pockets something there needs to be done wallace all right panel we have to take a break here but when we come back the coronavirus turns the race for the white house into a debate over who aposs best prepared to lead the nation in crisis that aposs next commercial break begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate i want to thank bernie sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion we share a common goal and together we we aposll defeat donald trump sen bernie sanders i vt presidential candidate joe what are you going to do for the 500 000 people who will go bankrupt in our country because of medically related debt end video clip wallace joe biden trying to wrap up the democratic race after another string of primary victories on tuesday but bernie sanders making it clear this race is not over yet and we aposre back now with the panel marie a lot of democrats not just joe biden want this race to be over but in fact there aposs going to be a debate on cnn tonight one on one sanders and biden sanders has made it clear he aposs going to push at least ideologically the things he believes in and i think it aposs fair to day that joe biden has not been a strong debater so far in this cycle over a series of debates how do you expect tonight to go harf crisis situations like we aposre in right now i think show voters that they want someone statesman like they want a steady hand and that aposs what joe biden will be focusing on tonight he gave that speech about coronavirus this week and i think tonight you will see him say look bernie has some good ideas but right now we need someone who can come in on day one and handle what we are seeing in this country joe biden also adopting elizabeth warren aposs plan on bankruptcy just this week so he is taking on some of the ideological left he aposs adapting some of it but he aposs going to come out tonight and say in every poll i beat donald trump bernie doesn apost and right now when we see a president lying about a website saying he takes no responsibility i aposm the one who can beat him that electability argument will be an even sharper relief tonight wallace chuck marie makes the point about a steady hand but i think we have to admit and acknowledge the fact that joe biden is not always a steady hand in these debates lane you know he is a gaffe machine and always has been throughout his career that is a known liability and i assume one reason bernie sanders insisted on having this debate and staying in the campaign was just to try his luck and see if joe biden could somehow blunder and help bernie revive his campaign but i think what the big picture here is that the whole campaign has been completely transformed i mean the whole subject of this campaign is now this virus and its economic fallout which is like nothing everybody was expecting the campaign to be about two weeks ago and so wallace i mean we aposre even seeing states postpone their primaries louisiana did it georgia did it lane correct correct wallace i mean literally putting the primary contest on hold or at least postponing it lane and so i guess the way bernie wants to play that is say see now is the time for medicare for all what this reveals is we need that transformation in health and biden will say no no no it aposs a crisis we need a steady hand but what i aposm thinking also is it aposs going to focus attention on the fact that both of them are very old and both of them are literally in the risk group for this virus and i think that it may cause in that sense some downside risk to both of them and and furthermore i think wallace but there aposs nobody else in the race lane exactly and this whole process has has now sort of left us in a point where it aposs completely scrambled and a month from now it could all look completely different wallace josh we talked about the economic impact of the coronavirus in the last segment there aposs also though obviously a political component because donald trump was planning to run and quite rightly on a pretty strong economy strong growth low unemployment record stock market now all of that is gone if we were to end up in a recession how much would that compromise challenge donald trump aposs prospects for re election holmes well that aposs certainly a big hypothetical right i mean it wallace well it aposs not such a crazy hypothetical holmes no it aposs not i mean clearly this is going to have a huge economic impact there are two ways of looking at it the first both relate by the way to how we ultimately emerge if we ultimately emerge with an economy that looks anywhere nearly like the one we went in with i think you mitigate a lot of those problems the second thing way to look at it is did we have a healthy healthy enough economy to absorb something like this and i think for the first time in a long time you can say the american economy was positioned in a place where we have resources and the capabilities of actually undergirding the systemic problem that we aposre going to have as a result of this virus so look i think that the argument changes significantly because you aposre not walking in waltzing into an election with these huge employment numbers and huge gdp growth we aposre not going to have that what we may well have is a reminder to the american people that our the strength of our economy can rebound under this administration even under the most unprecedented crisis wallace gillian it aposs interesting axios reported i think yesterday about a focus group in minnesota of swing voters who said that even if there is a recession that because of the coronavirus they wouldn apost blame that on president trump the only it seems to me hiccup there is we don apost know where we aposre going to be six months from now which is when we aposre going to have this election now you know it if we aposve rebounded obviously that would redound to the benefit of president trump but if things are bad you wonder how people are going to feel turner i suspect that a lot of american voters not just this focus group but folks all across the country view this virus as like an act of god and politics is not really very closely related to it maybe six months from now they aposll start thinking about how donald trump aposs administration responded to it a quick note on what you and chuck just talked about a minute ago when it comes to age there aposs a million dollar question in this election cycle that i don apost think anybody wants to ask and that is what if all top three presidential contenders contract this virus over the coming months it aposs not a crazy question we aposre in this unique cycle where all three trump biden and sanders are 70 plus one source pointed out to me the other day we know at least one of them has an underlying health condition sanders has had heart issue so far it aposs not unreasonable given the amount of people they interact with every day that they might all contract this virus and at some point maybe overlap at the same time what does that look like this becomes a national security concern very quickly wallace marie are the effects of this virus both in terms of public health in terms of the economy are they fair game politically for democrats harf they are fair game because who we have leading our country during a crisis is the most important question you can ask voters and you don apost have to politicize it you don apost have to take cheap shots but i think a lot of americans are looking at how president trump has handled this downplaying it not telling the truth not giving clear guidance on whether you should go out when and where you can get a test and they look at that and all this notion that his voters had of blowing the system up of discarding the expertise and the government that aposs coming home to roost right now and i think that aposs how voters are going to look at this as a leadership test in a crisis that is fair game across the board wallace josh you have 45 seconds for a rebuttal holmes as i said at the outset i think there is an extremely low tolerance for partisanship at this point wallace but there aposs been partisanship on both sides holmes there sure has and i think the american people are going to take a look at that and think boy oh boy are these folks out of touch i think any any you look at the behavior of speaker pelosi of mitch mcconnell and wallace but don apost you think don apost you think it aposs going to be a legitimate question was this handled well or wasn apost it holmes absolutely harf inaudible in a crisis holmes in the back end of this when the country recovers absolutely but when president bush is standing on the the burning towers and declaring that we will we will make these people pay that aposs not the point to question our intelligence right you aposve got at this point we have to get through this wallace all right and we have to get through this segment thank you panel see you next sunday up next our special power player of the week she aposs tops in her craft creating stylish hats and still going strong at the century
