considering backing out of nuclear negotiations or restarting nuclear and missile tests trump in his first meeting with moon since the unsuccessful u s summit with kim in hanoi said the u s wants to

wednesday kim stressed self reliance in his country to deal a telling blow to the hostile forces that go with bloodshot eyes miscalculating that sanctions can bring north korea to its knees moon said
