apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic singapore ap china s placement of weapons systems on manmade islands in the south china sea is designed to intimidate and coerce others in the region defense secretary jim mattis said saturday laying out a sharp criticism of beijing at an international security forum and threatening larger consequences if militarization continues he warned that america s recent move to disinvite china from a multinational naval exercise this summer was an initial response to the militarization of the islands it was he said a relatively small consequence i believe there are much larger consequences in the future china relying on muscle to use weapons to pursue goals not favored by international tribunals is not a way to make long term collaboration the rule of the road in a region that s important to china s future mattis said when asked to elaborate more on the consequences there are consequences that will continue to come home to roost so to speak with china if they don t find a way to work more collaboratively with all of the nations who have interests top stories ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century the u s he said remains committed to ensuring free and open transit in the region and he said he doesn t believe that china s actions will pay off militarizing the islands mattis said will not enhance china s standing in the world despite china s claims to the contrary the placement of these weapons systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion mattis said referring to the recent deployment of anti ship missiles surface to air missiles electronic jammers and other equipment on the spratly islands and the landing of bomber aircraft at woody island mattis also struck at one of the key longstanding disputes between the u s and china telling the conference that america will continue to provide defense equipment and services to taiwan and oppose any effort to alter the status quo china claims the self governing island as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary but in a quick pivot he said the u s welcomes cooperation with china wherever possible and announced that he has accepted beijing s invitation to visit there soon it remains to be seen if that invitation will stand after this conference mattis comments triggered an equally pointed reaction from a chinese official at the meeting senior col zhao xiaozhuo said a u s move a couple years ago to send two warships into china s territorial waters was a violation of law and an obvious provocation to china s national security and territorial integrity mattis responded that the question reflected a fundamental disconnect with the way international tribunals have spoken on the matter we do not see it as a militarization by going through what has traditionally been an international water space said mattis of the u s ship movements through the south china sea what we see it as is a reaffirmation of the rules based order as expected the pentagon chief gave only a brief mention of the ongoing negotiations for an historic summit later this month between president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un trump announced friday that the nuclear weapons summit he had canceled with north korea s kim jong un is back on the summit is expected to be here in singapore mattis said the pentagon will hold the line and support the diplomatic effort to secure the complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the korean peninsula the pentagon leader s comments at the annual shangri la dialogue came in the wake of a tumultuous few weeks between the u s and china last week the u s withdrew an invitation for beijing to participate the exercise known as rim of the pacific china had participated in the exercise known as rim of the pacific in 2014 and 2016 the pentagon said the decision to disinvite the chinese navy was triggered by what it called strong evidence that china has deployed weapons systems on the islands and called on china to remove them china says it is within its rights to build up defenses on islands in the south china sea that it believes are its sovereign territory china s activities mattis said in his speech saturday stand in stark contrast to the openness of what our strategy promotes it calls into question china s broader goals house armed services committee chairman mac thornberry r texas who was attending the conference said china is alienating other nations and nations must band together and say the actions are unacceptable the u s response to china s weaponization of the islands continued on sunday as two u s warships sailed close to the paracel islands which lie north of the spratlys it was the latest freedom of navigation operation designed to challenge beijing s claims china protested the maneuver in recent years the u s had sought to stabilize military relations with china but the militarization of the islands has been a persistent point of conflict many nations fear that beijing will use the construction on the islands to extend its military reach and potentially try to restrict navigation in the south china sea china s delegation at the conference is being led by lt gen he lei vice president of the people s liberation army s academy of military science china has not sent high level officials to the three day meeting in an apparent attempt to deflect attention from its campaign to expand its sovereignty across virtually the entire south china sea mattis made clear that the u s does not expect nations to choose between the u s and china adding that beijing should have a voice in shaping the region while allies have a voice in shaping china s role the u s he said will continue to pursue a constructive results oriented relationship with china co
