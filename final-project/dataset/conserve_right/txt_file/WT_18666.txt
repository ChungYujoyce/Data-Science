indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion it is summer and time to read books i recall the late editor of the editorial page of the washington post the sainted meg greenfield making fun of the idea of summer books but i have long filed her quip away as a quip that was quipless she could read books almost anytime she wanted but busy people read when they have a special opportunity and during summer break i would like to remind them of good books to read this summer there is an abundance of them two books that have been compared justifiably with dean acheson s memoir from many years ago present at the creation are by donald h rumsfeld and henry kissinger two men of vast governmental experience who need no introduction mr rumsfeld s known and unknown a memoir covers his life in government service and should be interesting to all americans because of what he says about the iraq war but also because of what he says about the decisions in which he played a role starting with service in congress in the era of lyndon b johnson mr kissinger s on china is fascinating for its historic sweep through an ancient civilization from its beginnings to the present with some memoir thrown in for mr kissinger played a critical role in opening china to the world and his firsthand accounts of zhou enlai and mao zedong struck me as particularly enlightening mr rumsfeld s book like that of mr kissinger and for that matter like that of acheson covers an enormous amount of ground from service to richard m nixon to his role as secretary of defense under george w bush there is much material for comment but allowing for limited space i should mention only the lie that is that bush lied and others died there is much evidence here to refute that claim not the least of which is that if the bush administration lied so did many of the world s intelligence agencies for that matter so did saddam hussein even to his generals mr rumsfeld reminds us of all this he quotes people including hillary rodham clinton and john kerry urging us to war and he mentions much else most tellingly the small kurdish town of khurmal top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore in khurmal our intelligence indicated that before the war terrorists were engaged in putting the finishing touches on weapons of mass destruction unfortunately secretary of defense colin l powell mentioned the town in his speech to the united nations before our invasion and by the time our troops arrived the terrorists had fled but not without leaving evidence of their grisly business i have no doubt that in the years to come overwhelming evidence will come that mr bush did not dupe us mr kissinger begins his book with a majestic rendering of ancient china that suggests that for thousands of years china was different from the west his contention it seems to me is that the emerging china is still different with different goals than say the british empire he may be right i hope he is in the meantime i am glad for the services of the american navy and air force in particular in later chapters mr kissinger is particularly interesting in recounting his relations with chinese leaders the secret knowledge on the dismantling of american culture by dramatist david mamet has fetched my attention and i am willing to recommend it as a splendid read though probably not the most satisfactory reason for giving up on liberalism and joining the right ever since whittaker chambers the journey to the right by leftists has been entertaining and at times moving and mr mamet s journey is no different he has read the right books and formed the right conclusions he writes with wit and a sense of irony yet as he derives wisdom from both friedrich hayek and glenn beck i think i will await his further lucubrations on the matter to consider him a sage suffice to say he is a great dramatist and i would like to get to know him better finally andrew roberts has a brilliant history of world war ii the storm of war a new history of the second world war i recommend it i have in my library dozens of world war ii histories from the very earliest by b h liddell hart now all have been rendered curiosities or unfinished works by mr roberts stupendous history of the war in the theaters of asia africa and europe he writes beautifully and brings alive on the page the statesmen generals and admirals and ordinary soldiers and sailors he left me thinking what if in the place of franklin d roosevelt and winston churchill we had had barack obama and david cameron in 1939 mr obama really would have had to be the messiah r emmett tyrrell jr is founder and editor in chief of the american spectator and an adjunct
