speaks during a campaign stop at the first niagara center monday april 18 2016 in buffalo n y ap photo john minchillo ap whoever dubbed tuesday april 26 the acela primary because the five states that held primaries on that day coincide with the route of amtrak s fastest carrier needs a refresher in how trains and republican presidential hopefuls run the washington to boston acela service is known for the three things speed quiet cars and higher fares you won t find those first two traits swiftness and silence in this boisterous time consuming gop affair expensive yes but not a joy ride here are four takeaways now that the republican local has completed its northeastern course trump towered i ve kept struggling with a way to best characterize donald trump s roll new york last week connecticut delaware maryland pennsylvania and rhode island all this week one thought trump 2016 looks a lot like the american map circa the mid 1700 s he s conquered 12 of the 13 original colonies new jersey votes on june 7 plus most of the southeast except for a few states here and there trump controls the american continent east of the mississippi river but now the race moves west first up indiana on may 3 more on that in a moment a week later west virginia and nebraska after that the gop field spends quality time on the west coast two weeks in oregon and washington before a final push in california montana new mexico south dakota and the aforementioned new jersey the question trump has momentum as he steps off the acela then again so too did texas sen ted cruz after he rolled trump in wisconsin s april 5 primary from this point forward to california will it be nomemtum or big mo for the donald isn t it bromantic you ve heard of rudolph valentino but maybe not jean acker she was valentino s first wife best known for supposedly locking him out of the bedroom on their wedding night never consummating the marriage yet suing for the legal right to mrs rudolph valentino the political marriage between cruz and ohio gov john kasich quicker even than valentino and acker s two month courtship may not turn out to be as cinematic but there is the matter of consummation cruz thinks kasich intends to cede indiana to the more conservative texan kasich has told reporters he s not instructing his followers to switch to cruz it s anyone s guess as to whether cruz and kasich much care for each other what i don t understand why they felt the need to go public with their hasty nuptials other than the obvious reason they both realize the urgency of the moment far behind in delegates needing to defeat trump soon before he salts away the gop nomination it s funny how fast things can change in politics we entered april with trump looking wobbly we ll exit the month with cruz and kasich resorting to a bromance that reeks of desperation hoosier daddy a word about campaigning in indiana home to a pivotal presidential contest and a contentious gop senate primary both of which are playing out along establishment outsider lines if i were working the basketball crazy state i d want one of three individuals by my side basketball legend larry bird former indiana university coach bobby knight or the kid who drained the jumper at the end of hoosiers ok jimmy chitwood doesn t exist in real life and larry legend isn t all that political though he once snubbed ronald reagan that leaves us with coach knight who s appearing with trump at a wednesday evening rally in indianapolis it s not the first sports endorsement to come trump s way buffalo bills coach rex ryan warmed up the crowd for him at a rally the day before new york s primary and it begs the question of pro trump star power other than the apprentice and gary busey wayne newton and jon voight with polls showing trump holding a narrow lead among hoosiers cruz could use some star power of his own better yet maybe a gene hackman pep talk california the chicago cubs have waited 71 years for a world series appearance 108 years for a title california s absence from the national political picture seems just as pronounced post acela primary trump s delegate count has risen well into the 900 s that puts him three fourths of the way to 1 237 which is now officially out of reach for cruz until after a first ballot in cleveland when pledged delegates can begin switching their votes here s why california matters more with each passing week trump can t win without taking a gluttonous portion of the golden state s 172 gop delegates to get to 1 237 on june 7 i m guessing he ll have to score 140 delegates as such it s the nevertrump movement s last chance to derail him in california amtrak parlance that primary would be a ticket on the coast starlight a three day ride along the west coast that isn t fast and isn t cheap and unlike tuesday s acela experience maybe the only real hope of throwing trump from the train get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout
