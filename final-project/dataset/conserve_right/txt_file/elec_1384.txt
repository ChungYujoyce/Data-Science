national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge now that all of the controversial elections recounts and re recounts are over let us review some of our lessons learned florida is the jaguar of vote counting and i m not referring to the animal or the jacksonville nfl franchise i mean the car for decades part of the charm of having a jaguar was how often it broke down that s no longer the case it was the kind of conspicuous consumption that economist thorstein veblen used to write about with owners bragging about how much they paid for repairs the spectacle of sweaty election officials poring over provisional ballots 18 years after the state became infamous for such things has now cemented election incompetence into the montage of images we associate with the sunshine state beaches rocket launches mickey mouse and the human menagerie of freaks weirdos moperers villains and perverts who fall under the omnibus internet meme florida man we learned relearned actually that a lot of people are very very tense about politics and quick to jump the gun president trump no doubt a bit insecure that his red wave failed to materialize immediately claimed that voter fraud was rampant and that elections in arizona and florida were being stolen florida governor rick scott followed trump s lead and made similar allegations as did a host of republican pundits meanwhile in georgia democrats led by stacey abrams and ohio senator sherrod brown as well as a chorus of liberal pundits insisted that the governor s race there had been stolen by georgia s republican secretary of state and gubernatorial candidate brian kemp we also learned that the actual evidence for all of these allegations fell far short of the rhetoric jwplayer jwplayer

florida but none that came close to robbing scott of his 12 000 vote lead brenda snipes broward county s supervisor of elections had a 15 year record of incompetence that at times seemed very difficult to distinguish from partisan skulduggery she finally resigned from her post this week but in arizona there is no evidence of wrongdoing and the state gop s refusal to go with trump s talking points was an admirable example of republican leaders particularly governor doug ducey bucking the partisan tide georgia is a more controversial case but as national review s rich lowry documents the evidence of theft through voter suppression isn t there either no matter how many twitter memes say otherwise kemp s decision not to resign from his job overseeing elections may have been bad pr but that s the way the law works in georgia kemp had run for reelection twice before without stepping aside without any improprieties as had democrats in that position in the past allegations that he closed polling sites in black neighborhoods leave out that those decisions were made locally likewise claims that he purged black voters from the rolls hinge on a tendentious reading of a law passed by a democratic legislature and signed by a democratic governor requiring that the rolls be updated kemp enforced the law he didn t undermine it the final lesson there is a massive double standard in the national conversation when it comes to election results and irregularities when republicans suggest democrats are up to no good it is universally decried as a paranoid craven or openly authoritarian attempt to delegitimize an election when democrats suggest an election was stolen it s a grave warning of a crisis that should require international election monitors in the words of dan rather when republicans graciously concede as representative martha mcsally did in arizona it s an example of decency and civility i give mcsally credit for a graceful concession but let s be clear it only stands out because of the moral sludge of trumpism in which any show of grace or honorable conduct is shocking tweeted josh marshall the editor of talking points memo when you lose you don t lie about it or attack the voting process you concede move on but when florida senator bill nelson a three term democrat refused to concede and move on insisting that scott was trying to steal victory liberals didn t call him a sore loser and when abrams refused to concede in georgia and still refuses to say that kemp is a legitimate governor it s hailed as heroic speaking truth to power such double standards are poisonous and contagious which is why you can be sure you ll hear even more of this in 2020 and not just from donald trump 2018 tribune content agency llc get our conservative
