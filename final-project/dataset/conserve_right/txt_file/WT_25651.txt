tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn minneapolis star tribune july 24 heed mueller on one clear point interference threatens democracy he satisfied neither trump s critics nor defenders but nation could unite to protect democracy top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time former special counsel robert mueller in hour after hour of congressional testimony gave this country a vivid demonstration of the kind of by the book nonpartisan unshowy demeanor that at once bolstered his credibility while diminishing that of some of his more self aggrandizing questioners the nation should be grateful that such public servants still exist mueller restated forcefully that his report did not as president donald trump has claimed repeatedly exonerate the president but he resisted attempts by some democrats to get him to say that the only reason he did not charge trump was because of a legal opinion that states a sitting president cannot be indicted he confirmed nonetheless that russia interfered in the election that it benefited trump and that trump s organization welcomed it and lied to cover it up that is damaging for trump and no amount of tweeting that the hearing was a disaster for democrats will alter it but those who hoped the former special prosecutor would swoop in like some avenging angel and persuade americans of the need for impeachment were left unsatisfied mueller refused to go outside the parameters of his report and in doing so avoided becoming a pawn of either side yes mueller made clear that a president could be indicted once he leaves office but that is theoretical and it must be said unlikely while no one is above the law there is no precedent for criminally indicting let alone convicting and jailing a former president the constitution is clear on the remedy for a president who abuses his office it is a political process not a criminal one democrats have hard decisions to make on whether to pursue impeachment and as mueller s testimony showed there will be no easy path particularly as the election draws nearer and that brings us to what may have been the most important element of mueller s testimony without reservation mueller sounded an unequivocal warning about russian interference that should spur immediate action over the course of my career i ve seen a number of challenges to our democracy he said the russian government s attempts to interfere in our election is among the most serious this deserves the attention of every american coming from someone with the stature of mueller who headed the fbi under republican and democratic presidents and who has spent a lifetime in law enforcement such a warning should not be taken lightly mueller also let it be known that the fbi continues to investigate counterintelligence regarding russian interference that makes it imperative that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell end his obstruction of the bipartisan election security bill and allow a vote to move forward minnesota fought a yearlong battle to free up election security funding minnesota sen amy klobuchar has tried to bring the election security act to the floor to no avail the act would among other things provide backup paper ballots that are crucial to accurate tamper proof recounts congress will continue to be divided over what to do about a less than scrupulous president but it can come together on what should be common ground for any patriot securing this nation s election infrastructure against foreign interference failure to do so is a betrayal of the voters elected leaders serve st cloud times july 19 americans please know this nation is battling for its soul many political junkies are viewing president trump s tweets about four new members of congress as defining the main issue for the 2020 presidential election that s an understatement we say those actions define the only issue trump s discriminatory sentiments bolstered by his past actions and utterances put front and center one simple reality americans are in a battle for the soul of this nation are we as our founders proclaimed 243 years ago a nation where all are created equal are we as americans following our nation s pledge of liberty and justice for all are we bound by the rule of law are we a place where anyone can work hard and rise from humble beginnings yes even beginnings that start on foreign soil because that s what our founders envisioned and we re not guessing they said so they wrote it down so the question before americans not just for the 2020 election but for the future of the country is this what country do you want to live in do you want this to be a nation striving for all the freedoms our founders not only envisioned but willingly put their lives behind with their signatures or do you want a country led by a president bent on keeping power by stoking fear using intimidation and making verbal attacks on select americans we believe supporting or opposing any politician based on a single issue should be done very rarely however president trump s repeated championing of nativism along with his reckless history of targeting of people of color women and sometimes people with disabilities make this a time when that single issue measure needs to be applied enough of excusing and ignoring his bigotry and hate because your economic times are good or you can t stomach the other party if you support him with your vote own this you support a president who embraces the exact opposite values of those written into the very documents presidents are sworn to uphold u s house republicans who did not speak out against trump s original tweets this past week including u s rep tom emmer r minnesota deserve similar scrutiny especially when many of these same leaders two days later rebuked supporters for chanting send her back at trump s wednesday campaign rally the president literally put those words in the crowd s mouths how can any honest american rebuke those who repeated the words but not the powerful leader who put them up to it america has a president with a history and current practice of fomenting hate and bigotry based on negative stereotypes of those who are not like him be they foreign born female or otherwise other he swore an oath to lead a nation not a party he made a promise to be the president of all the people stating in his own inaugural address that the oath of office i take today is an oath of allegiance to all americans he has broken that promise and he cannot lead the people when he disdains and derides a significant portion of them a republican challenger although an ideal alternative for middle of the road centrist republican voters who just can t fathom voting outside the gop isn t going to happen democrats who might otherwise cast a primary vote for a one issue outlier to move the party platform have to be asking themselves if this time it s worth it this is no time for politics as usual what should america be it s time for soul searching it s time to choose the free press of mankato july 25 franken senator s resignation still for the best the publication this week of a new yorker piece sympathetic to former sen al franken quotes the minnesota democrat as saying he absolutely regrets resigning in the midst of numerous allegations of harassment it suggests franken is angling for a return to politics we re not swayed we believe as we did in late 2017 that minnesota the senate the dfl and the issues franken cares about were all better served by his departure as a practical matter we don t see what door franken 68 expects to open to revive his political career minnesota has two dfl senators it has a dfl governor the congressional district in which franken resides has a dfl representative a senate berth could perhaps open if sen amy klobuchar finds her way onto the national ticket but her presidential campaign hasn t found any noticeable traction and any attempt by a democratic president to appoint franken to a job requiring senate confirmation will doubtless result in a contentious hearing the new yorker article itself doesn t really stand up to a close reading nate silver of fivethirtyeight put it well this article is a master class in biased reporting and editing there are so many subtle ways that it seeks to manipulate the reader into taking franken s side while it attempts to undermine the leeann tweeden allegations the ones that include the infamous pretend to grope her as she naps photo it barely mentions the others could franken have remained in the senate for the remaining two plus years of his six year term probably it s been a long time since the senate formally expelled a member but had he stuck it out the controversy would have consumed him he would have been in a weaker position electorally assuming he sought a third term in 2020 than his successor sen tina smith is today the democrats who called upon their colleague to resign in 2017 drew a clear distinction between themselves and the republicans who continue to embrace a president tainted by more serious improprieties than anything franken was accused of while there are few if any elected officials innocent of hypocrisy franken s ouster spok
