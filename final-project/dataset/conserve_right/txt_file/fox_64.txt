is being held steve steve harrigan fox news correspondent chris we are getting some new information about this mail bomber some new details about his personality family members are describing him as

must never ever be allowed in america and i will do everything in my power to stop it kevin corke fox news white house correspondent it was a call for peace but for president trump taming america aposs political tempers might prove to be the heaviest lift yet of his presidency in the 21 month since mr trump took office the nation aposs political climate has become increasingly disruptive disrespectful even deadly the latest temper of the time a mass shooting at a synagogue and the arrest of a suspect who authorities believe sent more than a dozen pipe bombs to democrats across the country a reflection of a political culture now awash in vitriol and venom are letters sent to leaders containing the raw materials for ricin have barely shocked senses and political players mete out harsh judgments with impunity rep maxine waters d calif you tell them they are not welcome anymore anywhere hillary clinton former presidential candidate you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about eric holder former obama attorney general michelle always says that you know when they go low we go high no no when they go low we kick them trump any guy that can do a body slam he aposs my kind of he aposs my guy barack obama former president when words stop meaning anything when truth doesn apost matter when people can just make up facts then democracy it doesn apost work corke just who was at fault for the current political environment is a debate that will be had for some time what is clear is our need to examine how we got to this point and where we go from here nikki haley u s ambassador to the u n we have some serious political differences at home but our opponents are not evil they aposre just our opponents in the end we must recognize that we are all americans corke chris end videotape wallace kevin thank you joining me now the secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen secretary welcome back to fox news sunday kirstjen nielsen homeland security secretary thank you it aposs my pleasure to be here wallace let aposs start with that terrible synagogue shooting as you view it now was this an act of terror was it a hate crime and how do we better protect soft targets like a house of worship nielsen well chris first let me be clear this was a pure act of evil you aposve heard that from the president and vice president yesterday that aposs what it is we all condemn this in the strongest terms possible and as you know we do an extraordinary amount of planning and training for active shooter events as well just protection of soft targets and crowded spaces in general wallace i understand that in fact dhs officials had been in this synagogue recently nielsen yes as recently as march we actually conducted a site visit there with our protective security advisor in the area this is something we often do wallace and what aposs the advice how to handle an active shooter somebody comes in to a service in a synagogue what can you do nielsen well each individual location each individual event is slightly different and that aposs why the planning and the training is so important in such events there is rarely time to think through roles and responsibilities the response has got to be automatic and that aposs where the drills and the workshops that we conduct come in we aposve trained over 900 000 officials throughout the country we will continue to do that in some cases the advice is to shelter in place to some is to orderly evacuate it depends on the circumstances but you should always listen to the individuals they are in charge who will direct you wallace let aposs turn to the mail bomb case is there any evidence at this point that cesar sayoc had any help in constructing and sending these bombs is there a chance that there is an accomplice who is still at large nielsen well as you know chris investigation is still underway what i can assure you is if there are additional perpetrators they will also be brought to justice the president has directed all federal resources to be on top of this we are we continue to work closely through the secret service and our federal protective services with the fbi and state and local officials and we will bring any and all perpetrators to justice wallace but at this point is there any sign that there is an accomplice nielsen well as you know the fbi and their press conference did announce that one individual has been taken into custody the rest of the investigation is ongoing and i know that we will learn more in the hours and days to come wallace i want to hold up you can apost see it but i aposm going to hold up the front page from the washington post from yesterday about the capture of cesar sayoc and it doesn apost say suspect arrested what it says is bomb suspect outspoken supporter of trump what responsibility do you think president trump bears for the actions of this individual nielsen i think the president has made it extraordinarily clear that we will never allow a political political violence to take root in this country i firmly believe in the first amendment but anybody who uses the first amendment as a cover to threaten or commit an act of violence will not be tolerated there is no place for hate in this country hate is hate violence is violence we will do all we can at the department of homeland security to ensure that such attacks are not perpetrated wallace we aposve been talking in this program about the coarsening of our political discourse during the height of the family separation controversy you were at a restaurant where you are heckled as you ate in the restaurant and later protesters went to your home and blasted audio of crying migrant children outside your home a couple of questions secretary what those protesters did do you think that was over the line and what do you think do you think the president aposs rhetoric and politics have contributed to the growing incivility and rancor in our politics nielsen i think that folks you know first of all to the extent that folks exercise their first amendment rights that is protected in our country but there is a line when those choose to use the first amendment to incite violence to incite disruption rather than being constructive that to have conversations that instead tear americans apart i do not support that i you know there is a time very recently chris where i daily had to review myself all of the death threats against the great men and women of the department of homeland security who every day wake up to try to enforce the law and protect other americans there is an appropriate way to express your solutions to express your ideas i welcome them at all times but these calls to violence these calls to disruptions are not effective not productive and frankly they just contribute to additional deconstruction of our ability to work together wallace all right let aposs turn to perhaps your day job you aposve got a lot of day jobs immigration there is a report that the president is considering making a major speech this week in which he will announce that he is sealing the border even to people seeking asylum on what legal basis could he do that nielsen i think what the president has been saying and will continue to say and certainly what i have been saying is this caravan is not getting in there is a legal way to enter this country those who choose to enter illegally will be stopped we are working with our partners in mexico they have taken unprecedented efforts within their territory to ensure an orderly flow and that those who have no legal right to be there are removed we intend to do the same but my general message to this caravan is do not come you will not be allowed in there is a right way to emigrate to the united states and this is not it wallace i want to ask perhaps drill down on this a little bit with you secretary because according to reports the president may use the same legal authority he did for the first travel ban which is section 212 f of the immigration and nationality act i fully understand that people coming from honduras don apost have a right to come into the u s illegally but on what basis can you say that this caravan poses a national security threat nielsen we have a crisis of the border right now we are stopping between 1 500 and 1 700 people a day trying to cross illegally into this country this caravan is one iteration of that but frankly we essentially see caravans every day with these numbers so i think what the president is making clear is every possible action authority executive program is on the table to consider to ensure that it is clear that there is a right and a legal way to come to this country and no other ways will be tolerated wallace i fully understand that and a lot of people would say that we should reform the laws so the question i have is he aposs talking specifically about a provision where the president gets to protect national security we aposre talking in many cases here about women about children about babies how do they threaten national security nielsen well i think there aposs a couple ways to look at this what i can tell you is last year alone we aposve stopped 3 000 so first let me back up and let aposs talk about the caravan this isn apost a ticketed event you don apost have a membership in the caravan there are consistently moment to moment there are those who are raising their hands and saying they aposre part of the so called caravan and then there are others who yesterday said they are part of the caravan today say they are no longer a part of the caravan what we aposre really talking about is the flow of people that are headed towards united states they have chosen to break laws along the way you saw some of them frankly overwhelm and burst through ph the border between guatemala and the country of mexico mexico has offered them asylum in some cases they have refused mexico has offered them work permits in some cases they have refused and i think what the president and i are both saying and we want to be clear on this is if you seek asylum do so in the first place country mexico has offered you refuge if you want a job that is not asylum if you want to be reunited with your family that is not asylum if you want to just come live in the united states that is not asylum there are legal ways to do that but this is about the rule of law this is about understanding who is in the flow and chris i cannot tell you as secretary of homeland security that i know every person in this flow what i do know is that we stopped 3 000 people a year who have traveled of a pattern similar to terrorists from attempting to come in the southwest border and as you know in general we stopped across united states 10 known or suspected terrorists a day from getting into the united states wallace i aposve got about a minute left i want to ask you about another one of your day jobs and that aposs the midterm elections coming up nine days from today can you guarantee to the american people that their voting systems will be secure are now and will be up through november 6th that if you go to vote that you will be able to do so and that your vote will be counted accurately and that there won apost be a foreign actor interfering with that nielsen the goal here chris just as you say is absolutely to assure americans that their votes will count and their votes will be counted correctly we are constantly monitoring constantly working with them sharing information we aposll be setting up a virtual situation room on election day so that we can vertically support any incident response that aposs needed and so that we can share any information we are more prepared than we aposve ever been and we will continue to prepare not just for this election but through every election to come in the future wallace secretary nielsen thank you thanks for joining us today nielsen my pleasure thank you wallace up next who and what is responsible for the deepening political divide in our country we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss whether it aposs president trump aposs job to play unifier in chief commercial break begin video clips trump we have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the republican party trump i would like to think that everybody in america would think it aposs wrong to spend all your time from a position of power vilifying people questioning their patriotism calling them enemies of the people and then suddenly pretending that you are concerned about stability end video clip wallace president trump and barack obama with very different views about who aposs to blame for the ugly political divide we see these days and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service liz marlantes politics editor of the christian science monitor and jason riley from the wall street journal well congressman chaffetz clearly president trump is not responsible for the mail bombs being sent to prominent democrats the person who created the devices and put them in the mail allegedly sayoc is responsible but does the president bear any responsibility for the growing ugly political rancor in this country jason chaffetz former congressman r utah i aposm sure the democrats would argue that but presidents probably get too much credit and too much blame for what aposs happening in that rancor i think the american people we need a vigorous debate that is what we do in this country political dissent is the american way but there aposs a point where it crosses the line and becomes too personal when you aposre up in the face of somebody who aposs getting dinner somebody like a sarah sanders and whatnot certainly a shooting and violence that has no place in the american discourse i thought president trump was pitch perfect and i think the call from schumer and pelosi should have matched with the president did but unfortunately it did not wallace mo i want to hold up again this front page from yesterday of the washington post because i aposve got to say i was really shocked by it i fully expected it to say suspect arrested instead it says bomb suspect outspoken supporter of trump that aposs the headline on the washington post and i went back and looked at the post from last year after bernie sanders supporter attacked a republican baseball practice and severely wounded steve scalise no headline there about outspoken supporter of sanders so i guess the question is is it fair to draw the kind of linkage front page suspect outspoken supporter of donald trump mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics public service yes i probably would have written a different headline if i work at the washington post but having said that look i do not think it is a stretch to argue that the president aposs comments are helping to stir the pot even further i agree with the congressman presidents get too much credit and i agree that there are people who overstepped the line i was outspoken when people interrupted sarah sanders apos dinner or secretary nielsen aposs dinner i thought that was inappropriate but when the president of the united states is actually questioning people aposs patriotism and calling them enemies of the people and you know is saying pitch perfect words in the wake of a tragedy but then goes into a rally and continues to divide and blame people i think that is worth examination i think it is worth exploration i think we can all do a better job in our own lives at being more civil and being vigorous dissenters and arguing with one another politically but checking how we do it i would hope that the president would take some of this to heart as well wallace jason when congressman chaffetz talks about the president was pitch perfect my initial reaction was which president because it did seem this week weak as if there were two presidents first of all there was teleprompter trump let aposs take a look begin video clip trump we must never allow political violence to take root in america cannot let it happen and i aposm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it and stop it now end video clip wallace but then there was twitter trump here he is at 3 14 a m friday morning funny how lowly rated cnn and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the current spate of bombs yet when i criticize them they go wild and scream it aposs just not presidential do you think it aposs fair to say that there were two very different presidential tones here jason riley manhattan institute fellow oh absolutely chris after two years of president trump i think this is something have come to expect i do want to say referring to the headline the newspaper you put up if you want to know why trump won apost give up twitter and social media that is why that headline is why he does not trust the mainstream media to treat him fairly and he is going to continue to use social media so long as the mainstream media treats him in that fashion and his supporters are going to appreciate his use of social media i think that is exhibit a right there i think we would like the country would like public officials to exercise some restraint to not jump the gun when we see these tragedies happen they aposd like hillary clinton to do it they would like eric holder to do it and they aposd like president trump to do it and president obama to do it as well it would be nice if they did behave that way the motives seem to vary when these incidents happen you mention a softball practice shooter the guy who shot at the annapolis newspaper had a different motive they vary and i think we are trying to shoehorn a political agenda into these actions is wrong what we should be doing is bringing these people to justice and hopefully trying future acts by crosstalk wallace but you think that the president aposs rhetoric is separate and apart i aposm in not i aposm no way i aposve gotten in some fights on this network about this i aposm in no way saying the president was responsible but do you think it aposs possible that it aposs useful to say that these events happen in a particular climate riley i don apost think that aposs useful at all anymore than bernie sanders is responsible for the softball practice shooter i don apost i don apost think that aposs the proper way to look at these situations these events happen because these people are deranged the person who shot gabby giffords for instance these are deranged people and that is what we need to look at i don apost see attaching politics to this as helpful at all in one case we had a trump supporter carrying it out and in the other case we had a trump opponent carrying it out so no wallace liz liz marlantes the christian science monitor what we had seen though with all of these incidents is an increase in really dangerous and ugly radicalization of disturbed individuals online and i think that is something that we need to look at the same exact process that isis uses to recruit people we are seeing that here with dangerous homegrown extremists in these types of events are on the rise that is something you can talk about the tone of the top or the general political discourse but there is something really ugly going on on the internet and that is something i need think we need to pay attention to elleithee it aposs not limited to the internet though i mean there are i mean when you talked about the media i mean there are hosts on cable news who are giving home to right wing conspiracy theorists and allowing them to move forward unchecked with these conspiracy theories chaffetz there aposs nobody out there advocating that anybody take any violence elleithee no no that aposs different that aposs different chaffetz it is different you aposre right elleithee that aposs not what i aposm saying chaffetz but you aposre trying to ascribe it to some deaths and some murders and terrorism crosstalk elleithee we are talking about the tone of our politics chaffetz you are associating those with terrorism and it aposs no wrong no one party has cornered the market on crazy crosstalk chaffetz you can point on this both ways elleithee this exchange is a reflection of the challenge right now i am making a point about the challenge of our political discourse and the lack of civility and the fact that the extremes as liz was saying the extremes are rising and finding more homes to articulate their vision that is what is challenging chaffetz i don apost think you can point to a specific television show that aposs advocating this or crosstalk elleithee it is everywhere it is online it is on cable news it is in a variety of places and i would hope that everyone whether they are a television host whether they are an elected official whether it aposs me and my job in academia that we all do a better job of checking it wallace liz final thought marlantes i think there aposs an opening for a politician who wants to come forward and says i want to unite the country i want to be a healer not adding to the climate of toxicity that we aposd seen i mean i was really struck to that package that you play there was that clip by nikki haley and she had such strong words in the wake of what happened in her state i think there aposs a big opening for a politician who wants to be a healer chaffetz completely agree wallace the one thing you can say whether it has something to do with politics nine days before an election everything has to do with politics all right we aposll take a break here see you all a little later up next with just over a week until the november midterms who aposs got the advantage we aposll talk with the chairs of the democratic and republican house campaign committees when we come right back commercial break wallace coming up the battle for control of the house may be decided by just a few seats begin video clip trump if the radical democrats get control they will try to erase every single thing that we aposve achieved end video clip wallace we aposll ask the two house committee chairs about prospects for a blue wave next commercial break wallace just nine days from now voters will go to the polls to decide which party controls congress on the house side democrats need to flip at least 23 seats to take over but races in many battlegrounds remain tight joining me now from new mexico congressman ben ray lujan chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee and from ohio congressman steve stivers head of the national republican congressional committee rep steve stivers r ohio nrcc chairman good morning wallace gentlemen we often talk about an october surprise in the closing days of the campaign and i wonder whether the terrible october surprise this year is the outburst of violence this last week congressman lujan will democrats make this an issue the outburst of violence in our politics and tie it to president trump rep ben ray lujan d n m dccc chairman look first off chris thanks for having me this morning look no one should be politicizing what happened this week number one the senseless acts of violence that we see in pittsburgh the number of people that were killed while they were at a place of worship is a clear reason why congress must act to keep people safe number one and then also with the number of people who were threatened as a result of those bombs that were being mailed across america but look we should come together as a country this should not be a political response but rather a response at how we can further bring us together wallace congressman stivers can president trump clearly not be held responsible for the specific acts of violence but for a culture a discourse that contributes to it stivers well i agree with ben that we should not be politicizing these acts of violence as your panel said earlier hate has no ideology if you look at the baseball shooting last year that happened to be a bernie sanders supporter we need to come together i agree with ben i want to say that ben is not my enemy democrats are not my enemy they are my opponents and while we have different visions for the future of america different directions for america we are all americans first we need to come together and do what aposs in the best interest of america and no matter who wins in ten days i believe we can come together and make that happen wallace all right let aposs turn to some nuts and bolts starting with the real clear politics average of recent polls going to put them on the screen on the generic ballot question which party do you support in our congressional district democrats still lead republicans at this point 49 5 percent to 41 9 percent congressman lujan does that mean that there still is a blue wave and that democrats are going to regain control of the house lujan look chris while people have described this in different ways i aposm confident the democrats will win back the house this year we built our strategy around our candidates incredible men and women with records of service many of who have served our country in the u s military former cia officers fbi agents who have committed their lives to keeping our country safe and they aposre connecting with the american people talking about their personal stories i never said this would be easy but we made a commitment to build a battlefield and leave no stone unturned and that aposs why i aposm confident we will win the majority in just nine short days wallace congressman stivers the fact is history at least is against you since world war ii the president aposs party has lost an average of 28 house seats in the midterm after that new president is elected and when the job approval is below 50 percent as mr trump aposs is now he party loses an average of 37 house seats and again if democrats take 23 seats they take the majority congressman stivers what makes you think history won apost repeat itself again in this midterm stivers well mike we aposve defied history already we aposve had a we aposve created a wallace i aposm chris but thank you very much stivers sorry sorry chris we aposve defied history already we aposve won eight out of nine special elections we actually have an economy where we have 4 percent economic growth we have unemployment at 3 7 percent we have the highest consumer confidence we aposve ever had and we aposve lifted up all subgroups including record low unemployment among african americans and 18 to 25 year olds so i think people will reward us for what we aposve done we have more work to do but and we have great candidates we have folks who have who are incumbent members of congress folks who are police officers military folks we have folks who are committed to moving our country forward working together to make a difference so i think we aposre going to be able to hold our majority and i feel like momentum is on our side in this last week wallace congressman lujan i mean the fact is but all objective standards the economy is strong unemployment is down growth is up usually the economy if there aposs not a war going on is the key issue how do you beat that lujan well look chris all across america hardworking middle class families are still telling us that their wages and salaries are not keeping up with the cost of living my republican colleagues this year do not have a voting record to run on that has actually prioritized hardworking middle class families that aposs number one number two is you look at the data chris with what you put on the board there while i never look at any one poll data aposs on our side momentum aposs on our side the energy is clear early voting is up all across america and as long as people continue to turn up and vote we will do well the other thing is we aposre making sure that the american people know about the voting records of our republican colleagues when it comes to health care voting to take away protections for people with pre existing conditions and moving and agenda forward that would have actually slapped an age tax on people between the ages of 50 64 and resulted in creasing health care premiums deductibles and out of pocket costs for the american people that aposs what we aposre running on and again an agenda anchored around for the people and around our candidates wallace we have been talking this hour about the tone the ugly tone our politics has taken and i want to play some ads that both of your campaign committees you aposre the two chairs of the campaign committees have run against some of your opponents congressman stivers here aposs one that the nrcc ran against democrat elissa slotkin in michigan here it is begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif minority leader i just don apost even know why there aren apost uprisings unidentified female is this the quote unquote mob unidentified male it aposs going on too long liberal extremists tearing america apart elissa slotkin is one of them end video clip wallace congressman slotkin served three terms working for the cia in iraq and afghanistan or in iraq with the cia and then worked in the administrations of both presidents obama and bush is it constructive to call her of all people a liberal extremists stivers well you know i think i respect ms slotkin aposs service to our country in the cia and in the administrations but people aposs views on issues are legitimate and there are contrasts that we need to run so people understand what folks believe and i think it is fair to say that she is not in the mainstream of michigan politics wallace congressman lujan here is an ad that your group that you aposre chairing the dccc ran against republican congressman mike kelly in pennsylvania begin video clip unidentified male 2010 car dealer mike kelly aposs elected to congress and while there his net worth increased by millions so it aposs no surprise he helped give special tax breaks to car dealers like himself end video clip wallace but congressman the specific group you site for making that report the center for responsive politics says in fact his net worth has dropped dramatically during the time in office it hasn apost risen lujan well look chris when we see our republican colleagues voting for a tax package dubbed by the american people as a tax scam that was prioritizing corporations on the most wealthy in america over hardworking middle class families we aposre going to call them out on their record but look to the point of the question that you aposre asking chris wallace yes but that aposs his record this isn apost but sir that aposs his record i aposm talking about his net worth and that aposs a fact lujan well look to the point of your question i think that all committees and all spenders out there that are investing in campaign ads across the country they need to be respectful of that tone but i would agree with steve that when we aposre looking at voting records that i think that that is fair game as well and that we need to make sure that we aposre all looking to see that we can make sure that we aposre having a better conversation with the american people whether it aposs the last nine days of this cycle or going into next election as well wallace all right i aposve got a little bit over a minute left and i want you to share it equally so you each get about 30 seconds yes you aposve talked about the economy yes you aposve talked about health care immigration but to what degree is this election really about donald trump either pro or against congressman lujan you go first lujan look chris i think all across the country our candidates are not really talking about this president much there aposs no one that aposs going to talk more about donald trump than donald trump which gives our democratic candidates the opportunity to connect with their personal stories and talk about an agenda that is built around for the people and how we aposre going to be able to help lower prescription drug prices lower health care costs move a strong infrastructure package and clean up washington d c with all the corruption our candidates are doing well and it aposs because of our candidates the democrats will win the majority in the u s house of representatives wallace chairman stivers you have 30 seconds stivers well i think this election is about results versus dysfunction i already talked about our economic success we have more to do on infrastructure lowering health care cost but the dysfunction the other side would bring their health care agenda would kick 179 million people off their insurance and bankrupt medicare on day one it aposs they have an agenda that aposs outside the mainstream they want to abolish ice they want to not protect our border when there aposs a caravan of people coming lujan steve that is just untrue wallace all right i knew were weren apost going to settle things here but we appreciate both of you coming on chairman lujan chairman stivers thank you both thanks for your time in these closing days of this heated campaign stivers thank you so much lujan thanks for having us chris wallace coming up which issue will have the most traction in the midterms health care immigration or president trump we aposll ask our sunday group next commercial break begin video clip trump democrats want to raise your taxes they want to impose socialism that aposs what they aposre doing barack obama former president if republicans keep congress this fall you better believe they are coming after health care again and millions of people across the country who count on this are not going to have it end video clip wallace president trump and former president obama making their closing arguments to voters out of the campaign trail and we aposre back now with the panel well liz with nine days till the midterms how do you see the races both for the house and the senate liz marlantes the christian science monitor it aposs anybody aposs guess i mean we really don apost know right now what aposs going to happen early voting has been really interesting to watch turnout has been high across the board seven states have already surpassed their 2014 early voting numbers wallace more than 8 million people have voted early marlantes and and it aposs possible that some states will surpass their 2014 total numbers just in early voting according to some experts so that aposs a sign that there aposs a lot of interest the question is whose voters are going to turn out and we really don apost know is there still going to be you know a silent trump vote like we saw in 2016 or is this the year that democrats really mobilize young people minorities their coalition wallace we need to point this out though because liz midterms oftentimes as opposed to a presidential election turnout is low this almost seems that it could rival a presidential election in turnout marlantes oh absolutely and it again michael mcdonald who aposs a turnout expert an early voting turnout expert is saying that it aposs possible that we will see the highest turnout for a midterms since 1914 based on what he aposs seen so far wallace and i just want to say right now i was not around in 1914 so but i hear it was a heck of a heck of a turnout congressman chaffetz a lot less talk these days about a blue wave a sweeping democratic victory particularly in the senate where i think the kind of conventional wisdom for what it aposs worth is that republicans are going to hold onto the senate majority but aren apost there in the house a lot more ways when you look at the map for democrats to get to a 218 majority than republicans chaffetz yes i would agree with that but i was in the house in 2010 when there was a red wave wallace absolutely chaffetz and the democrats lost i think some 63 seats and there aposs no evidence anything like that aposs going to happen keeping the senate maybe even gaining in the senate i think is what you aposre going to see in a house it aposs going to be nip and tuck it aposs going to be close a lot of local issues like water in california will play a key role in what aposs happening in those races there but i think the week after the selection of the speaker will be fascinating because neither of the presumptive leaders actually have enough votes of 218 to get wallace well don apost talk about that we have to wait we can talk about that the week after the election chaffetz inaudible it aposs going to be so close wallace let aposs not burn our political issues chaffetz all right next week wallace let me talk about issues because there seem to be several big ones out there health care obviously is the economy is the immigration and concerns about the economy about the caravan and president trump let me start with you mo i aposm going to get to you jason in a moment which of those issues do you think has the most traction with voters elleithee look i think we aposre kind of living in a populist era and people are feeling that institutions are ignoring them which is why i think it aposs really interesting that democrats if you look at democratic ads across the country they aposre focusing on health care they aposre focusing on losing the protections for pre existing conditions that might be one of the most populist issues democrats have had in a very long time and i think it is fueling a lot of these numbers trump is being talked about everywhere else democrats are kind of trying to find an alternative by trump by talking about health care and i think it aposs helping them wallace jason riley well i think the issues that play to the president aposs strengths would be one the economy we just had reports third quarter 3 5 percent growth after eight years of being told 2 percent was the new normal by all the experts we could be on track to 4 percent growth for the year it aposs within reach so that will certainly play because the republicans in the latest wall street journal nbc news poll have a 15 point advantage when it comes to people who think which party does a better job on the economy i also think immigration plays to the president aposs strength and i don apost know why this caravan issue why the democrats think this works for them it simply plays in i think to this lawlessness that president trump has labeled them with it plays into the abolish ice the sanctuary cities this is more of the same and i think this this is something that works better for the president than it does for democrats so that aposs another issue wallace let me just interrupt for a minute we have a democrat there what about immigration and the caravan is that an effective issue for republicans elleithee look i think there are two couplings of emotions that drive voters in any election hope and optimism or fear and anger this is clearly a fear and anger dynamic and on both an election riley inaudible elleithee no no hold on hold on i think what has been motivating both sides in the election from day one is anger democrats have been angry since the morning after december or since november 2016 that has worked very well for them throughout 2017 and has gotten them to where they are now the republicans i think there was a bit of a complacency and then between kavanaugh and caravan we started to see the intensity and some anger on the right begin to bubble up the president has been very effective in stirring the pot and trying to keep them as angry as possible so which is going to which is going to win out we aposll find out in two weeks riley well i think that to the congressman aposs point local issues obviously play a big role in midterms and when it does come to national issues yes the kavanaugh hearings and the caravan have helped republicans close that enthusiasm gap but i think with the caravan issue mo this is a massive humanity headed towards the border this was not spontaneous or organic these are these are people that have been rounded up by activists and and immigrant advocates told what to say to reporters and and people at the border and president trump is not only right to do something about this i think he has a duty to do something about this i aposm very pro immigrant but i do believe in a sovereign u s border and in doing things the right way this is not the right way to seek asylum to america elleithee look i think i think democrats have been using immigration to their advantage for much the past year when the president and his family separation policy was center stage you saw a huge outcry and i think democrats were able to harness some of that energy and have been saying during this caravan crisis or excuse me discussion that we need to address this issue at the source and and the president aposs failure to do that has helped add to this but when when push comes to shove and you look at these districts these suburban swing districts across the country that are sort of the most competitive and the most nip and tuck and people are talking about a caravan versus losing pre existing conditions which is going to be more of the motivator which is going to be more of the driver if we aposre talking about the politics of this moment i think pre existing conditions is going to be the one wallace jason chaffetz what surprises me is the economy is going so well that you would think that this would be a no brainer that republicans would run on that and the president yes he mentions it it isn apost what he spends most of his time talking about is it that and you aposve got about 30 seconds here that he thinks and republicans think people are more likely to vote in anger than in ingratitude chaffetz well i think the idea that nancy pelosi and chuck schumer would have a gavels that maxine waters would be the chairman of financial services is something we talk about all the time there aposs a criticism the mainstream media doesn apost talk about the good news of the trump economy and i think that aposs very real but people feel it in their pocketbooks and it helps republicans going into the election wallace well we aposve got a little bit more time to talk about it and then after that aposs over the election then we can talk about the election of the speaker chaffetz yes there you go wallace there aposs always business is good these days thank you pane see you next sunday up next as we hit the home stretch of midterm campaigns things are getting even more heated on the trail commercial break wallace at the end of an ugly week of political violence it aposs reassuring to know most of that campaigning followed familiar lines with tough rhetoric and some funny moments and president trump usually at center stage here aposs a look at the action on the trail begin video clip question is he no longer lying ted trump to me he aposs not lying ted anymore he aposs beautiful ted sen ted cruz r texas and god bless president donald trump trump under
