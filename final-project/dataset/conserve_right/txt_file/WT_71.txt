concerns about the administration s decision to engage in hostilities against iran and about its lack of strategy moving forward mrs pelosi said in a statement our concerns were not addressed by the president s insufficient war powers act notification and by the administration s briefing rep gerry connolly virginia democrat called the presentation sophomoric and utterly unconvincing i left the room more troubled than when i went in he tweeted some republican lawmakers also expressed dissatisfaction with administration officials answers about what would justify the need for further military force against iran they were asked repeatedly what if anything would trigger the need for the administration to come back to congress for a declaration of war or an authorization for the use of military force sen mike lee utah republican told reporters at one point i believe one of the briefers said something along the lines of i m sure we could think of something but they struggled to identify anything tehran also appeared to be uninterested in escalating an armed conflict six days after the u s killed soleimani with an airstrike in iraq foreign minister javad zarif said iran had concluded proportionate measures in self defense by launching the missile attack tuesday night on the ain assad air base in western iraq and a second base housing u s and allied forces in the iraqi

retaliated for the death of soleimani u s stock markets posted healthy gains wednesday after his speech republicans in congress praised the president s restraint while some democrats expressed grudging relief as a superpower we have the capacity to exercise restraint and to respond at a time and place of our choosing if need be senate majority leader mitch mcconnell kentucky republican said on the senate floor i believe the president wants to avoid conflict or needless loss of life but is rightly prepared to protect american lives and interests and i hope iran s leaders do not miscalculate by questioning our collective will and launching further attacks the president who campaigned in 2016 on getting out of endless wars in the middle east vowed to impose even tougher sanctions on iran immediately these powerful sanctions will remain until iran changes its behavior the president said but neither the white house nor the treasury department would say what other new

response from susan rice a former obama administration national security adviser this is another series of despicable lies by president trump she said on msnbc the fact that three years after taking office he remains obsessed with president obama shows president trump s extreme weakness and insecurity mr trump urged countries that were part of the 2015 iranian nuclear deal to back out of it and work toward a new agreement that would indefinitely bar the iranians from building nuclear weapons iran has announced it longer considers itself bound by the agreement and will exceed the deal s limitations on nuclear fuel enrichment as long as i am president of the united states iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon mr trump declared iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism the time has come for the united kingdom germany france russia and china to recognize this reality they must now break away from the remnants of the iran deal or jcpoa and we must all work together toward making a deal with iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place the president said soleimani was a ruthless terrorist who was planning new attacks on american targets he fueled bloody civil wars all across the region mr trump said he viciously wounded and murdered thousands of u s troops including the planting of roadside bombs that maim and dismember their victims soleimani directed the recent attacks on u s personnel in iraq that badly wounded four service members and killed one american and he orchestrated the violent assault on the u s embassy in baghdad in recent days he was planning new attacks on american targets but we stopped him he added by removing soleimani we have sent a powerful message to terrorists if you value your own life you will not threaten the lives of our people mr trump said the world has failed to hold iran s islamist regime accountable for its hostile actions dating back to its 1979 seizure of the u s embassy in tehran and the holding of 52 american diplomats as hostages for more than a year for far too long all the way back to 1979 to be exact nations have tolerated iran s destructive and destabilizing behavior in the middle east and beyond mr trump said those days are over iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world we will never let that happen democrats in congress expressed concern that mr trump s actions were still risking war with iran sen tammy duckworth illinois democrat and an iraq war veteran said mr trump also has risked provoking iraq to kick us out of the very democracy we have helped to build we need to exert our constitutional control over this out of control toddler in chief and vote to prevent him from entangling us in another major war without legal authorization from congress she said on the senate floor wednesday we need less chest thumping and more diplomacy she said mr trump is a five deferment draft dodger who does understand the sacrifice of u s soldiers sen chris murphy connecticut democrat and a member of the foreign relations committee said he is glad the road to war may be narrowing but accused the president of damaging u s national security the trump administration has enabled tehran to restart their nuclear program turned the people of iraq and iran against us brought about a halt to our counter isis mission and prompted iraq to vote to eject all our troops from the country mr murphy said in short we are weaker and iran is stronger because of trump s actions but senate armed services chairman james m inhofe oklahoma republican said the president has bolstered u s security by holding iran accountable for its aggression iran now knows that president trump means what he says and that it cannot afford an all out war with the united states which is why it chose not to escalate further mr inhofe said whether iran seizes this opportunity to negotiate or not by killing soleimani president trump has put us in the strongest position we ve had with iran in decades he said the u s should now work with our partners in the region and in europe on a more comprehensive approach towards de escalation one that does not repeat the mistakes of the obama administration and which focuses on ending all aspects of iran s malign behavior including their use of ballistic missiles terrorism and their nuclear program through diplomacy lauren meier and seth mclaughli
