abruptly cut short in february when the two sides failed to strike a far reaching deal to end the north s nuclear and missile programs mr trump said at the time that he had to walk away because the north koreans demanded sweeping sanctions relief in exchange for only a limited commitment to destroy part of their nuclear arsenal a characterization pyongyang later challenged since hanoi mr kim has cast cast a negative shadow on future talks with heated rhetoric and by carrying out missile tests tests he had previously suspended while nuclear talks were gaining steam in a mid april speech the north korean leader set a dec 31 deadline for the trump administration to make a bold decision to change its negotiating stance if it wants a deal we don t like and we are not interested in the united

defensive nuclear umbrella from all of east asia the trump administration has declined to comment on when the last direct contact occurred between u s and north korean officials although u s special representative for north korea stephen biegun said at the shangri la dialogue security conference over the weekend that he remains confident progress can still be made mr pompeo meanwhile stressed in
