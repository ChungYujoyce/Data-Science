 cbs this morning youtube by sandy fitzgerald friday 14 october 2016 08 22 am gop vice presidential candidate mike pence said friday he has a lot of respect for first lady michelle obama but he doesn t understand the basis of her claim in a her speech thursday condemning donald trump for using what she called sexually predatory language in a conversation caught on a hot mic in 2005 i have a lot of respect for the first lady and the job she has done for the american people over the last seven and a half years the indiana governor told the cbs this morning host charlie rose continuing that he does not believe the language described sexually predatory actions i already spoke about my concerns about the language he used in that 11 year old video said pence but what he has made clear is that was talk regrettable talk on his part but that there were no actions further trump has categorically denied these last unsubstantiated allegations that were made this week from at least five women who claimed trump groped and kissed them against their will in years past frankly i think before the day is out the allegations will be questioned said pence the same reporters who wrote a similar story six months ago for the new york times have written this story and that story was completely discredited pence told fox news fox friends the trump campaign is working to bring out evidence that will disprove the allegations being made about him and said during an interview with nbc s today show that evidence is coming in frankly a matter of hours he told today show hosts matt lauer and savannah guthrie that melania trump has already contacted people magazine for a retraction of its story about trump but lauer commented that was different than showing evidence just say tuned pence told the today show there is more information coming forward but donald trump has made very clear that he s categorically denied these allegations yet he can t be more definitive than that and the difficulty is that at this point in a campaign it is astonishing to see with all due respect the enormous coverage of these really unfounded allegations unestablished allegations compared to an avalanche of emails coming out of hillary clinton s years as secretary of state pence said he agrees that allegations such as those being made against trump should always be taken seriously and respectfully but in the case of bill clinton he actually admitted to being involved with a 23 year old intern at the white house named monica lewinsky when he was president bill clinton actually paid a settlement of over 800 000 to one of those women paula jones the remarkable thing as the media goes chasing after unsubstantiated allegations coming from a newspaper that six months ago did a massive similar story that was utterly discredited by the same reporters pence told fox news it s remarkable to me they continue to literally ignore the hard evidence that s flowing out of hillary clinton s years as secretary of state and the clinton foundation whether it s a speech supporting socialized medicine in canada a paid speech supporting open borders in brazil he said the most concerning to him was the news that clinton s aides while she was secretary of state were directing contracts for the rebuilding of haiti after the earthquake to friends of the clintons i mean this is exactly the kind of pay to play politics the american people are tired of it s going to end when donald trump becomes president of the united states pence told cbs that as the father of two daughters and as a public person he does take allegations like those facing trump seriously but also noted the gop presidential nominee categorically denied the claims against him further the indiana governor said he urged trump to apologize which he has he also questioned the timing of the news against trump as we have hard evidence flowing out of the clinton foundation and the clinton years but the unsubstantiated claims are dominating the news pence said he s spoken with trump over the allegations being made about him and he believes the presidential candidate donald trump has asserted that all of these recent unsubstantiated allegations are categorically false and i believe him said pence the donald trump as i come to know and my family has come to know and spent considerable amount of time is someone who has a long record of not only loving his family and lifting his family up but employing and promoting women in positions of authority in this company and pence told rose he gave up a job he loves as governor of indiana a state he loves to join the trump race because i think this country is in a lot of trouble and he thinks it s time to return the issues and move away from the scandals the trump scandals have caused many to question his character but pence said he has found trump s response to be extraordinary he apologized for what he said 11 years ago said pence he showed humility he showed heart he focused that national presidential debate back on the issues that really affect the american people at home and abroad meanwhile he pointed out that the avalanche of emails from clinton s accounts continue to emerge clinton was advocating open borders when she was giving a speech in brazil advocating socialized medicine when she gave a speech in canada said pence the haitian issue to me is the biggest one the friends of the clinton s were given preference shall treatment for contracts for the reconstruction of haiti after an earthquake also on friday pence commented on trump s claims that the upcoming election may be rigged and he agrees that voter fraud has been an issue we are currently involved in a pretty vigorous investigation in the state of indiana over voter fraud said pence it is in the interest of everybody on every side of the spectrum to defend the one vote one principle the way elections are managed at the state level is to become involved as a poll watcher and poll volunteer and we consistently encourage people to do that watch the latest video at video foxnews com he told today show hosts matt lauer and savannah guthrie that melania trump has already contacted
