releasing a british oil tanker that its forces seized in the persian gulf and claimed to have arrested 17 cia spies it s getting harder for me to want to make a deal with iran said mr trump who called the claim of spy arrests a totally false story his remarks showed a shift in tack after weeks of attempts by the white house to publicly open the door to negotiations with tehran they put out

military captured friday in the strait of hormuz tehran has refused to release the ship and its 23 crew members britain which has been reluctant to join mr trump s campaign of pressure and economic sanctions against iran and has tried with other european powers to salvage an obama era iranian nuclear deal took a harder line monday the ship was seized under false and illegal pretenses and the iranians should release it and its crew immediately may spokesman james slack told reporters we do not seek confrontation with iran but it is unacceptable and highly escalatory to seize a ship going about legitimate business through internationally recognized shipping lanes britain also announced plans to form a maritime protection mission in which european nations will use escort vessels to help ensure the security of commercial ships traveling anywhere near iran the ramped up rhetoric suggested that iran s strategy of provocation multiple ship detentions bombings of several oil tankers the
