wreaths at a war memorial and at the mausoleum of national hero ho chi minh surrounded by vietnamese soldiers in crisp white uniforms and his own entourage of top north korean officials at the border he got out of his armored limousine and clasped his hands waving to a crowd of people cheering his departure since trump flew home to washington kim has stepped assuredly into the spotlight keen to show himself as a poised leader taking his rightful place on the international stage he met friday with president nguyen phu trong the country s top leader and communist party chief grinning broadly as he was feted by top officials and escorted down a red carpet top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey as kim met with officials in hanoi the united states and north korea have both been spinning their versions of what happened during one of the most high profile diplomatic collapses in recent years but some experts believe that kim by standing shoulder to shoulder with trump at a summit that captivated many around the world will have one sure win he ll be able to portray himself to his people and supporters as the charismatic head of a nuclear armed power not an international pariah that starves its citizens so it can build nukes and missiles on saturday kim his trademark high and tight pompadour a bit disheveled walked slowly behind a wreath with his name on it and a message that said i mourn the heroes and patriotic martyrs as it was taken to the monument to war heroes and martyrs he also oversaw the presentation of a large wreath at the ho chi minh mausoleum where he bowed and walked inside talks between kim and trump broke down on thursday the second day of their two day summit in a dispute over how much sanctions relief washington should provide pyongyang in return for nuclear disarmament steps despite a senior north korean official s suggestion in a rushed middle of the night news conference called to dispute trump s version of the summit s end that kim may have lost the will for diplomacy the north korean leader seems to have emerged from the diplomatic wreckage as a winner kim answered questions with humor and ease when confronted by an aggressive international media contingent here and crucially for his image at home he stood firm on his demands for the relief of sanctions imposed over a nuclear program north korea says it built in the face of unrelenting u s hostility meant to end its leadership kim as he considers his next move after hanoi will be backed by state controlled media that were already busy portraying the summit as a victory for their leader saying kim and trump appreciated that the second meeting in hanoi offered an important occasion for deepening mutual respect and trust and putting the relations between the two countries on a new stage north korea said it had asked for partial sanctions relief in return for closing its main nuclear site at yongbyon an important nuclear fuel production facility but not the only place the north is believed to make bomb fuel the united states also has been spinning the summit breakdown with senior officials saying that north korea wanted billions of dollars in sanctions relief in return for only partial dismantlement of yongbyon and demanded the north scrap more of its nuclear program for such a high level of concessions it s unclear what will come next working level meetings among experts to close the negotiating gap another summit or will trump consumed with controversy in washington and burned by the failure in hanoi lose interest the worst case scenario would be a return to the personal insults and threats of war between trump and kim in 2017 as the north staged a series of increasingly powerful weapons tests including a nuclear detonation and displays of long range missiles that can target the u s mainland though experts believe those icbms are not yet complete trump maintained ahead of the hanoi summit that the economic benefits of a deal could push kim to give up his nuclear ambitions kim came into the summit feeling confident that he could settle something that would end painful economic sanctions while letting him keep much of his nuclear program and only making a a variety of gestures that mimic disarmament jeffrey lewis a nuclear expert at the middlebury institute of international studies at monterey wrote after the summit collapse this outcome would be a signal that the world must live with north korea s bomb but kim won t rub it in anyone s face since it would be utter madness to try to topple a nuclear armed dictator it seems obvious which side should yield lewis said if trump does not accept the reality that we now live with a nuclear armed north korea then we are doomed to the collapse of negotiations and perhaps even a
