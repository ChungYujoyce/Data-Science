apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic china s freshly minted nobel prize for literature laureate whose name mo yan literally means don t speak in chinese in recent days spoke at ease on a wide range of issues some of them highly sensitive and thus controversial in the current chinese political environment sweden s decision to honor mr don t speak with the award is not without criticism by any standard mr mo is an enigma wrapped in chinese characteristics a member of the chinese communist party he publicly said he had lost his faith in the party since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre of pro democracy demonstrators in beijing his writings usually expose astonishing brutality and numbing corruption within the communist party top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender for more than two decades he served in the people s liberation army as a professional literary writer and he currently holds the post of vice chairman of the official chinese writers association mr mo once left a book fair in frankfurt germany while a member of the chinese delegation to protest of the presence of dissident writers from china yet his criticisms of communist party policies from forced abortion to the moral debauchery and political greed of party members are often more scathing and devastating than many writings by china s dissidents since the announcement of the literature award on oct 11 china has been intoxicated with euphoria and celebrations because the official chinese communist government in state media reports recognized mr mo as its first chinese nobel winner a notable falsehood here are the facts in 1989 the nobel prize for peace was given to the exiled tibetan leader the dalai lama whose homeland is claimed by china the government considers all tibetans chinese citizens in 2000 the nobel prize for literature was awarded to chinese dissident writer gao xingjian who was disgusted with the bloody tiananmen square massacre and emigrated to france where he is now a citizen ten years later chinese dissident writer literary critic and political prisoner liu xiaobo was awarded the nobel peace prize he remains in a chinese jail serving an 11 year sentence on trumped up charges although mr mo is accepted by china s communist government many of his views will not necessarily be welcomed by china s ruling clique on oct 12 during his first news conference after winning the prize mr don t speak said he hoped his fellow nobel laureate the imprisoned liu xiaobo would be freed as early as possible currently government run china central television cctv is conducting a self congratulatory opinion poll on the question are you happy designed to show the chinese people s gratitude to the communist party s great socialist achievements mr mo was interviewed sunday by cctv pollsters when asked are you happy mr mo did not follow the routine by thanking the glorious chinese communist party for his personal achievement as party members are obligated to do in such circumstances instead mr don t speak replied i don t know but his most outspoken statement since winning the prize already has stirred a national controversy at the oct 12 press conference he steered himself into the politically troubled waters of the bitter dispute between china and japan over uninhabited islands in the east china sea at present china is threatening japan daily with military action over the disputed island chain located south of okinawa and north of taiwan mr mo stunned the nation by announcing his opposition to a military solution to the dispute if we resort to a war over the issue he noted even if china won japan was defeated would we solve the dispute will a defeated japan recognize china s sovereign right to the islands the same problem will exist if japan defeated china therefore a war between china and japan won t solve the problem and i think the best solution is to set aside the issue now no people should be allowed to go to a disputed area in the ocean only let the fish go there fish will thank you throngs of angry youths a euphemism for chinese chauvinists were upset and prominently showed their displeasure on internet postings the party run global times a bastion of neo maoist sentiment promptly ran an editorial obliquely warning mr don t speak to shut up we hope mo yan will be able to use his status as the nobel laureate to make contributions to the development of our motherland and the progress of our society the saturday editorial stated we hope he can transcend all groups and promote china s social unity when there are schisms in social thinking and interests in other words global times wants mr don t speak to serve the government s current ideological watchword of harmony and unity under the one
