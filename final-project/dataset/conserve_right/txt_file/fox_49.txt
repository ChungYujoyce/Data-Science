humanitarian showdown in venezuela and why the president has changed his mind about pulling all u s troops from syria when we sit down with the secretary of state mike pompeo live only on fox news sunday then house democrats moved to block the president aposs national emergency declaration rep nancy pelosi d calif speaker of the house there is no emergency at the border it aposs a mythology of the president not a reality wallace we aposll discuss the latest on the border wall and the 2020 presidential field aposs move to the left with democratic party chair tom perez plus president trump aposs longtime fixer michael cohen is set to testify on capitol hill we aposll ask our sunday panel about that and when special counsel robert mueller will release his final report and our power player of the week having ph millennials with a real world playbook unidentified male we have built a gps for adulthood end videotape wallace all right now on fox news sunday and hello again from fox news in washington we begin with breaking news fighting broke out along the border in venezuela as troops loyal to disputed president nicolas maduro blocked opposition backed convoys attempting to bring humanitarian aid into the country several people died and some 300 were injured the trump administration condemned the violence that aposs only one of the challenges president trump faces this week on wednesday he meets with north korea aposs kim jong un for a second summit this time in vietnam in a moment we aposll speak with secretary of state mike pompeo about north korea venezuela and other hot spots but first we want to get a preview of the trump kim summit from kristin fisher reporting live from vietnam kristin kristin fisher correspondent well chris the location of the summit is very symbolic just a few decades ago vietnam was at war with the united states now it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world all while retaining communist control so president trump is hoping to show north korea leader kim jong un that if he commits to denuclearization then his country can enjoy the same kind of economic prosperity as vietnam begin videotape fisher north korean leader kim jong un is on his way to hanoi for his second summit in less than a year with president donald trump at the first summit in singapore the two agreed to work towards the complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula trump we now have a situation where the relationships are good where there aposs been no nuclear testing no missiles no rockets we got our hostages back fisher but the singapore agreement was light on specifics the challenge in hanoi will be to get the north koreans to sign something more concrete the north koreans will likely ask u s to lift some of the sanctions that have been crippling their economy while the u s will likely demand specific steps towards denuclearization first with deadlines and a verification mechanism but president trump says he aposs willing to be patient trump i aposm in no rush for speed we just don apost want testing end videotape fisher and while there have not been any ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons tests since the singapore summit the u s intelligence community says that the north koreans have continued to develop both of those programs chris wallace kristin fisher reporting from hanoi kristin thanks for that and joining us now before he heads off to vietnam the secretary of state mike pompeo mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday mike pompeo secretary of state chris it aposs great to be with you wallace before we get to the summit i want to ask about the developing situation in venezuela some small amount of aid did get through and reportedly some 60 members of the venezuela national guard defected to the opposition but generally speaking the forces stood for firm and stood by him is that a disappointment pompeo chris the venezuelan people are speaking loudly and clearly they understand that juan guaido is the legitimate president of the country we are supporting that the lima group the oas european countries all around the world have seen the devastation that aposs been wrought in venezuela by this sick tyrant maduro who aposs denying food to starving venezuelans and medicine to sick venezuelans burning trucks with this is the worst of the worst of a tyrant if i think the venezuelan people are seeing that we saw yesterday the military begin to see it as well some of this violence was clearly these colectivos these gangs the military wasn apost as certain they wanted to lean into this violence we are very hopeful in the days and weeks and months the maduro regime will understand that the venezuelan people have made it stays numbered wallace in a statement at the end of yesterday you said the united states will take action what does that mean pompeo we aposve already taken action action to support the venezuelan people and we aposll continue to do that they have a duly elected interim president mr guaido we are to continue to support them we aposll continue the american people have been most generous providing a couple of hundred tons of food medicine hygiene kits for the venezuelan people and then we aposll continue to build out the global coalition to put force behind the voice of the venezuelan people what aposs happened there is a tragedy there were five or six or eight killed yesterday but there have been hundreds and hundreds killed from starvation over the past weeks and months millions of people having to flee their homes 3 million people had to leave 10 percent of the venezuelan population those are the actions of the american people and the trump administration to support democracy in venezuela wallace but no military force pompeo we said every option is on the table we aposre going to do the things that need to be done to make sure that the venezuelan people aposs voice that democracy reigns and that there is a brighter future of the people of venezuela wallace all right let aposs turn to the main order of business for you this week and that is the kim trump summit in vietnam starting on wednesday before the singapore summit last june national security advisor john bolton said look they have to give up their entire nuclear program before the u s does anything and here you were just after the summit take a look begin video clip pompeo the complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the korean peninsula is the only outcome that the united states will accept end video clip wallace is that still president trump aposs position going into the summit complete denuclearization and no u s concessions before then pompeo there aposs been no change in u s policy since the time i aposve been secretary of state and frankly even before that when i was a cia director our objectives are clear our mission is clear president trump has also said this is going to take time there may have to be another summit we may not get everything done this week we hope we aposll make a substantial step along the way i spent a lot of time with chairman kim my team is on the ground today continuing to flush out paths forward to develop a road map for a path forward between the two countries and we are determined to achieve that it aposs important for the world aposs security the u n security council has demanded not the united states but the u n security council has demanded that chairman kim give up these weapons systems it aposs in the best interest of his country and i hope we can make a real substantive step forward this week it may not happen but i hope that it will wallace why a two day summit pompeo it might be one day it might be two days i aposm confident if it requires even more time we aposll commit to that there aposve been lots of conversations going on over an extended period of time continuing even through last night we are committed and president trump is committed to putting the hard work that it takes to get the outcome that the american people deserve wallace all right obviously you are not going to tell me what aposs been accomplished or what you think you aposre going to get at the end so far at least on the outside observers there aposs been some progress specifically as kristin mentioned in her piece therefore no nuclear test no missile test by north korea since 2017 but in terms of denuclearization handing over its nuclear weapons handing over nuclear fuel handing over nuclear missiles there aposs been very little take a look at this begin video clip mike pence vice president we still await concrete steps by north korea to dismantle the nuclear weapons that threaten our people and our allies in the region dan coats director of national intelligence we currently assess that north korea will seek to retain its wmd capabilities end video clip wallace the question i guess is as you head into the summit has north korea given any indication it aposs willing now to put meat on the bones that is either going to turn over an inventory of its arsenal or begin to turn over some of its nuclear arsenal pompeo in june of last year in singapore chairman kim unequivocally stated that he would denuclearize his country wallace but he hasn apost pompeo there were other pillars that we committed to as well we aposve made progress along some less so on others this is a complicated process the history is right i was the cia director at one point too you will recall chris the history is difficult the previous administration aposs policy right which was test allow the north korean to test pray pray they aposd stop and then cower when they threaten us right test pray and cower has been upended by president trump we put real economic pressure on the north koreans we aposve built out a global coalition one of the critiques is that we go it alone we aposve built up the world aposs coalition to communicate to chairman kim that that was the time now aposs the moment and i hope we aposll make real progress on that this week wallace there is criticism that president trump is unrealistic about his relationship and the threat coming from north korea i want to make a couple of points about this after singapore the president tweeted this there is no longer a nuclear threat from north korea and he talks repeatedly about the strength of his relationship with kim take a look here begin video clip donald trump president we would go back and forth and then we fell in love ok no really he wrote me beautiful letters and they are great letters we fell in love end video clip wallace why does the president say that pompeo relationships matter chris they affect everything in our lives whether it aposs grand strategy and denuclearization or simpler things relationships absolutely matter it aposs important that the two leaders are able to effectively communicate i aposve observed this over the past weeks and months i aposve watched them exchange messages i aposve watched our team understand the messages that the two leaders have provided and now we aposre going to get to have a second summit where the two leaders can sit and have a frank candid discussion explore options and i hope achieve what the ultimate end state is creating a brighter future for north korea and reducing the threat of the united states from the nuclear weapons that are today in north korea wallace is president from president trump aposs point of view is the idea of formally ending the korean war which we have an armistice back in the apos50s or the idea pulling some u s troops out of south korea are either of those on the table for this summit pompeo i told you before we started chris i aposm not going to talk about the context of discussions or elements of the negotiation i aposm simply going to stay away from that when we have an announcement you will be among the first to know wallace well along with everybody else in the world i aposm going to ask you a slightly odd question but it aposs something we aposre going to discuss later on in the show while you are sitting down with kim the house oversight committee is going to be conducting a public hearing on television with michael cohen the president aposs former lawyer and fixer reportedly he aposs going to talk about all kinds of bad or questionable things done in the trump organization do you question the appropriateness of having that hearing holding a public hearing that potentially could undercut the president while the president is on foreign soil negotiating pompeo congress has its own authority they can they can move how they choose to proceed i know what we aposll be focused on i aposm very confident that the president and our team will be focused on the singular objective that we are headed to hanoi for wallace this week the president reversed course on syria in december he said that he was going to pull all 2 500 u s troops out of northeastern syria right away take a look begin video clip trump we have won against isis we aposve beaten them and we aposve beaten them badly our boys our young women our men they aposre all coming back and they aposre coming back now end video clip wallace but now it turns out they aren apost coming back now he announced on friday that he aposs going to keep 400 troops there including 200 on the border with turkey two questions really has he now accepted the prevailing view in the military that even if they lose all their territory that isis will remain a threat and secondly have you gotten any buy in now that we are staying there from britain or france that they will keep troops there on the border to help protect our kurdish allies pompeo well chris the predicate of your question i think is wrong so let me just try and address the policy there the president has made very clear that the achievement of destroying the caliphate both in syria and in iraq we forget mosul people forget raqqa this is an enormous accomplishment of our administration and our partners in the region and we are very proud of that millions of people liberated from the terror of isis our president has also been very clear that this is the threat from radical islamic terrorism it aposs real it continues and we aposve got to continue to fight it the announcement this week that we aposre still going to have a residual footprint inside of syria makes sense in the context of our mission statement and the tactics will change as time goes on we aposll use different tactics in different parts of the world to fight back against radical islamic terrorism president trump is committed to doing it wallace have britain and france agreed to keep troops there now pompeo we aposre hopeful that we will have a coalition there i don apost have anything to announce this morning but i believe that the europeans will understand the risk and the threat and be partners alongside of us on this wallace i got about a minute left i want to ask you one final question hoda muthana the young woman who left the united states four years ago to join isis says that she wants to return here to face justice you have said she aposs not an american citizen she will not be allowed in she was born in the united states she did have a u s passport and in the past other isis fighters men who we have captured have been brought back here to face justice look nobody has any sympathy for hoda muthana but i guess the question is why is her case different why not allow her to come back if she was born in the u s and has a passport and face justice here pompeo she aposs a noncitizen terrorist she has no legal basis for her claim of u s citizenship she aposs not coming back to the united states to create the risk that somebody should return to the battlefield and continue to put at risk american people american kids american boys and girls that were sent to help defeat isis she put them at risk she aposs not a citizen she aposs not coming back wallace even though she was born in the u s is the issue i aposm just trying to understand the issue is the issue that her father was a diplomat at the time because they say he had stopped being a diplomat before she was born pompeo so there aposs litigation ongoing here aposs what i can tell you we have a strong legal basis for our claim that she is not citizen and she aposs not coming back wallace secretary pompeo thank you thanks for your time pompeo thanks chris wallace safe travels and good luck in vietnam pompeo thank you very much wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the fight for power in venezuela plus what should we expect from the trump kim summit this week will north korea start to give up its nukes commercial break wallace deadly clashes on the venezuelan border this weekend as forces loyal to disputed president maduro largely stood by him blocking most opposition efforts to bring humanitarian aid into the country and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove columnist for the hill juan williams julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press and josh holmes senator mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff well karl where are we at the end of a tumultuous saturday is maduro aposs hold on power stronger or weaker karl rove gop strategist i aposd say weaker and every day the steady application of the force of the lima group and the united states will make them weaker because inside the country hundreds of thousands of people are taking to the streets or protesting at the border crossing points and there was maduro as his military forces killed protesters dancing on the stage in front of a crowd in caracas so no i think i think he has weaker today and every day that the united states and its allies what aposs interesting to me is that this was led by the lima group this was led by the organization of american states the president receives a phone call before he takes action from justin trudeau this is multilateral action involving the united states and the steady application of force and protest inside the country will bring maduro down wallace but juan the sad fact is for people who would like to see maduro out that there have been a lot of talk that perhaps the military armed forces would turn on maduro would side with the people would side with the opposition that didn apost happen so what does the u s do now and how does president trump and his administration and the u s avoid the image that once again here aposs the u s intervening in latin america what has happened dozens of times over the last century juan williams political analyst and not were to good result we don apost have a great track record of successful intervention so many unintended consequences so much resentments against the u s you know to me maduro is a vulgar dictator i think people are suffering i think that aposs why the humanitarian aid why the lima group sees the necessity to get involved but i thought you were on target and raising the question with secretary pompeo about u s military intervention we can have cia and other people go in there and try to undermine them but at some point i think the american people say why is it our job intervention in this area i said has not does not have a good track record and it also broaches the possibility that the u s would actually put military forces in to oust maduro this doesn apost make sense it doesn apost make sense with the public in terms of our foreign policy it doesn apost make sense and of course it fits with the current push against all the charges of socialism that the trump administration is advancing here against their democratic opponents wallace we aposll be talking about that with tom perez in the next segment let aposs talk about the other big foreign policy story this week as we just discussed with the secretary of state and that is that president trump will be meeting with kim jong un in vietnam starting wednesday for a second summit here aposs what the president have to say about that this week begin video clip trump we started off with a very good meeting and i think we will continue that along i don apost think this will be the last meeting by any chance but i do think that the relationship is very strong end video clip wallace julie how confident are u s officials that they are going to come out of this summit with something more than they came out of singapore with which were basically vague declarations of an intent to denuclearize julie pace washington bureau chief the associated press you hear two different things from u s officials one privately they say that their expectations of some kind of significant deal are pretty low in this summit there might be more talk about denuclearization but the idea that they would come out with something signed specific with dates and verification is probably pretty low the other thing you do here is that there is some concern that the president because he knows that the takeaway from the first summit was that it was vague that there wasn apost anything particularly specific that he could get in a room with kim and make some type of concession that goes against what his advisors wanted to do that he could be so eager to strike some kind of deal that he could give something up i think that is a real concern particularly if you look at i know we will talk about this later some of what will be happening in washington while he is abroad michael cohen his former lawyer who was going to be testifying that he could be looking to direct attention in a different direction wallace josh what aposs your sense among republicans particularly senate republicans particularly senate foreign policy experts how do they feel about this summit and about giving kim another big international platform which always tends to weaken the sanctions regime there are indications that russian and china have loosened up since singapore and not getting the big concession for the north koreans on specifics of denuclearization josh holmes founder cavalry i think the important thing to focus on is to look at this as a continuum from when the president was first inaugurated i don apost think there aposs any question that we were perhaps even at the brink of war with north korea they were launching missiles indiscriminately some of which they were testing could hit the continental united states clearly we cannot ignore that and so you basically have to go paths at that point you could approach the brink of war or you could do what president trump has been doing which is engaging directly with kim and i think you know no question there has not been the concrete signed agreements out of the first singapore summit and probably won apost be out of this but you know what aposs not happening is they are not sending missiles they are not testing missiles they are not sort of broaching that brink of war type fever that we were at for the first year of his presidency and i think that in and of itself is great progress wallace karl you aposre the one person at this table who aposs had some experience with this when you were advising president bush 43 when he head into a high stakes summit how much did he and his team all of you know about what you already had baked in the cake what we are going to get at the end of the summer rove a lot and that aposs one of the problems with our relationship with north korea we don apost even have a common definition of what constitutes denuclearization we don apost have an agreement upon the process what comes first denuclearization or sanctions relief and so they really are they aposve had one summit but let aposs not kid ourselves we are at the beginning of a process we are not deep into the process and we aposre going to face an issue here where what kind of concrete steps are the north koreans going to take sure they are not sending missiles over japan and they are not testing nuclear weapons but maybe they don apost need to test we know they aposve got operative nuclear weapons and we know they aposve got the ability to send missiles whether they can marry the two together we don apost know but what concrete steps are we going to take in one of the key things that i think people are looking at when i talk to people in the foreign policy areas the facility at yongbyon which is the only facility from which they derive fissile material three elements they need for nuclear weapons and the question is a test of seriousness is whether or not they will decommission yongbyon and make it under an international inspection regime wallace but i have to tell you i talked to a foreign policy expert this week and asked him specifically on that issue and he said they aposve got enough fissile material already they don apost need yongbyon they aposve already got enough rove they aposve got dozens of weapons let aposs not kid ourselves even if we came to an agreement that they are not going to make anymore they have plenty of material plenty of weapons they will continue to use the material they have on hands to fabricate weapons unless there aposs an agreement to stop and even then in a country that is a virtual slave state how the heck do we have an inspection regime that works williams you know that aposs a very pessimistic view but i must say it raises the question in my mind karl why are we getting this matter platform an international platform why are we legitimizing him and don apost forget that the chinese and the russians have often operated in such a way to support this rove well you ask the question i will give an answer wallace real quick rove the administration i think has made the determination that it aposs better to engage than to not engage now we can argue about that but we engaged and it didn apost work we didn apost engage and that didn apost work the president has so far done got some things out of this at least the hiatus crosstalk wallace all right let aposs wait and see what happens wednesday and thursday in vietnam all right we have to take a break here we aposll see you all later in the program but we want to move on because when we come back democratic party chair tom perez joins us to discuss president trump aposs claims democrats are going socialist and we aposll also discuss the party aposs effort to block the trump declaration of a national emergency at the border commercial break wallace coming up the democratic presidential field for 2020 embraces liberal ideas begin video clip sen bernie sanders i vt presidential candidate we need to make public colleges and universities tuition free and lower student debt end video clip wallace we aposll ask dnc chair tom perez about the party aposs move to the left in a fight over the president aposs national emergency declaration commercial break chris wallace this week self described democratic socialist bernie sanders jumped into the 2020 race adding to a large and growing field of candidates who are taking the party further left joining us now the chair of the democratic national committee tom perez mr chairman welcome back to fox news sunday tom perez democratic national committee chairman great to be with you chris wallace president trump is pretty clear about at least one way he intends to go after the democratic party and whoever you nominate in 2020 take a look begin video clip trump the democrat party has never been more outside of the mainstream they are becoming the party of socialism late term abortion open borders and crime end video clip wallace whether it aposs the green new deal or medicare for all or suggestions about very high tax rates on the super wealthy how do you defend against president trump aposs charge and effort to portray the democratic party your tax and spend policies as socialist perez this is one of the oldest tricks in the playbook chris you go back 75 years when republicans don apost want to discuss the issues that matter to real people they call it socialism social security when it was being debated you had republicans calling it socialism the minimum wage in 1938 you had republicans calling it socialism medicare ronald reagan said and i quote medicare will lead to socialized medicine medicare will lead to socialism in america the affordable care act the children aposs health insurance program all of those things were socialism socialism why did they do that because they aposre wrong on the issues they don apost want to talk about pre existing conditions we aposre right on that issue we want to make sure if you aposre diabetic you can keep your coverage they don apost want to so they change the subject and that aposs what they do wallace ok some of those issues climate change health care have been around for a while but a new issue came up this past week three democratic candidates for president now say they support reparations compensating the descendants of slaves here they are begin video clip julian castro d presidential candidate i have long thought that this country would be better off if we did find a way to do that kamala harris d presidential candidate america has a history of 200 years of slavery we had jim crow end video clip wallace and now elizabeth warren says she also supports reparations not only for slavery but for native americans you talk about some of these other issues and say well the republicans have always called them socialist back in 2016 barack obama hillary clinton bernie sanders all dismissed the idea of reparations and polls have shown that the vast majority of americans are against the idea are you comfortable with some of your leading democratic candidates talking about reparations compensating the descendants of victims slavery perez civil rights is the unfinished business of america chris and we aposve we aposve seen throughout our nation aposs journey that we have more work to do and that aposs why democrats are talking about it but what democrats are talking most about right now is how do we build an economy that works for everyone and not just the few at the top how do we make sure that if you have diabetes that we will bring down the cost of prescription drugs how do we build an infrastructure program that aposs going to put people to work wallace ok i understand that perez that aposs what we aposre talking about wallace but specifically reparations do you think is that something that will be in the democratic platform the idea that we are going to pay the the country is going to pay reparations compensations to the victims the descendants of victims of slavery perez that aposs something that will be discussed during the course of the presidential nominating process and what i what i think is going to be discussed at at length during this nominating process is how do we make sure america works for everyone i find it this the whole interesting thing about the continued use of the word socialism is that repressive socialist regimes two of their most frequent qualities are number one they go after the press they try to undermine the press and number two they are they have endemic corruption and i find it very ironic when you hear this president using the word socialist all the time i mean he putin kim castro what they all have in common is they were doing so many of the same things you shouldn apost be attacking the press the way this president does it aposs unprecedented you shouldn apost be you shouldn apost be golfing wallace i wait a minute i got to i got to interrupt just for a second are you putting the president in the same class with putin and kim and castro perez i aposm just saying authoritarian socialist regimes undermine the media that is wrong you shouldn apost do that period no footnotes no exceptions authoritarian socialist regimes have endemic corruption you should understand that we democrats won in 2018 in no small measure because of the culture of corruption engulfing this administration wallace you saw the clip that we played earlier where the president was going through the litany of things he says the democratic party has now become one of the things that he talks about as democrats is the party of open borders on tuesday the house democrats are likely going to pass a resolution of disapproval against a declaration of a national emergency any concerns that the president is going to be able to paint democrats as soft on border security perez when you look at the facts the facts belie that chris the the fact of the matter is that democrats understand that you can have secure borders and the rule of law that aposs what we have fought for and as you correctly pointed out i think in last sunday aposs show what this president has done is unprecedented i think mr miller was on this show you correctly pointed out that there has been no factual circumstance where the president asked for x congress said no and the president went ahead and did it that aposs why at the heritage foundation in 2011 wallace i hate it when people turn my own words against me perez well but that aposs that happened wallace well well well played well played mr chairman ok let aposs turn the jussie smollett case after he claimed that he was the victim of a hate crime democrats rushed to his aid you tweeted let aposs call it what it is a vicious hate crime kirsten gillibrand wrote it aposs the latest of too many hate crimes against lgbtq people and people of color and both cory booker and kamala harris called it a modern day lynching here aposs how white house spokespersons sarah sanders responded to all of you begin video clip sarah sanders white house press secretary it aposs another sad example of people so quick to want to attack and come after this president much like you saw with the covington kids end video clip wallace was this a rush to judgment and to play identity politics in an effort to attack the president perez you know chris i spent the better part of a decade under republican and democratic administrations as a career federal hate crimes prosecutor i saw these cases firsthand if the allegations that have come out in recent days are true it aposs unconscionable because hate crimes the fact of the matter are on the rise and when you when you create a false situation you are doing an injustice to all the people who have been victimized look at the adl ph wallace do you think that you guys rush to fast to perez we had the facts we we acted on the facts as we knew at the time and and here are the facts that we know today hate crimes are on the rise and in the aftermath of charlottesville frankly that was a layup for the president he should have unequivocally said there is no place for this and yet he was empowering he was giving permission that was wrong and and we have to understand right now the fact of the matter hate crimes are on the rise wallace ok perez and that should be a bipartisan issue wallace ok let me ask you about something that people would say would be a layup for you do you still feel that virginia governor northam should step down for wearing blackface 35 years ago and do you support the virginia house of delegates holding a public hearing where the two women accusing justin fairfax the lieutenant governor of sexual assault can testify perez well let aposs take both questions together wallace right perez i called for governor northam to step down i think his ability to govern has been compromised as as president lincoln once said public sentiment is everything with it you can do anything without it you can apost do anything so i wallace so should he still step down perez yes i aposve called for that and i think his ability to govern has been undermined wallace and fairfax perez i have i have a i have a concern in the context of having a part time state legislature conducting the hearings i have been unequivocal in making sure that when allegations of this nature are made that they are investigated i don apost think the virginia house of delegates and the in the senate are the right place to investigate it we should have an independent investigation that should be prompt it should be thorough it should be fair and and it it that aposs what should happen wallace ok i aposve got about a minute left i got some bookkeeping to do will milwaukee host the 2020 democratic convention perez we have three finalists milwaukee houston and miami they are all in the hunt wallace when are you going to decide perez and we aposre hoping we aposre hoping to make the decision within the next few weeks at the most i my goal was to make it by the end of the month i hope to keep that but my goal is to get it right and if it takes a few days over then we aposre going to make sure we get it right we have an embarrassment of riches quite frankly wallace finally you have scheduled 12 democratic debates six this year end of this year perez right wallace six the beginning of next year will fox news get at least one of the 2020 democratic presidential debates perez we haven apost made that decision yet we have made the decision on the first two debates and what we aposre doing in the first two debates chris is unprecedented two nights making sure we have random draw and and here aposs our goal we want to make sure wallace you know what also would be unprecedented giving us a debate perez well that aposs well we aposll see about that but i well here aposs my number one goal my number one goal is to make sure that everyone gets a fair shake if we have 16 people in the race 15 aren apost going to make it to the mountaintop my job is to make sure that everyone and their supporters feels like their candidate got a fair shake and then my other job is to make sure that whoever wins has an infrastructure that will enable them to thrive and that aposs why i enjoy coming here talking to you talking to your viewers about our our vision of a democratic party of a nation frankly that works for everyone wallace well we welcome you thank you so much for joining us chairman perez perez always a pleasure wallace please come back sir perez my pleasure look forward to it wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group again to discuss the special counsel report which will be wrapped up someday and president trump aposs former fixer on capitol hill this week plus what would you like to ask the panel about the timing of michael cohen aposs congressional hearing while the president is overseas just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip anderson cooper anchor cnn aposs anderson cooper 360 do you still believe the president could be a russian asset andrew mccabe former acting fbi director i think it aposs possible i think that aposs why we started our investigation and i aposm really anxious to see where director mueller concludes that end video clip wallace former acting fbi director andrew mccabe like a lot of people anxious to see what special counsel robert mueller has found in almost two years of investigation and we aposre back now with the panel well julie first of all explain to our viewers and to me why we get all these reports last week the mueller reports is coming out friday no it aposs coming out this week then suddenly we are no we don apost know when it aposs coming out but it aposs not going to be this week and secondly what do your sources in the white house say how worried are they really about the mueller report julie pace the associated press so on the first point i think what you aposre seeing is some wishful thinking on people aposs parts we aposve been living with the mueller investigation for quite some time and there are signs that it is drawing to a conclusion in part because mueller has handed off some of these investigations some people on his team are moving on to other jobs but the reality is you know we aposre not going to know when this investigation is done until it is officially done and mueller tells barr the new attorney general that he aposs done i think it aposs important to note that when that happens that actually kick starts another process which is to figure out what becomes public so that is not actually the end of this in terms of your second question you know there is some real anxiety in the administration about this report because it aposs just such an unknown they are fairly confident that there aposs going to be nothing in the report that directly ties president trump to russia in terms of a phone call saying let aposs coordinate some type of real smoking gun but there are other areas where they have a lot less certainty that relates to the question of obstruction around the firing of james comey also this trump tower meeting that happened where don junior was present there anything that involved the president aposs family his kids in particular is of real concern and again it is such an unknown they they think they know what mueller has based on conversations with lawyers who have represented people who have had conversations but it but it remains a bit of a black box for them wallace well i want to i want to pick up with the the one of the first point you made which is after mueller gives up his report he gives it to william barr the new attorney general and according to the regulations that is a confidential report which barr then has to decide how much to turn over to congress and to the public here aposs what barr said at his confirmation hearing begin video clip william barr attorney general i am going to try to get the information out there consistent with these regulations and to the extent i have discretion i will exercise that discretion to do that end video clip wallace karl the justice department generally does not say anything about people it doesn apost decide to charge the comey press conference on hillary clinton being a a pretty dramatic karl rove contributor a glaring example of not following the rules wallace a of not following that but you aposve also got the fact that for the last two years house republicans particularly the intel committee were pressing pressing the fbi to turn over a lot of information it didn apost like the fisa warrant isn apost it going to be a little hard now to turn off that spigot if house republicans or barr or the president said oh no we can apost share this information rove yes look that aposs going to be the big battle what aposs made public and wasn apost not made public and this rule was promulgated by janet reno after the expiration of the independent counsel statue in 1999 it aposs been enforced ever since then i aposd make the argument this i i thought it was absolutely dreadful it was unsancted the sanctimonious jim comey blasting hillary clinton after after him declining to indict her he had no authority to make that decision incidentally that was a decision that should have been made at doj but having made that decision taking it unto himself the power to do that the then deciding not to indict her and then trashing her was it was a bad for this is several hundred years of american jurisprudence tossed out wallace all right but let let if karl so having said that wallace wait let me just ask no let me just ask you this so according to the justice department legal guidelines they can apost indict a president karl right wallace so the only person who could bring a president karl right right wallace i aposm not saying that there aposs anything to do is congress karl right wallace don apost you have to share any information with congress karl well you get you get to the you get to the critical moment wallace i sometimes kind of do karl you do brilliantly inaudible but but that is the key question if they if they if they decline to indict the president because presidents should not be indicted while they aposre in office that aposs the one thing that might need to be made public because that would need to be taken into consideration by congress which holds the ultimate power of impeachment but short of that i don apost think that they should make anything public because that aposs not what we should do in our system comey showed why that was wrong wallace ok i i we aposre running out of time here so i want to get to the another subject and that is michael cohen the president aposs former fixer former lawyer is going to testify in public before the house oversight committee on wednesday this very day that president trump sits down with kim jong un in vietnam we asked you for questions for the panel about that and barry zalma tweeted this why does the congress have no respect for the president josh how do you answer barry about the decision by the house oversight committee to hold a hearing with michael cohen who aposs clearly going to say bad things about the president right in the middle of a summit josh holmes founder calvary well i think it aposs terrible and i think it aposs a terrible precedent i mean there used to be not so long ago this agreement when a president was overseas that you help you hold fire on domestic political disputes this one is absolutely the highest rung on the ladder of a political dispute we aposre talking about a former aide to mr trump who who has proven time and again is very interested in trying to harm him politically just at a moment when the president is sitting down for something that can only be described as of top national interest for the international security of our country so i think it aposs absolutely ridiculous one point i wanted to make in reference to whether this is public or not we aposre not dealing with an intern escapade here as we were in the apos90s with the starr report we aposre dealing with some sensitive information about a state actor of russia in theory wallace you aposre talking about the mueller report holmes interfering with the election there is definitely going to be some things that are redacted here i absolutely am confident the democrats will use that as an opportunity to say that the doj is not sharing everything but in the end i think we aposre going to know everything that we need to know in this mueller report rove by law wallace wait wait wait let me bring in juan and you aposve been pretty critical i think it aposs fair to say of this president do you have any problems with a house committee holding a hearing a public hearing on national television with michael cohen when the president is over in vietnam and in a summit with kim juan williams political analyst yes i think it aposs it hurts us the american people in terms of the voice of the president because i think michael cohen is likely to indict the president aposs character he was the president aposs confidant his fixer and he aposs going to be talk about things like payoffs potentially criminal activity i mean directed to involve himself at the president aposs at the president aposs will so i think it is damaging but remember michael cohen was scheduled to have appeared much earlier he delayed it and this is just a consequence of that delay so i don apost think it was intentional action by the congress in response to the question who suggested that it aposs disrespect ph wallace well i mean i aposve got ten seconds they could have waited until next week williams well they could have waited forever but you know what he aposs going to jail and so really wallace not until may williams no but the point is he aposs going to jail and the point was he was avoiding testimony and they want to get him now wallace ok thank you panel see you next sunday and i will say it may be inappropriate but it will be good tv up next our power player of the week how this millennial ceo is helping other people her age face the real world commercial break wallace remember when you graduated from school and went out in the
