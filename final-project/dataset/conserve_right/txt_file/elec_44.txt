 sign in running against majority leader in races across country manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong senate majority leader harry reid is not on the ballot this year but the gop is nevertheless angling to make him the focus of the 2014 campaign arguing a vote for any senate democrat is a vote to keep mr reid in power in several early season campaign debates republican candidates have challenged democrats saying they are trying to hide their allegiance to mr reid whom they say is both the king of congressional gridlock and the man in charge of president obama s agenda on capitol hill republicans are hoping that the ill will toward mr reid can tilt the playing field against democrats in much the same fashion that they tried to use against then house speaker nancy pelosi in the 2010 elections when the gop flipped control of the lower chamber see also hhs breaks own rules oks ark medicaid plan with potentially costly results report democrats say the new focus on mr reid comes because the pelosi attacks have grown stale but they doubted attacking mr reid will sway many voters the attacks take several forms but all of them involve pointing to the nevada democrat who has been his party s senate leader for nearly 10 years as the tyrant of washington in alaska former attorney general dan sullivan accused sen mark begich a first term democrat of being a loyal foot soldier for mr reid subverting the needs of his state to the nevada democrat s wishes see also virginia s mcauliffe declines to expand medicaid program key to obamacare you have not been allowed by harry reid to offer one amendment on the senate floor in five and a half years in the senate i think that is an indication of your effectiveness for alaska mr sullivan said casting the senate election as a chance to retire mr reid from his leadership perch mr begich dismissed the line of attack with laughter saying he s voted his own priorities and added dan you should read my record a little better others republicans couch mr reid as the key driver of mr obama s agenda saying stopping the former will stop the latter if you like what is going on in washington then vote for my opponent because you know she will be more than a proxy for harry reid and barack obama and nothing will change businessman david perdue said at a forum with his democratic opponent michelle nunn in the race for georgia s open senate seat in kansas greg orman isn t even a democrat but rather an independent but sen pat roberts accused him of being a conduit for mr reid to remain in power mr roberts said mr orman had donated money to mr reid in the past this is the man that he supported with money mr roberts thundered this is the man that he supported in regards to the obama administration he is not an independent he is a liberal for his part mr orman said i agree that harry reid is stopping progress on a lot of things but so are republicans in the house justin barasky spokesman for the democratic senatorial campaign committee said the reid attacks won t resonate he said voters will view it as a distraction from the policy issues that democrats want to talk about republican senate candidates want this election to be about anything other than their records of supporting plans to gut medicare privatize social security and restrict women s access to common forms of birth control mr barasky said unfortunately for them it s not going to work mr reid s office did not respond to a request for comment still to be seen is whether he is as polarizing as mrs pelosi a rasmussen reports poll in 2010 found that 60 percent of likely voters disapproved of her last month rasmussen found house speaker john a boehner has the highest disapproval rating of the major congressional leaders at 60 percent with mrs pelosi at 56 percent mr reid was disapproved by 54 percent while his gop counterpart senate minority leader mitch mcconnell faced 49 percent disapproval mr mcconnell himself is banking that the reid attack will work the five term incumbent says he s an agent of change while voting for allison lundergan grimes his 35 year old democratic challenger would mean backing a democratic party out of touch with kentucky her first vote in the senate will be to re elect harry reid majority leader mr mcconnell told reporters following their recent joint appearance at a forum hosted by the kentucky farm bureau the most important vote she will cast will be to organize the senate and make him the majority leader who will then set the agenda which guarantees that none of the concerns that the kentucky farm bureau has will be dealt with tim alborg a democratic strategist in georgia said the jury is out on whether anti reid messages will sway voters sure there are some d c folks trying to demonize reid down here in the same way they ve attempted to use nancy pelosi s name as a slur mr alborg said and yes some folks in the republican base have bought into it since they ve been experiencing pelosi fatigue as of late most georgians though are looking for practical solutions and they re sick of gridlock in washington he said michelle nunn is focused on keeping washington working for us rather than shutting it down forrest a nabors university of alaska political science professor said that the anti reid message works best if it is done in tandem with attacks against mr obama the president s unpopularity tends to be lower than the national average reid s name is of course less familiar than obama s which is why linking them together is more effective he said copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view comments click
