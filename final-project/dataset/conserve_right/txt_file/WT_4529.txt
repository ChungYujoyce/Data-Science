limits on churches as the judiciary panel holds the hearings democrats will consider drafting articles of impeachment the articles could also cover matters beyond trump s efforts to push ukraine to investigate democrats including special counsel robert mueller s investigation but no decisions have been made the next steps would be a vote by the full house and finally a senate trial what s next in impeachment intelligence committee sums up democrats on the house intelligence committee have been compiling the evidence gathered through more than six weeks of closed door depositions and public hearings the committee has scheduled a vote to approve the report tuesday evening when lawmakers return from the thanksgiving break it would then go to the house judiciary committee even after the report is submitted the intelligence panel s investigative work could continue democratic chairman adam schiff has said the committee could hold more depositions and hearings but he won t allow the trump administration to stall the impeachment inquiry and prevent the judiciary committee from moving ahead his committee could file addendums to its report if necessary several potentially key witnesses former national security adviser john bolton acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney energy secretary rick perry and secretary of state mike pompeo among others have declined to provide testimony or documents on trump s orders democrats have said they don t want to get tied up in lengthy court battles to force those witnesses to cooperate with subpoenas but they could still hear testimony if one of them changed their mind or if other key witnesses emerged time is running short if the house is to vote on impeachment by christmas which democrats say is the goal judiciary

ask permission to subpoena nadler can deny witnesses sought by republicans who are likely to want subpoenas compelling testimony from joe biden s son and the anonymous intelligence community whistleblower whose complaint triggered the impeachment proceedings the judiciary committee would be responsible for drafting any articles of impeachment for a vote by the full house the articles of impeachment are expected to mostly focus on ukraine democrats are considering an overall abuse of power article against trump which could be broken into categories like bribery or extortion the article would center on the democrats assertion based on witness testimony that trump used his office to pressure ukraine s president to investigate the bidens and the baseless theory that ukraine interfered in the 2016 election additional articles of impeachment could include obstruction of congress and obstruction of justice the latter could incorporate evidence from mueller s report house floor vote the judiciary panel could take several days to debate the articles and then vote on them if sent to the house floor the articles could immediately be called up for consideration and would be handled similarly to any other bill or resolution if articles of impeachment reach the house floor democrats would be looking to peel off republicans to make the vote bipartisan so far however it appears few if any republicans would break ranks once an impeachment vote is done democrats would appoint impeachment managers for a senate trial senate trial house democrats are hoping to be finished with an impeachment vote by christmas sending articles to the republican controlled senate for a trial in 2020 unless political dynamics change trump is expected to have the backing of majority
