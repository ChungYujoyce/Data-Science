washington tuesday night president trump will lay out his vision for 2018 in his state of the union address he will say his policies have created a stronger american economy and he will announce plans he thinks will boost growth even more joining us now for a preview marc short the white house director of legislative affairs marc welcome back to fox news sunday marc short white house director of legislative affairs chris thanks for having me back wallace what is the major theme of the president aposs state of the union address tuesday night what aposs going to be the headline what are the two or three major priorities short i think the president is going to talk about how america is back he aposs going to talk about where we are today as far as growing an economy an economy that now has grown at a 3 percent clip over the last three quarters an economy that now has the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years an economy that has the lowest unemployment rate among african americans and hispanic americans in the history of collecting data that aposs broken demographically that way i think he aposs going to talk about the fact that america is open for business and the president is also going to make an appeal to democrats to make an appeal to say we need to rebuild our country and to make an appeal that to do infrastructure we need to do it in a bipartisan way and he will also talk about american strength the fact that we are continuing to wipe out isis but that we have growing threats such as north korea and one of our concerns is that we have these dramatic threats on the global scene yet where we are in congress is we still can apost even pass the spending bill that funds our military because democrats are continuing to hold the military hostage to pursue other agenda and he will ask that it aposs time that we rebuild our military to keep america strong wallace i aposm not saying that it aposs all his fault but you talked about reaching out to democrats and a push for bipartisanship when he sends out tweets about crying chuck schumer and he bashes nancy pelosi is that the best way to do that short well look at just this week chris i think that the president made an enormous appeal and showed enormous leadership in putting forward a plan to resolve the daca situation an issue that has plagued our country for decades and yet the outcry from democrats he went further than i think many people thought he would in providing not just permanent residents but also pathway to citizenship for roughly 1 8 million of people that have been living in this country and yet so far the democrats have continued to cry that they don apost want to solve the problem we are anxious to solve the problem the question is do democrats will chuck schumer and nancy pelosi show the same leadership and protect their constituency from their radical left wing base or they could continue to play politics with this issue wallace you know let aposs drill down on immigration it aposs actually the first question i was going to ask you about let aposs put up the president aposs framework that was announced this week a path to citizenship as you said for 1 8 million people eligible for dreamer status 25 billion for a wall limiting chain migration to nuclear families in other words dreamers can apost sponsor their parents and an end to the visa lottery the blowback was fierce from both sides begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d cali house minority leader that plan is a campaign to make america white again ann coulter conservative commentator you may be able to roll over the never trumpers but if you continue down this line former trumper is going to be a much more difficult category for him end video clip wallace i mean and you aposve got to admit it it wasn apost just backlash from democrats there was also backlash from conservative hardliners what makes you think you can get a deal through congress on all of this it aposs a big ambitious plan before the daca deadline expires in march or do you think because the court has blocked the rescission of daca that you have more time than just march short well chris i aposve heard a lot of outrage over former speaker pelosi aposs comments when she makes racist allegation like that i aposve heard a lot of members even in moderate democrats say that that was over the top the reality is what the president has done is he aposs met with dozens hosted dozens of meetings at the white house some with republicans some democrats some bipartisan some just house some just senate some bicameral a lot of rational compromise plan that i think is something democrats ask for we started by saying we want to protect the 690 000 people who have permits under daca meaning people age 16 to 36 who have work permits who are in this country producing contributing to our economy we of course want to protect them we don apost want to send them away but democrats said that population should be larger we should consider those who are eligible but were afraid to apply we should also go back to 2012 which is when obama put in place his unconstitutional order the president did all of those things because he saying it aposs time that we fix the other issues too americans want to keep our border secure end chain migration and the visa lottery program wallace do you think you can get a deal by march or do you think because of the court action that you have actually more time than march 5th short chris we aposre anxious to get a deal we aposve been trying to get a deal i think that question really belongs to the democrats in congress we believe that right now you aposre right the courts have said that the march 5th is not there but if another court overrules they are not going to have the six month grace period that this president offered congress to fix it if the courts overrule that program will end immediately wallace but as i pointed out it isn apost and you are quite right there is backlash from democrats there aposs also backlash from republicans and one of the biggest issues is something that the president said this week take a look begin audio clip trump whatever they aposre doing if they do a great job i think it aposs a nice thing to have the incentive of after a period of years being able to become citizens end audio clip wallace but when president obama issued his executive order in 2012 he did not give dreamers a path to citizenship he simply said they could renew their status in a sense and this is what some conservatives are saying isn apost what you are offering the president offering isn apost it more lenient isn apost it softer in terms of what it gives dreamers that what president obama was willing to do short two points one is that we feel that is certainly worth it if we can help to fix this problem once and for all which is the other parts of the proposal the president has forward but second in that meeting that you televised at the white house when the president had 20 members of congress over he said i will provide cover from our side on this issue the question is are chuck schumer and nancy pelosi going to provide cover for their members from the radical left leaning base so far they are not showing the same leadership chris wallace so you think you can get conservatives who may not like the idea of citizenship to go along short so far we aposve had positive reinforcements from senator david perdue senator tom cotton these are not exactly doves on the immigration on the issue of immigration they are pretty hawkish on it i think conservatives recognize the benefit to really securing our border and helping to fix these long term problems so yes i think we aposre going to get widespread support on our side the question is politically it aposs not a policy issue chris policy this policy flatly polls 70 percent of american supported when you say that you are going to secure the border end chain migration and the visa lottery and provide this pathway and fix it 70 percent of americans agree it aposs not a policy issue it aposs a politics question wallace the president will also push his infrastructure plan on thursday night and here is the outline of that 200 billion in federal money to leverage at least 1 5 trillion in state and local and private investment here aposs the problem infrastructure has traditionally been an 80 20 split 80 percent federal money 20 percent state and local and private money but what you are proposing is a 20 80 split 20 percent federal money 80 percent from other sources why is that going to work short we think it aposs going to work for several reasons i think there aposs a growing some consensus that the infrastructure needs to be fixed it aposs part of the central parts of the president aposs campaign and we think that there is bipartisan support for it there aposs no doubt that i think democrats in congress will want more federal dollars for that issue but we also have to recognize chris that we have a significant debt problem in our country and so this can apost just be all federal largess that pays for this so a partnership is what makes sense the other thing that the administration has pledged to do is continue to roll back the regulatory constraints that i think has also limited some of the private investment when you do that they aposll be additional private investment coming in to make these projects real wallace i want to pick up on that because there was a report this weekend that the white house wants to scale back when you say regulations environmental regulations and critics say the effect is that in order to get these projects going you would gut the clean air act and the clean water act short the administration has no plans to gut the clean air act or the clean water act chris but what you aposve seen really over the last year is by rolling back the burdensome regulations the previous administration had put in place the economy has taken off that aposs what we want to make sure that our economy continues to grow when you see 3 percent growth over the last three quarters and compare that to eight years of 1 8 percent growth in the obama years much of that has been because of rolling back the regulatory burden and allowing the free enterprise system to begin to work again wallace for all of your plans for 2018 for all of the victory lap the president is going to take for the economy and what was accomplished in 2017 i think it aposs fair to say that there is a cloud that continues to hang over this white house and that aposs the russian investigation direct question did president trump want to fire special counsel robert mueller last summer short i aposm not aware of the president ever intimating that he wanted to fire robert mueller let aposs keep in mind a couple things robert mueller is still the special counsel don mcgahn is still head of white house counsel office taxpayers have spent millions and millions of dollars on investigations that have not proven any collusion thus far with russia the white house continues to cooperate in every manner providing any document that the special counsel has asked for so we have continued to comply fully robert mueller is still the special counsel i aposm not familiar in any conversation i aposve had with the president ever intimating he wanted to fire robert mueller wallace would the white house object if congress decided on his own to pass a bill to protect the status of the special counsel to make it harder or impossible to fire him is that something the president would sign short i don apost know hypothetically chris wallace the president responded this week to reports that the special counsel is investigating him on the issue of obstruction of justice here he is begin audio clip trump there aposs no collusion now they aposre saying oh well did he fight back fight back jon fight back oh it aposs obstruction end audio clip wallace what does the president think the difference is between obstruction and fighting back short honestly chris i don apost know unfortunately i aposm not often involved in those conversations regarding that investigation but i know that the president has been frustrated by this investigation he feels like there aposs been millions of dollars in taxpayer dollars spent and no evidence yet of collusion i think he also recognizes that you know i think it aposs been underreported is that the day before he accepted a position of special counsel robert mueller interviewed to be fbi director and never mentioned that to the president so i aposm sure there aposs concern that here was obviously he was going to be named special counsel he came in to be interviewed to be fbi director and never mention the con potential conflict there wallace finally let aposs look at this from the other side because some top republicans in congress talked about bias and corruption at the highest levels of the fbi and the justice department in their investigation both of hillary clinton and of donald trump one does the president believe that aposs true that there has been abuse that there has been bias in the investigations and two as the washington post reports today does he want to see that four page memo to that effect coming out of the house intelligence committee does he want to see that release to the public short well one we don apost know what aposs in the memo it aposs classified i haven apost seen it but i think the president generally is on the side of transparency and so yes i think he believes that that should be put out but on the first question i think that where we stand is that again there has been significant investigation so far and no evidence of any sort of collusion wallace when he hears things like the text between peter strzok and lisa page does that concern ph short sure of course that frustrates him i think something else that he aposs continually mentioned is the fact that mccabe aposs wife received 700 000 in political contributions from one of the clinton aposs close personal friends in terry mcauliffe and yet was leading the investigation into hillary clinton so yes i think he aposs concerned about several appearances of conflict of interest there at the same time he is going down to the fbi academy in quantico and spoke into the agents and talks about how much he appreciates their work in their efforts but yes i aposm sure he aposs very concerned about some of the appearances of conflict of interest at the very top of the agency in the last administration wallace i just want to button up one question about the release of the memo because the assistant attorney general sent a note to the special to the house intelligence committee saying it would be quote extraordinarily reckless to release that memo because it may reveal sources and methods is that a concern of the president short well sure i think we have to have those are rational concerns but at the same time i think the president is more inclined for transparency in this investigation and so to the extent that the house i think has advocated that it aposs publicly ph released i think the president is receptive to that wallace marc thank you thanks for your time this week and always good to talk with you and we aposll all be watching the president aposs speech on tuesday short great thanks chris thanks for having me wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to take a closer look at the president aposs agenda plus what would you like to ask the panel about the trump plan to trade citizenship for dreamers for tough new measures on legal and illegal immigration just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states the world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous america i aposm here to deliver a simple message there has never been a better term to higher to build to invest and to grow in the united states end video clip wallace president trump at the world economic forum in switzerland this week telling leaders america is open for business and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove columnist for the hill juan williams catherine lucey who covers the white house for the associated press and former republican congressman jason chaffetz well catherine you were on the davos trip with the president how was he received there and how much are they counting on the strong economic recovery the good numbers from 2017 continuing to 2018 to help republicans in the 2018 midterms catherine lucey white house reporter associated press yes so the big question going into the trip was the american first president versus the davos globalist and he was quite cordially received he had a reception he held a dinner business leaders the speech got you know a polite response and the president clearly was there to bring his economic message as he said and kind of take a victory lap he talked about the booming economy he talked about tax cut he talked about regulation changes and i think this clearly going to be part of his pitch on tuesday in the state of the union and something republicans are going to try to emphasize you know over the coming months wallace karl let aposs pick up on that when you hear what we just heard from marc short about what the president is going to say in his state of the union speech that he aposs going to take a victory lap for a strong economic numbers he aposs going to talk about infrastructure and creating jobs he aposs going to talk about immigration reform how strong a message for this year and how strong a message for republicans to run on in november karl rove former bush white house adviser well it depends on how much he says and what he says on tuesday night but it also depends on what he does in the months following that first of all i think he aposs got to be very careful about it appearing to be too self congratulatory this is a moment to compliment the american people and to compliment the congress for their cooperation with him on tax reform and regulatory relief but this is a moment where he can reset but the reset depends upon him following through in the weeks and months ahead he needs to make the case and the case can be made that people are going to feel this tax cut they are beginning to in their own lives but in february when the withholding tables kick in and everybody gets a bigger paycheck that aposs going to be the moment where he needs to be driving home not only is it affecting you in that way but it aposs affecting you in the money that aposs being pumped into the american money by american businesses to build new plants and equipment to refurbish their stores to create and build and buy new things that are going to require at the end of the line and somebody in the factory somebody in a farm somebody in a ranch to create whatever it is they need wallace so i aposm saying ph the key isn apost how it aposs going to go on tuesday night it aposs how he aposs going to do on wednesday and thursday rove sure wallace but he did great in his speech to congress last february but then he got back into tweets and needless arguments right afterwards rove and look this is also a moment of optimism look people are starting to feel optimistic about the economy this is the moment to strike that note of optimism that he missed in his inaugural address when he talked about that dark and gloomy place called america laughter wallace your boss didn apost like that bush 43 we ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook from al drennan on the president aposs new framework for immigration al writes it seems as though the president is going against many in his own party to extend the olive branch to appease democrats and strike a deal how is it possible for all democrats in the house and senate to not be jumping all over this proposal congressman chaffetz how do you answer al and the concern from some conservatives that the president is giving away too much to the dreamers when he gives them a path to citizenship which is again more than barack obama did jason chaffetz r utah former u s congressman yes viva trump i mean i think a lot of people are very surprised particularly in conservative circles that he added a component that allows that pathway to citizenship i don apost like that component but it really puts the democrats in a box and for nancy pelosi to go out and try to claim that this is some sort of racist plan i i don apost know that the democrats can actually say yes to anything and this is something they are really going to have to contemplate and when you have people like senator perdue as marc short pointed out and you have senator cotton in particular saying this is a good solid framework wallace yes we just pointed out two republican really strong hardliners on immigration issues chaffetz yes no it puts the ball squarely back in the democrats apos court and we will see if they can pass it out of the senate i don apost know that i can pass in the house quite as smoothly but if all the democrats get behind it in the house that i think there are enough in the house on the republican side of the aisle that they could actually pass this wallace on the other hand you talk about the democrats they are saying that the president is caving to the right wing of his party take a look begin video clip sen chuck schumer d ny senate minority leader the white house unfortunately has proven unreliable and wildly unpredictable within the course of hours they say different things every time the president moves forward on one thing his staff pulls him back and undoes what he says end video clip wallace but juan isn apost citizenship for 2 million not only dreamers but people eligible for dreamer status who hadn apost signed up yet isn apost that a huge concession juan williams fox news political analyst yes that would be terrific i mean the first point to say is it aposs run into position as you pointed out your interview with marc short from people like ted cruz the senator who is hardliner said gosh daca didn apost have a pathway to citizenship then you have right wing media like breitbart calling the president amnesty don heritage saying this is a nonstarter why are they saying this chris because in addition to providing a pathway he goes after legal immigration severe cuts in terms of legal immigration attacks the idea of a diversity lottery says that wrong so therefore he aposs also opposed to family reunification which had been the premise for our immigration policies in the past and when you think about this this is not comprehensive reform this is not dealing with the 11 million that are already here so this is the president aposs presentation at a moment when the democrats are saying 25 billion you just got a huge tax cut now you want to 25 billion for a wall that essentially is symbolic wallace so are using the democrats i mean on the other hand 2 million people in this country illegally even the dreamers as sympathetic as they are are in the country illegally you are saying democrats shouldn apost jump on this deal williams i don apost why would you jump look the president set a phony deadline this march thing he aposs the one that try to undo daca and he said this is going to be a bargaining chip in exchange for this i aposm going to demand concessions i want my wall ok the democrats are willing to give added money for security on the border the thing is are you willing to give 25 billion are you willing not to address comprehensive immigration meanwhile the real pressure and the president has said this he aposs going to have to take heat from his right from the conservative media from heritage from the freedom caucus in the house will paul ryan even call this wallace congressman williams because i think to your point paul ryan called that he has enough votes from democrats to get it passed chaffetz they could potentially get it passed but the reason i think the democrats are fighting so hard against the wall is the wall will actually work and williams we are at a 45 year low in terms of crossings congressman chaffetz yes and we aposve got still a long ways to go and i there is no way that you can give the pathway to citizenship to dreamers if you don apost also solve the nightmare that is down on the border and to secure and locked down that border is a fair compromise williams i think we have chaffetz i don apost like the amnesty part i don apost know that i could vote for that williams well that aposs the real issue here will paul ryan wallace well there aposs two issues there is the right wing of the republican party there is also the left wing of the democratic party let me just for a final word go to you karl because you broke your lamps ph on immigration reform in the bush 43 white house do they get a deal by march 5th or not rove well first of all they don apost need to because the court as you pointed out in your interview with marc short has basically put this all on hold but could they get a deal by march yes this is a good opening framework and let aposs be clear about it the president has gone a long way with giving a path to citizenship to the dreamers but it aposs already being distorted on the other side this is not 25 billion for a wall it aposs 25 billion for a wall additional agents technology and infrastructure along the border it aposs not just a wall it aposs all these other kind of things that had been talked about in order to secure the border yes crossings are down but we still don apost have secure control of our border one thing that juan touched on that was absolutely right the democrats particularly the congressional black caucus are going to fight hard to defend the diversity lottery because lotteries are weird but diversity means we draw people from countries that don apost normally flow in to the normal immigration flow largely african countries wallace yes or no they aposre going to get a deal or not rove i you know i think this all depends upon the goodwill of people on both sides the president doesn apost help by tweeting about schumer but schumer doesn apost help by going to the floor and nancy pelosi aposs comment was so over the top i aposm for immigration reform i am in favor of robust immigration but everybody who is adult ought to start acting like an adult in this conversation wallace well that sounds like a definite no to me laughter wallace goodwill if we are depending on goodwill we are in real trouble panel i aposll have to take a break here we aposll see you a little later up next president trump dismisses reports he wanted to fire special counsel robert mueller and has the fbi tried to protect hillary clinton and get donald trump house oversight committee trey gowdy joins us next commercial break wallace coming up has the fbi been against donald trump even before he became president begin video clip rep trey gowdy r south carolina i saw today it was a text about not keeping texts we saw more manifest bias against president trump all the way through the election and to the transition end video clip wallace we aposll ask house oversight chair trey gowdy about alleged abuses next commercial break wallace there have been two competing narratives in the russia probe this week first that president trump is getting closer to an interview with special counsel robert mueller amid reports he wanted to fire mueller last summer and second that the fbi has been biased all along for hillary clinton and against donald trump joining me now from greenville south carolina congressman trey gowdy house oversight chair and a member of the house intelligence committee congressman we aposll get to your concerns about the fbi and the department of justice in a moment but but let me begin first with this do you still trust after all you aposve heard do you still trust special counsel robert mueller to conduct a fair and unbiased investigation rep trey gowdy r sc oversight committee chairman one hundred percent particularly if he aposs given the time the resources and the independence to do his job chris he didn apost apply for the job he aposs where he is because we have an attorney general who had to recuse himself so mueller didn apost raise his hand and say hey pick me we as a country asked him to do this and by the way he aposs got two there are two components to his jurisdiction there is a criminal component but there aposs also a counterintelligence component that no one ever talks about because it aposs not sexy and interesting but he aposs also going to tell us definitively what russia tried to do in 2016 so the last time you and i were together i told my republican colleagues leave him the hell alone and that aposs still my advice wallace president trump said this week that he wants to sit down with mueller and conduct an interview here aposs the president begin video clip question are you going to talk to mueller trump i aposm looking forward to it actually question do you have a day set trump i don apost know no i guess they aposre talking about two or three weeks but i would love to do it cross talk trump you know again it aposs i have to say subject to my lawyers and all of that but i would love to do it end video clip wallace as a practical matter does the president have any choice doesn apost he really in effect have to sit down with a special counsel for an interview and let me ask you this as a former federal prosecutor when he does that interview how dangerous is that legally for the president gowdy well i don apost know what he aposs going to say and i don apost know what he knows so i can apost address how dangerous it is if there aposs no collusion and if there aposs no obstruction of justice there aposs not much danger there are two aspects to this chris there aposs the legal aspect and the former prosecutor in me wants him to testify because he is uniquely well situated to answer certain questions the conversations between he and comey there are only two people in those conversations we aposve already heard director comey aposs side of it if there aposs another side we need to hear it that aposs the legal part so i wanted him to testify from a legal standpoint but let aposs don apost kid ourselves there is a political component to it twice now over 50 of my house democratic colleagues have voted to move forward with impeachment twice before he aposs answered a single solitary question from bob mueller over 50 twice and said he should be impeached and that aposs without answering a single question adam schiff who aposs the ranking member on the intelligence committee said he had evidence of collusion before we even began the investigation so the politics of it is i don apost think he aposs got a fair jury i do think he has a fair investigator i think he aposs got a fair prosecutor in bob mueller but he doesn apost have a fair jury and he aposs going to have to decide whether the legal part outweighs the political part wallace the house intelligence committee is expected to vote this week on whether to release that four page memo that you had a big hand in writing that alleges abuse and bias inside the fbi and the justice department as i discussed with marc short the washington post reports today the president wants to have the memo released do you agree with that gowdy i do i aposm sorry that we aposre to this point this memo is nothing but a a the distilling the reducing of thousands of pages of documents provided to us by the department and the bureau so there aposs nothing in this memo that the department is not already aware of if you think your viewers want to know whether or not the dossier was used in court proceedings whether or not it was vetted before it was used whether or not it aposs ever been vetted if you are interested in who paid for the dossier if you aposre interested in christopher steele aposs relationship with hillary clinton and the democratic national committee then yes you aposll want the memo to come out if you aposre adam schiff who is consistently wrong when it comes to issues of disclosure he didn apost want us to find out any of this information chris he he fought in fact gps went to court fusion gps went to court to keep us from finding out that the democrats paid for the dossier so if you aposre adam schiff of course you don apost want the information to come out you didn apost want us to find it in the first place this memo answers what i think are really legitimate questions and i do think the fbi should look at it before before it is released and i have provided that counsel to chairman nunes and i think that he has taken that under advisement so i want to play face off poker i want the bureau to know everything that aposs in the memo i think you aposll be surprised it is not a hit piece on the department and the fbi i would not have participated in it if that aposs what it was wallace but let me let me let me pick up on this because the reports are and you kind of indicated that in your answer that the memo centers on this question of the fisa application the department of justice fbi application in 2016 for a warrant to conduct electronic surveillance against this fellow then trump campaign manager carter page your complaint according to reports is that you say that when they made that application they didn apost talk about the role of the russia dossier and especially the fact that it was opposition research paid for by the clinton campaign the democrats and yes adam schiff is leading a charge say you aposre cherry picking the information one that that the fisa warrant on carter page is not as central as you aposre making it and two that there was a lot more in the application than just the dossier that the fbi did not rely just on the dossier to get the warrant gowdy well i can apost even confirm for you that there is a fisa warrant and i can apost confirm for you who it aposs on because that is classified and i aposm not going to disseminate classified information i will just ask you again are you interested in whether or not the world aposs premier law enforcement agency relied on a work product produced paid for by the democratic national committee are you interested in whether or not all wallace but but but i guess the question the question i aposm just asking is this sir and and yes i can understand you aposre not going to confirm it but we aposre talking about the fisa warrant of carter page did they rely just on the dossier or did they rely on a lot of other material gowdy well for me to answer the question is confirmation that there is one i will let me ask you this chris if they relied on it half is that significant enough for the american people to know if they aposre relied on it at all do you want to know that if you aposre the judge do you want to know if a third of what you aposre providing to the court was paid for by a political opponent so whether they whether it was relied upon 80 percent or 20 percent do you want to know that the democratic national committee paid for material that was never vetted that was included in the court proceeding do you want to know whether or not the primary source in these court proceedings had a bias against one candidate do you want to know whether or not he said he aposd do anything to keep that candidate from becoming elected president wallace i want to i want to i want to and i don apost mean to interrupt sir but i aposve got two more questions i want to get to and we aposre running out of time because i want to address those texts between lisa page and peter strzok who were two key figures in both the clinton and trump investigations in february of 2016 during the clinton e mail probe page sends this text one more thing she clinton might be our next president the last thing you need us going in there loaded for bear you think she aposs going to remember or care that it was more doj department of justice than fbi strzok responds agreed i called bill and relayed what we discussed he agrees i will e mail you and redacted same the real question i have is that there aposs no question that is a deeply troubling political bias expressed by two fbi officials i guess the question i have is did strzok and page have the power to protect clinton on the one hand and to get trump on the other gowdy well they they did they have the power to protect her the decision not to charger her was made before she was ever interviewed how would you like that deal chris i mean how how would you like to go wallace no i aposd like that deal gowdy yes wallace but i guess the question is was that just peter strzok or was that a lot of other people who weren apost party to these clearly biased and outrageous texts gowdy well i think what you aposll see and and one reason the judiciary committee and oversight is investigating is there was tension between the department of justice and the fbi but peter struck was the lead investigator that aposs who interviewed hillary clinton so these same two people whose bias was so insidious that bob mueller fired them the second he found out about it there bias existed the entire time these same two people who were so biased they should be kicked to the curb immediately were the ones interviewing hillary clinton editing the memo to take out references to president obama editing the memo to take out the reference to grossly negligent so i wallace right gowdy no i can apost prove to you that they were the final decision makers nor do i have to what i have to prove to you is two really important people hated him would have done anything to protect her and thank god michael horowitz found out about them while they were investigating the president wallace i want to ask you one last question we aposre running out of time here there aposs clearly some troubling evidence and clearly the strzok page memos are deeply troubling and you know go to it and investigating that there are also have been some issues of potential hype by republicans and i want to give you an example this week senator ron johnson brought up the issue of a secret society inside the justice department here he is begin video clip ron johnson r wisconsin senator what this is all about is further evidence of corruption more than bias but corruption at the highest levels of the fbi in that secret society end video clip wallace but then we saw the only text on this that page wrote to strzok the day after the election are you even going to give out your calendars he had apparently bought russian calendars as a gag it seems kind of depressing maybe it should just be the first meeting of the secret society which led to this exchange begin video clip question this text message seems to be the comment about secret society was in jest do you agree that it appears to be in was in jest johnson it aposs a real possibility end video clip wallace question congressman final question i aposm going to have to ask you to answer briefly don apost republicans hurt their credibility on real issues of bias when they make such a big deal about secret societies and palace coups gowdy yes republicans are the best i aposve ever seen at taking good facts and overstating them and therefore changing the narrative i don apost know what they meant by secret society i didn apost use the phrase it is fair to ask them but if it were a joke chris then was it also a joke to mention the insurance policy was it also a joke to talk about impeachment the morning after president trump won was it also a joke to say i have no interest in participating in an investigation if he aposs going to be cleared there aposs a pattern and republicans are better served by letting the texts speak for themselves i have no idea what they meant by that i don apost know if it was a joke or not it aposs not my job to figure it out these two witnesses need to come in and tell us what they meant by it and everything else they said over the course of 18 months republicans would be well served let the texts speak for themselves let the jury make up their mind and quit engaging in hyperbole which we seem to do a lot wallace and we look forward to the investigation continuing there are a lot of legitimate issues here congressman gowdy thank you thanks for sharing your weekend with us we aposll follow all the developments this weekend and in the future gowdy yes sir thank you wallace coming up the special counsel gets closer to an interview with the president while questions grow about bias inside the fbi the panel returns next commercial break begin video clip rep mark meadows r nc freedom caucus chairman i am shocked to read exactly what has taken place i would think that it would never happen in a country that loves freedom and democracy like this country chuck schumer d ny senate minority leader conspiracy theories with virtually no fact paranoia delusion why are they afraid of the truth of the mueller investigation end video clip wallace house freedom caucus chair mark meadows and senate democratic leader chuck schumer at odds over allegations of bias inside the fbi and the justice department and we aposre back now with the panel well congressman you were the former head of the committee that trey gowdy now chairs how convinced are you that there was bias inside both the clinton and the trump investigations chaffetz r utah well based on the surface what we aposve seen so far there is clearly bias but remember they hillary clinton investigation is a closed investigation we should be looking at that that aposs what we do as a country we are self critical we do go after these things i think the most definitive report though will be what michael horowitz the inspector general for the department of justice that report will probably come out of the next 60 days an obama appointee with 450 employees i think when he comes and testifies before the oversight committee that will be the most definitive word wallace juan you have to admit that some of the strzok page texts that we aposve been reading over the last few weeks are troubling especially when peter strzok was the lead fbi investigator both in the clinton case and in the trump case williams come on chris they people have personal opinions you and i have personal opinions i think we come out here and try to do an honest job wallace wait wait you aposre not at all troubled by those texts williams well first of all no be remember they aposre lovers so this is like pillow talk between two people who have personal opinions i don apost know that it has impacted their capacity to lead at investigation what i see here is a repeated effort coming from the right they throw spitballs at the wall trying to somehow disparage the fbi discredit robert mueller don apost forget they aposre wallace how how about when peter strzok williams trump trump not only tried wallace how about when peter strzok williams has fired comey wallace well wait williams gone after these people wallace ok i aposm not talking about that how about when peter williams now this week he aposs trying to fire mueller wallace how about when peter strzok and lisa page are saying well let aposs not go into that clinton investigation loaded for bear williams well wait a second they aposre talking it aposs like you and me joking saying hey chris president trump we wish would come on and on this show and then wallace i aposm not joking i aposm serious williams i know i know but i aposm saying we wish but i aposm saying and i say chris well you know what if you want him to come back maybe we shouldn apost ravage him this time that aposs a joke between juan and chris that aposs not an indication of how you aposre actually going to conduct the interview but this is again discredit the fbi because they aposre worried that mueller in fact it aposs going to find something that aposs what aposs going on chaffetz he started to draft the memo before they aposd interviewed 16 people williams there was no basis at that point to charge her so they go into the interview and they say well this is what we know at this point but you guys want to make it into some paranoid i mean i got to chaffetz trey gowdy was crystal clear about his feelings wallace all right rove if those e mails had been referencing defending donald trump in the same way that they were defending hillary clinton if the roles were reversed juan would be rational and reasonable and understanding exactly what is at play here look robert mueller let the test of this is the day that robert mueller found out about these e mails and read them he fired strzok he did williams yes rove he couldn apost he couldn apost fire him from the fbi but he could demote him and sent him to human resources to end his career that aposs how bad this was now i don apost think it aposs the fbi but i do think two bad actors in this and i agree with the congressman when horowitz aposs report comes out wallace and again this is the inspector general rove the inspector general wallace an independent person in the justice department rove independent general independent official with the with powers to subpoena and powers to observe and interrogate and we aposre going to be as a nation shocked at the behavior of these two individuals not the fbi let aposs be clear about that but these two individuals wallace catherine meanwhile the president in comments just before he went to davos left the door wide open to sitting down for an interview with special counsel robert mueller how upset were his lawyers that he gave away a lot of negotiating power and in the end though do they really think they have any choice that he aposs going to just both politically and legally have to sit down and and talk to the special counsel lucey well certainly the white house tried to walk it back a little bit after he said he aposd love to do this but yes he he could refuse a voluntary interview that aposs something he could do but ultimately to your point mueller has subpoena power so he could use that wallace and lucey and wallace and we should point out if he subpoena aposs him lucey then he wallace then he testifies before the grand jury lucey absolutely and wallace and he doesn apost have lawyers alongside of him lucey and and could prompt you know a legal fight which seems not helpful so yes i think what we aposre looking at right now is the president has made his intentions quite clear what aposs not clear is what the scope of his questioning might be what the setting will be how exactly this might come together wallace congressman chaffetz how much legal jeopardy for the president when he sits down in this interview given the fact that he has told different stories about why he fired comey questions about you know when when he kicked everybody else out of the room did he tell him to go easy on mike flynn or not i mean it would strike me chaffetz look wallace this is kind of tension city chaffetz well it aposs fraught with peril but you don apost know exactly what the president aposs going to say or what sort of evidence they might present to him that may be a year or two old but i think his temperament is such that yes bring it on he aposs been very definitive that there was no collusion and i think he aposll stand by that williams i just worry that he you know this week it came out that he aposs asking his deputy fbi director who aposd you vote for and it also comes out this week that we have been misled as an american people about his interest in firing mueller almost a year ago i think this guy thinks there aposs something to hide that aposs what he aposs trying to obstruct this investigation chaffetz democrats take took that point before he was even sworn in they got to pick their battles they scream about everything and i don apost think they have a case with this wallace thank you panel see you next sunday to be continued up next our power player of the week how one american soldier kept his promise to the combat translator who saved his life commercial break wallace we aposre still arguing about the texts during our long wars in iraq and afghanistan we aposve heard a lot about the bonds among american soldiers but there aposs another special bond between u s forces and their local combat translators here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape matt zeller co founder no one left behind i wouldn apost be sitting here talking to you today if it hadn apost been for my afghan translator wallace voice over in 2008 matt zeller was on his fourth day serving in afghanistan when he was knocked out by a taliban mortar as he came to an afghan translator rushed to his rescue unidentified male when i focused there were two taliban crawling in the bushes zeller he decided at that moment to run across the battlefield knock me down and shoot them at the same time killing them instantly and saving my life wallace zeller promised janis shinwari he would help if the translator ever wanted to come to the u s months later shinwari called janis shinwari co founder no one left behind i found out that my name was added to the taliban kill list and they were trying to hunt me down or one of my member family zeller and i said sure thinking it might take six months maybe a year at the most and it ended up taking four years wallace out of that experience zeller started no one left behind a group devoted to saving afghan and iraqi translators who have risked their lives protecting american soldiers zeller if we don apost keep that promise that prevailing narrative around the world i feel will be that the u s will simply abandon you if you choose to partner with us wallace started in 2013 nolb first helps translators and their families get special immigration visas going through a rigorous background check zeller the average time it takes to get through the security screening is three and a half years wallace once they arrive the group which now has chapters in ten cities meets them at the airport finds them housing and helps them get a job unidentified male thank you very much for your donation wallace aj was a translator for american forces in afghanistan for nine years including a visit by then defense secretary robert gates he talks about how helpless you feel coming to a strange country unidentified male there aposs no one to help them no one to welcome them and they don apost know what to do everything in the country is different wallace starbucks and lyft ph partner with nolb four years later shinwari has a steady job and owns his home since 2013 zeller aposs group has helped 5 000 translators and family members come to the u s but he says more than 50 000 more are trapped wallace on camera for those folks that are still waiting in afghanistan and iraq is this a matter of life and death zeller this is absolutely a matter of life and death if we don apost keep this promise the people that we ask them to help us fight against going to murder them wallace voice over zeller says whether we keep faith with combat translators will send a message will this country protect or abandon people who help us in future conflicts zeller if janis had not believed that we would have kept our promise he wouldn apost have served with us and i wouldn apost be sitting here talking to you today i aposve got pts and as far as i aposm concerned helping my brother come home and start his new life in america was the most healing thing i aposve ever done unidentified male thanks brother wallace to learn more
