i watch election results to gauge whether america has become freer or more tyrannical it s hard to know whether tuesday s results will make much difference often individual liberty erodes in ways that neither major political party much cares about last weekend i suffered through the new york marathon i suffered not because i ran 26 2 miles but because i live near central park and at marathon time officials turn my neighborhood into a little police state four thousand police officers 20 boats and four blimps guarded the marathon barricades bomb sniffing dogs and surveillance cameras were everywhere this is new marathons used to be fun people friendly events athletes and spectators mingled freely no more new york s authorities now treat marathon spectators as annoyances if not threats even runners must pass through magnetometers before they may race this happened of course because of the horrible bombing in boston that shut down parts of boston for nine days but other countries response to terrorism is less extreme fifty two people were killed in the london underground bombing of 2005 by 4 p m that same day bus service resumed in my neighborhood concrete blocks and parked garbage trucks manned by a union driver prevent civilian vehicles from entering or leaving in case terrorists drive a car over central park s wall and then through the trees to kill runners we were allowed to walkhome but only if we showed id s that proved we lived on that street the ground was covered in litter since authorities remove every trash can lest a terrorist hide a bomb in one i can t imagine what all this costs police barricades are everywhere these days if you want to watch the fourth of july fireworks in new york city you may no longer just gather with friends and have a picnic police herd spectators into barricaded pens and if people try to climb out to use a bathroom cops yell stop once you re in you re in i doubt that such security theater makes us safer if terrorists want to make a statement they will find other locations government always grows police departments are no exception the incentive is always do more politicians reason if anything goes wrong i ll be blamed someone else pays for prevention though so i ll take every precaution i once asked new york city s police commissioner if there was now too much security he replied people want tofeel safe yes most people will give up liberty for security but when we change society this way we let the terrorists win that s one reason i fight with ann coulter she wrote if you are considering voting for the libertarian candidate in any senate election please send me your name and address so i can track you down and drown you because nothing matters more to the country than republicans taking a majority in the senate that mindset distracts us from defending something far more important than either party individual liberty neither republicans nor democrats consistently protect it when i told coulter that i often vote libertarian she replied influence the republican party do not be the spoiler to hand the government over to democrats who i promise do not share a single principle with you democrats do want government control of the economy and more regulation of speech innovation medicine school and all kinds of things that ought to be fun but i feel threatened by republicans too some want to control our personal lives and fight constant wars abroad i don t want government to regulate every inch of my life that s why i m a libertarian most republicans and democrats don t love liberty enough to remove those barricades near central park or countless other impediments to doing what we want they impose a million boring bureaucratic intrusions on daily life it s time america obsessed less about republicans vs democrats and more about liberty in all its forms still i m delighted that republicans won the senate yesterday finally taking power from the destructive harry reid they did didn t they please tell me they did alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
