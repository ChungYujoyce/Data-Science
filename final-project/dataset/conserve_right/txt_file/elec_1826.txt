our friends over at hot air have conducted a 2016 republican primary poll and the results are instructive if not earth shattering and yet you re probably wondering to yourselves why the hell is he blogging about this i ll tell you why because polls such as these survey a specific kind of audience that is to say i suspect most people who regularly read hot air and care enough to participate in their surveys represent the base of the party they strike me as informed conservative republicans who can give us greater insight into who the most popular and likable conservative candidates are right now heading into 2016 indeed most 2016 public opinion polls survey likely republicans voters or registered voters not necessarily conservatives this survey therefore is something worth flagging so there you have it of the more than 1 000 readers who participated in the survey almost half would support gov scott walker 48 percent if the general election were held today sens ted cruz 28 percent and marco rubio 6 percent finished in second and third place respectively jeb bush however did not fare nearly as well as he might have hoped he garnered only 16 total votes so without trying to read too much into this poll perhaps we can definitively say jeb bush may be a top tier candidate overall but no thanks to conservatives grassroots support for him is lukewarm at best alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
