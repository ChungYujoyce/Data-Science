tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn the news media proved that its annoyance with president trump is alive and well following robert mueller s eight minute finale wednesday the trajectory of the news coverage was predictable journalists revisited what they already knew about mr mueller s investigation into russian collusion suggestive speculation followed most news organizations emphasized that mr mueller refused to exonerate mr trump in the matter mueller in first comments on russia inquiry declines to clear trump noted a new york times headline which was typical journalists also suggested congress fire up impeachment proceedings a notion immediately supported by lawmakers with intense interest in the process top stories democratic clerk charged with

impeachment proceedings immediately tweeted sen cory a booker a new jersey democrat who is running for president broadcasters joined the fray networks obsess over mueller asking congress to impeach trump writes kristine marsh a newsbusters org analyst who parsed the coverage on abc nbc and cbs following mr mueller s brief appearance which did not include questions from journalists all three networks broke in with live coverage demanding that it was now the democrats chance to impeach trump abc was the most heavy handed in their coverage with anchor george stephanopoulos bringing up the impeachment topic at least eight times in a 13 minute segment impeachment was mentioned in at least five more instances beyond that by the abc team ms marsh said noting that the coverage got more forceful minute by minute nbc went after hidden implications with hopes that congress picks up the mantle of impeachment the analyst said i m surprised the journalists who were denied the opportunity to ask questions didn t give mueller a standing ovation when he left the podium talk radio kingpin rush limbaugh told his 14 million listeners perceptions differ however matt gertz senior fellow at media matters for america a progressive watchdog blames the trump administration for putting a dishonest spin on the mueller report it has been more unnerving to watch the mainstream press grapple unsuccessfully with mueller s actual conclusions and let the trump administration s spin set the narrative mr gertz wrote in his analysis adding that mueller s statement is an indictment of a press that focused more on what people had to say about the report than what the report said mr scalise has advice it is well past time for democrats to move on from this madness speaker nancy pelosi and her caucus need to accept the results of the 2016 election admit there was no collusion and recognize that russia s election meddling happened under president obama s watch republicans are committed to improving the lives of the american people i invite democrats to join us and focus on the issues their constituents sent them to congress to address house minority whip steve scalise louisiana republican mrs sanders clears the air if bob mueller had thought there was wrongdoing and was sure of it he would have had a moral obligation to say that he didn t in fact he did the opposite he concluded that there was no collusion there was no conspiracy and left the determination about obstruction up to the attorney general because he couldn t find enough to make that determination himself the attorney and the deputy attorney general and other senior members of the department of justice made that determination confirmed there was no obstruction and the case was closed and it s time to
