gathering of global elites in the swiss alps the president on jan 22 played down the threat posed by the respiratory virus from china which had just reached american shores in the form of a solitary patient in washington state we have it totally under control trump said on cnbc it s one person coming in from china and we have it under control it s going to be just fine top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens in the 11 weeks since that interview the coronavirus has reached every corner of the globe it has infected more than 500 000 americans and killed at least 20 000 it has rewritten the rules of society isolated people in their homes closed schools devastated the economy and put millions out of work when trump spoke in switzerland weeks worth of warning signs already had been raised in the ensuing month before the president first addressed the crisis from the white house key steps to prepare the nation for the coming pandemic were not taken life saving medical equipment was not stockpiled travel largely continued unabated vital public health data from china was not provided or was deemed untrustworthy a white house riven by rivalries and turnover was slow to act urgent warnings were ignored by a president consumed by his impeachment trial and intent on protecting a robust economy that he viewed as central to his reelection chances twenty current and former administration officials and republicans close to the white house were interviewed for this account about the critical weeks lost before the president spoke to the nation on feb 26 most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions mysterious pneumonia on new year s eve china informed the world health organization of a mysterious pneumonia outbreak spreading through wuhan an industrial city of 11 million the government closed a seafood market at the center of the outbreak moved all patients with the virus to a specially designated hospital and collected test samples to send to government laboratories doctors were told to stay quiet one who issued a warning online was punished he later died of the virus the pentagon first learned about the new coronavirus in december from open source reports emanating from china by early january warnings about the virus had made their way into intelligence reports circulating around the government on jan 3 the head of the u s centers for disease control and prevention robert redfield received a call from his chinese counterpart with an official warning dr anthony fauci the government s top infectious disease expert was alerted to the virus around the same time and within two weeks was fearful it could bring global catastrophe quickly u s intelligence and public health officials began doubting china s reported rates of infection and death toll they pressed china to allow in u s epidemiologists both to assist the country in confronting the spread and to gain valuable insights that could help buy time for the u s response u s officials also pressed china to send samples of the virus to u s labs for study and for vaccine and test development on jan 11 china shared the virus genetic sequence that same day the national institutes of health started working on a vaccine ultimately the u s was able to get china s consent to send two people on the who team that traveled to china later in the month but by then precious weeks had been lost and the virus had raced across asia and had begun to escape the continent balancing act for much of january administration officials were doing a delicate balancing act internally they were raising alarms about the need to get americans on the ground in china publicly they were sending words of encouragement and praise in hopes beijing would grant the americans access matthew pottinger trump s deputy national security adviser persistently urged more aggressive action in calling out china and sending teams there but while word of the virus was included in several of the president s intelligence briefings trump wasn t fully briefed on the threat until health and human services secretary alex azar called with an update on jan 18 while the president was at his private mar a lago club in florida trump spent much of the conversation wanting to talk about vaping he was considering a new policy restricting its use white house officials now believe trump didn t fully grasp the magnitude of the threat to the u s in part because azar who was feuding with several members of trump s inner circle did a poor job communicating it azar was trying to walk a fine line between trump s upbeat statements and preparing the government for what might lie ahead america s risk is low at the moment he later told house lawmakers that could change quickly moreover the president was in the middle of his senate impeachment trial and focused on little else punctuating nearly every white house meeting with complaints about the democrats out to get him grievances he would continue late into the night on the phone from his private quarters trump also had little desire to pressure beijing or criticize its president xi jinping with whom he wanted to secure cooperation on ending a yearlong trade war before the reelection campaign kicked into high gear when trump fielded his first question about the virus in davos he enthusiastically praised xi s response going well beyond the calibrated risk reward messaging his aides were encouraging infighting the west wing was adrift by late january acting chief of staff mick mulvaney held the post in name only as rumors swirled of his impending post impeachment departure he was on the initial coronavirus task force which was plagued with infighting at the same time the white house office of management and budget was clashing with azar s hhs over money to combat the virus hhs wanted to send a special coronavirus funding request to congress but the white house budget office resisted for weeks insisting that hhs should instead repurpose 250 million of its existing budget to bolster the national stockpile by buying protective equipment hhs however claimed that without congressional authorization it could not buy the needed quantities of masks gowns and ventilators to rapidly bolster the national stockpile eventually an initial request went to congress for 2 5 billion in virus aid an amount that lawmakers of both parties dismissed as too low the bill that congress quickly passed and trump signed the first of three so far was for 8 billion even as the two agencies fought there was no influential voice in trump s orbit pushing him to act swiftly on the pandemic trump had surrounded himself with loyalists and few in the administration including national security adviser robert o brien were able to redirect the president s attention in mid january meetings were being held at the white house but the focus was on getting u s government employees back from china which was still playing down how contagious the virus was a jan 29 memo from senior white house aide peter navarro accurately predicted some of the challenges faced by the u s from what would become a pandemic though he was hardly the first to sound the alarm but he like pottinger was viewed by others in the white house as a china hawk and their concerns were rejected by others in the administration who did not bring them to the president on jan 30 the who declared the virus a global health emergency while trump held a packed campaign rally in iowa the next day the trump administration banned admittance to the united states by foreign nationals who had traveled to china in the past 14 days excluding the immediate family members of american citizens or permanent residents trump styled it as bold action but continued to talk down the severity of the threat despite the ban nearly 40 000 people have arrived in the united states on direct flights from china since that date according to an analysis by the new york times the white house denied that it was slow to act while the media and democrats refused to seriously acknowledge this virus in january and february said spokesman judd deere president trump took bold action to protect americans and unleash the full power of the federal government to curb the spread of the virus expand testing capacities and expedite vaccine development when we had no true idea the level of transmission or asymptomatic spread very very ready on feb 10 trump stood before thousands of supporters packed into a new hampshire rally and declared by april you know in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away the crowd roared its approval at trump s unproven assertion the senate had acquitted trump on the impeachment charges and the president shifted his focus toward reelection even as others in the administration keyed in on the virus federal officials put the cdc solely in charge of developing a test for the virus and left out private interests a choice that cost precious time when the resulting cdc test proved faulty trump spent many weeks shuffling responsibility for leading his administration s response to the crisis he put azar in charge of the administration s virus task force before replacing him with vice president mike pence toward the end of february even as the virus spread across the globe prevailing voices in the white house including senior adviser jared kushner and treasury secretary steven mnuchin urged the president to avoid big steps that could roil financial markets the president had firmly linked his fate to wall street and it took a tumble by the markets for trump to ratchet up his response in late february while trump was on a trip to india the dow jones plummeted 1 000 points amid rising fears about the coronavirus trump stewed about the collapse on his feb 26 flight back to washington and lashed out at aides over comments made by a top cdc official dr nancy messonnier during a briefing the prior day when she warned americans that they would have to prepare for fairly severe social distancing it s not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen she said the white house announced that pence would brief the media about the response that night but trump took the podium instead and has not relinquished the stage much since belatedly making himself the face of the battle against the virus when trump first took the lectern in the white house briefing room to speak about the virus the u s had 15 coronavirus patients we re at that very low level and we want to keep it that way trump said we re very very ready for this lemire reported from new york
