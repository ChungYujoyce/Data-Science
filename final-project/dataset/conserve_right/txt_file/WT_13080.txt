apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic los angeles ap there s a new breach in china s great cultural wall and hollywood is cautiously moving in disney s announcement monday that it will make iron man 3 in partnership with a chinese company is the latest sign that movie studios are warming to china s new openness for decades china has capped the number of foreign films it allows into the country until recently the limit was 20 but in february chinese officials announced that they are increasing the quota to 34 top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century china said it will also allow foreign studios to garner a greater share of box office revenue foreign companies can now expect to earn 25 percent of their movies ticket sales in china up from between 13 5 and 17 5 percent the changes are a significant move for a bureaucracy that is leery of outside cultural influences and competition from foreign films the change could affect everyone from action movie fans in guangzhou to hollywood s most powerful filmmakers the relaxing of china s strict rules comes at a price for u s studios the world s most populous nation wants foreign studios to bring their moviemaking know how to china by forming joint ventures with chinese studios still hollywood isn t gushing in recent years u s movie studios have developed a rocky romance with china chinese people adore foreign movies especially 3 d adventures like avatar or more recently journey 2 the mysterious island but studios have been jilted when beijing has promised new openness only to reverse course in disney s case many of its movies have made it into the country but recent hit tangled for instance was stopped at the border in a recent interview dreamworks animation skg inc ceo jeffrey katzenberg summed up the industry s attitude the goal lines are moving all the time he said everyone is wondering how it plays out china has long kept up a barrier against foreign films wary of insidious cultural influences while sheltering its own filmmakers officials last raised the annual cap on foreign movie imports as a condition of joining the wto in 2001 the recent increased foreign movie quota is a belated response to a trade dispute the u s won nearly three years ago studios are patiently trying to make the relationship work because of china s enormous potential box office revenue in china rose more than a third last year to 2 billion putting the country on pace to become the world s second largest movie market after the combined u s and canadian region this year it is expected to top 5 billion by 2015 the u s and canadian theatrical market meanwhile shrank two years in a row to about 10 billion in 2011 so far this year however revenue at u s and canadian theaters is up about 19 percent it s only a matter of time before china s movie going market is the world s biggest according to some industry watchers whether it is the most profitable for outsiders is another question in 2006 warner bros pulled out of a two year old theater chain joint venture when beijing changed the rules suddenly disallowing the studio s majority stake late last year production company legendary pictures joint venture which is set to make the movie the great wall hit a stumbling block when its hong kong based partner failed to raise enough capital entertainment lawyer schuyler moore says he has warned clients not to be overly optimistic in dealing with the country and says it will take a year to see how china implements its new movie policy moore believes china s new openness is aimed mainly at boosting its own cultural industries in the long term it s no different than china trying to make aircraft and cars and everything else their goal is to have the expertise so they can displace hollywood he says against that backdrop companies like the walt disney co and katzenberg s dreamworks are entering a delicate dance katzenberg traveled to china in mid march to meet with chinese officials about how the expanded quota rules would be applied he also sought to work out details regarding the company s new joint venture in china oriental dreamworks china is big it is the fastest growing and that s what makes it challenging katzenberg told the associated press prior to his trip disney and its new partner beijing based dmg entertainment didn t offer many details about their iron man 3 project although the companies say the movie will incorporate chinese elements and be partly funded by dmg the dreamworks deal announced in february is for a joint venture studio based in shanghai that is 45 percent owned by dreamworks and 55 percent owned by its chinese partners capitalized at 330 million some analysts questioned whether it was worth it for dreamworks to give up a 55 percent stake in the venture it is not clear how well dreamworks will do when it has to relinquish creative controls said janney analyst tony wible this just adds to some of the uncertainty with the deal however there is a good long term potential so the risk goes with the return china isn t just waiting for hollywood to come running last month a key official in china s movie infrastructure yang buting appealed to hollywood s finance community to enter new joint ventures in the country he once led the nation s primary distributor of foreign films china film group and now chairs a co financing arm of the government china mainstream media national film capital hollywood group inc which set up an office in beverly hills calif this year i have a vision of an ideal version of film cooperation between china and the united states chinese or american stories joint investment co production joint cast and credits distributed globally he said at a conference in los angeles the formula will surely be a win win miracle for both china and the u s so far co productions have had mixed success the 2007 ang lee directed film lust caution which paired hai sheng film production co and universal pictures focus features group won critical acclaim but failed to make its money back on the other hand the retelling of the 1984 classic the karate kid by sony pictures and china film group in 2010 reinvigorated a franchise much of its success can be credited to the charming chemistry between its new star will smith s son jaden and martial arts legend jackie chan a well established hong kong born hit with chinese audiences the movie was a global hit it cast china and kung fu in a positive light and grossed 343 million worldwide still it is unclear whether new rules favor chinese co productions or movies brought in under the new quota based on a deal announced by chinese vice president xi jinping and u s counterpart joe biden china will let in 14 more foreign movies a year as long as they are in 3 d or the imax format that lifts the number of foreign films allowed under the quota system each year to 34 these foreign films will also share 25 percent of the box office receipts up from 13 5 percent to 17 5 percent now the rest goes to theater owners and the government while the new higher cut is less than the 43 percent share china offers domestic movie studios it still could be a better deal for hollywood than being the junior member of a joint venture meanwhile china s home movie market is dominated by pirated films the fledgling market for legitimate online movie rentals is tiny one of the clearest beneficiaries of the rule change is imax corp the big screen movie company that licenses its technology for a share of ticket sales imax is hugely popular with chinese movie fans it receives about half of the studios share of the box office for movies that end up on its screens in china as more imax format movies are let in more films will contribute to its chinese revenue going forward still ceo rich gelfond treads carefully i d say there s always country risk wherever you do business in the world he says but by creating a win win scenario where it s good for the chinese partners it s good for the chinese consumer and it works for imax we think we can minimize that risk busi
