being destroyed trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds the dereliction of duty charge against wang pengfei is unusual because he was in charge of police forensics and likely handled heywood s autopsy and efforts to trace the poison that killed him widespread reports from china state that gu kailai wife of chongqing party viceroy bo xilai a powerful ruling politburo member and mrs gu s co defendant zhang xiaojun forcibly fed cyanide to heywood killing him instantly in a

of the gu case a sign that the reported cause of heywood s death by cyanide poisoning may not hold water the charge raises questions about whether mr wang falsified the cause of death by cyanide

did not specify how heywood was killed or when a local court in the eastern province of anhui will hold the trial which observers say will last a few days a guilty verdict against the defendants is

the expense of its coveted good relationship with president vladimir putin s government china and russia share much in common on the international stage such as shielding dictators bashar assad in syria and moammar gadhafi of libya until he was killed by rebels last year but on border issues historical animosities linger and russia surprisingly joined china s other neighbors in opposing beijing
