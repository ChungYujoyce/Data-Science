apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic pyongyang north korea ap as his right hand grips the mouse the physics major s eyes are fixed on a flat screen monitor labeled with a red sticker reminding him the computer was a gift from kim jong il kim nam il says he prefers learning online to studying from books and in that sense the 21 year old is just like other university students the world over north korea is undergoing its own digital revolution even as it grapples with chronic shortages of food and fuel it is still among the most isolated of nations with cyberspace policies considered among the most restrictive in the world yet inside pyongyang there s a small but growing digital world and a whole new vocabulary to go with it cnc e libraries it an operating system called red star and a web portal called naenara top stories gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed in a world ever wary of the unpredictable nation s motives some see in north korea s bid to train a generation of computer experts the specter of hackers launching attacks on the defense systems of rival governments others see the push to computerize factories and develop it expertise as a political campaign designed to promote kim jong un the reputedly tech savvy swiss educated son being groomed to succeed his father as north korea s next leader the country remains one of the hardest to penetrate by email by phone by internet but there are signs of curiosity about the wired world outside interest in computers and technology is not new for north korea according to local lore leader kim jong il once said there are three types of fools in the 21st century those who smoke those who do not appreciate music and those who cannot use computers at the close of a historic 2000 meeting with then u s secretary of state madeleine albright he asked for her email address north korea s biggest it hub the state run korea computer center has been around since 1990 and has expanded across the country and into germany china syria the united arab emirates and elsewhere according to the company since then north korean it firms have quietly developed software for banks in the middle east applications for cell phone makers in japan and south korea and even video games for nintendo and playstation said paul tjia a dutch it consultant who has been working with north korean companies for years the u s bans the export to north korea of luxury items such as iphones and ipads but north korean programmers working for nosotek a software joint venture in pyongyang managed by westerners have developed games for facebook the iphone and ipad wii and blackberry company president volker eloesser said by e mail computer use doesn t appear widespread yet in north korea where power is scarce and most of the country remains analog it s still the domain of the privileged in pyongyang and aside from top government officials most only have access to the country s internal intranet network not the strictly allocated global internet but inside the cocoon of computer labs and it centers young north koreans are well versed in programming tjia said the knowledge available in the country is in many cases up to the western level he said adding that those who need extra training are routinely sent to india and other countries and increasingly north korea is getting on the world wide web last year north koreans created a buzz by opening accounts on twitter facebook and youtube with the handle uriminzok korean for our people flag carrier air koryo may not have a website but does have a facebook page with 1 200 fans and engages in lively humorous discussions with followers while dispensing advice on travel and visas earlier this month one facebook user asked if air koryo offered online check in you kidding right air koryo responded there are many things to do before even looking at online check in such as actually creating a website beefing up science and technology to build up the economy has been a national creed and government mission since the countdown began in 2009 toward the milestone 100th anniversary of national founder kim il sung s birth a new oft cited slogan has emerged breaking through the cutting edge and in this year s new year s editorial the government emphasized the importance of science and technology in this it era last year references to cnc computer numerical control began popping up regularly in state media on propaganda posters on t shirts and in the latest rendition of the arirang mass games everything from pencils to sandals are being churned out at top speed thanks to cnc according to state media it even has its own ode song of cnc said kim hyang a guide at the three revolution exhibition hall hall where products made with cnc are displayed asked to hum a few bars he laughed and demurred to the west computer automation at factories around since the 1960s may not seem so novel but for north korea it s a catchphrase for modernization and a rare instance of english creeping into a staunchly korean vocabulary it s a word that has a trendy feel rolling off the tongue modern high tech international cutting edge they re all virtues befitting a young little known future leader who is described as a tech savvy military genius by his loyalists it gives them something to praise him for said brian myers a professor of international studies who focuses on north korean propaganda kim il sung came to power as a military legend and kim jong il did too what i would do in their position would be to link jong un to technical innovation south korean officials suspect more strategic military motivations are behind north korea s zeal to train the next generation of computer experts for nearly 60 years the korean peninsula has remained in a technical state of war divided into the communist north and the u s backed capitalist south though both sides signed a truce in 1953 tensions persist in 2009 unidentified hackers waged a denial of service cyberattack on a host of u s and south korean government sites including those for the white house pentagon presidential blue house in seoul and south korean defense ministry in a simple but effective ploy the hackers flooded the websites with useless requests slowing them down or knocking them offline a similar but more sophisticated attack this march targeted 40 south korean government military and civilian sites as well as websites linked to the u s military in south korea including 14 of the same sites hacked in 2009 attack north korea is strategically nurturing its cyber warfare unit lt gen bae deuk shin chief of south korea s defense security command told a computer security forum in seoul earlier this month north korea s ministry of the people s armed forces denies involvement calling the allegations absurd the culprit is difficult to nail down but north korea or its sympathizers are likely dmitri alperovitch vice president of threat research at computer security software maker mcafee inc told the associated press the purpose to test the u s and south korean defenses and reaction a recent mcafee study said knowing that would be invaluable in a possible future armed confrontation on the peninsula since cyberspace has already become the fifth battlespace dimension in addition to land air sea and space the report said computer education
