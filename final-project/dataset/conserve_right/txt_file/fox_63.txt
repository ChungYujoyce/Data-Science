in washington the trump administration says it aposs prepared to do more after this week aposs missile barrage on the syrian air base meant to deter president bashar assad from again using chemical weapons against his own people the question this hour is what happens next in a few minutes we ll ask one of the key figures who helped president trump plan the attack general h r mcmaster in his first television interview since becoming the president aposs national security advisor but first let aposs bring in fox news correspondent kristin fisher live from palm beach with the latest from the southern white house kristin kristin fisher fox news corrrespondent chris residents of the same syrian town hit in that chemical weapons attack say warplanes have returned to bomb them though this time without the deadly gas and it has the world wondering how president trump will respond in a letter to congress he defended his decision to launch almost 60 tomahawk missiles at a single syrian air base without congressional approval by saying quote i acted in the vital national security and foreign policy interest of the united states pursuant to my constitutional authority he then said that quote the u s will take additional action as necessary and appropriate to further its important national interests as the president mulls over what those additional actions might be the pentagon is investigating if russia was involved in that chemical weapons attack senior military officials say a russian drone was seen flying over the hospital where victims of the attack were taken a few hours later it was bombed the kremlin is denying any responsibility now russia is flexing its muscles by sending a warship towards the two navy destroyers that launched the strike on syria and all of this just days before secretary of state rex tillerson is scheduled to take his first trip to moscow the state department says tillerson called his russian counterpart yesterday and the trip is still on and he will be bringing a very powerful message with him that president trump is willing to take decisive military action any time a country crosses his redline chris wallace kristin fisher reporting live from palm beach kristin thanks for that joining me live now from mar a lago president trump aposs national security advisor h r mcmaster general welcome to fox news sunday lt gen h r mcmaster national security advisor thank you chris it aposs a pleasure to be with you wallace the trump administration seems to be sending mixed signals this weekend u n ambassador nikki haley says that getting rid of assad is a priority on the other hand secretary of state tillerson says that first we have to get rid of isis destroy isis assad can wait so which is it how does the president see this playing out in syria mcmaster well both secretary tillerson and ambassador haley are right about this what we really need to do and what everyone who aposs involved in this conflict needs to do is to do everything they can to resolve this civil war to halt this humanitarian catastrophe this political catastrophe not only in syria but the catastrophe is affecting the greater middle east it aposs affecting europe and it aposs a threat to the american people as well and so to do that what aposs required is some kind of a political solution to that very complex problem and what ambassador haley pointed out is it aposs very difficult to understand how a political solution could result from the continuation of the assad regime now we are not saying that we are the ones who are going to affect that change what we are saying is other countries have to ask themselves some hard questions russia should ask themselves what are we doing here why are we supporting this murderous regime that is committing mass murder of its own population and using the most heinous weapons available so i think that while people are really anxious to find to find inconsistencies in the statements they are in fact very consistent in terms of what is the ultimate political objective in syria wallace i understand that that aposs the ultimate political objective but secretary tillerson said destroying isis must come first you don apost seem to be saying that mcmaster no that aposs exactly what we are saying we have seen what isis does right how isis brutalize these people how isis has now established control of territory and populations and resources and grown in strength and is threat to all civilized peoples so we are conducting very effective operations alongside our partners in syria and in iraq to defeat isis to destroy isis and reestablish control of that territory control of those populations protect those populations allow refugees to come back begin reconstruction and allow the resources crosstalk wallace but sir i m just trying to clear this up is it two separate tracks at the same time or does isis have to happen first before we and the international community moved to depose assad mcmaster well i think as you saw with the strike that there has to be a degree of simultaneous activity as well as sequencing of the defeat of isis first what you have in syria is a very destructive cycle of violence perpetuated by isis obviously but also by this regime and their iranian and russian sponsors and so what we have to be able to do is to work together with our allies and partners to help resolve this conflict and the resolution of the conflict will tell each of the elements that you are talking about chris the defeat of isis and then also it has to be a significant change in the nature of the assad regime and its behavior in particular wallace but let me ask you a question sir which may clarify this because as kristin fisher reported syrian warplanes are already using that same base that you and the u s forces hit thursday night and they are reportedly again bombing that same town in northern syria but only this time with conventional weapons not chemical the question is if assad continues killing babies only with conventional weapons not chemical will this president stop that or will president trump say he aposs going to do nothing stand aside mcmaster well i think what aposs important to remember is our objective our objective was to deter the continued use because there aposs been a pattern of the abuse of chemical weapons by the assad regime and his mass murder attacks against innocent civilians that was the objective and i think ambassador haley secretary tillerson everyone has confirmed that we are prepared to do more in fact we are prepared to do more in fact we are prepared to more two days ago as well and so what aposs significant about the strike is not that it was meant to take out the syrian regime aposs capacity or ability to commit mass murder of its own people but it was to be a very strong signal to assad and his sponsors that the united states cannot stand idly by as he is murdering innocent civilians what was a redline in 2013 and so that was the important objective to keep in mind here the other significant thing about this though crosstalk wallace he is continuing the mass murder so the question is if he uses conventional weapons is president trump prepared to stop him from using conventional weapons to slaughter innocent civilians mcmaster well i think with this president what we have is someone was helping us understand helping us provide him with an assessment of what is the degree of agency and control we have over this very complex situation the president has in response to a mass murder attack acted decisively and if they aposre using that airfield that aposs i mean that s not what the objective was to take out the airfield forever the objective was to send a very strong political message to assad and this is this is very significant i think because i think everyone should realize this is the first time the united states has acted directly against the assad regime and that should be a strong message to assad and to his sponsors who are enabling his campaign of mass murder against his own civilians wallace so there is a possibility that president trump you are saying leaving it wide open that he will act against president assad if he goes against civilians no matter what weapon he uses mcmaster well the president will make whatever decision he thinks is in the best interest of the american people and it will be our job to provide him with options based on how we see this conflict evolve in this period of time before us after the strike and what we aposre doing now is working with our partners our allies everyone except russia and iran who are somehow continue to think that it aposs ok to be aligned with his murderous regime we are working with our parties and allies to magnify the effects of this strike to and then to build momentum toward ultimately resolving the civil war defeating isis and bringing the peace and security back to this region and to the syrian people wallace let me bring in you mentioned russia russia has sent as kristin fisher reported has sent a warship into the mediterranean and over the weekend the prime minister of russia medvedev wrote the u s is quote on the verge of a military clash with russia sir what are we prepared to do if russia defends its interests in syria mcmaster well this is part of the problem with syria is russia aposs sponsorship for this murderous regime and if we would want to appeal rationally to russia this is a great opportunity for the russian leadership to reevaluate what they re doing why they are supporting a regime that is committing mass murder against its own people and so russia could be part of the solution right now i think everyone in the world sees russia as part of the problem wallace was russia involved do we have evidence that they were involved in the chemical attack mcmaster well i think what we should do is ask russia how could it be if you have advisors at that airfield that you didn apost know that the syrian air force was preparing and executing a mass murder attack with chemical weapons i think we ought to ask them a question wallace president trump as you well know talk to during the campaign and since about trying to establish an alliance with vladimir putin and he indicated that there was some kind of moral equivalence between the two nations here he is begin video clip trump will i get along with him i have no idea bill o reilly fox news host he aposs a killer though putin is a killer trump there are a lot of killers we aposve got a lot of killers why you think our country is so innocent end video clip wallace general what is our relationship with russia and putin today mcmaster well today it can be whatever the russians want it to be do they want it to be a relationship of competition and potential conflict i don apost see how that aposs in russian interest or do they want it to be where a relationship in which we can find areas of cooperation that are that are in our mutual interest how is it in anyone aposs interest that this conflict in syria and this catastrophe in the greater middle east continue and they can be part of the solution or they can continue what has been really a very sophisticated campaign of subversion against western interests and a campaign of subversion and intervention on behalf of a murderous regime in the middle east and so i think this is what our secretary of state will be exploring with the russian leadership this week and the president is determined to do everything he can to advance american interests and if that entails working with others to come to solutions in the world that enhance our security the president will do that and it aposs really now up to the russian leadership to reevaluate what they are doing in the middle east wallace i want to turn this all overshadowed the fact that the missile strike happened in the midst of a summit between president trump and chinese president xi and during dinner the president told president xi about the attack did president xi give any indication that he now takes president trump statement more seriously that if china doesn apost act to stop north korea aposs nuclear program that he president trump will did you get the sense that they were taking that more seriously and also we learned this morning that a u s carrier strike force is on its way to the korean peninsula why mcmaster well it is such a privilege to be part of this national security team and help enable this team for the president as national security advisor it aposs really extraordinary i think the degree of concurrent activity that was going on this week and nobody really even broke a sweat over it i mean we have extraordinarily competent people in these positions who are providing the president with options and then can then have this amazing military that we have that can execute those decisions of the president flawlessly and so it was i think maybe a bit surprising to the guests here about how really no one was really even stressed out or anything about the need to conduct this operation in the wake of this murderous attack and i think the summit was extremely successful because it met the first objective which is to allow the president and premier xi to build a relationship that they can use to identify areas of cooperation and to advance really our mutual interests but american interest in particular these are key areas wallace and i m running out of time so i ve got to ask you sort of lightning round quick questions quick answers why the carrier strike force to the korean peninsula mcmaster well it s prudent to do it isn apost it i mean north korea has been engaged in a pattern of provocative behavior this is this is a rogue regime that is now a nuclear capable regime and president xi and president trump agreed that that is unacceptable that what must happen is the denuclearization of the korean peninsula and so the president has asked to be prepared to give him a full range of options to remove that threat the american people and to our allies and partners in the region wallace finally you know you ve got china you ve got syria you ve got russia but a lot of people in washington are talking about relations inside the white house welcome to the d c politics general mcmaster why did you push for steve bannon to be taken off the principals committee of the national security council mcmaster well this is not as significant as it appears i think but i think what the president was making clear that he is going in terms of permanent membership of national security council have those permanent members who are for every meeting every official meeting of the national security council to be those who will give him their advice on the long term interests of the american people and so really though you know it depends the president can get advice from anybody he wants and he does that he asked a broad range of people who he trusts and steve bannon is one of them about policy decisions and about the risks and opportunities involved with each of these so none of that has changed wallace but do you think it was inappropriate to have a political advisor in that role mcmaster well no i think what is appropriate is to have in that role whoever the president wants in that role and there and steve bannon provides the president with advice on a broad range of issues and will continue to do so wallace general mcmaster thank you we covered a long range of issues today thank you for your time sir and we ll follow what happens next in syria and around the world mcmaster thanks chris it was a pleasure to be with you thank you wallace coming up should congress have had a say before the u s missile attack demand from both sides the president consult them before he acts again two leading senators join us next commercial break wallace just as president trump launched that missile attack in syria senate republicans employed the nuclear option to confirm neil gorsuch to the supreme court joining us now two senate leaders to discuss both developments from austin texas the number two republican in the senate john cornyn and here in washington ben cardin the top democrat on the foreign relations committee senator cardin you just heard the president aposs national security advisor general mcmaster are you satisfied that they have a clear plan for how to proceed in syria sen ben cardin d maryland not at all i don t i don apost think he articulated a syrian strategy what we saw was a reaction to the use of chemical weapons something i think many of us supported but what we did not see is a coherent policy on how we re going to deal with the civil war and also deal with isis wallace i want to ask you about that as well senator cornyn because as i said there were these mixed messages that have come out this weekend from the administration haley is talking about deposing assad tillerson talking about taking out isis first do you have a clear sense of what the administration aposs policy is sen john cornyn r texas well first and foremost i think it aposs to send a message to assad and to the russians the iranians and north koreans that there aposs a new administration in charge of our national security policy i applaud the president for doing what he did to enforce that red line that president obama drew three years ago but did nothing to enforce but i think that along with my friend ben cardin congress needs to work with the president to try and deal with this long term strategy lack of strategy really in syria we haven apost had one for six years during the obama administration and the 400 000 civilians have died and millions of people have been displaced internally and externally in europe and elsewhere so we definitely need a strategy we need to work with the white house to come up with one that has bipartisan support wallace well let aposs talk about that because while most senators including the two of you i think supported this particular strike under these specific circumstances there was concern from both sides of the aisle about whether president trump gets more deeply involved whether or not he needs authorization from congress to do so here was democratic leader chuck schumer this week begin video clip sen chuck schumer d ny senate minority leader it is now however incumbent on the trump administration to come up with a coherent strategy and consult with congress before implementing it end video clip wallace senator cornyn is schumer right does the white house need approval from congress if it aposs going to get more deeply involved in syria cornyn well under the war resolutions act which the president sent a letter pursuant to that act yesterday explaining his actions it is required and i think it also makes good sense before we commit our military and our men and women in uniform to any sort of conflict they deserve the support of congress on a bipartisan basis as well as the support of the american people so that aposs why that sort of consultation and advice is so important wallace senator cardin let me pick up on this with you because president obama and now president trump both authorized widespread force across the middle east based on an approval that was given by congress right after 9 11 this is 15 years later does that cover moving against the assad regime or does the president made new approval and an important question because as we remember when president obama went to congress back in 2013 to enforce the red line it was clear congress wasn apost going to approve it do you think if the president went to congress now that democrats republicans would pass resolutions supporting the use of force to depose bashar assad cardin chris you asked a couple of questions first in regards to the 2001 authorization it aposs been interpreted by the obama administration i assume also the trump administration to cover the use of force against isis in syria many of us disagree with that and believe congress should pass a separate resolution dealing with isis that we shouldn t be using the 9 11 resolution for that purpose in regards of going against assad syria there is no congressional authorization there is no authority to use force the president has some inherent article 2 to powers but as he consulted with us by notice on this attack it aposs incumbent upon him to consult with congress and if there aposs going to be a use of force on a continuing basis he needs the authorization wallace and do you think the house and senate democrats as well as republicans would authorize the use of force cardin i think it depends upon seeing a plan from the president on syria that can get the support of congress and then how force is used as part of implementing that strategy we have neither we have we don t have overall strategy and we don apost have the request for use of force wallace well there was another big story this week and i want to address that with both of you now and that was the senate republicans invoking the nuclear option changing the rules of the senate to confirm neil gorsuch as the next justice to the supreme court here was that moment in the senate begin video clip mike pence vice president of the united states the nomination of neil m gorsuch of colorado to be an associate justice of the supreme court of the united states is confirmed end video clip wallace senator cornyn i want to talk there aposs been enough about why this happened and merrick garland and gorsuch and all of that i want to talk about the impact of this going forward doesn apost this ensure that the next time the president gets an opening if his party controls the senate that he s going to appoint somebody even more ideological even more to the extreme if you will wing of his base because he doesn apost have to worry about getting bipartisan support doesn apost have to worry about reaching out to the other party cornyn well chris this is really a restoration of the status quo before the george w bush administration when there was no such thing as filibustering judges particular judges on the supreme court clarence thomas got 52 votes when he was confirmed one senator could have required 60 votes under the theory that basically was developed under chuck schumer and democratic leadership to the george bush administration but i think there is no danger of that happening what it means is when we elect the president we know that they re going to be the ones who get to nominate judges and they re going to get support for that at least 51 votes but here judge gorsuch got bipartisan support 54 votes in the senate for his confirmation and he deserves he deserved it wallace senator cardin i want to ask about the strategy here and i know there were some democrats who said maybe we shouldn apost filibuster gorsuch because the thought was well then the fact that we haven apost done it will lead president trump to nominate if there is a number opening someone more moderate have you made a strategic mistake here in the sense that now president trump knows i can nominate anyone almost anyone i want and get 51 votes a bare majority of the senate and they ll get through cardin well john cornyn is my friend and i mean that but we disagree on this issue i think damage has been done in the future nominees for the supreme court i think damage has been done to the senate as an institution which is important for our country i think that wallace but didn t you do some of the damage i don t mean you but the democrats by filibustering cardin both the democrats and republicans have blame here both democrats and republicans have handled things in a way that shouldn t have been done we should change our rules by bipartisan we shouldn apost change the rules to accomplish a purpose and this has been going on the ultimate filibuster was merrick garland aposs filibuster when he didn apost even get a hearing or vote in the united states senate by less than a majority of the u s senators holding him up so we aposve seen this go back to when president obama s first year for second term republicans said we re not going to confirm any more court of appeals for the district court wallace and you invoke the nuclear option cardin we did so we aposve seen this pattern you see more filibusters for judicial nominees by the republicans under president obama than we saw in the whole history of the united state senate both sides have blame here wallace all right i want to get into one last subject with both of you and the time we have left when you get back from this two week recess that you aposre taking we re going to have less than one week to pass the spending bill if you failed to do so the government is going to shut down senator cardin if the white house insist as they are at this point about including funding for building that wall along the southern border for having sharp domestic spending cuts in order to offset a defense spending increase will you block that even if it means the government shutdown cardin well first i m not sure the president has the majority of the united states senate that will support funding a wall because i talked to enough republicans to know and they ve said it publicly that s a waste of money and it aposs counterproductive so i think the senate will carry out its will and hopefully provide no money no taxpayer money for building a wall wallace but to answer my direct question if a choice between putting money in for the wall having those domestic spending cuts would you go for a shutdown cardin i want to see government i don apost want to see a government shutdown i m willing to make compromises in order to keep government functioning but we have to take a look at their trade offs so i can apost answer that in fact until i see everything that s in the bill wallace senator cornyn are those issues that i just mentioned worth shutting down the government or would you support leaving some of them out in order to keep the government functioning cornyn i think this is a test for the new democratic leader senator chuck schumer as well as the administration they re going to be the ones ultimately who negotiate this but there s not going to be a shutdown i m confident that we ll come up with something that everybody can live with wallace senator cornyn senator cardin thank you both thanks for joining us today thanks for your time cardin thanks chris wallace next up we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss president trump aposs military strike the gorsuch vote and drama inside the white house plus what would you like to ask the panel about the decision to hit syria what does it mean for the president aposs foreign policy just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up senate republicans invoked the nuclear option and confirm president trump s nominate neil gorsuch to the supreme court begin video clip unidentified male i think it aposs a good day for the senate and a great day for the country end video clip wallace we ll ask our sunday panel how the gop action will affect future openings on the high court next commercial break begin video clip trump when you kill innocent children innocent babies babies little babies with a chemical gas that is so lethal people were shocked to hear what gas it was that crosses many many lines beyond a red line many many lines end video clip wallace president trump explaining a sudden change in his policy towards the assad regime just one day before ordering a strike on a syrian air base and it aposs time now for our sunday group bill kristol from the weekly standard fox news political analyst and columnist for the hill juan williams mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service and washington examiner contributor lisa boothe phil you heard general mcmaster the national security advisor at the top of the show are you satisfied that this administration has a clear strategy for going forward in syria particularly the question i asked which was is this just about chemical weapons or is the president prepared to act if there aposs just by conventional means the slaughter of civilians bill kristol the weekly standard i think they aposve at least done what they had to have done to lay the predicate for having a clear strategy they haven t worked it all out but if he had not acted now we would be in even worse shape than after president obama didn apost enforce his red line it was such a visible violation of its national norms and what syria had committed to when it allegedly got rid of all these chemical weapons so let them work out the strategy i have a lot of confidence in h r mcmaster i do think when historians if the trump administration ends up non disastrously the replacement wallace non disastrously kristol that aposs my that s my standard for trump yes lisa boothe washington examiner contributor it s very it s very believable ph kristol if if if it does and i aposm hopeful it does don t get me wrong i m hopeful it does the replacement of of mike flynn by h r mcmaster as national security advisor could really be an important moment because looking at from the outside what struck me and i think you you noted this too chris during the week it seemed like this was there was a crisis and they handled it competently you could agree or disagree do they have a long term strategy how knows wallace no clearly kristol but in terms of just the execution of this inaudible 72 hours meetings diplomacy and military stuff coordinated keeping it secret you know that was impressive so that reassures you if you think the trump white house inaudible but a little bit of a chaotic place you like gee h r mcmaster has the national security side of it under control wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of what the missile strike means for president trump s larger foreign policy michael lodge sent this on facebook since the justified attack by the u s on syria was this truly a clear enough signal to world leaders that america is back in charge juan how do you answer michael juan williams fox news political analyst well i think that if you aposre sitting there having lunch and dinner as president xi of china was it s got to send some kind of message especially with regard to north korea now if you look on the world there are a lot of hot spots though and there a lot of reasons for the u s to exercise some moral authority president trump as a candidate said if it aposs not about u s economic interest if it aposs not about u s national security interest it aposs no business of the untied states and as you know he encouraged president obama don t get involved with syria so there is no doctrine chris and when i was listening to your interview with mcmaster i looked forward to it because i wanted to understand what is the rationale how do they sell this to the american people how do they sell it to the person asking the question this morning and there is none he doesn t say you know what conventional weapons are continuing to kill people in syria and we find this abhorrent and we will stop it no he did not say that to you he doesn t he aposs not clear what the next step is wallace let aposs turn to the other big story this week normally this would be dominating and the news and that was republican in the senate invoking the nuclear option in order to confirm neil gorsuch to the supreme court here are the senate aposs two leaders begin video clip schumer i believe it will make this body a more partisan place it will make the cooling saucer of the senate considerably hotter sen mitch mcconnell r ky majority leader i hope my democratic friends will take this moment to reflect and perhaps consider a turning point in their outlook going forward end video clip wallace lisa that aposs what i want to talk about with you is where the senate goes from here particularly on supreme court nominations this is something i brought up with the two senators in the last segment it seems to me and this isn apost just trump and republicans it will be true of the next democratic president when he is a democratic majority doesn apost this increase the likelihood that when a president s in that situation he s going to appoint somebody that is more to the extreme more to in line with his base because he doesn apost have to he or she doesn apost have to reach out to the other side because they know there s not going to be a filibuster boothe yes potentially but i mean you also have to look at the fact that really prior going back to 2003 prior to miguel estrada no judicial nominee with a clear majority had essentially been blocked by a filibuster then you also go to 2006 with president obama leading the filibuster attempt against justice alito and then it was the democratic party in 2013 that changed the rules for the lower court i mean wallace i now i mean this goes back and forth there s nobody with clean hands here cardin s right but my point is going forward there was at least this self limiting factor well maybe we ve got to reach out to the other side is that gone now boothe i mean yes potentially but i don apost necessarily think i don t think the onus is on the republican party i think we re just seeing politics as a whole getting increasingly more partisan but the point being is going back to 2003 you really didn t see the filibuster being used in a partisan manner so i you know i don apost know if this is fundamentally changing the rules when you just go back to 2003 where we really saw at least a party using it for you know sort of a bipartisan weapon wallace but that s what but it s gone on i mean you ve you ve had boothe yes but no but to answer wallace i mean you had merrick garland you you there aposs there is no there may be an original sin here but there aposs not one party that boothe but but to answer your question i mean sure but i also think that that aposs happening regardless of what just recently happened in the senate i think that is the direction that party politics is heading wallace well if i aposm right did and i know that aposs a a mo elleithee georgetown inst of politics public service right wallace i a very distant possibility williams go ahead inaudible go ahead boothe inaudible wallace if if if what i ve said is not if what i said is not disastrous to use bill kristol s new standard did democrats make a strategic mistake filibustering this one because it opens the door for president trump with his next appointment if he gets another appointment elleithee yes i you know it aposs it s hard to say i and and i aposm i m with you and i m with senator cardin that both sides have some of the blame here my party has a lot of blame for the way it it acted and i think maybe the filibuster may have been a a poor judgment i also think the republicans i mean the fact that merrick garland was couldn apost even get a hearing right and we do go back and forth i aposm i m usually a fairly optimistic guy this is a case where i am very optimistic you hear senators now saying well we went nuclear on nominations there aposs no way that aposs going to happen on legislation i aposm not so sure right what s going to happen the first time there aposs a contentious piece of legislation that s up there and the partisan heels dig in even more i think we are we are entering a very tenuous time for the united states senate where it is going to become a lot more raucous and i don apost think that aposs necessarily a good thing when there aposs a lot of raucousness around now in this town that needs to be checked wallace well look i want to i want to pick up on raucousness because there s raucousness inside the trump white house and i want to talk about that with you bill let s be honest with all of the big events this is really what s got washington buzzing this apparent split inside the white house between the so called nationalist led by steve bannon on the appropriately on the right there and the so called new yorkers or democrats led by trump aposs son in law jared kushner over the direction of the trump presidency bill what are you hearing how bad is it and is anybody going to be forced out kristol i think it aposs bad or at least dramatic i don t know if bannon will be he ll be i think pushed aside some i doubt if he ll be forced out immediately what shows me who has the upper hand is this i saw a new york times it was a new times story i think it was today or yesterday and the sort of the slug ph that once saw going in you know originally was trump had called it these two top aides and told them work it out wallace right kristol so i saw that and i thought well the two aides who had to work it out obviously were steve bannon and jared kushner those are the two guys who at loggerheads no trump had called in steve bannon and reince priebus and told them to work it out with jared kushner now what does that tell you you ve been around organizations a while kushner is and the driver aposs seat trump is telling his chief of staff at this top strategist you get along with jared kushner so jared kushner in my to my in my opinion is the most powerful man in domestic policy at least in the white house today wallace lisa beyond the the obvious game of thrones side of this who s up and who s down what s the significance whether it aposs the bannon wing or the kushner wing in terms of policy for this presidency boothe personally i don apost think it aposs as significant as it aposs being made out to be because the reality everyone everyone is basically putting this at the premise of somehow you know president trump is being you know is a puppet of either steve bannon or priebus or whoever aposs in charge jared kushner the reality is this is a guy i think people are under they re not getting enough credit this is a guy in 2012 who trademarked make america great again a guy who defeated 16 candidates in the primary who defeated hillary clinton who outspent him two to one and if you include outside groups three to one and did all this with three separate campaign managers i mean so this is a guy who aposs very smart politically who s a lot more adept than anyone wants to give him credit for so the idea of who was at the helm in regards to the chief of staff or whatever that role is i think is is irrelevant williams well i boothe i don apost think it aposs as big of a deal as we re all making it out to be wallace we re we re we re out of time i suspect this is going to continue it may be irrelevant but it is kind of interesting and it s boothe it is and i ll i ll i ll grant you that wallace it is it is what we do boothe it is interesting wallace thank you panel up next our power player of the week the former head of u s special forces who led the takeout of usama bin laden on what we should do now in syria commercial break wallace chances are you aposve never heard of bill mcraven but you know his work a navy seal for 37 years he became the head of the u s special operations command he was in charge of the missions that captured saddam hussein and killed osama bin laden and now he aposs written a jewel of a book called make your bed little things that can change your life and the world we interviewed him after the chemical attack in syria but before president trump aposs response here s our power player of the week begin videotape wallace bill welcome to fox news sunday mcraven thank you chris wallace it aposs an honor to have you mcraven it aposs great to be here wallace as the commander of the missions that rescued captain phillips that found and killed bin laden what s the secret of success what is the key to pulling these things off mcraven yes i think you have to rely on a lot of great people i mean obviously i didn apost do this on my own i had great operators working for me in every case and you have to be able to reach out find those that are really experts in their field the helicopter pilots the fighter pilots the seals on the ground the built ph operators the rangers draw on their experience and then make the best decision you can to move forward wallace in your book and we re going to talk about that more in a minute you talk about seal training you were a seal for 37 years and how brutal it is hell week six days of of just extraordinary exercises on basically no sleep does it have to be that tough mcraven if their combat experience and if their success in combat is any indication the traditions if you will and the standards we ve had in place for many many years have paid huge dividends and i think they ll they ll continue to to march out smartly with those wallace you had what 150 people in your class and 33 made a through mcraven correct wallace and and from your experience in the field as a seal do you need that kind of training to make it in real in the real world mcraven in the real world of being a navy seal you do i mean part of this is a recognition that you know you re going out and you re going to select not just the fastest and the strongest you re going to select that individual that can one think critically that can that can ensure that in the tough times they are going to get through so you will see we had we had a young man in our class who was a remarkable runner i think he was close to a four minute mile in high school and yet we had an officer that was a little faster than he was and and so you found as time went on that it really wasn apost about the fastest and the strongest was really about those kids that never ever gave up and that aposs part of of the points we we bring out in the book is that just just don apost give up and and you ll find a way to success wallace you re now chancellor of the university of texas system 14 institutions about a quarter of a million students that you re educating and in 2014 you delivered a commencement speech that went viral 10 million views online here aposs a clip begin video clip mcraven if you make your bed every morning you will have accomplished the first task of the day it will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another and by the end of that day that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed end video clip wallace if you want to change the world make your bed and that is the title of this this book it s little but it s got wonderful life lessons in it what s the message mcraven i think the the lessons are universal it doesn apost make any difference whether you ever spent any time in the military it doesn apost make any difference about your race or your ethnicity or your orientation these are important lessons don apost quit stand up to the bullies have a little bit of discipline in your life wallace right make your bed mcraven make your bed wallace why is that why is that so important mcraven well i think it is one of these tasks that really does get your day started off right i mean all you know my my mother and my father ensured that before i went to school every morning i made my bed and then in the military of course the really reinforce that and it aposs it s a number of things it is about the first task of the day doing the first task of the day right and recognizing also that little things matter wallace one of your stories lessons is about a ranger named adam bates ph mcraven right wallace what aposs the lesson there mcraven well adam bates a young ranger he was on his first tour in afghanistan stepped on a pressure plate ied and and lost both his legs and i really think what adam bates represents frankly is all the soldiers sailors airmen and marines that were wounded in iraq and afghanistan and other places i never ever met a single soldier didn apost say i want to get back to my unit some of them missing legs missing arms they always wanted to get back to their unit and adam never gave up and to this day he has carried on he aposs got a great life and again its representative of of all those great young men and women that served in iraq and afghanistan wallace i aposve been trying to get you to sit down for an interview for several years now since we first met back in 2014 and i m going to take this opportunity to ask you about some questions back in 2015 you said if we really mean to beat isis we ve got to put more boots on the ground there when you look at the situation in iraq in syria do we need more mcraven well i you know i m always very cautious about old retired guys like me trying to make an assessment of the tactical situation on the ground having said that i think if you look back a year march or so of last year we really begin we the united states really began a a more serious effort i think in going after isis and i think that was the right thing to do i i credit president obama for realizing that we needed a little bit of a change in the plan he did that and of course president trump has continued that and and and looks to be accelerating that and i think what we ll see is the acceleration or the decline of isis so i think both presidents deserve some credit in in how they are attacking this problem wallace different issues same country syria when you look at this horrific chemical attack on the rebel held town in northern syria by the assad regime is there anything we can do mcraven there are some options out there everything from a no fly zone but it is difficult and we have looked at that before the potential to do a no fly zone means you may come in contact with the syrian air force or the russian air force so i think we have to be a little bit cautious but clearly something needs to be done we cannot just sit by and see this mass migration and see the carnage that is that is occurring in syria and do nothing wallace i didn apost realize until this week that you graduated from the university of texas with a degree in journalism i can t understand how you went so wrong and decided it was more important to become a navy seal and defend our nation but when president trump tweeted in february that much of the media are in his words quote the enemy of the american people your journalistic hackles went up and you said this begin video clip mcraven the news media is the enemy of the american people this sentiment this sentiment may be the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime end video clip wallace that aposs pretty strong language coming from somebody who s seen the threats you aposve seen greater threat than the soviet union greater threat than radical islam mcraven i think those threats really kind of brought us together so when you looked at the the strikes on 9 11 and the threat from the soviet union this really brought us together as a democracy i i think so when i talk about the media you know when when the media is referred to as the enemy of the american people both myself and and the president and others swore an oath to the constitution of the united states and the first amendment of that constitution is freedom of the press so the reason that i expressed some concern was that when the president of the united states says that the media is the enemy of the american people to me that undermines a little bit of the constitution so i do think it is a tremendous threat to our democracy but there aposs a second part of that clip that you should run which is where i told the journalism students that they also have an obligation so in order for the media really to to be seen as more truthful one the journalists have to check their facts also leave your bias at the door so yes i do think anybody that says that the media is the enemy of the american people is not right i ve been i have been raked over the coals by the media but i will tell you i think it is the single most important thing for this democracy wallace finally i want to ask you about your job as chancellor of ut because you have laid out what you call a path for change at ut including what you call nine quantum leaps and one of them i m fascinated by you want to start a mandatory course for every one of those quarter million students on american leadership what do you hope to accomplish mcraven the fundamentals of leadership i think really are are ethics you know how do you do things to ensure that you are you know i said there aposs three things you have to be moral legal and ethical in all of our decisions we must be moral legal and ethical so we need to understand ethics ethics in business ethics in politics ethics in the military it aposs also recognizing that we need our young men and women to learn how to function in a group environment how do you lead a small group what are the qualities of leadership that we see in great business leaders great politicians great military men and women so these are the sort of things we want to teach in the in the leadership curriculum wallace well you are an exemplar of that bill mcraven thank you thank you for
