retailers crucial back to school and fall seasons there s complete uncertainty said steve pasierb ceo of the toy industry association this could be huge if it goes on for months wuhan the chinese city where the outbreak hit hardest is a center of automotive production it s been closed off along with neighboring cities isolating more than 50 million people and bringing factories to a standstill so far u s automakers haven t had to curb production for want of chinese parts but david closs professor emeritus at michigan state university s department of supply chain management said the clock is ticking i would say it s weeks at the most closs said one to two to three weeks hyundai said tuesday that it was suspending production in south korea due to disruptions in the supply of parts resulting from the coronavirus outbreak in china and that it was seeking alternative suppliers in other regions the partial shutdown of wuhan has already harmed the production of tv display panels and raised prices according to a report by research group ihs markit the city has five factories making liquid crystal displays known as lcds and organic light emitting diodes known as oleds both of which are used for television and laptop monitors china accounts for more than half of the global production capacity for making these display panels david hsieh an analyst at ihs markit said in a report that these factories are facing shortages of both labor and key components as a result of mandates designed to limit the contagion s spread leading suppliers to raise panel prices more aggressively

s second biggest tommy wu and louis kuijs of oxford economics have slashed their forecast for chinese economic growth this year from 6 to 5 4 they expect most of the damage to be inflicted in the first three months of 2020 but a more serious and long lasting impact cannot be ruled out they wrote monday forecasters are contending with unknowns no one knows how long the outbreak will last how much damage it will cause or how policymakers will respond to the threat we re grasping for precedents said phil levy chief economist at the freight company flexport who was an economic adviser in the administration of president george w bush some look back to the sars outbreak which paralyzed the chinese economy for the first few months of 2003 but the damage from sars faded quickly china was booming again by year s end and the world economy emerged mostly unscathed but times have changed in ways that are not favorable to containing the economic damage back then china was the world s workshop for cheap goods toys and sneakers for instance now china has moved up to sophisticated machine parts and electronics like lcds and it accounts for about 16 of global economic output up significantly from just 4 in 2003 levy said he was struck by how u s airlines reacted to the coronavirus they suspended flights between the united states and mainland china for weeks american airlines through march 27 united through march 28 and delta until april 30 the move doesn t just affect tourists students and business travelers caryn livingston editor of air cargo world noted that about half

dodge president donald trump s taxes on chinese made goods the trump administration and beijing last month reached an interim trade deal china agreed to step up purchases of u s imports by 200 billion this year and next but trump s top economic adviser larry kudlow told fox business network on tuesday that the viral outbreak means that the expected export boom from that trade deal will take longer the coronavirus along with fears that u s china tensions over trade and geopolitics will persist gives them one more reason to reduce their reliance on china among multinational firms there is increasing unease that china is starting to become quite risky said johan gott an independent consultant who specializes in political risks for businesses but it isn t easy to completely abandon china

suppliers in vietnam and india with no luck yet its ceo jay foreman said he is hoping that the factories in china will resume production by early april which he considers the best case scenario but he fears that any more delays could mean that the factories don t start to ramp up production until after may 1 the stakes are high basic fun gets about 90 of its toys from china and foreman has been
