ation should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion it now seems unlikely that the virus destroying lives and livelihoods around the world began in a wildlife for supper market in wuhan more plausible that it began in a laboratory in that same chinese city the evidence that has come to light so far suggests the pathogen was neither genetically engineered nor released as a bioweapon but that it got loose by accident or more bluntly due to incompetence chinese officials deny that on friday president trump confirmed that u s intelligence agencies are investigating at least as early as january china s rulers must have been aware that they were dealing with a local epidemic that could become a global pandemic at that point if they d shared what they knew and prevented those infected from traveling abroad less damage would have been done how much less according to a university of southampton study had interventions in china been conducted just three weeks earlier transmission of covid 19 could have been cut by 95 percent top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey instead china s rulers lied on jan 14 they claimed the disease was not being readily transmitted human to human on jan 19 they declared the virus controllable and its spread preventable they silenced those who knew better including chinese doctors chinese journalists and even wuhan s mayor some were arrested and charged with fabricating disseminating and spreading rumors some have disappeared the world health organization a u n body funded largely by american taxpayers our annual investment is 10 times that of beijing echoed such statements and praised the chinese government s response including the very rare leadership of president xi jinping the who resisted recommending restrictions on trade with or travel to china not until march 11 did it declare the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic perhaps you ll say that china s rulers were deceptive because they were embarrassed concerned for their country s image that s understandable which is not a synonym for forgivable but there s a more disturbing possibility president xi knew the disease would seriously weaken china s economy he knew that if he helped other countries those countries might suffer little or no damage ben lowsen a longtime china expert at the pentagon wrote in the diplomat that mr xi may have asked himself this question why should china suffer the effects of a pandemic while others stayed safe and increase their strength relative to china based on china s own costly experience we cannot assume mr lowsen added that mr xi would decide against withholding support from the international community to ensure that china would not suffer alone that would be immoral and one might argue criminally negligent but don t expect the international criminal court to take up the case the icc is too busy accusing the united states and israel of war crimes and crimes against humanity nor is it likely that the u n human rights council will say or do anything the unhcr has long been dominated by egregious abusers of human rights you ll be unsurprised to learn that beijing this month secured one of five seats on the panel that makes appointments to the unhrc over many years a growing list of transnational organizations have been taking americans money and spitting in americans eyes under the direction of regimes hostile to america china s rulers continue to lie last week memri the middle east media research institute reported that china s arabic language television network is still telling its 14 million viewers that u s army personnel visiting china last october probably brought the virus with them it is passing strange how many people conservatives and liberals alike including presidents george h w bush bill clinton and george w bush have managed to convince themselves that the communist dictatorship is evolving into america s partner vice president joe biden not long ago said china is going to eat our lunch come on man also what a beautiful history we wrote together president trump has sung mr xi s praises to be fair buttering up dictators is part of mr trump s negotiating strategy to be fairer i don t think that strategy has worked the trump administration is however the first to identify china as an adversary it did so in the national defense strategy written and released in 2017 when h r mcmaster was serving as national security adviser beijing is building its military strength violating maritime laws incarcerating muslim uighurs colonizing tibet suppressing freedom in hong kong stealing intellectual property by the ton waging information warfare and lawfare as well as hijacking international organizations perhaps the current global health and economic crisis will prompt wider recognition of this one party state s oppressive policies at home and hegemonic ambitions abroad the threat it poses to the security of america and what we used to call the free world i was encouraged on friday to see the editor of bild germany s largest and most important newspaper publish an open letter to president xi saying you are endangering the world you plan to strengthen china through a plague that you exported you will not succeed there s one more point i want to make today taiwanese officials have coped with the virus extraordinarily well as early as dec 31 they began screening arrivals from wuhan they also warned the who about person to person transmissions the who ignored them that s because china s rulers insist taiwan be treated as a rogue province rather than an independent nation state which for all intents and purposes it has been for more than 70 years over that span of time taiwan has become free and democratic the taiwanese have never been ruled by communists and few would choose to be that should matter to the peoples of what we used to call the free world clifford d may is founder and president of the foundation for defense of democracies fdd and a columnist for the washing
