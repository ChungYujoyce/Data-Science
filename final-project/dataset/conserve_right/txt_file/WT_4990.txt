such a complaint based on the cnn and daily beast stories mr bondy told the washington times i read rep nunes remarks with close care i remind him that in addition to a free press one of the cornerstones of our democracy is that a person is presumed innocent unless and until if ever they are proven guilty by proof beyond a reasonable doubt mr parnas has been charged in new york with federal election act violations and his indictment is not a conviction mr parnas was been subpoenaed by the house intelligence committee before he made the nunes allegation to talk about his association with mr giuliani his evidence and potential testimony is nonpartisan and not intended to be part of a battle between the left and the right but rather an aid in the determination by our government of what is in the best interests of our nation mr bondy said a cnn spokesman declined to comment a message to daily beast public affairs was not returned among mr nunes comments on fox news sunday morning futures with maria bartiromo i ve been used to this the past three years we continue to expose democrat corruption over and over again and what always happens right when we exposed them what do they do they go out to kill the messenger so this week another fake news story the problem with this week s fake news story is we actually caught them and we caught them badly and it also involved criminal activity we are going to take cnn and the daily beast likely into federal court we hope they cooperate because we are also going to be working with the appropriate law enforcement authorities because it is not ok to work with someone who has been indicted on serious federal crimes to build a media narrative and dirty up a member of congress we hope that cnn and the daily beast will cooperate with the court they should comply with the subpoenas once we file them and go through depositions it will be fun everyone is going to know all the facts i can t compete by trying to debate this out with the public media when 90 of the media are totally corrupt because this is criminal in nature it is so bad it is so slanderous we ve got all the facts on our side i will win in court and they ll have a chance to cooperate and they ll have to show how they work with someone who has been indicted which is likely conspiracy to obstruct justice or an accessory to it
