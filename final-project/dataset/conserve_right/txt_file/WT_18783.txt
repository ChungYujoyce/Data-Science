california gets federal covid 19 funds trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore sotheby s meanwhile has big plans to expand into mainland china after setting up a joint venture allowing it to be the first foreign company to hold art auctions there in a big leap over rival christie s the expansion plans highlight how the thriving demand for art from asia s growing class of wealthy collectors is leading to intensifying competition in hong kong the region s auction hub many of the collectors flocking to the city for twice yearly sales by a number of companies are mainland chinese but a growing number come from other asian countries such as indonesia guardian and poly have been watching and seeing what sotheby s and christies have been doing in hong kong and i personally think they ve been sat back in the wings saying the time is right said jonathan macey senior broker with the art futures group you ve got a sea of money coming into this business from across southeast asia in addition to hong kong and chinese collectors he said hong kong is a logical place for us to step out and to fulfill our international expansion plan said guardian s president yannan wang who founded the company in 1993 with chen dongsheng the southern chinese city is also an attractive place for art auctions because there are no taxes unlike in mainland china where buyers have to pay up to 23 percent in taxes and import duties wang said expanding in hong kong was also symbolically important because the buyer of the company s first ever lot at an auction 19 years ago was a hong kong collector guardian s hong kong auction held sunday in a ballroom in the mandarin oriental hotel raised 58 6 million more than double the pre sale estimate it drew people such as wu jia lin who lives in the manufacturing hub of dongguan in china s southern guangdong province and has been collecting art for 10 years there are fewer artworks here but they re good quality said wu who had his eye on a wu guanzhong scroll painting of a bamboo grove with a presale estimate of 52 000 77 400 the sale room was jammed with hundreds of bidders including more than 100 that the company brought in from beijing at times the chatter from the crowd standing at the back of the room drowned out the auctioneer who spoke only mandarin but the din died down when the highlight of the daylong sale a landscape series by qi bashi went on the block bidding opened at 10 million hong kong dollars 1 3 million and rose rapidly until the hammer went down at hk 40 million 5 2 million which didn t include a 15 percent commission in a bold move the event was held the same day as sotheby s auction of contemporary asian art traditionally the most prestigious of the company s multi day semi annual sales a similar rivalry is in store in late november when beijing poly international auction co s first hong kong auction coincides with christie s fall sale the chinese auction houses both have storied backgrounds guardian founder wang s father zhao ziyang was chief of china s communist party until he was purged for refusing to suppress the student led pro democracy demonstrations in

giant state owned corporation that s best known for being a major defense contractor and which was owned by the people s liberation army until 1999 beijing poly has a reputation for being aggressive with a reputation for setting high estimates to attract more business art market insiders say the expansions by guardian and poly come amid signs of cooling china is estimated to be the world s biggest fine art market accounting for 30 to 41 percent of global sales according to various estimates but research firm arttactic says the market is slowing with results showing sotheby s christies guardian and poly raising 1 5 billion in their spring sales down 32 percent from the autumn 2011 auctions sales volumes are significantly down said michael frahm who runs a london based art advisory firm and specializes in new asian art i think the overall market is cooling a little bit and it s definitely down from last year chinese collectors enthusiasm may also be damped after an investigation earlier this year by mainland authorities into tax evasion on artworks sotheby s asia ceo kevin ching shrugged off fears of a china slowdown saying it was just bumps in the road he said the company s joint venture sotheby s beijing auction co is planning its first proper auction in china next spring probably of wine watches jewelry and western art sotheby s invested 1 2 million for an 80 percent stake in the venture which held a symbolic first sale last month of a single sculpture ching said sotheby s spent six months in a laborious and protracted process trying to set up the venture different licenses different authorities different government levels would be approving 10 000 things that would be needed for the company to be operational he said he said he wasn t worried about guardian and poly expanding into hong kong saying they were healthy competition rather than a threat sotheby s which rang up 1 billion sales in hong kong last year may even benefit from the chinese collectors that the mainland rivals bring to hong kong once they ve learned how to buy in hong kong how to do online bidding and phone bids these people will come over to us very soon online https
