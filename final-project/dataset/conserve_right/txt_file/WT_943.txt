solutions which owns eight fitness clubs in north carolina and georgia our guiding principle has to be taking great care of our staff and our members and keeping them safe ryan said that doesn t include opening friday because i think that would be irresponsible he said ryan said officials haven t provided adequate information on what precautions gyms should take the business is also trying to obtain disinfecting supplies already running low before it closed in march plus masks and gloves for staff the governor s order has put additional pressure on businesses ryan said in addition to creditors and landlords possibly ending breaks there s fear of customers shifting to competitors that do open friday he said with soaring joblessness georgia officials loosened rules on unemployment
