round robin format can allow results to be manipulated to earn an easier matchup in the knockout round the chinese players tried to rig the draw after its second seeded pair unexpectedly lost to a danish team in the morning that placed the no 2 pair on course for a semifinal meeting with wang and yu instead of the final wang and yu then deliberately set out to lose so they would go into the bottom half of the draw they hardly exerted themselves and neither did the south koreans drawing jeers of derision from the crowd and warnings from the umpire and tournament referee torsten berg wang and yu eventually got what they wanted by losing an hour later the south korean team of ha and kim took to the court and decided to also try to lose to the indonesians to avoid meeting wang and yu in the quarterfinals early on all four players were warned by the umpire for not trying hard and berg returned and produced black cards to disqualify both pairs but the cards were rescinded on a promise of better play in the third game berg reappeared to urge them to finish and the indonesians ended up being better at losing than ha and kim who fell into the playoff they didn t want with the world
