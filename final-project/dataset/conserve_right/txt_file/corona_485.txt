national review transgender student s bathroom access case returns to court apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound trump s grotesque tweets sessions says trump s anger over russiagate recusal is not all unjustified but stands by decision brexit architect cummings defends decision to travel amid lockdown an irony of the coronavirus debate is that the more successful lockdowns are in squelching the disease the more vulnerable they will be to attack as unnecessary in the first place a growing chorus on the right is slamming the shutdowns as an overreaction and agitating to end them a good example of the genre is an op ed co authored by former education secretary william bennett and talk radio host seth leibsohn it is titled tendentiously and not very accurately coronavirus lessons fact and reason vs paranoia and fear they cite an estimate that the current outbreak will kill 68 000 americans then they note that about 60 000 people died of the flu in 2017 18 for this they thunder we ve imposed huge economic and social costs on the country this is obviously a deeply flawed way of looking at it if we are going to have 60 000 deaths with people not leaving their homes for more than a month the number of deaths obviously would have been higher much higher if everyone had gone about business as usual we didn t lock down the country to try to prevent 60 000 deaths we locked down the country to limit deaths to 60 000 or whatever the ultimate toll is jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription false playlist https cdn

at historic lows why did we work to find a treatment for hiv aids when so many of the people with the disease now have normal life expectancies of course it was precisely the actions we took that caused those welcome outcomes consider the perversity of their reasoning a different way if we had shut down the country a month sooner and there had been say only 2 000 deaths then on their terms they d have an even stronger argument i e we did all this and there were only a couple of thousand fatalities in other words the more effective a lockdown would have been the more opposed bennett and leibsohn would be to it as for the flu comparison it isn t as telling as bennett and leibsohn believe the 2017 18 season with 60 000 flu related deaths was particularly bad but the coronavirus might kill a similar number with the country on lockdown in the 2011 12 season 12 000 people died of the flu in the entire country new york alone has eclipsed that in a little more than a month again while on lockdown in 2018 19 there were 34 000 flu related deaths in the u s we ve already surpassed that number nationally yet again while on lockdown why have people reacted so dramatically to this virus bennett and leibsohn have a theory new york city is where the epidemic has struck the hardest the media is centered in new york city new york certainly gets disproportionate media attention but it is also as all of us had no hesitation recognizing on sept 11 2001 part of america if the disease struck smaller heartland cities such as omaha and wichita would bennett and leibsohn hope that the story got ignored bennett and leibsohn neglect the key fact that the economy began to shut down before there were widespread official orders people voted with their feet because they were fearful of a highly transmissible virulent disease and they acted rationally if everything had gone on as normal the outbreak would have been worse and we would have eventually had shutdowns anyway the most objectionable part of the bennett and leibsohn posture is its sneering attitude toward frenzied panicked ordinary americans who have sacrificed so much to protect their families and co workers and complete strangers by all means let s open up the economy as soon as we can but it will require more careful thought than the most fervent critics of the shutdowns have demonstrated during the peak of
