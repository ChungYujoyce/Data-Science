clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk the president s stances on climate multinational agreements and defense spending have struck a discordant note with western european powers like france and germany yet he s singing in tune with leaders from central and eastern europe many of whose nations were under russian sponsored communist dictatorships within living memory besides bulgaria he s welcomed leaders from the czech republic hungary romania and slovakia to the white house this year and he dispatched vice president mike pence to warsaw after hosting polish president andrzej duda and his wife in june analysts say mr trump sees a business opportunity with european leaders who cherish america and felt ignored by president barack obama yet risk falling under the influence of russia or china there s also a natural kinship between these leaders styles and mr trump s own they are nationalist relative to western europe and religious and have a certain esprit de corps that springs from that said peter rough a senior fellow at the hudson institute in d c once tucked behind the iron curtain the people in these nations have fresh memories of the cold war and relish their alliance with america they view the u s as a protector especially against russia in a way that bigger european powers might not these leaders see the chance of entering the white house and having a photo op with the u s president as a lifetime opportunity and a huge boost for domestic popularity and so they are eager to play along with mr trump s pretenses for grandeur said pavel baev a nonresident senior fellow at the brookings institution he said mr trump meanwhile gets a chance to perform the role of a world leader and command respect without giveaways or expenses from the u s treasury the relationship we have with bulgaria has been very strong great people mr trump told mr borissov eric stewart president of the american central european business association aceba said central european nations like the u s have an entrepreneurial spirit and are thriving spots for the tech industry and defense projects as mr trump pushes nations to spend at least 2 on defense as part of their commitment to nato bulgaria commits to provide due consideration to proposals from u s defense companies who wish to compete in the bulgarian market mr trump and mr borissov said in a joint statement mr trump in june treated mr duda to a flyover of f 35 jets after poland agreed to a deal to purchase 32 of the planes the leaders also agreed to move 1 000 u s troops poland as a deterrent to russia continuing a buildup of forces in the region that began under mr obama mr trump is diverting from his predecessor however by seeking closer political and economic ties with central and eastern europe the obama administration pivoted away from business with central europe and toward asia according to mr stewart that was their plan and they were very open about that he said in that strategy they went too far with some of the countries they even put sanctions on them you didn t have to leave them and treat them badly earlier this year mr trump hyped trade with romanian president klaus ioannis and pushed american energy investments in place of natural gas from russia the white house on monday highlighted bulgaria s efforts to produce natural gas with greece and u s plans to license the use of american nuclear fuel for the kozloduy nuclear power plant bulgaria is traditionally one of the poorer countries in the region but there s tremendous potential for economic growth in partnership with the united states a senior administration official told reporters before the visit we are particularly enthusiastic about working in the energy sector bulgaria has tremendous potential here and tremendous investment potential for u s companies as it seeks to decrease its reliance on russian energy and to diversify its energy sources some diplomats say closer ties with eastern europe must not come at the expense of cooperation with europe s traditional powers those divisions were on display earlier this year mr trump was supposed to visit denmark on the way home from poland though he canceled after the danish prime minister called his interest in buying greenland absurd mr trump then slammed copenhagen for failing to meet its nato obligation of spending 2 of gdp on defense poland is among eight of the 28 nato countries that have met the standard mr trump has continued to burnish his relationship with mr duda a populist who shares mr trump s skepticism of the european union and presides over a surging economy ready to do business with u s investors ukraine is a bit of an outlier in the president s charm offensive the administration argues it s done far more for the country than the obama administration but mr trump push to get its new president volodymyr zelensky to cooperate with probes into democrats and former vice president joseph r biden have put the ukrainians in an awkward spot mr trump in late july asked mr zelensky who had been seeking a white house visit to look into unfounded claims that ukraine is safeguarding a hacked democratic national committee server from 2016 the request is part of a house impeachment inquiry focused on ukraine critics say mr trump risks sending a mixed message touting u s manpower and energy investments to resist moscow even as he criticizes nato allies develops closer ties to strongman vladimir putin and calls for restoring russia s position in the g7 group of developed nations mr rough said that s just part of mr trump s negotiating style he wants to pull all the levers of power and then enter negotiation
