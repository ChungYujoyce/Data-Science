be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace anchor i aposm chris wallace the house judiciary committee takes over the impeachment inquiry will the white house participate begin videotape president donald trump the failed washington establishment is trying to stop me because i aposm fighting for you and because we aposre winning wallace as the intelligence committee wraps up its work

committee the top republican on the panel doug collins of georgia and democrat hakeem jeffries of new york only on fox news sunday then mayor pete buttigieg democratic presidential candidate well it aposs very encouraging but we aposre not going to let it go to our heads sen elizabeth warren democratic presidential candidate the same answer it aposs always been i don apost do polls wallace buttigieg up warren down we aposll ask our sunday panel about the top tier of 2020 democratic candidates getting reshuffled all right now on fox news sunday end videotape and hello again from fox news in washington president trump returns to the white house after a surprise trip to afghanistan and some golf in florida and right away he faces tough choices he must decide whether to send lawyers to participate in impeachment hearings conducted by the house judiciary committee meanwhile democrats on the intel committee will deliver their report making the case to impeach a president for the third time in american history in a moment we aposll talk with two members of the judiciary committee republican congressman doug collins and democrat hakeem jeffries but first let aposs get the latest from kevin corke live from the president aposs florida retreat at mar a lago kevin kevin corke fox news chris for the president there will be scant time to reflect on the thanksgiving holiday as his administration now braces for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry in a letter to the president chairman nadler issued a friday deadline for the white house to declare whether counsel intends to participate in the hearings and to specify if counsel will cross examine witnesses or present evidence that aposs two days after lawmakers expect to hear testimony from four scholars on the constitutional grounds for impeachment a process already being criticized by ranking member doug collins who wrote the committee asking that the witness list be expanded noting that it aposs less than a quarter of those called to testify during the clinton impeachment collins apos letter is just the latest example of the political and process tug of war playing out on capitol hill as the inquiry shifts to the judiciary committee from the intelligence committee whose members will be able to review a draft of their impeachment report on monday before voting to forward their findings on to chairman nadler tuesday for president trump the resumption of the hearings might seem a cold reality following a warm welcome by u s service personnel during his surprise visit to afghanistan on thanksgiving a brief respite from the war on terror to visit with the commander in chief and just ahead of his trip to the nato summit in london where two were killed and three were injured in an isis claimed attack on friday speaking of that trip to london the president said on twitter he aposll be there representing our country while democrats will be back here conducting the most ridiculous impeachment in history chris wallace kevin corke reporting from mar a lago kevin thank you joining us now the top republican on the judiciary committee congressman doug collins and welcome back sir to fox news sunday rep doug collins r ga good morning chris good to be with you wallace so as we said the chair of the judiciary committee jerry nadler has written you asking whether or not republicans want to subpoena any witnesses to testify on the president aposs behalf will you collins well we aposre going to take care of that we aposre making sure that we get out witness list in but let me just point out something here chairman nadler sent a letter asking us by friday to present this list and present all the things that we would like to do however we aposre not even going to see the schiff report as it aposs going to be known out of committee until tuesday night possibly even wednesday morning before we get to see it there aposs a lot of problems here that we have to investigate here as an attorney if you have a case going forward you want to know exactly what you aposre facing and chairman nadler is simply asking for an arbitrary deadline because we aposve not seen the schiff report we aposve not seen any we aposve not even heard from him what he actually wants to have for hearings this is just another example i think of him being told i need to do something and we go from there this is a problematic part for us to have to go forward with wallace okay but i just want to be clear in the first part of what you said will republicans on the committee call for subpoena witnesses to testify and if so who are you going to ask to testify collins oh of course we aposre going to testify the first and foremost the first person that needs to testify is adam schiff adam schiff is the author of this report adam schiff has been the author of many things a lot of them found to be false over the past couple of years but he aposs going to be the author of this report he aposs compared himself in the past to a special counsel this is what he said he was doing well if we go back to clinton and even back to nixon but in clinton ken starr was the special counsel he presented a report that we aposre going to get his judiciary he actually came and sat and testified under oath and took questions from all sides including the white house my first and foremost witness is adam schiff wallace so you want to bring him in before the committee not just to present a report but to take questions from democrats and to be cross examined if you will by the republicans collins he needs to be he aposs put himself into that position if he chooses not to then i really question his veracity and what he aposs putting in his report i question his you know the motives of why he aposs doing it it aposs easy to hide behind a report it aposs easy to hide behind a gavel and intelligence committees behind closed door hearings but it aposs going to be one another thing to actually get up and have to answer questions about what his staff knew how he knew what he did about the whistleblower report his interactions that he aposs had with ukraine the other things that he aposs had over time in this process and also why he has still not released documents to our committee and reports to our committee that we need to actually proceed in our committee of judiciary committee which is the committee of impeachment i have a question why are they hiding this stuff from us if they think they have such a case give us all the materials and don apost let jerry nadler write a crazy letter that says on the 6th let us know who your witnesses are we don apost even have the information from the intel committee yet this is why this is a problematic exercise and simply a made for tv event coming on wednesday wallace okay chairman nadler has also written to the white house asking if they want to have a lawyer to represent them at wednesday aposs hearing which is going to be with constitutional scholars and to actually mount a defense of the president the next week a week from monday do you know whether the white house is going to participate collins well i think they aposre still we aposre still looking at that but i aposm going to have a question for you chris why would they want to participate in a just another rerun we aposre back by the way in rerun season here in the judiciary committee we aposve already had constitutional scholars in the committee talking about from the mueller report and others is there an impeachable offense this is a complete american waste of time right here the problem is is jerry nadler and the rest of them have already got in their mind they aposre writing the articles of impeachment whether they have fairness or process or all so if the white house participates with a bunch of constitutional scholars which by the way i wrote a letter to chairman nadler why are we doing this on a normal three to one ratio if it aposs so important like we did in clinton where we had almost four times as many of these witnesses why don apost we at least get two for two why don apost we at least have more witnesses in this process wallace let me interrupt for a minute here because collins no problem wallace that aposs what you aposre saying is that three of the four constitutional scholars are going to be pro democrat pro impeachment and one of the four is going to be basically questioning whether or not there are grounds for impeachment collins that aposs exactly right that aposs what we aposre seeing here and look i think the problem is here is they aposre on a timeframe it aposs an internal kind of timeframe to try and finish this out by the end of the year because they want to get at this president right now before the before everybody completely sees through the process sham of the elections for next year so we aposre rushing this chris i don apost think the american people even if they support an impeachment inquiry or even trying to remove and overturn the votes of these 63 million people for this president they don apost think this is fair and i aposve talked to democrats who do not believe this is fair if the judiciary committee simply has a constitutional scholar hearing and then they have a presentation of a report by adam schiff and we go straight to a mark up that is a failure on chairman nadler of ultimate proportion because this is a failure of the judiciary committee to be able to talk to fact witnesses to be able to talk to the people that have actually been a part of this and actually have the president viably participate in his own defense which he aposs not had the opportunity to do now wallace okay okay collins to simply go ahead wallace laughs okay you aposre pretty wound up i got to say you obviously had some collins laughs wallace turkey this thanksgiving let aposs talk about collins and a little bit cranberries as well wallace okay well me too let aposs talk about the merits of this you say there aposs no basis to impeach the president i aposd like to play some of the key testimony that the house intel committee heard the last couple of weeks basically making allegations or stating evidence against the president take a look begin video clip amb bill taylor the meeting president zelensky wanted was conditioned on the investigations of burisma and alleged ukrainian interference in the 2016 u s elections male speaker it is improper for the president of the united states to demand a foreign government investigate a u s citizen and a political opponent male speaker mr giuliani aposs requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a white house visit for president zelensky end video clip wallace congressman collins before we get to the question of whether this is an impeachable offense or not simply do you see anything wrong with that the president conditioning support for ukraine whether it was a meeting whether with zelensky whether it aposs military aid conditioning support for ukraine to that country investigating some of the president aposs political rivals collins well i think it aposs interesting that the premise of your question is based on witnesses who agree with your premise i disagree and say that mr volker mr morrison even mr sondland who presumed it was being conditioned the president himself told senator johnson there was no pre condition there was nothing to be presented on this so if you want to show one side then also show the other side as we go along with this president trump has always been concerned about foreign aid he aposs always been concerned about what aposs going on in the ukraine in europe and how is europe participating and how our tax dollars wallace but collins the question is the question is though if we aposre looking at corruption does it matter who aposs involved that aposs the problem and the policy issue that got discussed in intel he was looking at the corruption part of this and yes if they were if the bidens were involved then they would have been a part of that but the problem is is there was never a discussion in intel that we saw as i just pointed out several key fact witnesses who actually said there was no conditioning on this so you can put wallace but let me collins put words inaudible wallace but let me ask you if i may sir because we aposre about to run out of time collins no problem wallace july 25th phone call where the between president trump and president zelensky he never mentions corruption and ukraine he never mentions burisma he just mentions investigate two americans and he names them joe biden and his son hunter collins well again if you look at the call itself there was an overall discussion which had been had previously about others in discussion with ukraine and also just go back to the fact of the president looks after our tax dollars and the president is looking out for the fact was there problems there when we look at this process we do not see a president who conditioned anything he just wanted the facts whether it be the 2016 election whether we aposre looking at of what was happening he was looking at the fact of is there corruption so i do not spend dollars that i don apost need to spend in the ukraine because of corruption that was still there wallace okay let me just collins this is an issue wallace let me just ask you a thought experiment just bear with me for a minute collins okay wallace if you believed that the president had used the power of his office to try to get ukraine to interfere with our elections if you believe that would that be an impeachable offense collins i do not believe it so that i aposm not going to answer a hypothetical in which it aposs designed to simply say that the president did something improper chris he did nothing improper there was nothing about a problematic giving aid to another country in which you aposre talking about corruption which he aposs required to do by law and it just so happened that a presidential candidate aposs son who was getting a massive amount of money from a company that had been under investigation in which even other witnesses that had been favorable quote to the democrats in the investigation have said needed to be looked at this is a problem of overall proportion but there aposs nothing here that the president did wrong and this is a thing that we aposre going to move forward on wallace okay i got one last question i aposve got a minute for it collins okay wallace a u s senate seat in georgia comes open at the end of the year johnny isaacson the senator there is retiring president trump has pushed hard for georgia governor brian kemp to appoint you as the senator but it appears from all reports that the governor is going to go ahead and appoint kelly loeffler a big republican and a financial executive to that seat instead what do you know about where this stands and if he appoints her and not you how are you going to feel about that collins well the governor still has that appointment to be made i appreciate the support that i aposve received from the president and many others but right now as you can see in this interview this morning i have a big job to do in the next three weeks and that aposs impeachment we aposll have to see where the governor goes with his pick and then we aposll have a decision to make after that but right now my full focus and attention is on impeachment and also as i look forward it is what it is best for georgia those will be the things that play into my mind but right now first and foremost is defending against this faux sham impeachment that we aposre going to get started on wednesday with wallace just real quick when you say you aposll have to make a decision after that if it happens does that mean that you might potentially run against her when she aposs up for re election collins well chris let aposs see what the governor does first i think he aposs heard from a lot of folks but if he does then that aposll be a decision we have to make at that point wallace congressman collins thank you thanks for joining us today collins no problem wallace always good to talk with you sir collins yes chris always good to be with you take care wallace up next we aposll get reaction from a top democrat on the judiciary committee as they make their case against the president congressman hakeem jeffries of new york joins us next commercial break wallace house democrats have invited president trump to send lawyers to participate in hearings starting this week as the judiciary committee decides whether to draft articles of impeachment against him joining us now from new york congressman hakeem jeffries a top democrat on that committee and congressman welcome back jeffries good morning chris great to be with you wallace let aposs start with what president trump said about the democratic impeachment effort at a rally this past week in florida here he is begin video clip trump the failed washington establishment is trying to stop me because i aposm fighting for you and because we aposre winning it aposs very simple cheers end video clip wallace congressman wouldn apost democrats have a stronger case against the president if you hadn apost been talking about impeaching him almost from the day he took office rep hakeem jeffries d n y well chris i disagree with that premise and as it relates to this impeachment inquiry that we aposre in right now we are here reluctantly the impeachment of a president is not something that we came to congress to do we came to congress to get things done to work with this president to drive down the high cost of life saving prescription drugs and we hope to be able to pass a bill in the house over the next three weeks that would do that we aposve actually indicated that we want to work with president trump to fix our crumbling bridges roads tunnels airports wallace all right jeffries and mass transportation system and to work with him on a re negotiated nafta agreement we aposve been clear about that from the very beginning wallace but congressman excuse me congressman but i mean the fact is almost since he took office first it was collusion with the russians the mueller report that it couldn apost make a case there obstruction which democrats still believe is the case now ukraine there aposs been an awful lot about investigating the president impeaching the president removing the president since he took the oath of office jeffries well the house is a separate and co equal branch of government we don apost work for this president or any president we work for the american people we do have a constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and balance on a potentially out of control executive branch that is not the democratic party playbook that in fact is the james madison playbook madison indicated that the house should serve as a rival to the executive branch because the founders didn apost want a king they didn apost want a dictator they didn apost want a monarch they wanted a democracy so we do have a responsibility to defend our democracy we aposre here at this moment right now because the president decided to pressure a foreign government to target an american citizen for political gain and at the same time withhold 391 million in military aid from a very vulnerable ukraine which is an ally to the united states and is still at war with russian backed separatists in crimea that aposs why we are at this moment chris wallace but congressman democrats have been making that case you aposve been making your best case to the public for two months now you just finished 30 hours of televised hearings 12 witnesses and the public apparently isn apost buying it at this point i want to put up a recent poll back in early october people approved of impeaching and removing the president by a margin of 52 percent to 46 now after you have presented your evidence it aposs 48 percent for and 50 percent against and you know while you could argue that those are well within the margin of error it aposs clear that there is none of the bipartisan support that speaker pelosi said for months was essential to impeachment jeffries well the most recent poll that i saw actually had 50 percent of the american people supporting the impeachment inquiry and the potential removal of the president 43 opposed more significantly i think 70 percent of the american people indicated that the president did something wrong that said our job is to follow the facts apply the law be guided by the u s constitution and present the truth to the american people no matter where it leads because no one is above the law that aposs what we have been doing that aposs what we are doing that aposs what we aposre going to continue to do moving forward wallace all right i want to get to some of the issues i discussed with congressman collins judiciary chair nadler has asked the white house whether they want to participate in this first hearing on wednesday this coming wednesday with four constitutional scholars let me ask you a question first who are the witnesses that the democrats are calling jeffries well that aposs a question that aposs best directed at chairman nadler the committee hasn apost been provided that information yet i think they aposre still trying to work out the details even my good friend congressman collins didn apost indicate who the republican witness will be so that remains to be seen my expectation wallace let me pick up on that though how can you ask the white house to participate in a hearing three days from now when they don apost even know who the witnesses are going to be and by your own admission three of them are going to be for you and one of them is going to be for president trump i mean how is that a fair process jeffries well it aposs not my understanding that three of them are going to be for me we aposre for the truth i think wallace when i say you i aposm talking about for the impeachment for jeffries right wallace they aposre going to side with the democratic view of impeachment jeffries well three witnesses consistent with the congressional rules will be called by the majority on the house judiciary committee and then one witness as congressman collins indicated will be called by the minority that is wallace but why three to one jeffries consistent with wallace why not two and two jeffries the current house rules well that aposs something to be discussed but what aposs most important is let aposs have a discussion chris about the 12 fact witnesses who have already testified all of whom were members of the trump administration ambassador volker trump appointee ambassador sondland trump appointee ambassador taylor trump appointee dr fiona hill trump appointee jennifer williams trump appointee wallace all right jeffries lieutenant colonel vindman trump appointee all of whom confirm the central allegations here of the wrongdoing engaged in by the president with respect to pressuring a foreign government to target an american citizen that is the abuse of power that we are concerned about that act undermined america aposs national security wallace chairman nadler has also asked the white house not just for this hearing this week but whether or not they want to participate they have a deadline of this coming friday on this whether they want to participate in hearings starting a week from monday december 9th to mount a defense of the president but house democratic leaders are already talking about all right next week the week of the 9th by the end of that week that the house would have voted out articles of impeachment and then the following week the last week before christmas that the full house will vote on whether or not to impeach the president i guess the question is how fair is that it looks like all right a week from monday come in mount your defense and by the end of the week we aposre going to impeach you jeffries well no timeline has been set as a member of the house democratic leadership and a member of the judiciary committee i can tell you that the only thing that speaker pelosi has said and she said a very solemn somber and serious tone is that we are going to proceed expeditiously that aposs because this matter relates to an urgent of a matter of urgent concern that was set forth by the inspector general to the intelligence committee another trump appointee and we aposre just going to be guided by the truth at the same time we want to give the president every opportunity to present exculpatory information wallace so what so let me just pick you up on that sir are you saying that if the white house decides to fully participate and they say we want to call a half a dozen witnesses we want to take this on into the past the first of the year which is not that long a period of time from now i mean this has moved at warp speed are you saying you personally would be okay with that jeffries well we aposll see what happens i mean we need to be guided by the truth if they come forward with relevant witnesses i think we all may want to hear from john bolton we all would like to hear from mick mulvaney wallace how about jeffries we aposd like to hear from wallace how about jeffries the secretary of state wallace joe biden and hunter biden would you like to hear from them jeffries well i think that if they aposre relevant but the reality is chris if you look at the testimony from ambassador taylor for instance what he said and this is a west point graduate this is someone who was a vietnam war hero and a reagan administration appointee subsequently appointed by trump he said that there was no legitimate national security reason for withholding the aid no legitimate public policy reason no legitimate substantive reason if the president would like to come forward and present an actual witness who can provide some exculpatory information as to why the aid was withheld we all would welcome that wallace okay got a couple of minutes left while the judiciary committee at the same hour that you aposre holding your hearing this wednesday president trump will be overseas in london at the nato summit representing this country do you have any problems with that jeffries well again we have a constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and balance that means that we do need to investigate evidence of wrongdoing much of which is hiding in plain sight we have the july 25th phone call that the president himself made and pressured the ukrainian government with the words do us a favor though at the same time withholding the 391 million without justification but we also want to continue to work with this administration you know the american people pay five or six times the amount as other countries who are developed for the same drug often manufactured in the same location that aposs wrong the president has indicated that wallace well no but i jeffries we should give the federal government the power to negotiate wallace i was just asking whether jeffries we want to work with him on that wallace you had a problem with the juxtaposition you aposre discussing whether to impeach the president while he aposs representing the country overseas jeffries well we aposre giving the president every opportunity to participate in the impeachment inquiry in a very fair and balanced way wallace we like that phrase fair and balanced here at fox congressman jeffries one final question for you as you mentioned you aposre a member of the house democratic leadership at this point do you know for certain of a single republican who is going to vote to impeach this president jeffries no we haven apost had that conversation but ultimately every single member of the house of representatives is going to have to decide whether they want to put principle over party whether they want to put the constitution ahead of corruption this is about abuse of power this is about national security this is about the undermining of the integrity of our elections this is about betrayal and this is about the united states constitution we aposll see what people decide to do moving forward wallace congressman jeffries thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sir jeffries thank you chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss what to expect in those big impeachment hearings starting this week plus what would you like to ask the panel about whether the white house should send lawyers to participate just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up mayor pete buttigieg goes from an underdog to a frontrunner according to new polling begin video clip buttigieg our message is resonating here i think because iowans are looking for bold future oriented vision end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the latest shakeup in the 2020 democratic race commercial break begin video clip trump and now the same maniacs are pushing the deranged impeachment think of this impeachment impeachment a witch hunt the same as before end video clip wallace president trump blasting the ongoing impeachment hearings and receiving a strong response at a rally this week in florida and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz fox news political analyst juan williams former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the wilson center and rich lowry of national review and author of the new book the case for nationalism all right we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of whether the president should send a lawyer to participate in the impeachment hearings we got this on facebook from greta kraft she writes since the president and republicans have consistently expressed concerns about due process doesn apost it behoove the president aposs counsel to attend these hearings and participate to their full ability congressman chaffetz how do you answer greta should the president send a lawyer to represent him and the white house at the hearings starting this week former rep jason chaffetz r utah i do think the president should send an attorney but it is ridiculous that given these hearings on wednesday we don apost even know who is going to be who are the witnesses going to be i think this process start to finish has been a sham but at the same time the president should send counsel they do have no idea how this process is going to move forward except we know they aposre going to go as fast as they possibly can rather than getting it right wallace yeah i was going to ask you because hakeem jeffries was talking about well you know we will just follow the whatever the wherever the truth leads us but on the other hand the timeline they aposve got is all right president you can mount your defense and then we aposre going to impeach you chaffetz they haven apost gotten the report out of the intel committee and the republicans are supposed to name who their witnesses is going to be i mean you can kind of guess the direction they aposre going to go but they aposre going for speed rather than getting it right i don apost think they should be moving forward on this at all i just think it aposs a whole sham and i think the president aposs making a good point and they have not converted a single republican throughout this process wallace congresswoman harman the white house officials have said from the very start this is an undue process and they aposre suggesting this call now well why don apost you bring in your lawyer to represent the white house and present a defense is simply to try to add some credibility to an unfair process do they have a point former rep jane harman d calif well i think the process is being rushed at this point it is the clock next year is an election year and that aposs a problem but i think as speaker pelosi said she was reluctant to do this it was the facts that drove the democratic majority whether the rest of you agree or not to this point i think one of the problems is there are three committees involved instead of just one committee which was the case in both the nixon and the clinton impeachments i was a member of the house during the clinton impeachment and it aposs a very tough and miserable process and the people pushing it paid a severe price so what do i think now i think the names of the democratic witnesses should be public this minute and i think the white house i agree with jason should participate in the clinton case the white house presented a 30 page document making its case wallace well and they also got to cross examine ken starr the independent counsel harman again it was a different process there was an independent counsel there wasn apost an independent counsel here wallace well the argument could be you could interrogate adam schiff who was harman well i you could i think that aposs an awkward idea but i think that his report and the names of the witnesses should be public immediately wallace okay chaffetz adam schiff should have to he should have to be there answer questions about why we aposre not hearing from the so called witness all of these types of things wallace you mean whistleblowers chaffetz whistleblower yes harman you mean the whistleblower well i think because the law protects him or her wallace let me bring the other half of the panel in rich house democrats really do seem to have a tight timeline rich lowry national review yes wallace two weeks of hearings the end of not this week but the following week articles of impeachment and there aposs the final week before christmas vote to impeach i here aposs the question i have at this point which is a bigger political risk for democrats risk for democrats to go ahead and vote to impeach or to decide to pull back and go for something lighter like censure lowry they aposve crossed the rubicon long ago they have to impeach it aposd be extremely dispiriting to their base it aposd be humiliating in fact if they didn apost do it for some reason at this point i think the main process concern here chris is they aposre not going to take the time to actually try to get any of the firsthand witnesses that have direct knowledge of this matter and the president aposs statements and state of mind mick mulvaney the acting chief of staff rudy giuliani any of these people because it might take you know another two months or so and i think a lot of the process arguments at the moment will be forgotten in the fullness of time but the fact that they aposre sending a flagrantly incomplete factual record to the senate on this most you know consequential constitutional process that will be remembered and i think that aposs why history will look dimly on this process and it aposs just sheerly because it doesn apost work on their political timeline wallace on thursday president trump paid a surprise visit to u s troops serving in afghanistan here he is begin video clip trump there aposs nowhere i aposd rather celebrate this thanksgiving than right here with the toughest strongest best and bravest warriors on the fact of the earth you are indeed that end video clip wallace juan as i was watching that and we were all surprised when suddenly we heard the president was in afghanistan i aposm sure he genuinely wanted to support the u s forces those wonderful men and women who are defending us on the frontlines in afghanistan on the other hand i also thought because everything is political doesn apost it make it a little bit harder to impeach the president when you see him right there acting as our commander in chief juan williams fox news well the reports this week were that he aposs emulating bill clinton who stayed busy during the impeachment hearings and did so quite to his political profit but remember clinton aposs travels didn apost stop newt gingrich from impeaching president clinton so it doesn apost it aposs not you know determinative but it has this political spin that you put to it but the other part of the political spin is that with trump it seemed and i think this is why you had the thought i certainly had it that it looks like a photo op remember he hadn apost gone to visit any war zone until last year he was criticized for it this is his first visit to afghanistan our longest war 2 000 plus americans dead he had no preparation he talked about a cease fire but his military people said we know nothing about any ceasefire with the taliban and the taliban said they know nothing about a ceasefire he then talked about negotiations with the taliban and again his own diplomats said we know nothing about any ongoing talks with the taliban the president canceled talks with the taliban last september if you aposll recall after they were engaged in a violent incident so it seems to me that if you come back home and say because this picks up on what you were talking about with congressman jeffries why don apost we get things done you know you think about well why is it that the president hasn apost moved on prescription drugs why is it the president hasn apost wallace why hasn apost the house moved on usmca williams yes exactly that aposs where i was going so the big victories for him would be if he can get a trade deal usmca or the china trade deal but that thing he aposs simply saying hey give me this opportunity so that i can somehow distract from the reality of impeachment hearings chaffetz the democrats continue to play into the hands of donald trump because no matter what the president does he visits our troops in afghanistan he aposs going to go to the nato meetings next month then they aposre going to complain that that aposs just wallace not next month this week chaffetz i mean next week that is so fundamentally wrong and again somehow going into 2020 donald trump looks like the victim he looks like the washington d c outsider and that he will gain more political support it will what the democrats are doing speaking simultaneously harman i don apost think that aposs speaking simultaneously wallace wait let congresswoman harman williams you guys made the case harman thank you thank you williams i mean rich made this case as well oh it aposs obstruction but democrats aren apost bringing forward witnesses who was obstructing who was harman all right williams keeping mulvaney from harman so so williams testifying harman so let aposs go to usmca the democrats have made some good points in the house and those changes are being vetted with canada and mexico i salute president trump for trying to get that done correctly i also think he was right to go to a war theater for a three and a half hour visit should have stayed a little longer and maybe worked harder on the taliban negotiations so he knew what he was talking about wallace well wait wait harman and he wallace no president male speaker laughs yeah wallace spends a lot of time in the harman well three and a half wallace unintelligible as if they aposre negotiating harman no but he should have worked at on the wallace i mean did barack obama spend overnight in harman i aposm not saying he wallace iraq or afghanistan harman that he should negotiate with the taliban but i aposm saying he should have known he should have been brought up to date on where we were he is the one who called off the negotiations but on nato i think he should go to that that those talks were set two years ago wallace okay harman by theresa may and hopefully male speaker inaudible wallace all right harman progress will be made lowry as a practical matter speaking simultaneously wallace not that anybody ever gets the final word but i aposm going to try lowry as a practical matter he aposs going to come back home and he aposs not going to be above it all anymore he aposs going to be tweet live tweeting the hearings so he aposs never going to fully adopt the bill clinton strategy and juan on these witnesses no white house aids in its own impeachment and there aposs at least a colorable case that there are legitimate privilege claims for these witnesses the courts should decide but democrats don apost want to wait because they aposre on a political timetable so they aposre going to have a partisan impeachment vote on a political timetable wallace panel we have to take a break here when we come back another terror attack on london bridge the suspect a man already convicted of terrorism who was recently released and 2020 politics elizabeth warren dropping sharply in a new national poll as the democratic race gets another shake up commercial break begin video clip buttigieg it aposs very encouraging but we aposre not going to let it go to our heads there aposs still a long way to go warren so it aposs the same answer it aposs always been i don apost do polls i aposm out here fighting every day on behalf of working families end video clip wallace 2020 democratic candidates pete buttigieg and elizabeth warren reacting to recent polls showing he is surging and she is dropping and we aposre back now with the panel so let aposs look at the national quinnipiac poll that came out this week joe biden is solidly in first place as you can see but the news is what happened behind him buttigieg went from fourth to second in the last month in this national poll while warren went from first to third and as you can see went all the way from 28 to 14 and lost fully half of her support juan what happened to warren and how seriously do you think we should take buttigieg as a potential democratic presidential nominee williams well i think you take him pretty seriously he aposs also done very well in fundraising which we didn apost mention there but he aposs a leader in terms of fundraising which is a surprise to many people because he aposs clearly not a leader in the polls even though he aposs been rising i think warren is the one that came as a shock to me chris as you said losing 50 percent of her support principally among white educated democrats who previously were tremendous boosters for her so the other thing that strikes me as the headline wallace let me just ask you specifically about that williams yeah wallace don apost you think the problem i don apost think it aposs coincidental is she came out with her medicare for all plan how much it aposs going to cost how she aposs going to pay for it and people didn apost like it williams people did not like the prospect of losing your private insurance but i think even more so her whole sort of raison d aposetre for her candidacy is i have a plan i have a way to deal with this issue and when people were asking her how do you plan to pay for this people found it unacceptable they did not like the plan and so i think that undermined her thesis if you will wallace all right then there is former new york city mayor michael bloomberg who aposs now officially in the race a video surfaced in the last few days of him making a speech last year in which he seemed i don apost think seemed he did favor regressive taxes taxes that hit the poor more harshly especially on issues like cigarettes and sugary drinks take a look michael bloomberg the problem is in people that don apost have a lot of money and so higher taxes should have a bigger impact on their behavior and how they deal with themselves so i listen to people saying oh we don apost want to tax the poor well we want the poor to live longer so that they can get an education and enjoy life wallace so rich basically tax the poor so they won apost do the things to harm themselves that they would do if they had the money how do you think that aposs going to go over with democrats lowry i don apost think well laughter and this is not a gaffe in the sense of misspeaking this is something he legitimately believes it aposs rank paternalism and goes to how there aposs something to dislike about the bloomberg candidacy for everyone republicans don apost like the taxes democrats don apost like the taxes on the poor and pretty much everyone likes soda so i just think this campaign is preposterous the idea he aposs going to wait out the first four contests and then swoop in you know on a 100 million ad buy i just think is ridiculous and is going nowhere wallace okay let aposs turn to the terrible scene we all saw on friday of this holiday weekend a man stabbed several people on london bridge killing two of them the man in the foreground is walking away with the knife some bystanders subdued the attacker but when police told them to back off the man flashed a suicide vest which turned out to be fake and the police and we froze it there shot and killed him and there was another attack in which a man in the netherlands stabbed three teenagers they aposre all going to be okay congresswoman harman while all this is going on isis put out harman yeah wallace photos of what it said are new isis recruits it appears despite the attack and the takedown on their isis leader al baghdadi isis isn apost going away is it harman i they aposre not going away and our new strategy or non strategy on syria means that isis will go through the porous turkish border and some of the fighters will return to europe some of them are european and these attacks are going to go up so first of all kudos to the brave citizens who made this you know put the extinguisher wallace they took the guy down one person had a fire extinguisher harman a fire extinguisher wallace and someone had a narwhal which is a kind of whale a long pointed narwhal tusk and was harman well but kudos wallace they took him down harman to them wallace no absolutely harman for being brave they took him down and then the cops came and took him out because he was wearing a suicide vest so i think that was the right strategy wallace well we should point out a fake suicide vest harman a fake suicide vest turned out to be fake but no one believed that at the time at any rate i think we need more brain cells focused on isis i think our policies are making it more like that isis will reemerge in europe and i think that copycat attacks can happen which is why let aposs not denigrate the intelligence community which is trying to get ahead of this let aposs not do things with the navy that make the pentagon really question whether the commander in chief is making good decisions and let aposs please reinstate our relations with allies who are the ones who are going to keep us safe and let aposs confirm if we can all these vacancies at the homeland security department wallace congressman chaffetz you know as we saw the baghdadi attack now these attacks and there aposs no indication that it was anything other than individual people we aposre not even sure in the netherlands that was a homeless person but this fellow no reason to believe at this point that he was working under the direct orders of isis but it aposs still out there and i can keep thinking of bush 43 who said this is a war the war on terror that aposs going to last generations chaffetz it was terrorism we need to call it out as terrorism wallace absolutely chaffetz and let aposs understand and i aposm certainly not blaming democrats in any way shape or form but when the house intelligence committee spends all their time over here focused on trump trump trump they are not doing their job and what they should be doing and looking at the spread of terrorism and isis and these types of things around the globe there is an opportunity cost to how the democrats have been spending their time and they aposre not working on these things that will actually cause terror around the world wallace well as a former ranking democrat on the intel committee is that fair or not harman well i don apost know what they aposre doing with a lot of their time because those hearings are classified and closed as they should be but i surely chaffetz but they aposre not even having them harman well but the bigger point is that we need more brain cells on the terror target it aposs coming here to isis is not over and to claim that it aposs over i think will shortchange u s security wallace rich do you worry that president trump on the trip to afghanistan is talking about making a deal drawing down troops we certainly are pulling back from syria that all of that is creating a breathing space for terrorists lowry yeah that would be the word so this is a dangerous group dangerous ideology we need to keep our boot on its neck in the middle east and trump aposs reflex is to liquidate our presence in the broader middle east where we actually figured out in recent years a way with minimal forces to defeat the caliphate and to keep isis on the run so it aposd be a mistake to pull out those forces wallace juan williams i think that aposs exactly right and it aposs a rare moment of bipartisanship in washington where most people say what are you doing why are you doing this the president aposs explanation chris obviously is he promised to get us out of these never ending wars and it aposs pretty popular with the american people but the execution is the where the rubber meets the road so to speak and in the execution he has not been sufficient in saying here aposs how i aposm not only dealing with isis but i aposm dealing with the russian larger presence now in places like syria i aposm dealing with wallace but he did deal with isis he killed baghdadi williams no no no but stopping lowry and unintelligible caliphate williams yeah but stopping saying that i have eliminated it is an overstatement that aposs like a mission accomplished you know reiteration rich and it serves people to think oh it aposs done away and it aposs not done away in fact it aposs a cancer that spreads pretty much through social media as they continue to recruit and use incidents like the one in london to somehow say to people yeah we should be doing this lowry and next week aposs important meetings with nato should not be overshadowed by a democratic congress that is trying to impeach a president laughter talking simultaneously chaffetz someone is on message this morning laughter wallace unintelligible go ahead harman no i mean nato is an important organization we are a keystone part of it and i hope that president trump makes that clear when he goes over and that he fully supports article v which is problematic now that he aposs met with erdogan and given erdogan a pass with respect to wallace article v an attack on one country is an attack on all countries harman right that aposs buying russian wallace i aposm very proud of myself inaudible laughter all right we aposll see you next sunday up next our power player of the week once again i dance with the turkeys commercial break wallace here aposs a holiday riddle we ask every thanksgiving who founded a huge tech company created a successful cosmetic business and now raises turkeys like the native americans did once again here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape sandy lerner farm with the land farm with the seasons know your soil know your rainfall know your weather know your animals wallace sandy lerner is talking about sustainable farming raising livestock and growing vegetables without the chemicals that are so common in what she calls factory farming just days before thanksgiving she took me out to see and yes to dance with her 1 300 turkeys heritage breeds that trace back to the indians lerner come on raise your arms gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble wallace lerner is mistress of ayrshire farms 800 acres in upperville virginia but as interesting as her business is how she got here she grew up on a farm in california making enough from raising cattle to send herself to college lerner what i learned was to love work i aposm really happiest when i aposm engaged and working and thinking and am striving wallace she got into computers in 1984 she and her then husband started cisco systems that found a way to link networks of computers the foundation of the internet but six years later venture capital people were running cisco how do you get fired from a company that you started lerner we just basically got taken to the cleaners and part of that was if you don apost have an employment contract i got fired by the same guy who fired steve jobs wallace laughs lerner had a second act she started a cosmetics company called urban decay with edgy colors for women like her and in 1996 she bought ayrshire farm lerner it aposs historically been people who had disposable income who made strides in farming look at george washington or look at thomas jefferson you aposre such a pretty girl because pretty is as pretty does wallace she raises shires warhorses that go back centuries scotch highland cattle and those turkeys which she says taste better because of the lives they lead how much does an ayrshire turkey cost as compared to what i aposd get in a grocery store lerner well our turkeys are expensive they aposre between i think they aposre running this year about 160 to 200 wallace at those prices there are questions about how to make this kind of farming profitable but while lerner is determined to run a sound business it aposs not just about the bottom line there aposs a 40 room mansion on the farm what aposs it like living there lerner i don apost know wallace what do you mean lerner i live in a little log cabin and i love it wallace do you think you aposre a bit eccentric lerner i am now that i aposm rich i used to just be weird wallace and so just days before thanksgiving sandy lerner and i danced with a turkey she grew up on a family farm and
