tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion in this latest episode of prosecutors gone wild special counsel robert mueller performed what can only be described in legal terms as pulling a jim comey like the disgraced fbi ex director and admitted leaker and liar mr comey mr mueller has never been elected to so much as dog catcher he has zero political authority whatsoever still like mr comey before him mr mueller thirsts for the limelight as president trump once said of mr comey mr mueller is a showboat top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots both men covet the political stage where mr trump holds more authority than any other single politician in the country if this is confusing read the constitution mr trump is the one and only elected official in the entire executive branch and he is the only politician save for his runnng mate vice president who is picked by a national electorate legal bureaucrats like james b comey and robert mueller while revered and worshipped as saviors inside the beltway don t have the authority book a conference room in a public building without ultimate approval of mr trump and at any moment mr trump has the authority to fire any one of them again see constitution piddling little worker bee drones like disgraced fbi ex agents peter strzok and lisa page are bureaucratic pissants who have even less authority in fact the whole reason donald trump got elected in the first place was to fire people like james comey and robert mueller and all their attendants flush the whole fetid nest of liars kleptocrats and power drunks down the stinking sewer starved for attention mr mueller made an entirely unnecessary yet politically provocative foray into the political spotlight wednesday he himself admitted that his appearance before the cameras or if hauled before congress would provide not one shred of new information any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report it contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made he said we chose those words very carefully and the work speaks for itself and the report is my testimony i would not provide information beyond that which is already public so then why speak now why speak at all the answer it appears is the same as mr comey s decision to stick his twisted oar repeatedly into the political waters during the 2016 election when he laid out a damning case for why democrat hillary clinton should be prosecuted for her illegal server yet would not be maybe he wanted to cover himself with all the delusional swamp rats for why he did not charge the president with anything maybe he just wanted to display once again his barely concealed contempt for mr trump maybe he just wanted to see new footage of himself on television whatever the reason mr mueller s statement did not change a single fact he still spent two years and was given unfettered access to the entire administration and produced not a whiff of evidence that president trump or his campaign colluded with russia to rig the 2016 election on the issue of obstruction he found plenty of examples of a highly exasperated mr trump being very exasperated over wasting two years and tens of millions of taxpayer dollars chasing down a bunch of ridiculous nonsense but that is not obstruction of justice that is called being president and donald trump is the only person who got elected 2016 to carry out those duties contact charles hurt at emailprotected or on twitter ch
