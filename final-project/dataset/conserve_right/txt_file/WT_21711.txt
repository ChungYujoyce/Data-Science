apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic billionaire environmental activist tom steyer reversed himself tuesday and jumped into the crowded race for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination sidelining his quest to oust president trump through impeachment and instead betting he can beat mr trump at the ballot box mr steyer s entry into the race gives democrats their own outspoken deep pocketed outsider harshly critical of the way politics is practiced a liberal mirror image of mr trump s 2016 campaign the 62 year old hedge fund manager is reportedly poised to spend at least 100 million of his estimated 1 6 billion fortune on the race after having dumped an estimated 120 million into the 2018 midterm congressional elections making him the democrats biggest financial angel of all time top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey yet he cast his campaign tuesday as an effort to combat big money influence in washington americans are deeply disappointed and hurt by the way they re treated by what they think is the power elite in washington d c and that goes across party lines and it goes across geography the new candidate said in a video announcing his decision we ve got to take the corporate control out of our politics his campaign also indicated that he will continue his focus on climate change a long running interest it s not clear what policy space mr steyer will carve out in the overcrowded democratic primary field washington gov jay inslee is focusing his campaign on climate change and a host of candidates including sens bernard sanders and elizabeth warren are driving the corporate corruption message dan callahan a top democratic party official in buchanan county iowa said he was surprised to see mr steyer jump into the race it doesn t seem like his message is terribly different than some of the other ones he said warren s got 60 staffers in iowa a couple of the other people have 40 or 50 it s going to be pretty hard to get a campaign for iowa so the strategy obviously is going to be to survive iowa and move on mr steyer does bring one major advantage though while others are begging donors for money he has already booked more than 1 million in tv ad space in the early presidential states of iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina according to the tracking firm advertising analytics that s the thing that makes him different than any other candidate in the race at the moment is that he s able to spend that amount of money right away said neil sroka a spokesman for the liberal group democracy for america mr sanders on wednesday said he likes mr steyer personally but that people are sick and tired of big money in politics i am a bit tired seeing billionaires trying to buy political power the senator from vermont said on msnbc i like tom he is a good guy he s a friend of mine but i m not a great fan of billionaires getting involved in the political process business career seeking to blunt such criticisms mr steyer highlighted the fact that he and his wife have pledged to give away half of their wealth to charitable causes if this is a banana republic with a few very very rich people and everybody else living in misery that s a failure he said mr steyer made his fortune at investment firm farallon capital management and announced he was stepping away in 2012 in 2013 he launched nextgen climate a nonprofit advocacy group for climate change the group has since rebranded as nextgen america despite his focus on climate change mr steyer s former firm invested in the fossil fuel companies that far left activists want to run out of business mr steyer said in 2013 that one of the reasons he stepped away was that he no longer felt comfortable being at a firm that was invested in every single sector of the global economy including tar sands and oil in 2016 his wealth earned him favored status with the hillary clinton campaign according to hacked emails from campaign chairman john podesta that were posted by wikileaks the clinton campaign debated how to have mr steyer raise money personally even while running nextgen which was operating as an independent expenditure group mr steyer was pondering a presidential bid last year but said in january that he wouldn t take the plunge he said he wanted to focus on impeaching mr trump and ran a series of commercials to personally argue the case yet impeachment talk was nowhere to be found tuesday mr steyer s campaign did not respond to questions about why he ultimately decided to reverse course and get into the 2020 race his first challenge will be to convince the party s energetic left wing base why he is a better choice than mr sanders ms warren or mr inslee his late entry is notable said adam green co founder of the progressive change campaign committee the decision to get in this late means a candidate must look at the entire diverse field and think i alone can win this said mr green whose group has endorsed ms warren especially for a rich white male this decision should be gut checked in a major way mr steyer is unlikely to make the stage for the second democratic primary debate later this month and will need to attract support from at least 130 000 individual donors to qualify for the next one in september that s going to be the biggest challenge for him is that folks have been running for six months mr sroka said you ve got a number of grassroots powerhouses in the race and just getting the funding total even with the money he s going to bring to the race is certainly going to be a challenge last year before he announced his decision to forgo a bid he polled at 0 in a national cnn survey and a cnn des moines register poll in iowa fivethirtyeight a prognostication outfit said it s not rating mr steyer as a major candidate john couvillon a louisiana based pollster said the best comparison for mr steyer is not mr trump but rather former new york mayor michael r bloomberg another billionaire who has poured tens of millions of dollars into pet issues such as gun control and who pondered a presidential run but ultimately decided against it in this case tom steyer did make the jump mr couvillon said he s always wanted to influence politics like michael bloomberg except now he feels there s an opportunity where mr trump tapped a populist sentiment and bucked the republican party establishment mr steyer hews closely to traditionally liberal causes and ideals the question in my mind is with a lot of candidates in the race what steyer is going to bring to the table that s not already being brought to
