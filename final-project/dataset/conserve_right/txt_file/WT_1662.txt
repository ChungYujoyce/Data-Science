apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion former new york city mayor michael bloomberg would be foolish to choose anyone other than sen amy klobuchar of minnesota as his running mate in the presidential race he s not foolish america needed a manager in 2016 and got one in donald trump differences in goals and priorities aside with mr bloomberg america can have a different manager and one of considerably more means top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century when a newly merged wall street investment firm showed him the door in 1981 he used his rainy day stash of 10 million to help found an outfit that now employs 20 000 people worldwide by march 2009 he had turned that 10 million into 16 billion 1 600 times his original investment as of now mr bloomberg has grown his company and investments to the point where his net worth tops 61 billion that s his cash plus what he can get for all his buildings land bonds and stocks minus the money he owes can you wrap your brain around 61 billion no well he can t either it s way too big for mortal minds more than 6 000 times his original 10 million investment mr bloomberg s 61 billion is 30 times president trump s net worth says forbes magazine it s also umpteen times massachusetts sen elizabeth warren s 12 million net worth former vice president joseph r biden s 9 million vermont sen bernard sanders 2 5 million ms klobuchar s 2 million and andrew yang s measly 1 million there is one nomination chaser whose net worth you can wrap your brain around former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg s 100 000 which sinks him 20 000 leagues under his democratic presidential rivals so why ms klobuchar who s as caucasian as they come and not california sen kamala d harris who has african heritage and was a brief hit on the democratic presidential look at me debate circuit because ms harris the first debater to stab slow joe comes off as a brutus in drag the last thing the top of a ticket wants anywhere near him ms klobuchar connects with people but not well enough to pose any attention grabbing threat to mr bloomberg on his july 17 to nov 3 general election slog at last recount she placed fifth in the iowa caucuses two mondays ago a final definitive tally is expected one hour before end times ms klobuchar is a fiddle made for second she has the policy savvy to match her political savvy minnesotans whose average january temperature is 4 degrees fahrenheit warmed to her enough to award her three six year terms in the u s senate and she is one of those rare democrats not in perpetual danger of falling off the left edge of the american political stage but wait there s less at 5 feet 4 inches ms klobuchar will stand less tall by 4 inches than mr bloomberg requisite optics for the two person ticket game that doesn t stop america s insulter in chief who stands 6 feet 3 inches in his cashmere socks from calling his probable fall opponent mini mike probable opponent will turn actual in milwaukee this july when 1 990 delegates and 775 superdelegates take a final look at the field then drop to their knees and beg the founder of bloomberg lp to be their standard bearer mr bloomberg is betting a billion or two on it the question is whether mr bloomberg will wither under mr trump s searing sizzle or have the donald s extraordinary personal appeal on a cold rainy monday before the new hampshire primary on tuesday mr trump upstaged the whole democratic field his presence filled the overflow area outside a manchester arena that holds about 11 000 people ms klobuchar won t help mr bloomberg attract crowds like that but as the senior senator and former district attorney from minnesota she does connect with people but not with enough dazzle to bring unease to the top of the ticket and she ll be 60 by the july nominating convention perfect old enough to have accumulated wisdom but not so old that she can t remember half of it like some other democrat who ll go unmentioned here but can mr bloomberg compete with that trump sizzle lavish spending by mr bloomberg on his anti gun crusade and his nanny state preachments probably won t work in crucial electoral college states that mr trump captured in 2016 remember mr bloomberg got city lawmakers to put a lid on the ounces of sugared beverages that could be sold in the five boroughs over which he ruled for 12 years as new york s thrice elected mayor he got smoking banned in restaurants bars hotels and everywhere else but people s own homes he also proposed banning cellphones in schools an absolutist on the holiness of free trade he could undo whatever fairness to the u s that the president has managed to add another potential problem for mr bloomberg is that his social liberalism has at times made him look untethered from the real world he supported the building of an islamic complex near ground zero after the sept 11 2001 terror attacks it knocked his approval rating for a loop most depressing for some of his more moderate admirers is that as mayor he favored stop and frisk now he s apologizing for it mr bloomberg has plenty of pluses like warm conservative hearts on taxes spending and budget balancing to me fiscal conservatism means balancing budgets not running deficits that the next generation can t afford he said in a 2007 speech to the british conservative party it means improving the efficiency of delivering services by finding innovative ways to do more with less cutting taxes when possible and prudent raising them overall only when necessary to balance the budget and only in combination with spending cuts he told his tory audience it means when you run a surplus you save it you don t squander it he added bring tears of joy to those brits enduring a labor party majority at the time that was then he s now saying he wants to raise taxes on the rich but for conservatives and many independents the biggest feather in his cap if he wore one would be his sticking with school choice and charter schools private and public which teachers unions rightly see as ways to break their deadly stranglehold on public education what likely will cripple him in the electoral college are his firearms phobia his wanting to create a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people democrat speak for illegal aliens and the now even more invincible looking mr trump as an incumbent that gives the mike and amy team a shelf life of nine months and
