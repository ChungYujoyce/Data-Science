gubernatorial results reaction and analysis from howard kurtz fox news media analyst and host of mediabuzz one of the few things journalists like more than pushing liberal agenda items like gun control and abortion is celebrating when democrats win elections one year after president trump s shocking upset victory the media are still trying to overturn the result that meant they had much to cheer when democrats did well election night this week msnbc s lawrence o donnell described the evening by saying it feels like tonight s history is being written by movie writers it is so dramatic that was pretty much the attitude across news and entertainment media nbc s today host matt lauer called it a stinging rebuke for trump the network s white house correspondent kristen welker liked that term so much that she used it too saying the election was voters first strong rebuke of president trump professional democrat and abc s good morning america co host george stephanopoulos argued that voters wanted to send a message to president trump pretend conservative matthew dowd who is one of the most annoying people on tv called it an election of diversity and inclusion over at the view warning watching too much could lower your iq co host joy behar proclaimed it makes you feel better about the country today certainly if you are one of the hosts at the view who are almost all laughably liberal eight years earlier when democrats lost with obama in office the media sang a different tune then cnn white house correspondent suzanne malveaux told american morning it is not a referendum on this president bet news host jeff johnson went on cnn s larry king live noting the truth that such elections tend to be a referendum against the ruling party that fact was certainly downplayed this week the virginia governor s race was marred by a racist and shockingly disingenuous ad by the latino victory fund the washington post editorial board pretended virginia s gubernatorial election tuesday was a victory of decency civility and moderation over fear dread and barely veiled racist coding but latino victory had released a commercial that depicted supporters of virginia republican gubernatorial candidate ed gillespie as confederacy supporting truck driving racist murderers who attack minority children according to real clear politics abc gave it 13 seconds of air time and the new york times buried it in an article attacking gop ads 2 media still can t cover shootings the texas shooting was the story of a crazed atheist who killed 26 people and was stopped by an nra trained good guy with a gun who thanked god for his skills i bet you already know the punch line that wasn t how it was depicted in the press trump even made what cnn called the apos good guy with a gun apos argument which annoyed editor at large chris cillizza sen ted cruz r texas took a swing at the media over their coverage and summed things up nicely there is a reason why there is public distrust of the media because the immediate focus is on a political agenda of gun control and that was precisely what the media did interspersed with absurd comments such as usa today s bizarre and much mocked claim that you can get a chainsaw bayonet on an ar 15 apparently this is a videogame attachment so we know what usa today staffers do during their spare time we also witnessed the very same media that had attacked trump for politicizing the new york city terrorist attack turning around round and doing the exact same thing about texas but that was ok it was a liberal agenda item there was abc arguing for extreme vetting on guns cnn s nutty liberal host don lemon whined that thoughts and prayers didn apos t stop the attack and cnn s alisyn camerota said it was absurd that trump was pushing the same old nra talking point about the good guy with a gun apparently she missed the memo about what actually happened in texas 3 an actual fish story poor fishermen are notorious for exaggerating the size of the fish they catch now it s journalists too but journalists just make up their fish stories entirely trump was in japan to meet with prime minister shinzo abe and they went to a photo location to feed koi fish the next thing you know twitter and several media outlets were freaking out that trump made a classic ugly american gaffe here s cnn s headline trump feeds fish winds up pouring entire box of food into koi pond cnn s veronica rocha took the jayson blair prize for most manufactured news event she wrote then with a look of enjoyment trump quickly poured his entire box of food into the pond only she admitted after abe who actually appeared to dump out his box of food ahead of trump in reality the two leaders took turns feeding spoonfuls of food and then dumped the remainder abe first but rocha tweeted a gif that cut abe out so you couldn t see him dumping first it was all about trump cbs and nbc joined in with this embarrassment this is why ordinary americans don t and can t trust traditional media 4 weinstein story ensnares times kudos to the new yorker for its piece on harvey weinstein s army of spies it
