on should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the media usually describes conflicts such as the war in syria as fluid volatile or uncertain a more accurate description would be foreseeable on the basis of the events that preceded them the recent actions of president trump and turkish president erdogan are a case study in foreseeable primary and secondary effects during their october 6 conversation mr erdogan renewed his frequently repeated demand that the united states pull our troops out of northeastern syria mr trump agreed to withdraw about 50 to make way for a turkish force he thus green lighted turkey s invasion of the area and emboldened mr erdogan a few days later after turkish artillery fire bracketed a u s outpost there intentionally not accidentally hitting both sides of it mr trump decided to pull all of our approximately 1 000 troops from the area top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches hogan says maryland can begin testing residents for covid 19 without appointment symptoms mr erdogan riding a wave of popularity at home believed correctly that he d won a major confrontation with the united states he celebrated by revealing that the turkish invasion of northeastern syria was in fact an ethnic cleansing campaign according to the financial times mr erdogan said his government was in discussions with russia with which he and iran had joined in a treaty to protect syrian leader bashar assad about the strategic arab majority town of manbij the ft quoted mr erdogan as saying the town needed to be emptied of the kurdish terrorist organizations that control it in the october 6 call mr trump couldn t have been surprised by mr erdogan s demand that we withdraw from syria which mr erdogan has been demanding since mr trump became president that demand along with mr erdogan s signing the treaty with russia and iran his purchase of russian s 400 missile systems forbidden by the united states and his islamization of formerly secular turkey deprived of credibility mr trump s threat to obliterate turkey s economy with economic sanctions if it took objectionable action in syria mr erdogan s invasion order and that his forces would not stop before all u s troops were driven from the area were entirely foreseeable mr trump s decision to impose only minor sanctions against turkey was a form of vacillation that weakened america s position that effect seemed to be worsened by the president sending vice president pence and secretary of state pompeo to ankara to plead for a cease fire after mr erdogan rejected the idea mr trump wants to withdraw u s troops from all the conflict zones in the middle east to end the endless wars he campaigned against in 2016 that s a laudable idea but he apparently doesn t understand that you can t expect a positive result from any war that you abandon to the enemy as i have written on this page unless america fights a war in a manner calculated to win it decisively we will lose it inevitably the president s errors are very serious but so are mr erdogan s having entered into a 2016 treaty with russia and iran to defend the assad regime and having purchased the highly sophisticated s 400 anti missile anti aircraft systems mr erdogan apparently believed he had secured russia s cooperation in his ambition to establish turkey as a major power but his dreams of a new turkish caliphate were quashed quickly not by us but by russia mr erdogan intended to occupy and ethnically cleanse an area 32 kilometers deep in syria a week into the turkish invasion russia said any such invasion was unacceptable and announced that its troops would prevent fighting between syrian and turkish forces russia thus put an end to mr erdogan s territorial ambition that action is a blunt message from russian president putin to mr erdogan that its territorial gains in syria are far more important to russia than mr erdogan pretends it to be having established russian power in the middle east by its huge footprint in turkey mr putin is not about to allow mr erdogan to even slightly whittle away at it instead of turkish troops eliminating kurdish people in manbij the town is now occupied by syrian troops abandoned by the united states the kurds have sought and are obtaining some protection from the assad regime mr erdogan s victories small as mr putin is making them are becoming ever costlier to us and to him one of the clearly foreseeable results of our abandonment of the kurds is the release of at least 10 000 isis fighters from camps in which they had been held by u s and kurdish forces there will be a major isis resurgence in syria and wherever those people can travel russia and iran are again foreseeably the other big winners in syria having already established major bases and power centers in western syria they are now able to expand into the northeast russian troops have already occupied a base abandoned by ours some european nato members are making noise but will do nothing significant to penalize mr erdogan that s because he has threatened to open the gates for hundreds of thousands of syrian refugees to get to europe causing another immigration crisis like the one that began in 2015 the europeans won t risk that the 120 hour cease fire agreement with mr erdogan that mr pence announced thursday enables the retreat of kurdish forces from a safe zone to be occupied by turkey however it does nothing to ensure that the 10 000 isis fighters remain in captivity it also promises that mr trump will not only decline to impose further sanctions on turkey he will remove those that had just been imposed it looks like another costly victory for mr erdogan jed babbin a deputy undersecretary of defense in the george h w bush administration is the author of in
