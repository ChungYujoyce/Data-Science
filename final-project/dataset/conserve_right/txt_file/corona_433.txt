the brennan center for justice which is heavily financed by george soros is calling for democrats to spend 250 million to educate voters about any changes that will allow vote by mail in the upcoming presidential election advocating an advertising campaign about those changes in non english languages the recommendations are part of the brennan center s updated 4 billion nationwide funding blueprint for voting reform during the coronavirus pandemic democrat lawmakers have cited the brennan center s coronavirus voting plan as influencing their legislative proposals while the news media has routinely spotlighted the radical proposal with other soros financed groups the brennan center has been leading a campaign advocating a vote by mail system in the upcoming presidential election citing fears that coronavirus makes it too dangerous to vote in person some of the groups are using the coronavirus crisis to push permanent changes to the way americans vote analysts have posited that such proposals help the democratic party republicans specifically fear the prospect of voter fraud since mail in voting would be harder to authenticate the original brennan center coronavirus voting reform plan released last month was budgeted at 2 billion this past week the center doubled that estimate to 4 billion explaining its original lower cost breakdown did not include the cost of ensuring the safety and security of the many other statewide and local elections that will occur throughout 2020 the brennan center s plan calls for a universal vote by mail option for all voters the budget estimates 54 million to 89 million for increased ballot printing and 413 million to 593 million for extra postage costs to alert the public about changes to the voting method the brennan center wants a 252 1 million public education campaign which must include advertising in non english languages brennan also wants 85 9 million to bolster online voter registration and it advocates implementing same day registration the brennan blueprint allows for mail in ballots to be processed prior to the close of polls on election day the document lobbies for polling place modification and preparation including same day registration real time address updates and provisional balloting for certain individuals brennan doesn t define which certain individuals should receive same day registration one section seeks the use of drop boxes to deposit ballots on voting day calling for jurisdictions to offer secure drop boxes in accessible locations for voters to drop off ballots directly the plan doesn t delineate rules for where such drop boxes could be located already california colorado oregon and washington use drop boxes statewide and have various locations set up that are not located at official in person balloting stations the estimate allocates 82 million to 117 million for drop box purchase and installation and some 35 million to 47 million for operation and maintenance drop boxes must be equipped with adequate security measures such as cameras the budget states without providing more specifics about security for the boxes brennan also advocates expanded early voting with states offering at least two weeks of early in person voting or a minimum of five days this would be a massive undertaking but i think it s absolutely necessary to make sure that we are prepared to run our elections in november and i think all the problems we have been having in primaries in the last few weeks is evidence we need to start now said lawrence norden the director of election reform at the brennan center and one of the report s authors democrat sens amy klobuchar mn and chris coons de cited the brennan center s coronavirus voting plan in a letter to house and
