what is the greatest threat to free and fair elections in america here s a hint it s not russia or any other foreign power it s not a person either it s something much more subtle and much more dangerous investigative reporter eric eggers has the answer hundreds of counties across the united states have more registered voters than people legally eligible to vote 29 states have counties with more registered voters than legal residents and eight states have more registered voters than voting age people when the supreme court upheld ohio s efforts to clean up its voter rolls in 2018 the majority opinion cited pew center statistics 24 million voter registrations in the united states are either invalid or significantly inaccurate and nearly 3 million people are believed to be registered to vote in more than one state during an undercover investigation new york city detectives attempted to cast illegal ballots based on flawed voter rolls 63 times and were successful on 61 of those attempts in 2016 the state of california became the first state to legalize the practice of ballot solicitation or ballot harvesting the collection and delivery of ballots by third parties organizations with clear political agendas are permitted to go to a location for example a nursing home or church to collect or harvest ballots the third party then transports these ballots to election officials the practice opens up the possibility of the politically motivated organizations altering or discarding ballots in the first major election after ballot harvesting was allowed in california democrats won every congressional seat in orange county which had been a republican stronghold for decades on election night 2018 california central valley republican congressman david valadao held a 5 000 vote lead over his challenger democrat t j cox in a historically conservative district however late ballots delivered by third party vote harvesters broke overwhelmingly for cox who ended up winning by 862 votes according to a 2015 rasmussen study of likely voters 53 of democrats supported granting illegal immigrants the right to vote democratic national chair tom perez one worked for a group called casa de maryland a longtime advocate for expanding non citizen voting rights related video campaign finance reform corrupts george will while federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections eleven democrat run states currently allow noncitizen voting of some kind some democrat controlled cities including chicago and san francisco allow noncitizens to vote in certain city wide elections related video the myth of voter suppression jason riley related video money in politics what s the problem george will the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that voter registration rolls are widely inaccurate and vulnerable to fraud as the supreme court highlighted in 2018 tens of millions of voter registrations in the u s are either invalid or significantly inaccurate and nearly 3 million people are believed to be registered to vote in more than one state so called ballot harvesting which allows third party organizations with political agendas to collect ballots and transport them to election officials has opened the door to massive fraud while federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections eleven democrat run states currently allow noncitizen voting of some kind including in certain city wide elections while the major media fixates on the influence of foreign powers on american elections a much more serious attack has been taking place right under our noses good old fashioned home grown voter fraud let s look at three of the worst offenses example number one bloated voter rolls in 244 counties across the united states there are more registered voters than there arepeople legally eligible to vote twenty nine states have counties with more registered voters than legal residents and eight states have more registered voters than actual voting age people when the supreme court upheld ohio s efforts to clean up its own voter rolls in 2018 the majority opinion cited pew center statistics 24 million voter registrations in the united states are either invalid or significantly inaccurate and nearly 3 million people are believed to be registered to vote in more than one state these numbers have a shocking implication it s very easy to exploit our voting system during an undercover investigation new york city detectives made 63 attempts to cast illegal ballots based on flawed voter rolls they were successful 61 times similar investigations in other cities and other states produce the same dismal results but phony voters on the rolls is just one threat to election integrity here s example number two ballot harvesting in 2016 the state of california one of the states with more registered voters than citizens became the first state to legalize the practice of ballot solicitation that is the collection and delivery of ballots by third parties with no trace of irony this is called ballot harvesting it works like this in california organizations with a clear political agenda are legally permitted to go to a location say a nursing home or a church and collect literally harvest ballots the third party then transports these ballots to a polling place or an election office this raises an obvious question once this third party collects the ballots what s to stop them from changing them or from just throwing out the ones they don t like a guilty conscience how do we know ballot harvesters from democratic organizations aren t destroying republican ballots or republican harvesters aren t destroying democratic ballots we don t we have no way of knowing let s look at one specific example on election night 2018 california central valley republican congressman david valadao held a 5 000 vote lead over his challenger democrat t j cox the margin was wide enough that the networks even called the race for valadao the republican incumbent but wait there were late ballots still to be delivered by the third party vote harvesters when those votes came in they broke so overwhelmingly for cox in a historically conservative district no less that valadao s 5 000 vote victory became an 862 vote loss maybe that was just a coincidence or maybe not in the first major election after ballot harvesting was allowed in california democrats won every single congressional seat in orange county which had been a republican stronghold for decades a year earlier no sober person would have thought that possible voter corruption example number 3 voting by non citizens should you have to be a citizen to vote silly question right it was once not anymore according to a recent poll more than half of democrats 53 support granting illegal immigrants the right to vote forget the legal ones democratic national chair tom perez before working for the obama administration worked for a group called casa de maryland which has been a longtime advocate for expanding non citizen voting rights yes it s true that federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections but 11 states all run by democrats currently allow noncitizen voting of some kind cities such as chicago and san francisco for example allow noncitizens to vote in certain city wide elections why because for progressives demography is destiny and many see illegal immigrants as future voters so there you have it three different ways to tamper with the vote bloated voter rolls ballot harvesting voting by non citizens these are just three ways in which the left creates a clear advantage for itself on election day the major media will tell you that corrupt voting practices either don t exist or are so minor they don t matter but to believe that you have to believe two things that voter registration rolls are accurate and secure from fraudulent registrations and that no one is trying to manipulate the results for political purposes those are two very big leaps maybe you want to make those leaps because you like the results they produce but if you care about free and fair elections no matter which party you belong to you need to pay attention or pretty soon free and fair elections will be a quaint relic of the past no foreign government can undermine our democracy
