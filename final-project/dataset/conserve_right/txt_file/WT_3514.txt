apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic governors may not have a vote on whether to impeach the president but those who would be governor have different opinions on how much that should matter to voters in the three southern states that will choose a chief executive next month the republican candidates strongly oppose congressional democrats efforts to impeach president trump and are trying to pin down their democratic opponents on the issue the democrats running in the states which trump carried in 2016 would prefer to talk about something else consequently while impeachment won t be part of the gubernatorial duties it is part of the gubernatorial debate top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century on monday kentucky gop gov matt bevin again raised the issue with his democratic opponent democratic attorney general andy beshear on social media the bevin campaign released a video renewing calls for absent andy beshear to be honest with kentuckians and state once and for all whether he supports impeaching and removing president trump from office as 95 of congressional liberals vow to impeach andy refuses to answer the simple question of whether he agrees with his own party that president trump must be removed from office the bevin campaign said mr bevin this month at the capital railed against media he considers supportive of the democratic campaign saying the press has allowed mr beshear to skate on the biggest political topic of the day mr trump who won kentucky in 2016 with 62 5 of the vote remains popular in the bluegrass state when asked where mr beshear stood on the question his campaign referred the washington times to a statement it released after mr bevin s frankfort press conference as andy beshear has already said publicly numerous times he is the state s top prosecutor and relies on evidence and fact it reads just like many other kentuckians the only information he has right now is what he s seen in different news reports he believes that if congress moves forward any proceedings should be nonpartisan and focus on facts and evidence mr beshear s move is smart politics experts said beshear is probably wise to deflect questions on

republicans counter that the democrats are dodging the biggest political issue and the republican governors association has tried to connect the dots between outspoken anti trump politicians who have pushed for impeachment and the democratic campaigns in mississippi republican lt gov tate reeves is a staunch supporter of mr trump and has noted that the democratic candidate attorney general jim hood has ties to groups driving the impeachment narrative such as california attorney general xavier beccera who has made something of a cottage industry suing the trump administration hood has taken huge donations from resistance leaders the very people pushing this impeachment campaign spokesman parker briden told the washington times tate has been firm that this is a sham and mississippi deserves a leader who won t back down to the national democrats jim hood has proven that s all he ll ever do that may strike some as thin connective tissue yet there is no question mr hood has tried to distance himself from his democratic party s lurch toward impeachment hood is not touching impeachment said douglas bristol a history professor at the university of southern mississippi who based his conclusion on discussions with hood supporters at the college s homecoming he wants to win republican support so there is little reason to bash trump in a state mr trump carried with 57 8 of the vote mr hood presents himself as a pickup driving hunter the hood campaign has issued a blanket statement when asked about impeachment that offers little clue about how mr hood would vote or thinks
