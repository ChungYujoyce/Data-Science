president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping there has been much speculation on which topics their conversations will address and it is a safe bet that taiwan will be on the list the u s taiwan relationship is a vital one and it is necessary especially in this time of change and uncertainty to restate the reasons why thirty eight years ago this month the taiwan relations act tra an important bipartisan creation of the u s congress was signed into law necessitated by washington switching its official diplomatic recognition from taipei to beijing the tra has allowed the united states to maintain its friendship and ties of cooperation with taiwan and its people it states that the status of taiwan should be determined by peaceful means and that nonpeaceful means to do so are a threat to the region and of grave concern to the united states at the same time the tra recognized and continues to recognize the reality of the world in which we live one where beijing has never renounced the use of force to take taiwan and where it engaged first in a massive military build up across the taiwan strait and now in the waters of the east and south china seas the tra mandates that the united states make available to taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable taiwan to maintain a sufficient self defense capability and we have done so in the decades since with bipartisan support top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in

further bolstered through the six assurances made to taiwan by president ronald reagan in 1982 which stipulated the tra would not be altered the united states would not mediate between taipei and beijing and the united states would not alter its position about taiwan s sovereignty or formally recognize china s sovereignty over taiwan as a result of u s commitments to taiwan an environment was created where the people of taiwan the population of which is now more than 23 million built a true functioning democracy that has experienced the peaceful transfer of power from one political party to another three times since 2000 at the presidential level and for the first time at the legislative level last year americans who have visited taiwan or worked with taiwanese people know that the reason the relationship is so strong is because we share many of the same values a commitment to democracy personal freedom individual expression and the rule of law taiwan has concurrently grown into a vibrant society garnering achievements in science and technology education the arts and popular culture that have been exported and embraced by people elsewhere in the region and around the world in every sense the tra and the relationship that has been built upon it have been successful just as taiwan has benefited so has the united states and the wider global community taiwan today is not only one of america s most dependable allies in the asia pacific and its 10th largest trading partner but it is an example for emerging democracies everywhere and a leader in providing humanitarian aid in times of need all this in spite of the regrettably limited international space in which taiwan is allowed to operate at a time when democracy appears to be in retreat in many parts of the world taiwan demonstrates how it can be a success as american diplomats and foreign policy experts have pointed out time and again the u s commitment to taiwan underscores to america s friends and foes its commitments to its allies and to democracy and helps to maintain u s credibility abroad in the five months since the u s presidential election there has been needless uncertainty regarding u s policy on china taiwan and cross strait relations before his confirmation earlier this year secretary of state rex tillerson reaffirmed the tra and the six assurances and said the u s commitment to taiwan is both a legal commitment and a moral imperative this was a positive first step this week s trump xi meetings are an opportunity for the president to both publicly and privately make the same important points u s engagement with china is important to the peace and stability of the asia pacific region but it is also vital that the mutual interests of the united states and taiwan should not in any way be compromised by this process lester wolff is a former chairman of the asian and pacific affairs subcommittee of the house foreign affairs committee and was a principal author of the taiwan relations
