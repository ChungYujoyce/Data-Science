tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion a 2002 movie called minority report featured a 2054 society where members of a specialized police force called precrime searched out and arrested suspects who were identified by a trio of psychics precogs as poised to commit vicious crimes poised meaning not yet committed did you get that suspects were apprehended pre crime based on figments of psychics imaginations this is how the democrats and nancy pelosi s impeachment inquiry into president donald trump rings the precog forces of the far left are demanding trump s impeachment for impeachable crimes he s not even committed for what minority report would have chalked up as pre crimes top stories trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sound stupid it is but just look at the democrats own words what is an impeachment inquiry after all except the left s special way of announcing they re going to go on a hunt for impeachment worthy crimes this president has supposedly committed so they can then punish him for those crimes by impeaching him they believe trump they want to believe trump has committed offenses worthy of impeachment so they re going to search and search and search until they can destroy in that regard democrats and shamefully even some republicans have been staging an impeachment inquiry into trump since day one since before day one in april of 2016 politico ran a report that speculated on all the pundits politicians and media types who were busily speculating on the chances of trump to be impeached trump it should be noted wasn t even nominated as the republican party candidate of presidential choice until july 19 2016 at the republican national convention fully three months after this politico report was published it s one thing for a president to raise red flags of criminal behaviors or even questionable deeds to heights that warrant deeper scrutiny it s another thing entirely for a faction of the political forces in this country to use their hatred of a president to justify constant queries and inquiries and investigations in hopes of turning up the goods the latest look see involves ukraine and a whistleblower a whistleblower who wrote a nine page document outlining information that may or may not point to trump s crossing of legal lines that may or may not indicate impeachable offenses committed by trump but that definitely was based on hearsay and that was definitely based on the hearsay of unidentified sources that the new york times has identified this whistleblower as a cia official doesn t exactly bolster the allegations on the truthfulness scale john brennan who headed up the cia until january of 2017 when trump took office has spent his down time filling his twitter feed with as much anti trump messaging as can fit in the allotted character count in one of his latest hewrote just weeks ago the stain donald trump leaves on our nation s soul should be a constant reminder that we cannot assume candidates for public office have the competence integrity decency americans deserve in 2020 we need to elect someone to safeguard strengthen democracy not trample it and let s not forget jim comey peter strzok lisa page not to mention the ones we still don t know working steadily secretly and silently to unseat this president at this point in time is it even feasible to expect the american people to believe anything that comes out of u s intelligence agencies particularly when the things that come are cloaked in anonymity carried by an openly anti trump press it d be nice to believe but honestly the hostility of the left and the contamination of our intel agencies make it tough as a smart guy just said to me impeachment inquiry is a phrase the anti trumpers can use to keep impeachment talk going well into election season even knowing full well they don t have the goods to impeach that s a concise summary just so the voters are clear though impeachment inquiry is not really a real thing it s a hunt for an impeachable offense it s tantamount to a fantasy hollywood movie drama about pre crime if the left actually had the stuff to impeach there would be no talk of inquiry there d be votes and action there s be nothing secretive or speculative about it cheryl chumley can be reached at emailprotected or on twitter
