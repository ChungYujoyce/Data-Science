minnesota democratic rep ilhan omar claimed on twitter sunday that 40 percent of people in the united states have less than 400 in their bank accounts april 6th 2020 the claim also made recent appearances in comments by sen bernie sanders an article published by salon and a national interest article among other media exploring the economic impact of coronavirus the 40 percent number seems to be pulled from the federal reserve s report on the economic well being of u s households in 2018 which found that 61 percent of americans said they would be able to cover a hypothetical expense of 400 using cash they had on hand savings or a credit card which would then be paid off on their next statement in that same report 27 percent of respondents said they would cover the expense some other way such as carrying a balance on their credit card or borrowing from friends and family and 12 percent said they would be unable to cover the expense at all the report notes however that a lthough so many incurring additional costs for a modest expense is disconcerting it is possible that some would choose to borrow even if they had 400 available preserving their cash as a buffer for other expenses in other words the study was a self reported record of how people would respond to an unforeseen additional 400 expense it did not directly address whetherrespondents had 400 in their bank account in fact the report cites a study based on the 2016 survey of consumer finances by neil bhutta and lisa dettling which found that even with monthly expenses included 76 percent of families have at least 400 in liquid savings this directly contradicts omar s claim even if this statistic were true however it still wouldn tserve as a good indicator of how well most americans will be able to withstand the economic distress brought on by the current reality the study that omar cited used 400 to represent small unexpected expenses individuals might face but that number is likely far lower than the financial shortfall faced by many americans during a prolonged economic shutdown without a clear end date to address this question the bhutta and dettling study offered a far better and more dire indicator noting that only about 40 percent of families have liquid savings equivalent to at least three months of expenses and less than 30 percent have liquid savings equivalent to at least six months of expenses there is no evidence to support rep omar s claim that 40 percent of americans don t have 400 in their bank accounts but her general assumption that most american families do not have the funds to subsist for an extended period of time during an emergency is almost certainly correct if you have a claim you would like to see us fact check please send us an email at factcheck thedispatch com if you would like to suggest a correction to this piece or any other dispatch article please email corrections thedispatch com photograph of ilhan omar by olivier douliery afp getty images we sent an email to with a link to finish logging in this claim and others made by the left is only to justify more taxes more govt control and shaping of society the claim women only make 80 cents on the dollar to men has been largely debunked but no one reports it a dept of labor study looked in to it women choose family children over money they may decline a promotion if it means more time away from family they are not as ladder climbing as men due to child care responsibilities while some positions have exact titles experience isn t always exact they looked at other items like north slope oil driller high paying dangerous job that most women wouldn t be interested in it has been against the law since the 60 s to pay someone different pay due to their sex i would like to see examples the only one i know is between actresses and actors yes hollywood that bastion of liberalism thanks for providing additional context regarding our ability to weather the current crisis failed to load posts
