tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap the cloud that has hung over president donald trump since the day he walked into the white house has been lifted yes special counsel robert mueller left open the question of whether trump tried to obstruct the investigation yes separate federal probes still put trump and his associates in legal jeopardy and yes democrats will spend the coming months pushing for more details from mueller all while launching new probes into trump s administration and businesses but at its core mueller s investigation gave the president what he wanted public affirmation that he and his campaign did not coordinate with russia to win the 2016 election after spending months tweeting no collusion trump had been proven right top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender gop vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid the findings summarized sunday by the justice department are sure to embolden trump as he plunges into his re election campaign armed now with new fodder to claim the investigation was little more than a politically motivated effort to undermine his presidency it s a shame that our country had to go through this trump said to be honest it s a shame that your president has had to go through this mueller s investigation stretched on for nearly two years enveloping trump s presidency in a cloud of uncertainty and sending him into frequent fits of rage the scope of the probe was sweeping mueller issued more than 2 800 subpoenas obtained nearly 500 search warrants and interviewed 500 witnesses including some of the president s closest advisers and trump s ultimate vindication on the question of collusion with russia came at a steep cost the investigation took down his campaign chairman his white house national security adviser and his longtime lawyer it revealed the extent of moscow s desire to swing the 2016 contest toward trump as well as trump s pursuit of business deals in russia deep into the campaign and the justice department didn t explain why so many trump associates lied throughout the investigation but in the end mueller concluded that those lies were not an effort to obscure a criminal conspiracy by trump and his advisers to work with russia there was smoke and plenty of it including an eyebrow raising meeting between trump s son and a russian lawyer but ultimately no fire good day for the rule of law great day for president trump and his team said sen lindsey graham r s c bad day for those hoping the mueller investigation would take president trump down democrats quickly sought to puncture trump and fellow republicans jubilation vowing to subpoena mueller s full report which remains a secret after spending years questioning trump s ties to moscow the democrats focus is shifting to the question mueller pointedly left unanswered whether trump obstructed the investigation by firing fbi director james comey and dictating a misleading statement about his son s meeting with the russian lawyer the fact that special counsel mueller s report does not exonerate the president on a charge as serious as obstruction of justice demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying documentation be made public without any further delay house majority leader nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer said in a joint statement the fight for those documents will be lengthy and contentious particularly against the backdrop of the 2020 presidential election it will involve complex debates over the rules that govern special counsel investigations which put a member of trump s cabinet in charge of summarizing mueller s findings for the public and a president s right to keep his private discussions out of the public eye previewing the case democrats will make to get more details about trump s actions house judiciary chairman jerry nadler d n y declared executive privilege cannot be used to shield or hide wrongdoing for trump and his associates the argument will be far simpler democrats already tried to go after the president once and failed just as important a victory as this is for president trump this is a crushing defeat for democrats and members of the media who have pushed the collusion delusion myth for the past two years that officially ends today said jason miller a former trump campaign official trump s legal troubles are far from over federal prosecutors in manhattan are pursuing at least two criminal inquiries involving the president or people in his orbit one involving his inaugural committee and another focused on the hush money scandal that led his former lawyer michael cohen to plead guilty last year to campaign finance violations new york attorney general letitia james is also looking into whether trump exaggerated his wealth when seeking loans for real estate projects and a failed bid to buy the nfl s buffalo bills but in the hours after mueller s findings were released those investigations appeared to be a world away for trump as he walked into the white house sunday night he pumped his fist to a group of supporters and declared america is the greatest place on earth the greatest place on earth editor s note julie pace has
