that if wisconsin gov scott walker survives his recall election tuesday it will be much harder for president obama to keep the state in the democratic column in the november election if mr obama loses wisconsin the gop says it changes the entire electoral college map and the democratic incumbent could pretty much kiss a second term goodbye the wisconsin theory is one of many being bandied about now that the general election between mr obama and mitt romney the presumptive republican nominee is under way top stories postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud australian researchers see virus design manipulation you are not going to die from covid 19 the candidates respective camps party leaders and armchair politicos are busy poring over the complex puzzle that is the electoral college in hopes of gleaning insight into how mr obama with his higher favorability ratings or mr romney more trusted on the economy can put together the winning strategy to get to 270 electoral college votes republican national committee chairman reince priebus predicts that if wisconsin goes red in november it will mean lights out for mr obama others surmise that as virginia goes so goes the nation yet others claim that much like previous elections this contest will boil down to what voters do in florida and ohio on the electoral college chessboard every vote in every state and the district of columbia 130 million were cast in 2008 translate into 538 electoral votes to win the electoral college and thus the election a candidate must pull in 270 electoral votes in the case of a tie the u s house chooses the president and the u s senate picks the vice president with five months to go political junkies generally think the election will be decided by the outcomes in nine battleground states colorado florida iowa nevada new hampshire north carolina ohio virginia and wisconsin the good news for mr obama for now he has an edge in most electoral college tallies but the president s edge is shrinking in these so called tossup states all of which the democrat captured in 2008 last week s jobs report which showed the nation added a dismal 69 000 jobs in may won t help mark s mellman a democratic pollster said mr obama would be in trouble if he loses pennsylvania new mexico minnesota or wisconsin which are generally viewed as friendly democratic turf but that s not likely mr mellman said he predicts the president is headed for at least 300 electoral votes more than enough to win obama has a lot more routes to 270 than romney does and as a mathematical matter the more routes you have the more likely you are to get there he said if romney doesn t win ohio or florida it is very hard for him to get there in fact it is very hard for him to get there without winning both ohio and florida both of those states offer mr romney potential running mates sen rob portman of ohio and sen marco rubio of florida and both states have proved to be crucial to successful white house bids in recent elections if al gore had picked up 537 more votes in florida in the 2000 election he would have bested george w bush four years later the two states arguably stuck a fork in john kerry s presidential dreams today robert t bennett ohio gop chairman said there are signs that mr obama is losing ground in ohio particularly among independents and voters in appalachian coal country who backed him in 2008 that is part of the reason why he thinks the race there is shaping up more to be like 2004 when mr bush won the state than 2008 when mr obama turned it blue but it is going to be a dogfight mr bennett said i don t kid myself the latest realclearpolitics com average of polls shows mr obama leading in ohio where he kicked off his re election bid last month mr romney meanwhile holds a razor thin advantage in florida florida is by every account a dead heat said susan macmanus a political science professor at the university of south florida the interstate 4 corridor is going to be critical again and so is the south florida area with regards to hispanic voters and to a lesser extent the jewish vote brian moran chairman of the virginia democratic party said the political world should keep an eye on what happens in the old dominion where mr obama in 2008 swung the state into the democratic column for the first time in 44 years it is no exaggeration that virginia is the battleground mr moran said arguing that this president s fate is likely tied to how well he performs in the washington d c suburbs there are very few scenarios that demonstrate that either of the candidates can win without virginia mr priebus meanwhile offered his theory in a conference call with reporters last week he said the mystery of who will win the presidential election could be solved in wisconsin this week in the outcome of mr walker s recall election a walker win mr priebus predicted of his fellow wisconsinite will make it harder for mr obama to carry the state certainly if wisconsin goes red it is lights out for obama so clearly putting wisconsin in the red column for the first time since 1984 is a pretty big deal he said copyright 2020 the washington times llc click
