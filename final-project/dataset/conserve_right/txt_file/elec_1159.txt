strategy on happening now isis barbaric attacks in paris and elsewhere have once again called the world s attention to our generational struggle against radical islamic terrorism a threat this administration has ignored as it has grown on their watch one place where their inaction and lack of moral clarity in this fight has been particularly stark has been in relation to our closest ally in the middle east israel israeli citizens have for decades lived with the daily threat of terror on their doorstep in their communities and when they travel abroad today while old enemies like hezbollah and hamas continue to threaten israel the jewish state has also seen a new threat emerge inside its borders a string of stabbings hit and runs and shootings of innocents whose only crime was being jewish is but the latest form of anti israeli terror this recent surge in violence has left israeli citizens vulnerable in their everyday life and cries out for allies who understand how disruptive such a threat could be as president i will restore resolve consistency and moral clarity to america s efforts to combat terrorism israel has faced radical shiite terrorists such as during the 2006 war with hezbollah when the iranian backed terrorist group rained thousands of rockets on the northern part of the country since then iran and syria have re armed hezbollah with more than a hundred thousand rockets including longer range sophisticated weapons that can hit tel aviv and jerusalem hezbollah has also plotted to slaughter innocent jews around the world including in latin america africa and europe israel has also faced radical sunni terrorism such as hamas campaign of terror which at times has included daily rocket strikes against civilian areas bombings and other attacks against israel hamas also knows that israel takes extraordinary care to avoid civilian casualties when defending itself and exploits israel s respect for innocent palestinian lives by using human shields and locating weapons stockpiles and firing positions in schools and hospitals such horrific exploitation of innocents in the promotion of terror reminds us there can be no moral equivalence

i will actively combat iran s support for terrorism and aggressively work to interdict and impose consequences for its provision of weapons and support to hezbollah hamas and palestinian islamic jihad i will rebuild the trust that has been badly eroded during this administration between the united states and israel i will make clear that the pathway to peace requires an end to violence and the recognition of israel as a jewish state i will restore the trust that binds america apos s alliance with israel and send the world the unmistakable message that we stand as one in our common effort to
