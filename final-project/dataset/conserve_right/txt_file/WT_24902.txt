partake in a celebration of democracy representation and our nation s history of immigrants upon his return to the white house mr trump told reporters that the protester didn t look so good to me he criticized the media for focusing on the demonstrator instead of his speech we had one person but other than that it was really fantastic the president said the republican party of virginia said mr samirah is the anti semitic democrat delegate best known for a series of virulently bigoted facebook posts characterizing the kkk as being better than israel and wondering aloud why he should care about the holocaust delegate samirah s outburst was nothing more than childish frustration over hillary clinton s loss said rpv chairman jack wilson if the democrats wanted someone to protest this historic bipartisan event maybe they should not have picked an anti semite ibraheem samirah is a disgrace t
