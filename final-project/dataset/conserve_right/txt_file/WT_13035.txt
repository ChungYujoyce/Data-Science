be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing the world should get ready for a new made in china product vaccines china s vaccine makers are gearing up over the next few years to push exports in a move that should lower costs of lifesaving immunizations for the world s poor and provide major new competition for the big western pharmaceutical companies however it may take some time before some parts of the world are ready to embrace chinese products when safety is as sensitive an issue as it is with vaccines especially given the food drug and other scandals the country has seen still china s entry into this market will be a game changer said nina schwalbe head of policy at the gavi alliance which buys vaccines for 50 million children a year worldwide top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey we are really enthusiastic about the potential entry of chinese vaccine manufacturers she said china s vaccine making prowess captured world attention in 2009 when one of its companies developed the first effective vaccine against swine flu in just 87 days as the new virus swept the globe in the past new vaccine developments usually had been won by the u s and europe then in march the world health organization announced that china s drug safety authority meets international standards for vaccine regulation it opened the doors for chinese vaccines to be submitted for who approval so they can be bought by u n agencies and the gavi alliance china is a vaccine producing power with more than 30 companies that have an annual production capacity of nearly 1 billion doses the largest in the world the country s state food and drug administration told the associated press but more needs to be done to build confidence in chinese vaccines overseas said helen yang of sinovac the nasdaq listed chinese biotech firm that rapidly developed the h1n1 swine flu vaccine we think the main obstacle is that we have the name of made in china still that is an issue china s food and drug safety record in recent years hardly inspires confidence in 2007 chinese cough syrup killed 93 people in central america in 2008 contaminated blood thinner led to dozens of deaths in the united states while tainted milk powder poisoned hundreds of thousands of chinese babies and killed six the government has since imposed more regulations stricter inspections and heavier punishments for violators perhaps because of that regulators routinely crack down on counterfeit and substandard drugmaking while welcoming who s approval of china s drug safety authority one expert said it takes more than a regulatory agency to keep drugmakers from cutting corners or producing fakes in the u s we have supporting institutions such as the market economy democracy media monitoring civil society as well as a well developed business ethics code but these are all still pretty much absent in china said yanzhong huang a china health expert at the council on foreign relations for china the challenge is much greater in building a strong robust regulative capacity last year a chinese newspaper report linked improperly stored vaccines to four children s deaths in northern shanxi province raising nationwide concern the health ministry said the vaccines did not cause the deaths but some remained skeptical meanwhile chinese researchers reported in the new england journal of medicine earlier this year that a pandemic flu vaccine given to 90 million people in 2009 was safe who s medical officer for immunization dr yvan hutin said who s approval of the chinese drug regulatory agency is not a blank check each vaccine will be evaluated rigorously with who and chinese inspectors given access to vaccine plants on top of other safety checks he said vaccines historically have been a touchy subject in the western world rife with safety concerns and conspiracy theories worries about vaccine safety resurfaced in the late 1990s triggered by debate over a claimed association between the vaccine for measles mumps and rubella and autism the claim was later discredited for china the next few years will be crucial as biotech companies upgrade their facilities and improve procedures to meet the safety and quality standards a process that is expected to be costly and challenging then they will submit vaccines to the u n health agency for approval which could take a couple of years first up is likely to be a homegrown vaccine for japanese encephalitis a mosquito borne disease that can cause seizures paralysis and death the vaccine has been used for two decades in china with fewer side effects than other versions its manufacturer expects who approval for it in about a year also in the works are vaccines for polio and diseases that are the top two killers of children pneumonia and rotavirus which causes diarrhea vaccines also are a significant part of a 300 million partnership with the bill melinda gates foundation for the development of new health and farming products for poor countries china s entry into this field is important because one child dies every 20 seconds from vaccine preventable diseases each year unicef the children s agency and the world s biggest buyer of vaccines has been in talks with chinese companies said its supply director shanelle hall the fund provides vaccines to nearly 60 percent of the world s children and last year spent about 757 million worldwide vaccine sales last year grew 14 percent to 25 3 billion according to health care market research firm kalorama information as drugmakers that face intensifying competition from generic drugs now see vaccines as key
