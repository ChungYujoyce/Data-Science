apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the long fbi probe into a purported russia election collusion was absent of any direct conspiracy evidence against a trump associate except for the discredited democratic party financed dossier and its impresario fusion gps for the first time in an official report there are explanations of why the fbi initially targeted four trump advisers retired army lt gen michael flynn adviser george papadopoulos campaign chairman paul manafort and adviser carter page the internal august 2016 explanations are found in the 436 page report of justice department inspector general michael e horowitz no fbi predication accused the four or listed evidence of a conspiracy top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches after the fbi opened its crossfire hurricane probe on july 31 2016 agents led by peter strzok eventually settled on those four men to investigate two ultimately were accused of conspiring with the kremlin only the dossier written by former british intelligence officer christopher steele with 165 000 provided by democrats and the hillary clinton campaign through fusion gps presented evidence no one else did the fbi s foreign intelligence surveillance act wiretap application to a judge for mr page on oct 21 2016 contained one set of russia election conspiracy claims all came from the dossier and none was corroborated according to mr horowitz s report another fact that underscores the lack of conspiracy evidence outside the dossier the fbi did not seek a fisa warrant on any other trump figure because it lacked documentation of probable cause special counsel robert mueller and mr horowitz have since left the dossier in shambles mr mueller found no trump conspiracy to hack computers and spread information warfare as the dossier alleged mr horowitz identified significant dossier inaccuracies the crossfire hurricane team first received dossier memos on sept 19 2016 a month after it opened cases on the four trump associates here are the fbi s written predications called electronic communications or ecs as recounted by the horowitz report each ec said the four may have wittingly or unwittingly helped russia paul manafort the principal piece of evidence was that he did consulting work in ukraine for a russia friendly political party george papadopoulos the justification was that he heard in london from a maltese professor that russia owned thousands of hillary clinton s emails he relayed the gossip to the australian ambassador to britain over drinks the ambassador reported the conversation to washington after wikileaks released hacked emails this tip was the central reason the fbi created crossfire hurricane retired army lt gen michael flynn the fbi stated that flynn was an advisor for the trump campaign had various ties to state affiliated entities of russia and traveled to russia in december 2015 carter page the new york based energy investor and former moscow resident had extensive ties to various russia owned entities the fbi said and had traveled to russia as recently as july 2016 mr page was also the subject of a counterintelligence investigation by the fbi s new york field office because of his contacts with russian spies who posed as diplomats those were the four predications pre dossier not one cited any evidence of conspiring with russians to interfere in the election the russia collusion claims weren t made until the next month and only by mr steele he wrote that mr page met with two shadowy kremlin figures while in moscow to deliver a public speech mr steele also said mr page and manafort worked as a team to coordinate with the kremlin on its election interference based on the mueller horowitz reports none of those allegations proved true mr page and manafort never knew or spoke to each other mr page also denied meeting the two kremlin figures as for papadopoulos no evidence emerged that he ever acted on the email information he didn t tell the campaign in new york and he never tried to acquire the messages flynn the former top military officer for intelligence collection as head of the defense intelligence agency seemed to have had routine engagements with russian counterparts he faced no allegation of a conspiracy he like the other three never faced a conspiracy charge president trump also found himself under fbi investigation andrew mccabe as the agency s deputy director opened a counterintelligence investigation after mr trump fired fbi director james b comey in may 2017 mr steele the dossier writer accused the president of being a longtime spy for russia no other source for that allegation has surfaced mr mccabe said in a cbs 60 minutes interview while promoting his memoir that he didn t know whether mr trump was a spy at the fbi bruce ohr who was associate deputy attorney general briefed him on mr steele s claims mr mueller who had the full cooperation of 40 fbi agents as well as u s intelligence showed no evidence in his march 2019 report that mr trump was a russian asset of any type michael caputo a trump campaign media adviser went through hours of mueller and congressional interrogations he told the washington times that his inquisitors never presented evidence of any conspiracy the special counsel was still trying to make a russian conspiracy case in may 2018 and now we know from the ig report that they already knew better by then mr caputo said they just couldn t help themselves they hated trump they had the power to keep investigating and they were damn sure going to use it as long as they could from august 2016 when mr strzok and other agents picked the four initial subjects things didn t go well for them even though no conspiracy was found the obama justice department believed flynn may have violated the 1799 logan act by talking to the russian ambassador during the transition about how to react to new economic sanctions he later admitted to lying to fbi agents when he denied talking about sanctions he is due to be sentenced jan 28 papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about when he first talked to maltese professor joseph mifsud as to the email gossip the mueller report said no documentary evidence and nothing in the email accounts or other communications facilities reviewed by the office shows that papadopoulos shared this information with the campaign manafort was convicted on tax fraud charges for the millions of dollars he earned in ukraine and is now in prison the mueller report said the investigation did not establish that manafort coordinated with the russian government on its election interference efforts mr page underwent a long grueling investigation during hours of questioning by fbi agents and congress the mueller report said the investigation did not establish that page coordinated with the russian government as an illustration of how the fbi lacked any evidence of conspiracy against papadopoulos the general counsel s office rejected the crossfire hurricane team s request for a fisa wiretap on him the fbi had no conspiracy evidence to even try on the other two we are aware of no information indicating that the team requested or seriously considered fisa surveillance of manafort or flynn the inspector general report said in the end mr horowitz didn t knock the fbi for opening crossfire hurricane we concluded that the quantum of information articulated by the fbi to open the individual investigations on papadopoulos page flynn and manafort in august 2016 was sufficient to satisfy the low threshold established by the de
