apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic chinese baby snatchers a chilling tale of chinese government officials confiscating babies in villages for big profits is gripping china the maverick newspaper caixin century broke the story monday on how local communist family planning officials acting as thuggish goons in hunan province in central china snatched more than a dozen babies many of them first births for families from hapless villagers the officials then sold the abducted babies to state funded orphanages and international adoption agencies for 3 000 each as the story went viral nationwide similar horror tales emerged from other provinces as well indicating a national pattern top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning since the 1970s china s one child policy has been rigidly enforced the underlying premise for the population control measure is that the penalty for having a second child should be so severe that fear of punishment will deter couples from even trying to conceive again after the first birth in most cases penalties include stiff fines forced sterilization and institutionalized discrimination against the second child in education medical care and housing in recent years with china s full blown socialist market economy many local communist cadres in charge of family planning have found a new way of carrying out the communist party policy enriching themselves by selling confiscated babies many of them ending up in the u s as adopted children of the more than a dozen babies snatched and sold by local communist officials in hunan at least one girl girls apparently predominate in the illicit trade was positively identified as little yang ling born july 24 2004 who was confiscated and sold a year later she now is in the united states with the american couple who adopted her the united states is the leading destination for many of these adducted children according to the state department s office of children s issues more chinese babies are adopted in the u s than any country in the world many of them classified as orphans in 2010 26 percent of all adoption cases in the united state originated in china followed far behind by ethiopia and russia shenzhen mayor sentenced xu zongheng the mayor of shenzhen china s fastest growing city for the past 30 years with a population 14 million and a leading manufacturing center of the world was sentenced to death with two years reprieve monday for taking bribes valued at 5 1 million the reprieve is a loophole in the communist legal system that has allowed many high ranking officials to avoid the ultimate sentence however the case is widely viewed by china watchers as the tip of an iceberg in china s corruption riddled culture it is peculiar because the official estimate of the value of the bribes taken by xu is far less than most observers suspect the common view is that the mayor pocketed closer to 340 million mainly from giant corporations and government entities in need of help with rezoning licensing trade privileges government contracting and career promotion however the large scale bribery may not be the critical reason for xu s fall from grace because similar cases are not uncommon in china s widespread corruption lore his undoing likely was related to the last charge against him tampering with the communist state s career promotion system the communist party central committee s absolute requirement is that all official personnel appointments be carried out through a rigid process of internal party screening the court case made clear that xu sold government office positions to the highest bidders in violation of party rules the sentence was also peculiar year after year according to amnesty international china executes more people than the rest of the world combined many for minor offenses yet for egregious crimes committed by high ranking communist officials a death penalty that is sure to be carried out is extremely rare in the past three years 18 officials above the vice minister level received death sentences with two years reprieve including the former chairman of china s largest state owned enterprise sinopec the general manager of the country s nuclear industry the deputy chief justice of china s supreme court the vice mayor of beijing the chief of the department in charge of food and drug safety and various chiefs of provincial legislatures none was executed and all are likely to walk out much sooner china s best actor lately human rights abuses and political repression in china have dramatically increased yet china s boyish looking 69 year old premier wen jiabao recently was busy telling the world how much china needs openness and democracy and trying to keep alive the hope that china s leadership has formidable reformers such as mr wen after all two weeks ago mr wen excited an international audience in malaysia by espousing his firm belief in political reform in china with harsh words toward some of the repressive measures within his own government yet most chinese remain unconvinced renowned writer yu jie recently published a book calling the premier china s best actor with a strong indictment against mr wen for his hypocrisy and empty words that the author said are aimed at deceiving the world mr wen is prone to bouts of crying when facing national crises and he often speaks outside lines of party orthodoxy when the party is facing serious problems yet more than others in the chinese communist upper echelon in recent memory mr wen contributed greatly to the longevity of the chinese communist party s rule mainly because of his extraordinary ability to act appropriately when the situation demands a career party hack mr wen is the ultimate political chameleon and he is the only politburo member in the entire 90 year history of the chinese communist party to serve and survive the reigns of four consecutive communist party general secretaries without being purged even though two of his former bosses hu yaobang and zhao ziyang were purged and become virtual nonpersons in the country in february 2008 while dutifully espousing his desire to see democracy in china mr wen penned a hit piece in the people s daily swearing that we must keep a firm grasp on the basic principles of the party in the initial stage of socialism without wavering
