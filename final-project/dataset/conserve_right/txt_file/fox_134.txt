daughter of sen mccain america has no need to be made great again because america was always great end videotape wallace and joining me now here in washington john mccain aposs good friend senator lindsey graham welcome again to fox news sunday sen lindsey graham r s c senate judiciary committee thank you for having me wallace you are speaking today at the private ceremony at the u s naval academy your tribute first of all how are you doing and secondly what are you going to say graham well i aposm doing ok these things help thank you to everybody who has called and asked me how i aposm doing cindy and everyone else around the family has helped me as much i helped them probably more so i aposm going to say that nobody loved a soldier more than john mccain that i bear witness to his commitment to have their back travel where they go never let them be forgotten the public may be tired of this war called the war on terrorism but john mccain never was and he had their back and he gave them what they need to win a fight we can apost afford to lose and he was willing to lose a political race but not a war so i aposm going to talk about all my travels with the troops and how much they love john mccain wallace i have to ask you about the passionate heartfelt but sometimes angry tribute by meghan mccain who took some pretty clear shots at president trump here aposs a clip begin video clip meghan mccain we gather here to mourn the passing of american greatness the real thing not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served end video clip wallace was that appropriate was it fair graham if you say something bad about meghan aposs father you will know it she didn apost like it so it aposs ok she is grieving all i can say is there aposs a lesson to be learned this week about john mccain number one americans appreciate military service if we aposve learned nothing this week you know the fact that john served our country in extraordinary circumstances it was appreciated by everybody what else do we know if you work hard and do your homework and know what you aposre talking about people will listen to you that if you pick big causes bigger than yourself you aposll be remembered he tried to drain the swamp before it was cool that you can fight hard and still be respected if you forgive people appreciate it and if you admit to mistakes you look good as a stronger man that aposs the formula john mccain this was a civics lesson for anybody who wanted to listen why do remember this man because of the way he conducted his public life wallace do you think there aposs a lesson there for president trump graham there aposs a lesson here for everybody including president trump everybody makes mistakes those who admit it are seen by the public as bigger not smaller know what you aposre talking about fight hard forgive and have passion strength and kindness are not mutually exclusive wallace let aposs turn to your day job and this week you aposre going to be spending a lot of time as a member of the senate judiciary committee and confirmation hearings for judge brett kavanaugh graham yes wallace to be confirmed to the supreme court first of all does he have the votes to win confirmation of the court graham if he does well at the hearing he will get my belief is 55 or higher if he does well enough i aposm sure he will do well wallace when you say 55 you aposve got to have 51 republicans with the appointment of mccain aposs replacement so you are saying as many as four democrats graham well that aposs 55 last time i checked wallace so that aposs what you think graham yes i aposm not good at math but yes i think there are a handful of democrats will vote for judge kavanaugh if he does well and maybe even more a lot of people should vote for judge kavanaugh if you are looking to a republican president to pick a qualified conservative he would be on the top of anyone aposs list including not just donald trump he aposs the one person i think every republican president would see is the most qualified of their generation wallace democrats say that the confirmation should be delayed until we know whether or not there aposs going to be either a criminal prosecution of president trump or impeachment proceedings against president trump here is senator dick durbin who was going to be on the program next begin video clip sen dick durbin d ill senate judiciary committee we should be withholding this decision on the supreme court nominee until the air is cleared and we know exactly where we stand when it comes to this president and inaudible end video clip wallace given that his former lawyer michael cohen says that candidate trump in 2016 directed him to commit a crime does the senator have a point graham well it wasn apost the point he had when clinton was under investigation we approved justice breyer so my democratic friends did not have this view when clinton was president wallace we should point i aposm going to bring it up with senator durbin 1994 clinton is under investigation by the independent counsel in whitewater and he was nominated graham i think wallace stephen breyer was confirmed to the court graham senator grassley has been very fair more documents than the person ever nominated to the supreme court we aposre going to have a hearing and there aposs no drama in this hearing the only drama is those running for president how will they handle this hearing on the democratic side you know we aposre going to get this good man confirmed wallace let me ask you though about this question of criminal liability i want to look at some kavanaugh aposs statements on that issue let aposs put them up in 1999 kavanaugh said the nixon ruling that president nixon had to turn over all of the white house watergate tapes may have been quote wrongly decided in 2009 kavanaugh wrote criminal investigations take the president aposs focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people is there a legitimate concern that justice kavanaugh if you were faced with a case on the supreme court would side with the president against either congress or the court graham well what i think you aposll find is somebody that has had 308 decisions so you can get a pretty good idea of what he thinks based on his time on the court of appeals but the bottom line here is that most people are unsure as to whether or not a president can be indicted a sitting president impeachment is a process to remove a president their criminal liability aspects are very much in debate i think he aposs going to be mainstream in his thinking he aposs going to look at both sides of the issue and decide appropriately wallace one issue that pro choice senators of both sides have pressed kavanaugh on in their meetings with him on capitol hill is abortion and kavanaugh reportedly told them that roe v wade is quote settled law is that a firm commitment in your regard in your view to not overturn roe and if it is a firm commitment how can you as a pro life senator support him graham i wouldn apost vote for anybody that says that every decision the supreme court cannot be revisited they revisit through a process there aposs a process of overturning long precedent there aposs a four part test you have to apply from my point of view what he will do is when that case comes if it ever does you just don apost wake up one day and say hey i aposd like to overturn roe v wade if there aposs a conflict that makes it to the supreme court he will apply the test of precedent to that decision roe v wade and every other precedent wallace but to make it clear you aposre saying you don apost view his statement for instance to senator collins a pro choice republican that it settled law means that therefore it can apost be re examined and conceivably overturn graham he would be disqualified in my opinion if you would not listen to both sides of the story and decide accordingly this idea that roe v wade is going to be challenged at state level there are all kinds of laws out there some may work their way up to supreme court he will give great deference i aposm sure to roe v wade but it can be overturned like every other decision but that will be up to the facts on the record wallace senator graham thank you thanks for your time on the tough weekend our deepest sympathies in a loss of a dear friend sir graham thank you thank you so much joining me now from illinois another member of the committee that will be questioning judge kavanaugh dick durbin the senate aposs number two democrat senator democrats have tried a variety of efforts to upend and derail the confirmation of judge kavanaugh i want to put some of them up the argument that there is a midterm election the argument that president trump is under investigation if you want to see millions of pages of documents from when he was staff secretary for president george w bush and the white house has no invoked executive privilege to withhold 100 000 pages from when he worked for the white house counsel i think it aposs fair to say that none of that has worked and the question is why is it the democrats have so far been unable to gain any traction against judge kavanaugh and in the public debate you don apost seem to have laid a glove on him durbin let me say at the outset before we get into that and i will address it i joined with lindsey graham every word he said john mccain john mccain i respect john mccain so much and yesterday was a great display of the respect so many people across this country had for this great american i was lucky enough to be with lindsey and john involved in some very important negotiations for more than a year on comprehensive immigration reform so i back up every word so let me start with brett kavanaugh in this way he is the most unpopular supreme court nominee in the last 40 years how did he reach that point so quickly well i think there were a number of reasons for it you look at first and foremost is the fact that this president said i aposm not going to put a man on the supreme court unless he is going to overturn roe versus wade and the affordable care act the president is never at a loss for words and he was very explicit in terms of what he wanted in a supreme court nominee those positions may be popular with his republican base they aposre not popular with the american people wallace wait wait graham an issue that you have raised wallace wait i mean he said he was going to appoint pro life judges he never said that he asked him or on a litmus test about that and also i have to say i aposm a little surprised that you are saying he aposs the most unpopular when did we nominate and confirm supreme court justices based on public opinion polls durbin well we shouldn apost be but you started off with the premise you aposve never laid a glove on him the fact of the matter is the american people have gone through this nomination and come to the conclusion that he aposs not the right person for the job let me go a little bit further here he comes before us at a time when people are concerned about whether this president or any president is above the law think about his role kavanaugh aposs role when it came to judge ken starr going after president clinton he was the aggressive prosecutor in that respect and a few years later after working in the bush white house said that completely reversed my position a president should not be subject to the subject of prosecution while he aposs in office wallace can i can i let me just ask you about that because as lindsey graham brought up and i was going to ask you anyway in 1994 bill clinton was under investigation by an independent counsel on whitewater and he nominated and the senate confirmed stephen breyer and that was also in a midterm election year that relate directly contradicts two of the arguments that you aposre making against kavanaugh durbin let me just say that i was not a member of the senate when justice breyer came before that body but it will tell you at the time the investigation was underway there was no suspicion at that moment that clinton was going to brush it aside and say you have no authority to even question me it went forward he was subpoenaed he was deposed he was tried in the house and i should say indicted under the impeachment clause and tried in the senate i was at the senate at the time and now we have a different situation completely there is a serious question as to whether this president given the opportunity will end the mueller investigation something which most republicans and the overwhelming majority of americans say would be a serious mistake and we ask of course judge kavanaugh what do you think and he says it aposs hands off when it comes to a president during his term in office i think that aposs a mistake and it aposs one of the major reasons people had misgivings about his nomination wallace let aposs look at some specific issues as i pointed out kavanaugh has told some pro choice senators that he views roe as settled law he was asked about obamacare there aposs a texas case that would try to take it all down because of the fact that the individual mandate has been repealed he said that he was very skeptical of that obviously these aren apost confirmed commitments you wouldn apost expect that from any judge isn apost it the real problem that this is a conservative judge donald trump went to the country and promised to nominate conservative judges originalists who would who would interpret the constitution as written it hasn apost healed well within the mainstream yes conservative but within the judicial mainstream durbin well you overlook one of the most important elements of his nomination and that is the fact that there has been more concealment of documents concerning his public service and his position on issues than ever in the history of the united states wallace he aposs given you half a million documents sir crosstalk durbin let me just make my point here chris the assertion of executive privilege by the white house to take 100 000 documents and say the american people will not get a chance to see them as they reflect on kavanaugh aposs background is the first time in history this denial of access to documents violates a role that we thought was a tradition of the senate under senator sessions and senator leahy time and again when it came to obama nominees they are suppressing these documents if we are lucky we will see 6 percent 6 percent of all of the documents that have been produced that could be produced to reflect on kavanaugh aposs true position on issues he saying and the white house saying the american people have no right to know so if he so proud of his conservative credentials show us the record stand before us trust the american people and they will trust you i would say that to judge kavanaugh wallace i and you will have the opportunity to do that starting on tuesday let me just say as a point of saying goodbye they have turned over half a million documents and the issue part of it is about 3 million documents when he was staff secretary and every document that went to the president went to his desk but senator durbin thank you thanks for joining us we look forward to your questioning of judge kavanaugh starting this week durbin thanks chris wallace always good to talk with you sir up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss what to expect from this week aposs showdown between the president aposs supreme court pick and senate democrats plus what would you like to ask the panel about how judge kavanaugh aposs confirmation would change the supreme court just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump we need to elect senators who will vote for judges to follow our laws and our constitution as written end video clip wallace president trump on the campaign trail this week making the case for his choice of brett kavanaugh for the supreme court and it aposs time now for our sunday group former press secretary for vice president pence marc lotter charles lane of the washington post former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and washington post columnist and former white house speechwriter marc thiessen chuck when justice kennedy the swing vote on the court stepped down and there was talk about replacing him we heard all this talk about a fierce battle for the future of the court and i want to ask you the same question that i asked senator durbin why hasn apost it happen the democrats don apost seem to have gained much traction against brett kavanaugh so far charles lane the washington post i think there aposs a lot of reasons starting with the fact that it aposs just possible republicans care a little bit more about this than actually democrats do i did a little checking and democrats were a little bit less likely than republicans to vote in 2016 based on the future of the supreme court so there aposs a little bit of a surprising passion gap there secondly i think it aposs the very simple fact that this is about 51 votes and the republicans have 51 votes and that means two things one mitch mcconnell can control the pace of this thing control the calendar and so forth and secondly it means the democrats are just struggling to get over that work and they are divided not divided down the middle but they are divided between the main block of the party and several people who have to run for reelection in red states that aposs created a very difficult problem in messaging for them and so they are left dealing not with the substance of the kavanaugh thing but procedural issues like document disclosure arcane matters very important but very arcane about executive privilege and the net effect is they have yet to identify some hot button things that can get the public excited against judge kavanaugh wallace we ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on twitter from waris waldo which after i read it several times realize some persons interpretation of where is waldo when did adhering to the united states constitution became radical and threatening marc lotter how do you answer that marc lotter former pence press secretary well i think that aposs the basis of this argument and we have and judge kavanaugh and in justice gorsuch we have someone who adheres to the constitution and many on the liberal side prefer to appoint justices who interpret the law to mean things other than what it says that aposs the heart of the argument wallace i want to turn to the nation aposs farewell to john mccain which has been the big story this week and his daughter meghan aposs tribute to him at the national cathedral yesterday which still has a lot of people talking here aposs part of that begin video clip meghan mccain the america of john mccain has no need to be made great again because america was always great applause end video clip wallace marc thiessen it aposs her dad marc thiessen former bush white house speechwriter yes wallace she obviously feels passionately about the fact that she thinks that president trump didn apost treat her dad well and he didn apost what did you think of her remarks thiessen well first of all just watching her this week has been heartbreaking because her grief has been palpable and so was her anger palpable yesterday and with good reason because donald trump treated her father disgracefully if you want to put this in perspective there have been 1 974 united states senators since the founding of the republic john mccain is only the sixth senator to lie in state who wasn apost either a vice president or president so this is a tremendous testament and there are only 31 people in american history who had laid in state this may very well be the first time that the sitting president of the united states has not participated in honoring that person and that as a result of his disgraceful behavior towards him he was even criticizing john mccain by name a few weeks ago on the campaign trail to suggest that he wasn apost a war hero and never apologized for that this is one of the reasons chris why i think donald trump despite a booming economy his disapproval has reached now 60 percent in the country it aposs not because people don apost like his policies because his policies are obviously improving the lives of people the economy is booming and on employment is low but his inability to be presidential and to rise to the occasion at a moment like this put aside his petty grievances against john mccain i think that aposs one of the reasons why his popularity doesn apost match his success as president wallace congresswoman edwards i promise i aposm going to bring one but marc lotter is out someone often defends this president your reaction lotter well i think it takes two to tango and i think john mccain and senator mccain has made a very good career out of attacking presidents when he disagreed on both sides of the aisle wallace but in fairness he somehow had a good enough relationship with george w bush and barack obama that they spoke at his funeral lotter and he did this is one that continued on this week and i think once we get past this we will remember john mccain for all of his great service the president is going to continue to go on and is going to do many things that john mccain supported like supporting our troops investing in our military and we aposll let their we aposll let their disagreement i guess go on in history wallace congresswoman edwards your reaction to meghan mccain aposs remarks and when you take in addition because it wasn apost just mccain it was joe biden and it was barack obama and it was george w bush the last republican president before trump was this week a rebuke of president trump donna edwards former congresswoman d md well i think that meghan mccain aposs remarks and all of the remarks of the various speakers were john mccain speaking his hand was clearly evident in those remarks and particularly meghan aposs remarks and i think that there were spot on for where we are in this nation you know i come from a military family too and i think for the president of the united states not to have honored and recognized senator mccain aposs service irrespective of policy disagreement i think was disgraceful and i think the nation stood up and said that it was disgraceful too and that all of those speakers indicated that what was valued and senator mccain in addition to his service in his honor was his commitment to this country and that we had a president of the united states who seemed incapable of even acknowledging that wallace all right we aposre going to leave it on that note panel we will take a break here we aposll see you a little later up next president trump threatens to cut canada out of a new nafta deal and forge ahead just with mexico what would that mean for workers in the economy on this labor day weekend afl cio president richard trumka joins us next commercial break wallace coming up president trump looks to replace nafta as he works on a new trade deal with mexico and canada begin video clip trump and we aposre going to call it the united states mexico trade agreement and we aposll get rid of the name nafta end video clip wallace we aposll talk with the head of the largest group of unions in the country richard trumka next commercial break wallace negotiations to hammer out a deal to reshape nafta the three nation trade agreement between the u s mexico and canada will continue this weeks after talks between the white house and canada stalled amid some bitterness joining us now to discuss the potential fallout for american workers is the president of the afl cio richard trumka mr trumka president trump has negotiated a new nafta deal with mexico but talks with canada stalled after some off the record comments that he made were published that he acknowledged that he won apost make any concessions to canada and here aposs what he said about that afterwards begin video clip trump here aposs the good news at least canada knows where i stand because we can apost have these countries taking advantage of the united states anymore it aposs very simple end video clip wallace question can you support a deal that leads canada out of a new nafta and will congress pass it richard trumka afl cio president well chris before i get to that just let me say on behalf of the hardworking men and women of this country who wake our country up every day make her run all day and put it to bed at night let me wish you a happy labor day and all your listeners a happy labor day look our economies are integrated the three countries in north america the economy is pretty emigrated and it aposs pretty hard to see how that would work without having canada in the deal you said that the mexican deal is close but there aposs still a lot of work to be left to be done even on the mexican deal chris because the language isn apost drafted we haven apost seen whole chapters of the thing we aposre anxious to move forward with it and anxious to have all three countries involved because nafta has had a devastating effect on the working people of this country for the last 25 years so we aposve been aggressively pursuing an agreement that works for the workers in all three countries and i can say we aposre not done yet wallace ok but let aposs talk about the parts of the deal we do know about that the trump administration has negotiated with mexico that it seems to me would be pretty good for workers let aposs put them up on the screen seventy five percent of a car aposs value would have to be manufactured in north america that aposs up from 62 5 percent forty to forty five percent of the car must be made by workers in whatever country earning at least 16 an hour do you support both of those provisions and frankly do you think that mexico would live up to them for instance the salary for car workers because in mexico right now the salary for a car worker on average is 3 an hour do you think they actually are going to boost that to 16 an hour trumka well first of all those provisions can be very very good and you said that the current provision is really 62 5 in actuality chris it aposs only in the 40s because they they do a little cheating saying if you put in 62 percent and china puts in 38 percent it counts as 100 percent so it aposs really lower and the change is really more more effective we haven apost seen the details of it yet but you hit the nail right on the head it doesn apost matter what aposs in that agreement if we can apost monitor it and effect it and enforce it effectively then the agreement will fail for workers and it will fail for the country so what we aposre pushing right now and we aposre working with ambassador lighthizer is is a way to let us effectively monitor what aposs going on the ground and then enforce the agreement regardless of who aposs in the white house because we aposve been told for over 25 years trust us this agreement will be good for workers what we need is an agreement that we can enforce no matter who aposs in the white house wallace let me trumka that aposs what we aposre looking for wallace let me step back for a minute and go broader view how does big labor feel about president trump at this point i mean the fact is growth is up unemployment is down he aposs using tariffs to try to break down trade barriers that i know that you hate so i mean what mark do you give donald trump on this labor day weekend trumka well when he was elected i said i would call balls and strikes when he did something that was good for workers we aposd support him when he did something that was bad for workers we would oppose him unfortunately to date the things that he aposs done to hurt workers outpace what he aposs done to help workers he hasn apost come up with an infrastructure program that could put a lot of us back to work he overturned a regulation that would actually denied over 5 million people overtime that they would have had he overturned some health and safety regulations that will hurt us on the job enforcement of osha and msha isn apost what it should be so we keep trying to find areas where we can work with him and where we can we do wallace well but let me ask you mr trumka let me ask you i mean 3 9 percent unemployment 3 5 million jobs created 4 percent 4 2 percent gdp in the last quarter i mean don apost you give him something for that trumka no those are good but wages have been down since the first of the year gas prices have been up since the first of the year so overall workers aren apost doing as well he passed the tax bill that encourages companies to outsource we can apost agree to support something like that he aposs every place we can chris we do but unfortunately right now the scale is weighted against him because he aposs done more to hurt workers than to help workers wallace so you have launched a new big political campaign for the midterms you have an ad out on the web right now is it your hope that democrats would take back control of the house and senate and block the trump agenda even those parts that have been good for workers like creating 3 5 million new jobs trumka it aposs not about democrats or republicans it aposs about electing people who will support working people in this country that aposs what we aposre looking to do we started a couple of months ago going door to door member to member with our members saying what issues are important to you we put those together we aposre going to put them in front of candidates those candidates that support the issues that our members say they want need and should have are the candidates that we aposll support it probably will be democrats because unfortunately democrats support working people more than republicans have we aposd like to change that but the reality is democrats support working people more than republicans although we go candidate by candidate and we support those republicans that support working people wallace finally this week i looked at the presidential exit polls from 2016 hillary clinton beat donald trump in union households by just nine points 51 percent to 42 which interestingly enough is the smallest democratic advantage since reagan ran against mondale in 1984 question don apost a lot of your members union members don apost they support donald trump trumka well actually three percentage points more of our members voted for donald trump than they did for mitt romney unfortunately 10 percent of our members 10 percent fewer of our members voted for hillary clinton they didn apost believe her on trade they didn apost believe her on a couple of other issues but you talked about households union members themselves are a much higher percentage in there again we give them all the facts and i believe in my membership the rank and file that when they get the facts they make the right decision every time we aposre giving them the facts on this president and anybody who aposs running against him and they will ultimately decide which one of those candidates that they want to support wallace mr trumka thank you thanks for sharing part of this labor day holiday weekend with us we aposll stay on top of all this sir trumka chris thanks for having me on and again happy labor day wallace when we come back the trump administration opens the door to regulating google our sunday panel returns to discuss the battle with big tech that aposs next commercial break begin video clip trump i think canada very much wants to make the deal and i think it aposs going to be obviously very good for canada if they do and i think it aposs probably not going to be good at all if they don apost end video clip wallace president trump playing hardball with canada as he tries to rewrite the quarter century old north american free trade agreement or nafta and we aposre back now with the panel well congresswoman edwards there was a lot of howling i think it aposs fair to say from democrats when president trump said that he was going to revamp nafta but aren apost there and it talked about it with mr trumka aren apost there a number of provisions in this agreement with mexico at least that are good for american workers edwards well i think there are also a lot of democrats who very much wanted to see a north american free trade agreement that really invests in workers that makes sure that we have protections across both borders and i think you heard that from what mr trumka was saying and i you know i think it wallace but raising but raising the wage to 16 an hour edwards raising the wages exactly wallace raising the amount that has to be content from north america edwards right and all those are those are actually things that many of us is democrats have been calling for for a long time because you know we can have free trade but if it aposs not fair on both sides of the border it really doesn apost work it doesn apost keep workers here working and it doesn apost make sure that workers in mexico are being paid what they need and i don apost think you can have a north american free trade agreement without having the other part of north america which is canada in the deal too wallace let me pick up on that with you marc lotter because talks with canada stalled on friday over it seems to issues one is continued dairy protections inside canada and secondly the publishing of off the record comments by president trump where he basically said i aposm not going to offer any concessions at all to canada does this deal go through and and i aposm primarily i guess i aposm talking about congress does this deal go through without canada onboard lotter i think it makes it much easier if canada is on board to get it through congress but this is this is very tough negotiating with the president and the prime minister and the canadian officials the president is very clear he wants to get this done he wants canada to be involved and it aposs going to be a question now of can they make enough concessions to make it fair on both sides i think they will wallace let aposs turn to another big story this week and that is president trump complaining that google aposs search engine when you put in president trump news it has been calibrated to drown out conservative voices the president and his team this week complained about that and even talked about regulating google here aposs the president begin video clip trump i aposve made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship blacklisting and rigged search results we aposre not going to let them control what we can and cannot see read and learn from we can apost do that end video clip wallace chuck first of all from the best of your knowledge is there political bias in the google search i mean is it calibrated to drown out conservative voices and to push liberal points of view and secondly what do you make of the threat by the president that the government might get involved in regulating google lane well the best of my knowledge about google aposs algorithms is not very good wallace well that aposs why i asked you inaudible lane but i i would be very surprised if somebody at google said let aposs set up the algorithm to drown out donald trump in any specific sense like that i think these searches work in an incredibly complex ways that for some unconscious or otherwise neutral reason may be turning up what president trump claims they aposre turning up but of course it aposs just his claim but there aposs a bigger context for this which is a lot of stuff going on at google like a few months back an employee circulating a memo internally claiming that the company isolates conservatives internally then he winds up on the outs there aposs a movement within google to decouple google so to speak from defense contracting and so forth and i think the president aposs pushing back against those things and he aposs more generally trying to turn google into just another part of this big fake news media that has been his big foil all through his political career you know there aposs a lot of suspicion both on the left and the right in sort of populist america about these giant technology companies and i think in that sense he aposs just trying to turn them into another one of his scapegoats to show like everything is stacked against us even the search engine wallace marc your thoughts about whether the government should be regulating a company like google are their first amendment issues there and if they were ph going to regulate google in terms of its search engine they can do a number of things just to make life difficult for google thiessen no doubt and i look i think the the fact that there there is conservative bias in social media it aposs not just google it aposs facebook it aposs twitter there aposs been a lot of accusations they probably the only place where there aposs more anti conservative bias than the legacy media is silicon valley so you know and the fact is a lot of people getting their news from silicon valley in a ways that they weren apost a few years ago but and so trump is raising a valid point where he loses me is when he says that he wants the government to start regulating it because i the only institution i trust less than google to regulate my my search is the federal government so i think what we need is for people to be more proactive in terms of where they get their news and how they they consume their news one of the the the avenue of social media has given conservatives an incredible voice that they didn apost have before because they didn apost have to go through the washington post and the new york times so they have a voice that they never had before but we aposre also in these ideological silos were conservatives only read conservative news sources liberals only read washington ph read liberal news sources and i think we all need to do a better job of policing ourselves and getting out of our silos and listening to the other side because that aposs how we get over the division in the country wallace congresswoman edwards i want to pick up on the last point that chuck made and that is isn apost there a legitimate concern and on this populist issue about companies whether it aposs google or facebook or twitter or amazon these huge companies that have so much power and so much money and so much influence edwards well i mean but the concern i think is really misplaced because if you look at these entities every time there you know is this sort of massive growth in this industry something else starts up that becomes the next new thing and we remember when twitter was the next new thing and instagram the next new thing and so i think that the dynamism that aposs in the industry allows that to you know to create an environment where you know you can have a lot of different kinds of voices in there and i think if anything is getting in the way of it in terms of the government i think it aposs saying you know this these decisions around net neutrality because then that makes it even more difficult for conservative or even you know far left views to get into the mainstream if you aposre put on this secondary highway so but the idea that the government should have the the the ability to figure out what the search engine is i don apost think so i mean most of the people i know in congress can apost even operate their twitter handle wallace i am remaining silent in this conversation i aposm i aposm a luddite which go to google and look up what it means thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week dolly parton on why kids around the world call her the book lady commercial break wallace most of us know her as a legendary
