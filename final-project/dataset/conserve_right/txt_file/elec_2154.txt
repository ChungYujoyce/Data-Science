bring energy from alaska jeb readies docu dump book launch poking the scowly owl press left swoon for warrensen elizabeth warren d mass is still using a strict present tense not running as her answer to questions about her possible presidential ambitions but that seems increasingly likely to change given the overwhelmingly positive and generally overwhelming coverage of her bid to harass the white house and senate leaders over wall street carve outs stuffed in a fiscal cliff spending bill the daily beast called her the most powerful democrat in america the wapo warned warren s moves may force 2016 frontrunner hillary clinton to alter her plans and warren got star treatment all up and down the major media corridor most remarkable is that in doing what was previously called reckless embitterment when republican renegades did it warren is leading a movement in which the democratic party debates its soul oh dear somebody get the smelling salts howard kurtz writes she s been a press favorite roughly forever but by standing up to a democratic president and bringing the government to within hours of a shutdown the freshman senator is being lionized like never before that escalated quickly whether or not warren really can disrupt the multi billion dollar rock crusher of a campaign that democratic frontrunner hillary clinton is putting together we get a pretty good idea of what the party base and the political press would like to see right now it seems that the fantasy scenario is for warren to run pushing excusing hillary to reveal herself as the true liberal she was born to be the happy story for democrats ends as hillary eradicates whomever the hapless republican nominee happens to be while warren certainly speaks to the enormous political energy among those who believe the system is rigged against ordinary people those cheering the democrats turn toward ideological purity in the wake of an election loss ought to remember that such movements once ignited are nearly impossible to douse quickly while it might be fun for journalists and liberal activists to watch warren hot on hillary s heels the party s chances in 2016 are worse than the conventional wisdom suggests and hillary is a far weaker candidate than coverage would indicate democrats are embarking on a very dangerous flight of fancy wapo if the loss of the senate intensified strains within the party the 1 1trillion spending bill that passed saturday night raised two issues that acted as matches to gasoline mmmhmm how is president obama currently taking hits on the left for coziness with the
