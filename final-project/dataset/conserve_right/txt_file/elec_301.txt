 apparently monday aug 27 was opening day for hysterical liberal sanctimony about imagined republican racism during this first round the new york times the atlantic and the tv networks each put in a splendid showing i d need a book to cover it all hold on i have one mugged racial demagoguery from the seventies to obamaavailable in fine bookstores near you sept 25 2012 today we will focus on the outstanding individual performance of the man who since the departure of contessa brewer is widely regarded by his colleagues as the stupidest on air personality at msnbc ladies and gentlemen i give you chris matthews appearing on morning joe matthews exploded at republican national committee chairman reince priebus alleging that mitt romney s harmless birth certificate joke from a few days earlier was a cheap shot awful and an example of the republicans playing that card discussing his hometown roots while campaigning in michigan romney had cited the local hospitals where he and his wife were born adding no one s ever asked to see my birth certificate even the liberals on the show were perplexed asked to clarify whether he considered the birth certificate joke playing the race card matthews angrily said yeah there s no doubt he did with his birth certificate no doubt why would he bring it up why would he say i have no problem with my birth certificate what s that supposed to say mika brzezinski because he s an awkward joker joe scarborough because he misfired badly on the joke but matthews didn t have time for alternative explanations besides he had already yelled at joe and mika so the issue was obviously resolved chris quickly moved on to romney s ads describing the obama administration s change to welfare requirements as another example of racism matthews said that romney s factually correct claim that barack obama is weakening the work requirement for welfare was playing that card fuming at the rnc chair and you are playing that little ethnic card there priebus like most people who haven t spent much time around matthews could only laugh awkwardly matthews raged you can you play your games and giggle about it but the fact is your side is playing that card you start talking about work requirements you know what game you re playing and everybody knows what game you re playing it s a race card asked by scarborough if he really believed that the welfare ad was racist matthews said of course it is welfare food stamps on hardball that night matthews continued his welfare rant the romney ad was ethnically charged and a dog whistle the phrase dog whistle is a dog whistle for imaginary sightings of racism for the clincher matthews added did you catch romney following it up by saying this was obama s effort to excite and shore up his base passing out welfare checks his base as everyone but chris knows the base romney referred to consists not of individuals collecting welfare but those distributing it i e union dues paying government workers democrats problem with welfare reform always was that if it worked we would need fewer of these well pensioned public employees a fact repeatedly acknowledged by liberals themselves when welfare reform was first proposed in 1994 will marshall of the progressive policy institute said the reforms would sever democratic ties to the liberal base which he described as congress the interest groups that cluster around them the bureaucracies that work closely with them the social service providers and experts and think tank types robert kuttner of the uber liberal american prospect magazine wrote that welfare reform would hurt bill clinton with the democratic base liberal journalist jeff greenfield of abc news said that clinton s becoming a third way new democrat would risk alienating a liberal base i m sorry gentlemen but it is my sad duty to inform you you re all racists the next night on hardball matthews made his most dramatic announcement yet it seems the mention of chicago in relation to the president is also a racist dog whistle matthews they keep saying chicago by the way you noticed guest john heilemann like an orderly in a mental institution trapped alone with a patient played along responding well there s a lot of black people in chicago while frantically jabbing at the alarm button for the love of pete can t we all acknowledge that a reference to chicago in this context manifestly refers to corrupt big city machine politics and 1920s gangsterism not race no one thinks al capone was an african american my advice to chris is pace yourself it s a long way to election day if you get too crazy too soon you ll have nothing left for the fourth quarter alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist
