r persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion president elect donald trump ran an election campaign that challenged american diplomacy s long standing principles and shibboleths since his election triumph mr trump is already rewriting the rules of the presidency and signaling that his foreign policy approach will be unconventional even before assuming office mr trump has moved away from president obama s foreign policy approach by staking out starkly different positions on several sensitive subjects including china taiwan israel terrorism and nuclear weapons a trump presidency may not bring seismic shifts in american policy but it is likely to lead to significant change in u s priorities geopolitical focus and goals as well as in the tools washington would be willing to employ to help achieve its desired objectives no country faces a bigger challenge from mr trump s ascension to power than china which has been flexing its military and economic muscles more strongly than ever after the obama administration s obsequious stance beijing must brace up and face an assertive new national security and economic team in washington that is unlikely to put up with its covert territorial expansion and trade manipulation top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots mr trump has signaled a need to recalibrate foreign policy by shifting its geopolitical focus from russia to the increasingly muscular and openly revisionist china unlike russia s 2014 annexation of crimea china s territorial revisionism as illustrated in the south china sea and the himalayas is creeping and incremental yet relentless mr trump s focus on china and islamic radicalism indicates that far from retreating from asia and the middle east america is likely to play a sharper more concentrated role for example the u s military could carry out more significant reconnaissance and freedom of navigation operations in the south china sea to countries bearing the brunt of china s recidivist policies the obama administration s reluctance to challenge beijing forced several of them to tread with excessive caution around chinese concerns and interests a wake up call came with mr obama s silence about the 2012 chinese capture of the scarborough shoal located within the philippines exclusive economic zone washington did nothing in response to the capture despite its mutual defense treaty with the philippines that inaction helped spur china s frenzied creation of artificial islands in the south china sea in late 2013 when china unilaterally declared an air defense identification zone covering territories it claims but does not control in the east china sea mr obama again hesitated effectively condoning the action and recently his meek response to what mr trump called an unprecedented act china s daring seizure of a u s underwater drone advertised american weakness in the dying days of the obama administration an emboldened china is rushing more missiles to its man made islands in the south china sea where on mr obama s watch it has built seven islands and militarized them in an attempt to annex a strategically crucial corridor through which half of the world s annual merchant fleet tonnage passes china has demonstrated that defiant unilateralism is cost free but it knows that its free ride is about to end with mr trump willing to adopt a tougher and less predictable line toward it this is apparent from mr trump s suggestion after taking a phone call from taiwan s president tsai ing wen that a one china policy is no sacred cow for him by subsidizing exports and impeding imports china has long waged an economic war against other major economies the obama administration s announcement last april of a deal under which china would scrap export subsidies on some products largely agricultural items and textiles drew skepticism in the markets because it did not cover major exports including steel trade is one area where mr trump must deliver on his campaign promises or risk losing his credibility with the blue collar constituency that helped propel him to victory he is threatening to slap punitive tariffs on china for what he described during the campaign as the greatest theft in the history of the world mr trump is unlikely to be deterred by the specter of a trade war with china for the simple reason that beijing is already waging an economic war in fact mr trump s likely argument for a tough china stance will be that beijing s one sided economic war must be halted such a policy approach is also apparent from some of his appointments including economist peter navarro the author of death by china the coming china wars and crouching tiger what china s militarism means for the rest of the world u s china ties could be in for a rough patch for another reason mr trump could pivot to asia in a way mr obama did not mr obama s failure to provide strategic heft left his asia pivot unhinged to be sure mr trump is likely to face resistance to recalibrating u s foreign policy from two powerful lobbies in washington a large tribe of panda huggers and the old establishment figures who spent their formative years during the cold war obsessing with the soviet threat and now see russian president vladimir putin as the epitome of evil mr trump s task is made more onerous by a mainstream media that remains hostile to him despite its epic failure to anticipate or predict the election outcome still a determined donald trump is likely to reorient
