united states reince is a good man john kelly will do a fantastic job wallace voice over we ll discuss the president s decision to replace reince priebus as chief of staff with retired general john kelly when we sit down for an exclusive interview with counselor to the president kellyanne conway on camera then with the collapse of republican efforts to repeal and replace obamacare what happens now sen mitch mcconnell r ky majority leader it s time for our friends on the other friends on the other side to tell us what they have in mind wallace voice over we ll discuss the possibility for bipartisan compromise and what the other side is willing to give with house democratic leader nancy pelosi and with dysfunction in the nation s capital the worse it s been in years we ll get a view from outside the beltway when we talk with republican governor john kasich of ohio conway pelosi and kasich only on fox news sunday plus explosive obscene comments by the new white house communications chief shake washington we ll ask our sunday panel whether the latest white house shakeup will save the trump agenda all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington donald trump ended one of the worst weeks of his presidency putting a new man in charge of his white house staff the secretary of homeland security retired marine general john kelly with open this disarray in the administration and republicans failing to keep one of their biggest campaign promises to repeal obamacare is another staff shakeup enough in the moment we ll talk with counselor to the president kellyanne conway but first let aposs bring in kevin corke at the white house with the latest kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent chris clearly the elevation and the appointment of general kelly is intended to calm the seas for a white house that despite its best efforts has been rocked by turbulent seas throughout the trump ministration especially when you think about what has been happening here politically now sources do tell fox news that the new chief of staff will have control full control in fact over the oval office and schedule though we have also learned that some key staffers at least for the time being will continue to have what s being described to me as casual access to the president with kushner bannon conway scavino and scaramucci being among the names most often mentioned priebus ouster just the latest in a series of departures and seeing ph this administration marked by unrest and upheaval at the highest levels including the loss of national security adviser mike flynn the firing of fbi director jim comey and the departure of key white house figures dubke spicer and now priebus as for kelly to be effective he will need control over a team that has had competing factions and a president who s own lack of message discipline has made it exceedingly difficult at times to effectively and coherently shepherd his message sources tell fox news general kelly will have that control and that was one of the major selling points to get him to come to the white house after several overtures his first day on the job chris is monday and given that explosive and profanity laced interview by the communications director last week and of course the latest setback on healthcare it aposs a safe bet he will have his hands full chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks for that let aposs drill down on what we can expect from the new chief of staff we are joined now by counselor to the president kellyanne conway kellyanne i want to start with a question that my colleague martha mccallum asked you on friday whether or not all of the white house staff will now report to the new chief of staff general kelly here s your answer begin video clip kellyanne conway counselor to the president that s just a pecking order question i think it s beside the point and here s why we all serve the president and this country end video clip wallace respectfully kellyanne i don t think it is beside the point an awful lot of people in and out of this white house say the problem is there s the lack of discipline there s an absence of chain of command so i m going to ask you again will all of the white house staff report to the new chief of staff conway so i will do whatever the president and our new chief of staff general kelly ask me to do and yesterday i was on fox friends and said very clearly that if we can have protocol pecking order order discipline and the chief of staff that empowers the staff to succeed i know that general kelly has done that on the battlefield i know that he s done that as a chief military aide to former cabinet secretary i know he s done that as a cabinet secretary and so we have great faith that that will be done and that is nothing about our outgoing chief of staff reince priebus who should hold his head high as he exits many great things happen in the first six months during his tenure and i think that reince will go down as one of the most successful and certainly longest serving rnc chairs were as chair they were able to raise a great deal of money and improve the digital and grassroots operation that allowed the republican party to succeed by getting the house the senate the governorships the state legislatures so i m always a protocol and pecking order kind of gal and i m very deferential person i ve never addressed the president even when he was a candidate and as close as we are as boss and employee i ve never addressed him by his first name i always address people like general kelly as sir and i also with reince priebus was happy to do what i was asked to do as a member of his staff but i think so much of the chief of staff role also occurred outside of the building there s a little too much going on right now in terms of acting like he is the personnel chief inside the building only this is somebody who regularly interfaces with the cabinet and general kelly is coming from the cabinet he will be talking to his peers about their different concerns their different deployment of issues wallace but look conway we aposve got a very active cabinet it often doesn t get covered he ll also be interfacing with capitol hill where a lot of the legislative agenda has stalled i think the chaos this week really was on capitol hill and in the senate why after 7 1 2 years nobody jumped out of a cake and gave us healthcare reform on a silver platter i don apost know wallace we re going to get to health care in a moment i do want to talk though about the disarray inside the white house you had anthony scaramucci and a profanity laced attack on another other members not just one of the administration of the white house staff and so i just want to ask you directly has scaramucci who said that he reports directly to the president has scaramucci have you have you now been told you to report to john kelly conway i will speak with general kelly and the president about that as i m sure anthony scaramucci will we are very i think we re all very curious and very excited to have our first formal meeting with our new chief of staff tomorrow i had a very brief conversation with him this weekend and again getting being able to solve the problems of this nation and doing it in an orderly and rapid fashion is really why we were sent to washington it s why the two people who are elected donald trump and mike pence and no one else are there so to the extent that we can do more and do it more quickly in a disrupted fashion in which we aposre accustomed to with donald j trump i think that having the tools in place is very important but i talked to anthony this weekend i talked to reince this weekend everybody is on the same team into terms of we re on the side of freedom and democracy repealing and replacing obamacare lowering taxes putting isis in retreat cracking down on these gangs sanctions on russia wallace right conway north korea and iran you know there aposs just so much that s happening and i ve got to say the swamp includes many people many institutions individuals and i think calcified ideas that need disruption it includes folks also on capitol hill who i don apost know what they were expecting chris were they not expecting donald trump to make good on his campaign promise and the moral imperative of getting the 20 million plus americans who have no health care coverage the relief they need the 6 5 million who we aposre willing to fork over money 3 billion worth to the irs rather than get simple obamacare coverage where do they not expect this president to go ahead and do what he said he was going to do wallace kellyanne you ve got to allow you aposve got to allow me to ask some questions here i want to ask you about one more question on the administration and then we ll move on to healthcare this week the president continued to attack his attorney general jeff sessions and when he was asked whether or not he aposs going to keep sessions in the job or fire him here was his answer begin video clip trump i m very disappointed with the attorney general but we will see what happens time will tell time will tell end video clip wallace does the president want sessions to continue as attorney general or has been suggested is he considering him moving over to replace general kelly as the secretary of homeland security conway again that s a personnel question and only the president can answer so just on friday you had thursday and friday you had attorney general sessions in el salvador and you had president trump on long island both working toward the same goal which is to stop these vile groups these ms 13 gangs who are murdering innocent americans and bringing drugs and violence and to our community crosstalk wallace i understand that does that mean conway at the same time well he aposs working crosstalk wallace no but i understand he s working the question is is he considering him moving over if you re going to if the immigration part of this is so important to be the secretary of secretary of homeland security conway i won apost comment on that but i will tell you that the president has expressed frustration about the recusal so much has flowed from that recusal and so much of president trump s agenda flows from the department of justice many of the primary issues and the program he won successfully on goes to the department of justice and look what s happened with this ridiculous russian collusion delusion you see all these journalists who built entire tv sets and lower thirds and screaming graphics and breathless coverage now slinking away this week chris from russian collusion coverage why because you have everybody from jared kushner giving his meeting with the senate and giving his public statement you have no there there whatsoever it s completely we were promised the next watergate we don apost even have water polo we don t even have watermelon it s so ridiculous and the only thing i can see happening with russia right now is this fusion gps matter as the senate witnessed who said everybody should go look over there and what s happened somebody being paid by the russians to compile a damaging dossier on donald trump again filled with falsities and lies you know how much time has been wasted away from the victims of obamacare crosstalk wallace ok let s not waste any more time let s talk kellyanne let aposs talk about obamacare the president put out a new tweet today i want to put it on the screen he wrote don t give up republican senators the world is watching repeal and replace and go to 51 votes nuclear option get cross state lines and more is that the president s plan stay on repeal and replace change the senate rules and legislative filibuster so that you can pass a fuller repeal and replace including selling insurance across state lines conway the president will not accept those who said it aposs quote time to move on he wants to help the millions of americans who have suffered with no coverage they were lied to by the last president they couldn apost keep the doctor they couldn apost keep their plan we ve met with the obamacare victims at the white house several times now they re real people they re suffering and when he talks about the 51 votes the president is basically making the case that so many of the components of real healthcare reform chris requires 60 votes the drug pricing the selling of insurance across state lines the associated health plans that allow those who don apost get their health insurance to the employers like you and i do or to government benefits who have been left out because the premiums are too high premiums have doubled we see in some states that there are no insurers crosstalk wallace let aposs talk about that kellyanne conway so he will he will stick with it wallace ok failing it and fail and then we should point out that both republicans and democrats say that there s no chance they re going to change the senate rules here s what the president says his plan is begin video clip trump i said from the beginning let obamacare implode and then do it i turned out to be right let obamacare implode applause end video clip wallace failing repeal and replace is that really what the president intends to do does he intend to cut off what are called cost sharing reductions which lower the out of pocket expenses for people lower income people and what about you talk about real people what about the millions of people while obamacare is imploding that are going to lose healthcare coverage conway so chris i saw the comment from mr schumer senator schumer about this what is their plan to help the csr payments are being made and we aposve already got an opinion by one court because you have members of congress who sued to say that under obamacare this money was never authorized through the congress and so they would like an opportunity to do that which is of course the normal course of business can i just ask senator schumer crosstalk wallace is the present going to cut off the csr payments the out of pocket payments he can do it starting next month this week conway yes he can he can he aposs going to make that decision this week and that s the decision that only he can make but let aposs go back to what we are really talking about here when he said yesterday in the same tweet i believe about the bailout the insurance companies bailout from members of congress he s talked about the csr payments he s also talking about this really sweet deal that members of congress and their staffers have where they are not beholden to the same health healthcare that so many americans say is unaffordable and unsustainable and untenable and this is exactly what so many americans hate about washington d c they feel like they have their nose pressed up against the glass peering into the special interests the swamp these lobbyists the folks on capitol hill they want people to live under the same rules they do and frankly if people had the same rules on capitol hill maybe they would have a stronger taste of what it feels like to be in a short what it feels like wallace kellyanne conway to have to choose between paying your premiums and paying your grocery bill wallace kellyanne conway but the president will make that decision but look the democrats have a big stop sign up they aposre obstructing everything wallace all right we d love to continue we aposve got to move on thank you so much thank you for your time always good to talk with you conway thank you chris wallace when we come back we ll discuss the trump white house and we ll try to answer the question what are democrats willing to give to get a compromise on obamacare house democratic leader nancy pelosi joins us next only on fox news sunday commercial break wallace it aposs now back to the drawing board for health care reform after the republican plan to repeal and replace imploded on the senate floor is the solution to obamacare bipartisan compromise joining me now is house democratic leader nancy pelosi leader pelosi welcome back to fox news sunday rep nancy pelosi d cali minority leader good morning my pleasure to be here wallace thank you how much trouble is this president in and do you think that putting general kelly in there is going to make a difference pelosi well let me take the second part i hope so i look forward to working with general kelly i ve worked with him as with secretary kelly at the department of homeland security so i will be speaking with him today and look forward to working with him it s a very important position the president the chief of staff to the president of the united states and it has to be recognized that he is the chief of staff wallace well i was going to ask you about that you aposve been in washington you ph see a lot of white houses the way they operate does this white house need more discipline pelosi well the i can just say from my experience working with the bush i white house andy card had a great rapport everybody knew he was the chief of staff and he had and that was recognized on capitol hill that he really was the chief of staff and with josh bolten highly respected we also work closely with him with our differences but nonetheless respectful of getting results wallace with the defeat of repeal and replace this week in the senate do you think that the republican effort to repeal obamacare is dead pelosi well the american people have spoken i think what you saw was just an outpouring of stories of how the affordable care act affected their lives so where do we go from here wallace but let me just say you say the american people have spoken they put republicans in charge of the house republicans in charge of the senate republicans in the white house all running on repeal and replace you could argue that they spoke and washington didn apost listen pelosi well they no i m talking about since the election they have seen what the replace might be and they have rejected that overwhelmingly people see what it means in their lives i think it aposs really important for us to recognize the facts here that what the republicans are putting forth put 17 million 20 million 22 million or 23 million people off the rolls and diminish the benefits increased the costs had an age tax undermined medicare and really was not a good proposal i think that there is in senator mcconnell s one of his bills that he had the repeal and replace he had a provision that we can all embrace and it was a provision to cover the cost sharing that is in cost sharing reduction to extend the range of reinsurance which is very important it has about short term stability long term stability and i fully support that and hope that he would advance that wallace all right let s because this gets in the weeds and i don t what to get too technical here for folks you sent a letter to republican congressional leaders on friday in which you said i want to extend my hand i want bipartisan compromise one of the things that you very much want and you just referred to it i talked to kellyanne conway about it is what are called sharing reduction payments these are payments to insurance companies that lower the out of pocket costs to things like deductibles and co pays for lower income people who are on the exchanges pelosi and middle income and middle income wallace let me just say president trump tweeted this yesterday if a new healthcare bill is not approved quickly bailouts for insurance companies he s talking about the csrs and bailouts for members of congress will end very soon here s my question leader pelosi to keep those csr payments what are you as democrats willing to give to get a real compromise pelosi let s go let aposs back up on it the affordable care act is a market oriented proposal doing the cost sharing the reductions a way to have it be in the free market in the marketplace as opposed to having everyone say have many more people on medicaid or something so you there s governors of states had said give me the money i ll buy insurance for these people so this is not bailing on insurance companies this is about having stability in the private sector in order to provide healthcare wallace with a huge government subsidy here s my point pelosi but it s not crosstalk wallace here s my point republicans compromise means both sides give not one side gives and the other side takes republicans want to cut back on obamacare s mandates on obamacare s taxes on some of obamacare s regulations what are you willing to give what are you willing to agree to as part of that that would allow a true bipartisan compromise pelosi well here s the thing first of all you will remember that the affordable care act as we passed and as we call it the affordable care act is something that was very modeled after romneycare and that said no free riders everybody has to have insurance so that if your neighbor aposs not buying insurance and you are you are paying more because he or she is not so this is about enlarging the pool making it healthier younger and having more benefits in the crosstalk wallace i understand the reason and i understand the history but it doesn apost sound like you aposre willing to give anything pelosi nobody is ph the question is that what did they have to offer in other words you have to have a big pool and in order to do that you have an employer and the and the wallace how about for instance you talk about free market instead of mandating that people have it what the republicans were saying forgive me was of you don apost have it and now you want to buy insurance you got to wait for a while or you got to pay a premium to get it in other words instead of saying i m the government you have to buy insurance why not say there s going to be a penalty if you don apost buy it pelosi well here s the thing when the president went into office there really was an opportunity to say you you have if you don apost like this how would you do this but instead they said we re repealing the whole thing 22 million people off cost will go up benefits will go down that s not a way to go down a path so what i say in the letter is as a first step let us accept what senator mcconnell has in his bill let us accept that and talk about other wallace yes but you want other changes let me let me switch pelosi but and then let aposs talk about what other changes are but you cannot say that we re going to have i do believe as i saw one of your staff ph this morning that healthcare is a right not a privilege and the more people who are involved in it the lower the costs are for everyone there s some things we can do right away lower the cost of prescription drugs a very something i think would have bipartisan support crosstalk wallace ok i want to a move to another subject the democratic leader in the senate chuck schumer said something interesting the other day and i want to ask you about it we re going to put it on the screen when you lose to somebody who has 40 percent popularity you don apost blame other things comey russia you blame yourself so what did we do wrong people didn apost know what we stood for just what that we were against trump and still believe that we re going to get to your new agenda in a minute but i want to ask you the specific questions do you agree with senator schumer that russia and come were not what beat hillary clinton pelosi well i think that they had influence there s absolutely no question about that but when you have a campaign you re responsible for your campaign i don apost even want to go in to that i do want to go in to our better deal let me wallace ok i m going to ask you about it because democrats put out a new agenda this week called a better deal let aposs put some of it up on the screen you call for higher wages lower prescription drug costs as you said job training infrastructure leader pelosi i m not saying anything any of that is wrong pelosi right wallace what i am saying is that none of it is new we aposve been hearing it for years we heard it from the democrats and hillary clinton in 2016 and you lost pelosi now well we aposre going to hear with more clarity for the first time since 2006 the house the congressional democrats are in charge of the message in 06 we were in charge we won we had a democratic president after that in 08 and that time line a very successful presidency now it aposs our turn to win the congress for the american people but elections are more about than about winning election they re about having a discussion to how we go forward wallace but they re all about winning the election that s what an election pelosi no no no it s about winning on the issues i mean in other words if the american people can hold all of us democrats and republicans accountable for what is in their interest instead of a trickle down agenda that really benefits the high end at the expense of working families that s why a better deal is important and it is entrepreneurial in its thinking it s fresh in terms of what it suggests wallace but let me ask you this there were four special house elections in this spring in which there were republican seats that were opened because they put jobs in the trump administration let me finish in the trump administration pelosi no i m agreeing with you wallace and you lost all four of them some of your own democratic colleagues in the house say part of the problem is that you and your leadership team are frankly too old and the question i have is does do democrats need new leaders with new ideas pelosi but let me just say this self promotion is a terrible thing but somebody has got to do it wallace exactly i agree with you on that pelosi and i think that the situation that we are in i am a master legislator i know the budget to the nth degree i know the motivation of people i respect the people who are in congress i think this is a great moment for those of us who understand what is stake with the affordable care act what our possibilities are in terms of working together with the republicans as has been our experience in the past so i feel very confident about the support i have in my caucus wallace let me just ask you one pelosi i ve never i have never not been opposed within my caucus and it had nothing to do with support suppose you became president and you were a democrat and you appoint your cabinet one from san francisco one from berkeley one from brooklyn one from santa monica do you think that the republicans could have ever won one those seats these seats were not seats wallace ok i got 30 seconds and the question is what are the chances democrats win back the house in 2018 and if so will you run for speaker pelosi it s so unimportant what is important is that we have a lively debate on a better deal better pay better jobs and a better future and that s what we look forward to having we have unity in our party you saw with the fight on affordable care act in the house and in the senate wallace right pelosi we are very proud of the fact that our party has diverse thinking in it we can accommodate that wallace leader pelosi thank you thanks for coming in please come back pelosi thank you my pleasure chris nice to be with you again thank you for being a guardian of our democracy the press wallace well thank you for that up next we ll get a view from outside the beltway when we sit down with ohio governor john kasich how do washington aposs problems look from there commercial break wallace coming up president trump caps off a tough week with a major staff shake up begin video clip trump reince is a good man john kelly will do a fantastic job end video clip wallace we ll ask our sunday panel about the state of the trump white house commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway of the statehouse in columbus ohio at the end of a rough weekend here in washington we what to find out how things look some distance from the nation aposs capital joining me now ohio aposs republican governor john kasich governor let aposs start with with president trump when you look at the events of just recent days the public humiliation of jeff sessions the the shocking interview by anthony scaramucci the open infighting in the white house sitting there in columbus ohio what do you think gov john kasich r ohio well i aposm worried about our country obviously chris and here aposs the thing you know the white house is an amazing institution it has great power but when i think about the people who have been able to lend voice to amplify that power you know i think about fdr nothing to fear but fear itself i think about jfk you know it aposs not what you what your country can do for you what do you do for your country or ronald reagan you know the city on a on a a shining city on a hill what we need and i think perhaps the president can get there i sure hope so is sort of the sense of unity of hopefulness not of division but of lifting and and i think we aposre not seeing enough we aposre not seeing that right now and so you take the powerful institution of the white house you combine it with a voice that is power and uplifting and that aposs what people loved about roosevelt that aposs what they loved about about kennedy it aposs what they loved about ronald reagan and that aposs what we need that needs to be thought about blitzer and and other than just belief and optimism about this country what makes you think that we aposre going to get that from this white house kasich because i aposm basically a glass half full guy and you know we aposve had six months but we have you know we aposve got a long way to go i just hope we aposre going to get it and i i would also tell you chris it aposs also congress if we aposre not going to get this direction out of the white house then we need to get it out of the congress and in congress we need people to get along and you know i listen to the leaders talk and i i don apost actually think the answer is with the leaders in the congress i think the answer is with the rank and file people who know that that city is now dysfunctional and i think furthermore we need to realize that it aposs not just the political leaders that are showing dysfunction it aposs the people in the country the partisans who demand certain things as john mccain said in a very bombastic way and that aposs not america america is give and take america is compromise without giving up your principles that aposs that aposs what our country is chris finding solutions to difficult problems not while tearing each other down but figuring out how we can get along and i aposve been involved in so many of those things let me tell you at the end of my term in congress i was having a conversation with pat schroeder the former colorado woman who tried to run for president kind of a polarizing figure in a way she was a friend of mine and i had these republicans say what are you talking to her for and i said what do you mean what am i i gave i read them the riot act i said you don apost have to agree with somebody to respect them to see if there are areas where you can get along where you can work together that aposs all kind of gone and i blame a lot of it on the leadership and they allowed these people who were in their rank and file to become partisans too we don apost make it as a country when we spend our time fighting all the time and denigrating people we don apost agree with wallace so how do you explain and we should point out you aposre now the governor in your second term in ohio but you spent 18 years here in washington as a member of congress how you explain the gop aposs failure after seven years of promising to repeal obamacare but also to come up with a replacement how do you explain that collapse of the bill in the senate this week kasich you know chris i aposm i aposm going to say i actually think it aposs a good thing for this reason because i think republicans looked over the cliff and i think they saw that there were going to be a lot of people who were going to be hurt particular people who don apost have much of a voice who the machine in the system grinds down and they pulled back i don apost think that this is done i don apost think it ought to be done i understand there will be hearings in the u s senate on what we can do about the exchanges i mean so to to a degree i aposm glad that they didn apost fulfill this this pledge right now but they have to work on it and and this is where they should call the democrats in and they should demand democratic participation and remember republicans are in the majority they get to call the tune but when they call the tune they aposve got to have a few democrats singing in the choir it aposs just that simple so i don apost think we aposre done with it yet we can apost be done with it yet and we can apost be done going after the underlying rising costs of health care the problem of entitlements which is going to you know kill our economy in the country address the issues of the division between rich and poor you aposve got to work together i did it when i was there even when we went through a government shutdown we balance the federal budget by working together and understanding one another and caring about one another even when we disagreed wallace but but let me ask you about that there aposs a lot to unpacked there you say let aposs work together we just had nancy pelosi on and she made a very strong case for her side but when i asked her what are you willing to give on taxes on regulation on mandates she said nothing kasich well look my friend tom carper from delaware is willing to give a lot my friend from colorado wallace but that let me get but he aposs a democratic senator go ahead kasich yes and and john hickenlooper the governor of colorado he and i are working together with you know ten other 9 other governors look you don apost do this in front of a national television audience you sit in a room you sit together you talk but each other aposs kids you go out you have a little dinner and you start saying what is the area of common agreement in apos97 bill clinton and the republicans had a had a feud and a war that led into a government shutdown you know what happened the the democrats in the white house came to see me and and senator domenici and we had private conversations and we opened up a dialogue of discussions we balanced the federal budget paid down debt the economy was doing great and no one was left behind you don apost do this in front of the tv camera but again you know chris this is one of the things everything aposs not on the leaders forget the leaders why don apost we get the rank and file members who were there hopefully to serve the country and not their party or some ideology stick to your principals but figure out how to give and stop asking the leaders for permission you aposre not in the fifth grade where you aposve got to ask the teacher if you can use the bathroom go out and talk to people on the other side here aposs the other thing chris have some guts you know all these politicians run around worried about well you know i aposm going to get killed by the tea party or i aposm going to get slaughtered by the left who are you surveying we aposve got the stop listening to all the yelling and screaming those are the people who should be released listen to wallace all right kasich and and get to the middle of our country wallace all right finally because there running out of time i aposm going to pursue a line of questions that my guess is you aposre going to hate but here we here we go and that is that you didn apost endorse donald trump you say you didn apost vote for him you wrote in john mccain instead would you consider running against donald trump in the 2020 primaries kasich no i don apost think about that chris and frankly you don apost you know you aposve got a republican president we don apost know what the future aposs going to hold and i don apost do these things because i aposm worried about my political future let me tell you if i answered a question and said i was even thinking about it i couldn apost go home tonight my wife would lock the doors on me look here aposs the most important thing for me i aposve got to serve the country i aposve got to be honest inside i cannot have you know just media appearances so i can be on television i aposve got to be a good guy i aposve got to i aposve got to be a man of faith and i aposve got to you know it aposs so i don apost know what the future aposs going to bring but i aposm not preparing anything along those lines but i want my voice to be out there because i think my voice and the voice of my colleagues made a difference in this health care debate wallace governor governor kasich thank you thanks for sharing part of your sunday with us always good to talk with you sir kasich come to columbus chris we need you to come out here let aposs spend a lot of time talking about all of this we can heal this country thank you wallace

about the state of the trump white house just go to facebook foxnewsunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip leon panetta former defense secretary i think it

aposs former defense secretary leon panetta talking about the new white house chief of staff general john kelly who was panetta aposs senior military advisor in the pentagon and it aposs time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service former democratic congressman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and gop strategist karl rove karl how much trouble is this president in and is general kelly the man to get him out of it karl rove fox news contributor well he aposs in a lot of trouble this week it was the most tumultuous week we aposve seen of a tumultuous presidency and kelly faces for challenge first of all the decision making process inside the white house had broken it is not disciplined it aposs not focused it aposs not deliberate and he was one of the first victims of it in the very first week of this administration when he raised objections which were not taken into account with the first travel ban he aposs got this issue of access this president is not going to end the practice of allowing people to flow in and out of the white house most presidents allow that the question is is kelly going to be able to stop people from using their access to the oval office to end run the policy process to cause things to happen that have not gone through the normal normal range he aposs going to have to deal with a couple of staff members who can apost be fired the son in law and daughter and maybe a couple of other protected people inside the white house scaramucci for example and finally he aposs going to have to reduce the drama reduce both the sniping within and reduce the leaks and bring some discipline to the relationships between this white house which is at war with itself i aposve never seen anything like it in my life of a white house so eager to to leak on itself wallace congresswoman harman you have worked with general kelly on several projects i don apost think anybody questions his competence and his qualifications but and his command but doesn apost know enough about politics does he know enough about domestic policy tax reform health care do be an effective chief of staff fmr rep jane harman d california i think he knows enough to be an effective chief of staff if this president in tweet allows him to use the process that karl is talking about to solve our problems but the first answer is north korea launched an icbm yesterday capable of hitting the continental u s it might not happen a warhead might be too heavy reentry might be a problem but this is a real problem and if he can focus this white house and this president at a careful answer to the north korean problem that will be the first test second point is congress proved itself capable not incapable last week no one talks about the fact that the sanctions package against three countries passed overwhelmingly wallace russia and north korea and iran harman yes veto proof and trump is about to or did sign it yesterday and the point of that is that was a good piece of legislation all three countries are screaming about it which means that congress and the president acting together sent a tough message that aposs a challenge it aposs also an opportunity congress can authorize the use of military force in the middle east and around the world in ways it hasn apost acted in 16 years so i think kelly is well equipped to deal with those two things and that would be a phenomenal start wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the state of the trump white house people seem to be getting fed up take a look nick tweeted this is there a plan other than aposshock and awe apos reasonable americans want to support our president but this reality tv nonsense has got to stop and we got this on facebook from charlette yared how can this white house possibly recover respect after this past week aposs sessions scaramucci boy scouts priebus and other histrionics why the drama and the antics brit how do you answer them brit hume fox news senior political analyst well the first thing i aposd say is that reince priebus is not the one to blame for such behavior this all comes down to the president and his behavior and its way of doing things and the casual way that he ran his business in new york where where he really kept a very loose schedule and people came and went and he picked up the phone and called different people at different times depending on what he was focused on at the moment white houses can apost operate that way this staff structure that exists in the white house traditionally which was developed over many years and many administrations is there is that way for a reason and the question really is not whether john kelly has the ability to be an effective chief of staff i think he manifestly does the question is whether donald trump will permit that whether he will allow that whether when somebody wonders into the oval office the first words out of his mouth will be does kelly know you aposre here and i think that aposs in doubt so what happens for example chris when when they have a date planned with events and so forth and a policy strategy and sir tweets a lot blows it all up in the middle of the night with some rant on twitter what happens then does does general kelly has some say over that those are all the unanswered questions and i think we aposll know the answer to them pretty answers to them pretty soon wallace wouldn apost you assume that he would have gotten some at least assurances hume of course inaudible wallace because supposedly he was asked about this as as far back as may hume yes wallace and he resisted taking the job hume right i think i suspect he does have verbal commitments to the president to that effect the question is will the president stick to them not will kelly will the president it aposs all about the president wallace senator john mccain after his diagnosis of brain cancer came back to washington very dramatically seized the spotlight here he was calling for his colleagues in the senate to go in a different direction begin video clip sen john mccain r arizona i hope we can again rely on humility on our need to cooperate on our dependence on each other to learn how to trust each other again and by so doing better serve the people who elected us stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the internet to hell with them begin video clip wallace though it was a powerful moment but what are the chances that it will actually happen in both parties mo elleithee fox news contributor yes as one of those bombastic loudmouths on television wallace no you aposre not elleithee i you know he aposs right but what at the chances i aposm not optimistic right now i think that there are too many factors at play that i hope we can get past but everything from a white house that seems determined to blow up every institution it can from the judiciary to the media to its own party to congress to congressional representation that is to driven on both sides on both sides of the aisle that is to driven by the way district lines are drawn now and the the importance of of the base for each side it is incredibly difficult to see a path right now out of the entrenched silos that both sides are living john mccain leaving the senate is going to be a huge loss for for that institution because of the fact that he seems to be one of those people and there are still some on both sides that are willing to try to get past some of these fissures but they aposre dwindling in numbers and until we start getting more people who will look that way we aposre going to be in trouble wallace karl we aposve got a couple of minutes left that aposs all you travel the country you talk to a lot of republicans how do they i aposm not talking about politicians i aposm talking about businessmen community leaders when you talk to them how do they feel about what they see i aposm not talking just about trump the congress the democrats the republicans how do they feel about what they see going on here rove well among sort of people who are active in politics party leaders business leaders community leaders i hear an increasing you know scratch their head why can apost this thing get done why can apost the republicans govern why can apost the president lead why do we have to put up with this drama more damaging i aposm starting to hear from ordinary americans as i travel who say you know what it aposs too much i aposm turning off i aposm turning out and the problem for the president when ordinary people start to say you know what i aposve had enough of all of this is that he aposs going to be stuck where he aposs stuck at that moment and what i aposm afraid of is is that he aposs had a honeymoon a ragged rugged not normal honey political honeymoon with the american people he aposs not seized the opportunities given to him on it and i think a lot of people are starting to say you know what i aposm done i aposve had it he aposs had plenty of time to demonstrate to me whether or not he aposs got an ability to to get it down now maybe general kelly will get it done maybe general kelly will help turn it around but i think brit was absolutely right this depends upon the willingness of the president to change his behavior wallace thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week from navy seal to the governor aposs mansion in the show me state commercial break wallace for most people being a rhodes scholar or a navy seal would be a crowning achievement but as we told you earlier this year for one young politician it was just the beginning here is our power player of the week begin videotape gov eric greitens r missouri i come as a conservative an outsider a navy seal and we aposre taking on politics as usual thank you god bless you wallace voice over meet eric greitens elected in november as missouri aposs governor and at age 43 the nation aposs second youngest greitens so help me god unidentified female congratulations wallace but what really sets him apart is his path to public office back in 2000 he was a rhodes scholar who also worked with humanitarian groups in war torn countries like bosnia and rwanda one day at oxford he looked at a memorial for rhodes scholars who died in the two world wars greitens if they hadn apost have made that decision then i wouldn apost be standing here and i realized at that moment that i wanted to do my part and i wanted to serve wallace greitens did four tours as a navy seal serving in both iraq and afghanistan greitens you know that at every moment there aposs somebody to your left and somebody to your right and that they aposre counting on you i can stay strong for them for ten more seconds i can fight for them for one more minute if i can make it for one more minute i can make it for ten more minutes wallace when greitens returned to missouri he started a non profit called the mission continues to help veterans with disabilities recover by serving others greitens continue their mission of service in communities and start their own businesses and get quality private sector jobs and to live as contributing citizens again here at home wallace the ferguson riots in 2014 where the turning point that led greitens into politics greitens ferguson was a tremendous failure if we aposd had a leader who aposd show up with any kind of command presence and courage and calm and clarity we could have had peace by the second night wallace greitens ran as an outsider and he wasn apost subtle about it greitens well i aposm no career politician i aposm on a navy seal and i aposll take dead aim at politics as usual wallace as governor he has kept aiming at the same target wallace on camera you talk about ethics reform before issues why greitens well because we have to have people who trust their leaders you know people want to have leaders who they can have confidence in wallace voice over his first act was to ban gifts from lobbyists to members of the executive branch greitens the people of missouri are ready to work so let aposs get to work today wallace but he aposs also signed a right to work law to boost missouri aposs economy and on public safety he aposs worked out with local police and gone to poor neighborhoods to hand out sandwiches greitens we need to have leaders who are willing to go to the front line and that what what too many politicians have just failed to do wallace when greitens and his wife sheena held their first event in the governors residences they were told it aposs usually a cocktail party for political insiders instead they invited three foster families for dinner as a symbol of the 13 000 kids in state foster care greitens as governor we can make a difference in those kids apos lies as governor we can keep our promises to the peop
