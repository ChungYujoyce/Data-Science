frustration with the policies however richard hoffmann senior associate at the beijing based dezan shira associates ltd a company that seeks to integrate foreign businesses into the 8 8 trillion chinese economy said the policies impact will vary depending on the company chinese policies on foreign businesses have been on the books for several years but are only recently being implemented they include new laws that increase taxes on companies in raw manufacturing and reduce taxes on high tech and service companies the china labor law which sets basic working conditions and a policy currently being modified that would make locally made goods easier to purchase taxes also will be levied on factories that produce large amounts of pollution if china feels that it can do what the foreign businesses are doing on its own then those businesses will face more restrictions mr hoffmann said noting that some companies were forced to restructure because of the new policies the u s china business council uscbc a nonprofit group that seeks to expand trade with china reported that the new restrictions are the result of chinese complaints that china s rapid economic growth is based

yam president of the u s china chamber of commerce said enforcing china s labor laws such as through unionization will help protect chinese workers by requiring safe working conditions many workers are easily exploited because they have little to no education or rights and can only survive by hard labor he said i think the government is doing the right thing mr yam said adding that he wonders whether the government can enforce the law he noted the last time beijing tried to implement it during the start of the worldwide economic downturn the government reversed it overnight commerce
