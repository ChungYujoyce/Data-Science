tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap science took a beating in the political arena this past week as president donald trump sowed confusion about hurricane dorian s path and democratic presidential candidates rang false alarms about the air we breathe trump found himself contradicted by his government s own meteorologists when he warned of danger to alabama then spent days defending his outlier forecast by week s end curiosity over who had drawn a loop on a weather map played out alongside life shaping questions about who should and shouldn t flee the storm on broader questions about climate and air quality in particular neither trump nor some democrats seem to be able to get it right top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender gop vows to investigate reports planned parenthood clinics took coronavirus aid a sampling from a week of statements from trump and the democratic campaign on weather war climate the economy and more war joe biden democratic presidential candidate on the iraq war immediately that moment it started i came out against the war at that moment interview tuesday with npr the facts not so as a senator in 2002 biden had voted to give president george w bush the authority to invade iraq which he did in march 2003 as part of a shock and awe bombing campaign with some coalition allies four months later in july biden was still expressing strong support for the military engagement nine months ago i voted with my colleagues to give the president of the united states of america the authority to use force and i would vote that way again today biden told the brookings institution it wasn t until 2005 that he came around to calling the war a mistake blaming bush because we went too soon we went without sufficient force and we went without a plan stormy weather trump in addition to florida south carolina north carolina georgia and alabama will most likely be hit much harder than anticipated looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever already category 5 tweet sunday 7 51 a m national weather service birmingham alabama will not see any impacts from dorian we repeat no impacts from hurricane dorian will be felt across alabama the system will remain too far east tweet sunday 8 11 a m the facts the episode showed what has been learned from other destructive storms trump can t be counted on to provide reliable information as a potential natural disaster takes shape even as his agencies try to do so it was never most likely that alabama would be hit hard never mind by one of the largest hurricanes ever within a half hour of trump s tweet the weather service s office in birmingham alabama had tamped down any expectations of a hit on alabama with its no impacts tweet a meteorologist in the birmingham office said the tweet was in response to residents concerns and christopher vaccaro speaking for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration which oversees the weather service said that day the current forecast path of dorian does not include alabama the official forecast at 8 a m sunday closest to trump s warning tweet showed a large zone of possible strikes but alabama was outside that zone by at least 180 miles at the time several graphics issued by the national hurricane center showed that parts of alabama had a small chance 5 to 10 of getting tropical storm force winds graphics from the previous week had suggested much more of alabama could see an impact though the odds even then were against it but those graphics which are not official forecasts in any event were outdated by sunday meantime alabama was not mentioned in any of the 75 forecast advisories the hurricane center issued between aug 27 and sept 2 a period covered by trump s tweet digging in his heels trump on wednesday displayed a map of the hurricane forecast from the previous week it had been altered to include what appeared to be a hand drawn half circle that extended the cone of uncertainty over a swath of alabama he had no explanation for the alteration then late friday noaa issued a statement walking back its position from the previous weekend and now lending a measure of support to the president it said the tweet from the birmingham weather office about no impact to alabama had been inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time this time the spokesperson was anonymous hot air pete buttigieg for me and everybody i know for the children that we hope to have for the people who will be alive at the turn of the century when if we don t change what we re doing we could lose half the world s oxygen because of what s going on in the oceans that is unthinkable cnn town hall with democratic presidential candidates wednesday the facts this is not sound science you and your descendants can breathe easy about the planet s oxygen levels there are other things to worry about from climate change fossil fuel combustion and amazon fires climate scientists told the associated press that buttigieg s claim that half of earth s oxygen is at risk is false that one is indeed a howler said michael e mann director of the earth system science center at pennsylvania state global oxygen concentrations are maintained by long term geological cycles and nothing here is going to alter that in any significant way if climate change is left unchecked the atmosphere could lose about a tenth of one percent of its oxygen content by the end of the century said jonathan overpeck professor at the university of michigan s school for environment and sustainability there is no science behind the idea that we could lose half the world s oxygen instead it s only a tiny amount one thing we don t have to worry about is oxygen levels in the atmosphere while burning fossil fuels does use up oxygen it s a far smaller amount than buttigieg suggests said texas a m university climate scientist andrew dessler he calculated the figures and came up with at most a reduction of oxygen of about 2 adding this is an absolute upper limit more reasonable estimates would be much much smaller probably less than a few tenths a percent and this is if we burn everything atmospheric scientist scott denning of colorado state university has estimated that if oxygen production were to stop now earth would have 1 million years of oxygen left such scientists see an urgent need to do more to address the emissions that are warming the climate and bringing profound change to life as billions know it depletion of atmospheric oxygen is not one of those changes beto o rourke proposing u s leadership on climate change convene those other top wealthy economies to make sure that this is our focus to save the lungs of the planet that produce 6 percent of the oxygen that we breathe and to ensure that we do not trigger a crisis in the amazon once it is set we will never be able to roll back candidates town hall on cnn the facts lands of the amazon are not the lungs of the planet that s a familiar phrase but not an accurate one oxygen production comes primarily from ocean sediments not forests which indeed generate oxygen but also consume it even if all plants in the amazon stopped doing photosynthesis we would not notice jonathan foley executive director of project drawdown a global climate solutions told the ap it would take millions of years for the atmosphere to run out of oxygen the amazon is key in draining heat trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere scientists also see grave consequences to nature and communities from fires in the rainforest but earth is not losing its lungs trump who s got the world s cleanest and safest air and water america tweet wednesday trump i want crystal clean water and the cleanest and the purest air on the planet we ve now got that tweet wednesday the facts false air quality hasn t improved under the trump administration and dozens of nations have less smoggy air than the u s as to water trump is correct that one measure yale university s global environmental performance index found the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled over the past two years the u s had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier federal data show there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 the four years when the u s had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980 the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days the nonprofit health effects institute s state of global air 2019 report ranked the united states 37th dirtiest out of 195 countries for ozone also known as smog the u s ranks eighth cleanest on the more deadly category of fine particles in the air on environmental quality overall the yale index put the u s 27th behind a variety of european countries canada japan australia and more switzerland was no 1 economy and trade trump china has now had the worst year that they ve had in 57 years this is the worst year they ve had in 57 years and they want to make a deal speaking to reporters wednesday in hurricane dorian briefing trump china wants very much to make a deal we ll see they had the worst year in over 50 remarks wednesday at announcement of state opioid response grants the facts not even close it s true that china s economy is decelerating slowed by trump s taxes on chinese imports and by beijing s deliberate campaign to combat runaway debts the international monetary fund expects the chinese economy to grow 6 2 this year though much faster than the u s that s the slowest in a long time for china since 1990 or 29 years in fact but it s a fantasy to suggest the chinese economy is the worst in a half century or more in 1962 57 years ago the country was an impoverished wasteland recovering from the massive famine caused by mao zedong s radical economic policies the economy would also plummet during the chaos of the cultural revolution of the 1960s since adopting economic reforms in the late 1970s china has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty established a growing middle class and vaulted over japan to become the world s second biggest economy trump we haven t taken 10 cents in from china if you look back over the years it s been the other way around they ve taken from us we never take from them now we re taking from them remarks wednesday in briefing on hurricane dorian the facts it s false to say the u s never collected a dime in tariffs on chinese goods before trump took action they are simply higher in some cases than they were before he s also wrong to suggest that americans aren t paying in any way for the tariffs as he escalates a trade war with china trump refuses to recognize a reality that his own chief economic adviser larry kudlow has acknowledged tariffs are mainly if not entirely paid by companies and consumers in the country that imposes them in a study in may the federal reserve bank of new york with princeton and columbia universities estimated that tariffs from trump s trade dispute with china were costing 831 per u s household on an annual basis before tariffs were recently escalated analysts also found that the burden of trump s tariffs falls entirely on u s consumers and businesses that buy imported products a report last month by jpmorgan chase estimated that tariffs would cost the average american household 1 000 per year if tariffs on an additional 300 billion of u s imports from china proceed in september and december trump has since bumped up the scheduled levies even higher probably adding to the u s burden to be sure china is feeling the economic hit too trump germany and so many other countries have negative interest rates they get paid for loaning money and our federal reserve fails to act remember these are also our weak currency competitors tweet tuesday the facts trump once again misrepresents the impact of federal reserve policies and is mistaken about germany s economy suggesting that it enjoys some kind of advantage in fact negative yields are a sign of that economy s weakness the german economy shrank in the previous quarter and there are expectations from investment banks that it could soon fall into a recession nor is the phenomenon isolated to germany japan and much of europe are also struggling with interest rates on government debt that are negative or close to negative investors are betting that stimulus efforts by the european central bank will keep rates persistently low but the negative interest rates on german bonds also reflect that government s aversion to issuing debt even though the borrowing would allow it to spend more on roads and bridges to spur stronger economic growth by having even slightly positive interest rates compared with the rest of the world the united states is in a better position to attract global investment james comey trump based on the ig report the whole witch hunt against me and my administration was a giant and illegal scam the house of representatives should now get back to work on drug prices healthcare infrastructure and all else the mueller report showed no collusion no obstruction tweet tuesday the facts trump is presumably referring to a recent justice department inspector general report that criticized former fbi director james comey s handling of memos about his interactions with the president but the report passed zero judgment on the investigation into whether the trump campaign coordinated with russia a probe comey that led until his may 2017 firing and that trump has repeatedly derided as a witch hunt it did not criticize the fbi for opening the investigation or suggest in any way that it was a giant and illegal scam the president s also wrong about the findings of special counsel robert mueller s report it did not find evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but that s not the same thing as no collusion the report also found instances in which the president sought to obstruct the investigation but said that justice department legal protocol prohibits the indictment of a sitting president associated press writers paul wiseman josh boak and eric tucker contributed to this report find ap fact checks at http apne ws 2kbx8
