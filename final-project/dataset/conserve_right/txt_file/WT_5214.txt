apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap consumers will have more health insurance choices next year under the much debated obama health care law and premiums will dip slightly for many the trump administration announced tuesday president donald trump was elected on a promise to repeal obamacare but despite his repeated efforts the program has stabilized three years into his administration that may be short lived the administration is asking a federal appeals court in new orleans to overturn the entire affordable care act as unconstitutional an overhang of uncertainty clouding its future top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time for now the department of health and human services is touting a second consecutive year of positive sounding numbers an additional 20 insurers will participate for 2020 expanding consumer choice in many states officials said nearly 70 percent of customers will have three or more insurers from which to pick a plan about 10 million people are covered through the health law s insurance markets which offer taxpayer subsidized private plans for people who aren t covered on the job former president barack obama s namesake law will be 10 years old next year premiums for a hypothetical 27 year old choosing a standard plan will decline 4 on average in 2020 for states served by the federal healthcare gov website the trump administration said about a dozen states run their own sign up websites but most rely on healthcare gov a low cost midrange plan for that hypothetical 27 year old will charge monthly premiums of 374 next year officials said the law s income based subsidies can drop that to around 50 however people who don t qualify for income based assistance must pay full price and that s before any deductibles and copays unsubsidized customers may just decide to go uninsured particularly if they re healthy a previous republican congress repealed the law s unpopular penalty to get more people signed up fines
