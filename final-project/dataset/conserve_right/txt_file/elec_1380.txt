national review biden s middle class tax pledge envision a presidential campaign without handshakes rope lines or rallies expose the fraudulent trump russia plot at all levels apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions poor bernie sanders the youth vote failed to show up for him the youth vote always fails to show up it will break your heart every time senator sanders didn t lose to joe biden he lost to tinder weed and the resident the kids were doing themselves a favor young people have more of a future for senator sanders and his coterie of socialist dingbat malefactors to ruin arising from the tumult triumphant was the dotty figure of joe biden biden and sanders vying for the democratic nomination michael bloomberg perhaps at least dreaming idly of a third party run as of today the youngest man with a realistic shot of winning the 2020 presidential election is donald trump 73 years of age what can we say for joe biden for one thing he is not a socialist so he is not a socialist what is he he is a vicious self serving political hack for one thing one whose ambition leads him from time to time into shocking indecency you may have heard that biden lost his wife and daughter in a horrifying drunk driving wreck the fault of a monster of a man who irresponsibly drank his lunch as biden puts it jwplayer

biden s wife and daughter did in fact die in a car wreck that is true it is not true that the driver of the other car was drunk that he had been drinking or that there was any reason to believe he was drunk or had been drinking or even that he was at fault the late mrs biden drove into the path of the tractor trailer the police report says but biden like every other third rate ward heeler of his ilk thinks and speaks only in terms of good guys and bad guys white hats and black hats and if something bad happens to good people then it must be because somebody in a black hat did something nefarious the driver of that truck went to his grave haunted by biden s lies to the point where his children were forced to beg the vice president to stop defaming their late father the casual cruelty with which biden is willing to subordinate the lives of ordinary people to his political ambitions for the sake of a petty tear jerker line in one of his occasionally plagiarized stump speeches is remarkable but that s joe biden just a regular guy from scranton who takes the train to work with a 20 man security detail swarming the platform at every stop and the aisles roped off to separate him from the riffraff as i have seen firsthand whose kids ended up growing vastly wealthy from unpredictable business opportunities to which they had no especial claim beyond their proximity to political power biden was protected by the democratic political machine and then by senate seniority later he was protected by the obama administration and by protectors of the obama administration and so he continues doing the same things he always has done some of you may remember that biden who got into trouble for plagiarism back in the 1980s when i was in eighth grade and who already was running for president way back then was pillaging margaret thatcher s speeches and neil kinnock s too not that anybody remembers him to flesh out one of his own orations that was embarrassing what is embarrassing is that he is still doing it as the washington post reports with his campaign stealing material for advocacy groups and presenting it as the work of his campaign that is a pattern a man who can lightly misrepresent the circumstances surrounding the death of his wife and infant daughter is liable to be just as cavalier when it comes to say slavery telling a largely black audience that mitt romney mitt romney wants to put y all back in chains oh that y all cynical doesn t begin to cover it one of the worst features of our political life is the ugly and dishonest fights we have over supreme court nominations a habit that can be laid squarely at the feet of joe biden who along with ted kennedy that pillar of human decency organized one of the worst smear campaigns in modern american political history against robert bork whose great crime against humanity was taking the extremist position that the constitution actually says what it says rather than what anybody with power wishes it would say at any given moment and that the way to amend the constitution is to amend the constitution rather than having nine wizards in black robes pull previously undiscovered constitutional mandates out of the penumbras upon which they sit all day don t like the way merrick garland was treated mitch mcconnell didn t start that game he is just better at it than his contemporary democratic colleagues are for lying partisan viciousness in the modern mode joe biden is your man he is a liar a corruptor of institutions and a grifter of the first order but he s not a socialist i ll give him that get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
