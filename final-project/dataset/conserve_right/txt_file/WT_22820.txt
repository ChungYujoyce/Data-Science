apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic democrats condemned monday as racist president trump s broadside at rodent infested baltimore but the blast also came as a reminder that most troubled major u s cities have been dominated for decades by one party and it isn t the gop cities like baltimore chicago detroit portland san francisco and st louis plagued by a host of social and economic ills have been run nearly continuously by democratic mayors and councils as far as republicans are concerned that s no coincidence the last republican mayor of baltimore city left office the year i was born and i m a wife mother and a grandmother said shannon wright a member of the baltimore city republican central committee and mayoral candidate see also trump says black voters in baltimore calling white house to thank him the year was 1967 there have been no republican policies policymakers in a long time so if you re going to assign blame to a party it would have to be the democratic party she said spurred by the 2015 riots baltimore has lost population while struggling with violent crime mismanagement and corruption two of the last three mayors resigned over scandals a wallethub survey released last week ranked baltimore the nation s least family friendly city in other words baltimore s problems are no secret but democrats and media outlets were outraged by mr trump s unrestrained tweet describing the baltimore based district of rep elijah e cummings as a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess the national action network s al sharpton said monday that mr trump had a particular venom for blacks and people of color the baltimore sun ran an editorial headlined better to have a few rats than be one while the new york times ran a column the rot you smell is a racist potus none of that deterred the president who continued to pound the issue in a series of tweets accusing mr cummings of ignoring conditions in his district baltimore under the leadership of elijah cummings has the worst crime statistics in the nation 25 years of all talk no action so tired of listening to the same old bull mr trump tweeted next reverend al will show up to complain protest nothing will get done for the people in need sad baltimore is far from his only municipal target mr trump previously blasted rising homelessness in los angeles new york and san francisco as well as the crime infested atlanta district of democratic rep john lewis and the terrible blight of crime in chicago the issue of urban decay has served a political purpose allowed the white house to draw a contrast between house democrats on the russia collusion issue versus problems in their own problematic inner city districts i think it s right for the president to raise the issue white house chief of staff mick mulvaney said on fox news sunday look i was in congress for six years if i had poverty in my district like they have in baltimore if i had crime in my district like they have in chicago if i had homelessness in my district like they have in san francisco and i spent all of my time in washington d c chasing down this mueller investigation and this bizarre impeachment crusade i would get fired mr cummings said that he was elected to do both each morning i wake up and i go and fight for my neighbors he tweeted it is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the executive branch but it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents democrats keep winning as cities decline the last time chicago voted in a republican mayor was 1927 but after years of population decline driven by the high cost of living and violent crime chicago voters took to the polls in april and elected another democrat lori lightfoot why chris cleveland chairman of the chicago republican party said republicans have virtually no chance in the windy city a phenomenon he attributed to the powerful democratic political machine fed by public workers unions and patronage the employees unions negotiate for higher salaries with the same people who receive their campaign contributions it s what keeps them in power said mr cleveland you d see people in this city switching allegiances very very quickly if that were not in place even though they stay in power democrats have been unable to stop the flight of the middle class including the black middle class because they fail to understand that the greatest social services program is a job he said they do not understand that a job brings amazing benefits not only to the individual but to that individual s family and that neighborhoods without jobs fail mr cleveland said they also fail to understand that jobs do not come from the jobs fairy jobs come from businesses you cannot be in favor of jobs when you re hostile to business and

for decades the last republican mayor elected was in 1943 there are good things happening in this city but they re the result of private interests working with barely an assist from the city government said mr hodes chairman of the st louis city republican party committee why don t voters elect republicans it s a vicious cycle you ll never win so you don t run he said adding that part of the problem is we ve given up on these urban areas even democrats have bemoaned the condition of democrat run cities sen bernard sanders of vermont who s seeking the 2020 democratic presidential
