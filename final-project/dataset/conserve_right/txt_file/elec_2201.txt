william weld mass succeeded in seeming human humane decent calm and at least compared to their major party competitors thoughtful this evening at their second cnn town hall but i m not sure they succeeded in seeming very libertarian or selling the party s position as a distinct outlook on politics and government that someone could grasp and understand they often seemed to go out of their way to just seem like a centrist independent mixture of what someone might see as good aspects of both other parties in fact when host anderson cooper would occasionally remind the candidates what the traditional libertarian stance was often relying on the party platform he might have done more to sell libertarianism s unique stances than the candidates herewith a not necessarily comprehensive list of places where a libertarian might have been frustrated with the candidates tonight with a few again not comprehensive nods to when they got it closer to right the emphasis though will be on the disappointments which dominated in my eyes weld made this worse by alluding to that awful bugaboo of every useless centrist third party movement in my lifetime the supposed tragedy of ferocious partisanship getting in the way of effective policy being made it was decent of weld to stress that the actual domestic threat of terror could and should be dealt with as a law enforcement matter even if he was perhaps too gleeful in calling for how much more spending would be necessary to do so but it would be worth it but he was far too casually supportive of the idea that drones would be necessary for those isis training platforms in south yemen it didn t sound like weld s notion of what to do in the middle east differed in any significant respect from the obama status quo the two governors mostly seemed thoughtful humble decent not aggravating control freaks or rampaging ids they did not seem like bold representatives of a distinct philosophy and practice of government one with a well developed philosophy about what government is for and why advertisement next johnson weld come out of cnn town hall looking like a sensible alternative to the two main options brian

article late at night my last pay check was 9500 working 12 hours a week online my sisters friend has been averaging 15k for months now and she works about 20 hours a week i can t believe how easy it was once i tried it out this is what i do http www trends88 com my last pay check was 9500 working 12 hours a week online my sisters friend has been averaging 15k for months now and she works about 20 hours a week i can t believe how easy it was once i tried it out this is what i do http www trends88 com i m making over 16k a month working part time i kept hearing other people tell me how much money they can make online so i decided to look into it well it was all true and has totally changed my life this is what i do copy this link inyour browser http www trends88 com i m making over 16k a month working part time i kept hearing other people tell me how much money they can make online so i decided to look into it well it was all true and has totally changed my life this is what i do copy this link inyour browser http www trends88 com actually this was the most accurate and detailed summary of the townhall anyone anywhere will ever do on the subject and echoes all of the complaints made by people who listened to every question in the prior thread i have no idea why you would say that and challenge you to explain why how you think it falls short i watched the whole interview near as i recall johnson outlined that prostitution was safer in nevada because it is legal there and unless my feed just jumped at that moment and i didn t notice it weld s response was in reference to corruption not prostitution he was addressing the idea of victimless crimes not prostitution weld said enough stupid big government shit without all of this inventing things and misrepresenting things over and over people are furiously spinning the answers to say shit that wasn t being said many of you people are purposely interpreting the entire campaign in the least libertarian way possible just so you can jerk off to your libertarian bona fides by playing the he s not a libertarian game these comment threads always devolve into whining and crying and bitching and moaning about how unfair reason is being towards donald trump and the same people come on here and fucking invent their own interpretations of what gary johnson has to say over and over and over and over his answer about the cake thing was as clear as it could possibly be he stated that according to the law if you sell cakes you have to sell them but that you don t have to take the step of decorating them or putting any message with them and that s a fact that is in fact how the world works if you want to die on the hill of putting black people back at separate lunch counters that s the only way to face that issue down i m all about freedom of association but it s time we get real here if you can t tell a black person to go fuck themselves because they re black you re not going to be able to tell a gay person to go fuck themselves because they re gay that s the reality that s what he said from day one and the lies and misrepresentation continue libertarian hate the libertarian candidate because libertarians won t stop justifying their preconceived notions long enough to actually listen to what he has to say you should all quit pretending to hate liberals so much you behave and argue exactly like them this board has turned into a couple dozen tony s question begging and selectively interpreting their way through the election any law that says you have to sell a cake to or make a hire of anyone you don t want to is not libertarian and is despotic yes you have the right to to not enter into any association or economic transaction you don t care to do again i m all about freedom of association but recognize the world you live in if you re going to make that argument you re going to have to make the argument that black people can be denied service for their skin color that s suicide politically largely because of the actions of 400 years of government no johnson just kind of sort of hemmed and hawed about prostitution in nevada he didn t bother to explain why banging a prostitute in nevada is safer than banging some craigslist hooker or explain why nevada hookers are less exploited than hookers in the other 49 states make it legal have the hookers go in for std tests every six weeks give them yelp reviews i got the clap from sindy 0 5 stars would not visit again he could have just said hey it doesn t make sense to make illegal what it s ok to do for free or he could have just pointed out that that he s running for president and the feds don t usually handle hooking charges those are all arguments he could have made and he made none of them whenever johnson s asked about any sort of controversial libertarian position he just stalls for time rather than admitting that he has any actual position about the controversial issue gov johnson did say that prostitution is a state level thing so you re making tulpain t s point agreed siv and winston agree he just wanted to be a decent middle of the road defender of an absolutely amazing and never been better status quo yep mealy mouthed reformers who are either total liars hiding a more radical agenda which their opponents will not exploit and will not upset voters or promise just more of the same weld made this worse by eluding to that awful bugaboo of every useless centrist third party movement in my lifetime of the supposed tragedy of ferocious partisanship getting in the way of effective policy being made i thought useless centrist third party was the goal of the lp in this campaign i thought viable alternative to the crazy trump or the crooked clinton was the goal of this campaign many missed opportunities i don t know if it s because they are not practicing or because they are intentionally trying to stay middle of the road to avoid controversy to get into the debates but either way whoever is running their campaign strategy should be fired i hear this theory from lp shills all over they don t really believe what they re saying they re just trying to get in the debates do they drop the act and start acting like libertarians as soon as they get in the first debate if libertarianism is so toxic that to speak it means political death wouldn t they just get kicked out after the first debate then if it s safe to act libertarian then why would it not be now or are they going to continue to peddle this center left bilge all through the debates in which case why did the lp even bother nominating a candidate at all they couldn t even claim they were educating the public on libertarianism rather than go after a very vulnerable segment of republicans who hate trump they are going after the democrat vote which is much less likely to go against hillary maybe johnson weld do these things because they actually believe these things and i m cheered by their transparency as i decline to vote for them the lp picked the wrong candidate yes i imagine cnn would have hosted a town hall for petersen perry or mcafee get real johnson didn t rise to the occasion he went soft when a hard thrust was necessary plenty of pot but no viagra makes gary a soft boy let s start with the fact that no individual vote is going to decide any election now we can go further and point out that since i live in ca my presidential vote has an absolute zero effect on the state electors nor am i alone we can also presume the chance of a johnson weld ticket winning is close to that of a diamond pipe opening under obo as he sits on the can tomorrow albeit with differential preferences on my part no i didn t watch it i read about it second hand from the commenters seems they didn t scream taxation is theft nor end social security nor repeal o care all of which we here i think would prefer but then go back to the first paragraph j w might be plowing the field to grow term libertarian for those who find it toxic you don t find them pure enough ok neither do i but were they purer yet they prolly wouldn t get even this air time my vote will likely be for that ticket enough protest votes and the msm might take notice my i have no illusion that mine will push em over the top why not move to where your vote will matter perhaps your life will be more pleasant as well where might that be i see no place where that is true and where i would like to live i live in california too so why not vote trump if it is a protest vote you re after the two governors mostly seemed thoughtful humble decent not aggravating control freaks or rampaging ids they did not seem like bold representatives of a distinct philosophy and practice of government one with a well developed philosophy about what government is for and why hell i ll settle for that except you won t get it because they have 0 chance of winning yeah would hate to seem like an aggravated control freak by saying people should be free to do what they want the village idiot is a better choice than lucifer or satan it may not be the most exciting vote to cast but it will let me sleep at night knowing that i didn t help grant legitimacy to either of the frightfully awful anti freedom in almost every instance candidates i understand voting for a candidate who can block the greater evil i can understand voting for the candidate you agree with i cannot understand voting for a candidate who you don t agree with and who can t block the greater evil this aftertouch is by and large what i think of the whole thing i guess an argument could be fashioned that if a third party or candidate no matter what it was or what it stood for received enough votes at the same time as our political duopoly was selfimmolating it could help to fatally damage one or both of them but it seems a bit like clutching at straws for a reason to bother to vote for j w you re assuming johnson can t win even though he represents the largest slice of the electorate the only thing holding him back is habit exactly most of us want to have good income but don t know how to do thaat on internet there are a lot of methods to earn money at home so i thought to share with you a genuine and guaranteed method for free to earn huge sum of money at home anyone of you interested should visit the site more than sure that you will get best result oi3 http www cashpost7 com while optimism about the wonders of an even hobbled and restricted market and technology and cheering the huge moral progress in acceptance of more types of people in the polity is a constitutive part of a huge strain of modern libertarianism johnson saying that life has never been better without any specifics about how things might need to improve while alluding to only one surviving problem discrimination elided any chance to explain a core part of the libertarian message that government does more than it ought to morally or practically and that that needs to change whew that may be the longest sentence i ve read in the last ten years i have now watched the interview twice compared to the first outing this was night and day he came off humble bright and actually coherent this time unlike previous libertarian forays into the presidential field of battle we have a perfect storm for the first time in history the two major party candidates are completely detested we need to be the sane voice in the fray talking about making sweeping changes to the federal government is a great way to have people dismiss the cause yet again tell the truth but don t shove it down their throats this country is sick and tired and it s not going to be easy to heal what has been done to it right now people are scared and the last thing you want to do is hit them with the same thing trump did hillary and trump feed off fear we need to encourage and let people know they are more like us by not shouting out the differences they will come to know us better if we talk to them from an angle they can understand 1 orders of magnitude better this time than round 1 still work to do in getting the message across but the trend is encouraging listen nobody is going to question brian doherty s passion or ideological purity given that he s spent his entire adult life working in pursuit of cato and libertarian ideals good for you it s a noble cause the platform is solid and has great end states fully developed in the meantime we have two governors with solid track records and a centrist pragmatic approach who are actively trying to sell a generally mainstream liberaltarian ticket to the american people many of whom have little to no understanding of what libertarianism is we re never going to have the first libertarian president show up with the doherty pure platform such a creature couldn t hold a senate or governor seat and certainly couldn t pass the american electorate in the next 3 5 cycles what we could have however would be a ticket of decent human beings with some executive experience who are willing to be flexible and adjust the message to be an iterative improvement of the status quo that will set the groundwork for more libertarian ideas in further iterations of the executive and hopefully legislative and judicial branches with all its truth and honesty and purity this article is at the end of the day as much a pissing in the wind as my own dumb layperson s opinion on anything keep up the good fight and sorry we won t see the revolution you dream of in our lifetime a 20 year veteran of lp voting loud opinions and trying to help people understand what the lp stands for they can t win can t stop a worse candidate from being elected and they re not advocating libertarianism why should a libertarian bother voting for them this is my problem too i really yearn to vote libertarian this year but alas i cannot bring myself to color in a circle with weld especially next to it given that he has never met a gun control policy he didn t love johnson s problems with religious liberty forcing people into contracts with which they disagree are also very irritating to me even though i m agnostic at best so that leaves me wondering if i want to vote for the worst libertarian ticket ever in order to publicly show my disgust with the worst democratic and worst republican tickets in modern times but my general allegiance to libertarian and constitutional ideals i m really scared that if johnson weld get an unprecedented percent of the vote that the oversimplification of fiscally republican socially democrat will become the new standard platform and if you start trying to defend libertarianism then your opponents will be able to reply with a quote from your own candidates and show that you re extreme even for an libertarian voting for clinton does not help the cause voting for trump does not help the cause not voting does not help the cause one cannot get from point a to point z without first getting to point b making it just that far is progress that should be seized at every opportunity 4 months of a perfect storm provides only so much time to enlighten the 2 party beholden seize the moment as the sensible alternatives to clintrump and have 4 years of johnson at the helm to further the cause in a meaningful way 4 years of clintrump furthers the cause in a rock throwing at the burning embers way but only if you prefer rock throwing to actually trying to fix anything rock throwing is fun maybe it s just me but i find a delicious irony in the notion that libertarians detest all loyalty oaths except their own weld outright saying that in his prosecutorial experience and i don t really know what he meant exactly that it s far from victimless and that the public s the loser and we can t see the crime being committed when it happens weld was making an analogy to public corruption cases that he prosecuted he said that those corruption cases were also called victimless crimes but they were far from victimless because the public was the loser and we can t see the crime being committed when it happens thanks for the article doherty s continual praising of libertarians with faint damns is distressing to many that he is thought of as a purist is surprising to many as well johnson and weld are doing what the lp was created for by principals the lio http www libertarian international org help promote libertarian direction more federal local centrist policies calm and discussion on the theme of less government more freedom and give a means where people can express concerns and discover libertarian dialogue cato was created for libertarian oriented democracy issues a trump clinton administration with a 7 libertarian vote will be very very different from one without such a vote fans of the non partisan libertarian international work for their own gary johnson teams in every country and have created a group for libertarian direction parties worldwide at http www ialp com as people get familiar and more conversant with libertarian eco tools and themes in due course we will see strict lio libertarian and increasingly strict libertarian direction and at least one liberal libertarian oriented troika of teams parties in every country our current main dialogue is this a libertarian interested 7 national vote everywhere in a world of peaceful sister floridas of no income tax localism and increasingly legal libertarian eco homes communities will not be a bad thing re https reason com blog 2016 08 am weld to i ve never looked at voting libertarian before but knew i couldn t vote hillary so trump was my only other option but he s just pissing off too many people that he ll need to be able to work with he said he could act presidential when the time came i think that time started at the convention i now don t think he s capable of acting presidential so what s my other option johnson weld i don t really care if they are pure libertarians i looked up johnson here http www ontheissues org gary johnson htm the things he supported while governor are a good match for me regardless of how pure a libertarian he is and while they may not be the most polished speakers they at least seem somewhat sane reasonable and like people who will do the least amount of harm and maybe even be able to get some good changes made there s nobody else running that i can say that about so in that respect they pulled me in the libertarian direction even if they are not pure libertarians i don t even know what a pure libertarian is but what i take away from the way j w want to do things reduce fed govt move some things back to the state which are better left there for the local needs min wage edu etc and let people make their own personal decisions on things that don t harm or affect others in bad ways i want the govt less a part of my life and this election cycle is a good example of why hopefully j w can help move things in that direction excellent post gthomson gary johnson s position reminds me of libs who call isis a right wing organization because they re religious ain t down with gays and oppress women he s focusing entirely on superficial overlap between libertarian and socialist populist causes and ignoring the ideology s core values gay marriages and non interventionism in a vague sense is already in with the national mood a socialist who cries out against wars would empower the government intervene elsewhere venezuela isn t fighting in the middle east ron paul was uncompromising to a fault but his dedication to limiting the size of government was unmistakable he wanted to shut down departments of a lot of things close military bases and reduce federal workforce by 10 he voted against foreign aid expanding hate crime laws and affirmative action he made a lot of enemies on the left and the right gary johnson is like the exact opposite i see a centrist republican who tries to have it both ways you re down with ssm but you apparently still think prostitution is icky even though they re both acts between consenting adults ok that s understandable for moderate but not libertarian ron paul wanted to end medicare at one point gary johnson will probably insist that we can make it work with the free market reprieved i think they are trying hard to be a trojan horse let s get in and then we can abolish a bunch of bs and while the pundits and media start freaking out in 4 years we ll be re elected in a landslide because some of these issues like blm instantly get better when less government is involved pre election every time you hear libertarians believe it is a pejorative they are not wanting to hear our philosophy they are handing him rope to see if he hangs himself to that extent this town hall was great no heroin overdose question and while i would have liked a better answer to the prostitution question the fact that they went a little into political correctness was smart they still gave it a wink with nevada s laws agreement with lp platform and suggesting that the victims were the ones afoul of the law not the partakers of the act for every one of us shaking a fist at the screen yelling come on there were probably 1 000 watchers forming their first thoughts on it i read in a book once and thus it must be so that americans vote based on candidate attributes personality image authenticity vibe not issues americans would rather have a candidate with genuine common sense as their leader than almost any other attribute i think it was something like a 75 25 split between the candidate s persona and the candidate s stance on issues for every libertarian screaming at our screens there were 1 000 voters who saw two adults compared to the other children it was a conversation without screaming without condescension without pretense i didn t agree with many of their answers but those answers were still as good or better than any other answers we could get in 2016 i am starting to think of johnson weld as popping the cork on libertarian champagne once the country has a taste they aren t going back to the swill that the other two teams are slinging down the bar if it makes a generation liberty curious then i might not even have to move to singapore i sympathize with the approach that they are taking i know it s easier said than done this is why i miss harry browne would someone delete this article this is not three fighting kids on a playground we re fighting the biggest most powerful most wealthy people in the world we can t have people writing this crap just hurting ourselves so disappointing say what you will about the purity of the platform but at the end of the day we re a bunch of mostly old white men splitting hairs on the platform for the last 20 30 45 years yes our statist self service too large government sucks yes our personal freedoms have been diluted but not a one of you has addressed the crux of the political issue how do we get there from here and my point stands it may not be johnson weld but from a credentialism and polish standpoint they re our best hope yet to get to a plurality you must first have a recognizable majority recognizable minority rather sorry no coffee how do we get there from here i have to go with not look or sound like assholes as step one johnson weld pushes in that direction but the movement if there is such a thing needs an influx of rank and file non assholes as a counterweight to the mostly old white men who have been spanking their monkeys to rand and the austrian school for decades if johnson weld can t blow through 15 percent with two of the most odious candidates for political office in recent memory hey it just ain t happenin the millenials are coming team red millenials are very libertarian and have always been we played in the red sandbox as it was the only option to legitimacy but the sand is now orange johnson is beating trump in this demographic and these aren t former team blue kids they are going for jill trump being nominated is the best chance to move this party forward the sjws are also pissing off a lot of young white males to this direction too so there will be some younger ones arriving shortly every late 20s republican friend i have has moved here at least for now a disappointment in libertarian terms the town hall discussion had zero impact on the political landscape or the national races currently underway reasonable discourse quickly devolved into ideological hairsplitting pedantry and general boorishness isn t that the gold standard for the lp the one thing that bugged me was the black lives matter comments i think there is a middle ground that doesnt piss off either side instead he took one side with a vague response that pissed off a lot of potential no trump republicans if i could bitchslap the author right now i would i m pretty sure everyone here wouldn t need to ask me why or decide it was a bad idea i m not even going to mention why i would do this as it is more effective to leave it in silence while they contemplate what they are doing here i don t think we can shift this country immediately over to libertarianism unless by small degrees at a time they are far more libertarianish than any other office holders in history so that is movement in the right direction even if they are far from a core libertarian as a lifelong libertarian a regular reason reader and a proud supporter of the johnson weld campaign i immediately rolled my eyes at this article it appears mr doherty is acting as another purist who would kick out the baby with the bathwater just because the candidates didn t say everything he wanted to hear exactly how he wanted to hear it this over just about any other reason no pun intended is why libertarians have struggled to become a successful party the rejection of our own by our own simply because they aren t 100 dogmatic in their approach or beliefs you can t build a party much less a revolution that way so what if the candidates didn t speak to the purists of the party they spoke to the general audience by which their message was going to be heard cnn isn t reasontv or some fringe youtube channel give these guys a break and perhaps approach the article with something like here are my pointers on how they could have done even better there is nothing libertarian about william weld not a goddamned thing bill weld or how not to choose a running mate there is no path forward at the federal level without first converting millions of citizens to libertarian philosophy and i would rather spend my little time on earth doing something more rewarding as such all we can do is take a page from john galt and stop enabling them it s very simple trump seems to be an idiot in public people say he acts normal in person he had my vote but not sure anymore hillary is so crooked even the democratic party agrees she is but will still vote for her even knowing she lies i watched the town hall last night most of it i did not agree with some of what was said but that being said they acted like adults so i am giving them a closer look i have always felt like its a wasted vote but i think the two other party s have left this universe and are out in la la land so it might be time i have yet to find a political party or it s representative that meshes perfectly with my positions the same can be said of friends and girlfriends for that matter the goal for me has been to maximize the compatibilities while attempting keeping an open mind about resolving the differences after over 30 years of voting i find johnson weld to be the closest fit to date they are certainly more congruent to libertarian sensibilities than any viable presidential ticket in my memory to label their performance as a disappointment because it failed to meet criteria for the ideal libertarian position is in my view overly harsh and detracts from the momentum the candidates are building i d be sleeping on the couch most nights if i described my less than ideal aka real life spouse as a disappointment and deservedly so i ll come back to the party when it comes back to its senses even after the barr fiasco they never learn calling clinton a wonderful public servant i wish johnson would have just passed out from the weed before anyone heard him speak i won t be surprised at all if they decide to add him to the debates regardless of whether he makes it to 15 just to prop up hillary while simultaneously torpedoing the lp for decades to come weld said weld commented weld clarified i have a feeling i m glad i didn t watch if the guy that supported gun control and eminent domain was doing most of the talking on actual policy i ll give 10 to any average lay person who can tell me a single thing pence has said on behalf of the trump campaign or that kaine has said on behalf of hillary maybe if johnson would grow a pair we could actually have a viable alternative candidate they might get fewer votes than if they had just run as libertarians at least then libertarians and small government conservatives could register a protest vote backing this card wouldn t be a protest vote that would take ideological consistency and a message libertarians actually believe in i get paid over 80 per hour working from home with 2 kids at house i never thought i would be able to do it but my best friend earns over 9185 a month doing this and she convinced me to try the potential with this is endless heres what i ve been doing http www careerplus90 com christ even in an election with trump and clinton we can t get a decent coherent nominee out there good article i think brian nailed the missed opportunities and misstatements of libertarian goals and policies i m not going to condemn a strategy of libertarian lite when it s clearly geared toward getting a foothold on the ladder rather than moving a few listeners a few inches closer to acceptance but on the other hand i m not motivated to pay for it unless i first see results so if this is your tack get in the debates then i ll get out my checkbook otherwise i ll just keep explaining to the curious that these guys aren t the real deal they often seemed to go out of their way to just seem like a centrist independent mixture of what someone might see as good aspects of both other parties almost as if they are running to win against 2 extreme and unlikable candidates i m not sure they succeeded in seeming very libertarian or selling the party s position as a distinct outlook on politics and government that someone could grasp and understand browne and badnarik did that pretty well and got 0 4 of the vote well they seemed disappointing for a very simple reason they are not libertarian having said that i am a libertarian and i will vote for johnson and weld because there is no choice on one hand you have a man running on the republican ticket that has a screw loose and on the other hand a woman running on the democrat ticket that has a major trust issue which one do you want to have their finger on the nuke button i ve been a libertarian since 92 and ever since then i have been tell people please stop voting for the lesser of the two evils because no matter which one wins you still wind up with evil but this time i am asking people to please vote for the lesser of the three evils just hold your nose and vote for johnson and weld and don t refer to them as libertarian they are far from perfect but far better than what we have now and better than the other two that are on the ticket the main contest was between hilary clinton and donald trump this party was standing nowwhere as now results has been announced that donald will be the new american president so now the picture is clear for us by the it was a good conversation good to see this post i am very happy to know about this
