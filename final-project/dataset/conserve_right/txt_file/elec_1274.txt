going to be creating jobs getting the economy back on track the governor s record the former massachusetts governor generally doesn t talk about a pro life agenda at his campaign rallies mr romney s position on abortion has evolved over his political career starting in 1994 with his failed u s senate bid against democrat edward m kennedy in massachusetts at the time mr romney said he personally opposed abortion but that his commitment to keeping abortions legal stemmed from having a relative who died from an illegal abortion i believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country mr romney said at the time i believe that since roe v wade has been the law for 20 years that we should sustain and support it he touted a similar message during his 2002 gubernatorial bid vowing to preserve and protect a woman s right to choose and saying that he is devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard however his stance changed in 2005 after he announced in a boston globe editorial that he is pro life and said that he supports a reversal of roe v wade the shift haunted mr romney in this year s gop primary where he was on the receiving end of attacks from former sen
