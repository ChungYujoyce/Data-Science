apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap secretary of state mike pompeo said saturday the state department intends to follow the law in the house impeachment investigation and vigorously defended president donald trump dismissing questions about the president s attempts to push ukraine and china to investigate a democratic political rival the trump administration and house democrats often disagree about what the law requires leaving open the question of how pompeo may interpret democrats demands for key information about trump s handling of ukraine pompeo speaking in greece said the state department sent a letter to congress friday night as its initial response to the document request and added we ll obviously do all the things that we re required to do by law he has allowed democrats to interview a series of witnesses next week among them is gordon sondland the u s ambassador to the european union another key figure in the probe top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender the administration has struggled to come up with a unified response to the quickly progressing investigation democrats have warned that defying their demands will in itself be considered evidence of obstruction and a potentially impeachable offense pompeo has become a key figure in the democrats investigation he was on the line during the july phone call in which trump pressed ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy to investigate former vice president joe biden and his son hunter sparking a whistleblower complaint and now the impeachment inquiry pompeo had initially tried to delay a handful of current and former officials from cooperating with the inquiry and accused democrats trying to bully his staffers on saturday pompeo did not back off his defense of trump s call with ukraine there has been some suggestion somehow that it would be inappropriate for the united states government to engage in that activity and i see it just precisely the opposite he said trump has offered a series of contradictory statements when it comes to the democrats subpoena of white house records asked wednesday whether the white house intended to comply trump told reporters i always cooperate even as he dismissed the inquiry as a hoax a day later however trump had a different answer for the same question saying he would instead leave the matter to his lawyers that s up to them to decide he said but the whole investigation is crumbling by friday however trump confirmed reports the white house was preparing a letter to house speaker nancy pelosi d calif arguing that congress cannot undertake an impeachment investigation without first having a vote to authorize it pelosi has insisted the house is well within its rules to conduct oversight of the executive branch under the constitution regardless it was unclear saturday when or if that letter would be sent pompeo meanwhile made clear that the state department had yet to turn over any document but intended to follow a proper review and he said he would do so faster than the obama administration i remember precisely once when i was on that side and we were looking for documents i remember precisely how long it took for those documents to come across he said in an apparent reference to his experience as a congressman during the investigation into the 2012 attack on the u s mission in benghazi libya we re going to beat that we re going to be more responsive than the obama administration was in the years that preceded this particular congress he said a congressional aide familiar with pompeo s response confirmed that the state department had indeed been in contact even if pompeo had failed to meet a friday deadline to produce documents required by the subpoena trump meanwhile continued to seethe saturday denouncing the investigation as yet another witch hunt and a fraud against the american people in a series of tweets saturday including several sent as his presidential motorcade ferried him back and forth to his virginia golf course trump defended his conduct and lashed out at critics including a past foil sen mitt romney r utah i m hearing that the great people of utah are considering their vote for their pompous senator mitt romney to be a big mistake i agree he is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the do nothing democrats trump wrote he ended his tweet with an extraordinary call to impeach a senator from his own party yet romney was joined saturday in his criticism by a second republican senator susan collins of maine who said it s not ok for a president to encourage a foreign state to investigate a political rival speaking after a firefighter memorial service in maine collins said trump made a big mistake when he piled on his outreach to ukraine by publicly calling on china to investigate the bidens sen ben sasse of nebraska is the only other republican senator to publicly criticize the president s comments that further fueled an impeachment inquiry lawmakers are focused on trump s efforts to push ukraine to investigate the bidens a whistleblower complaint said that trump sought to use military assistance for ukraine as leverage to push the newly elected zelenskiy to launch an inquiry into the 2020 democratic hopeful late thursday house investigators released a cache of text messages that showed top u s diplomats encouraging zelenskiy to conduct an investigation linked to biden s family in return for granting a high profile visit with trump in washington the release followed a 10 hour interview with one of the diplomats kurt volker who stepped down as special envoy to ukraine after the impeachment inquiry had begun lee reported from athens greece associat
