apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic new york ap donald trump a florida man not so fast despite a stinging good riddance tweet from new york s governor the president s home state may not let him go to florida without a fight trump s plan to shift his permanent residence to palm beach will likely be heavily scrutinized by new york state officials who are notorious for auditing wealthy residents seeking to flee to lower tax states to make sure such moves are real and not just on paper those cases can go on for years top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to

new york says just because you fill out a piece of paper that doesn t make you a floridian said mark klein a tax lawyer who has handled hundreds of tax residency audits people have this misunderstanding that if you go to florida and fill out an affidavit you register to vote and you get a driver s license that is all it takes even though it appears trump has a strong case he s only spent a few nights at his trump tower penthouse overlooking fifth avenue since he became president tax experts say it s not a matter of if he will be audited but when it s 100 percent he ll get audited predicted barry horowitz a tax accountant who has handled many change of residency cases there ll be a fight the general rule for avoiding new york taxes is to spend less than 184 days of the

despite paying millions of dollars in city state and local taxes each year he complained he had been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state new york gov andrew cuomo

condolences to the good people of florida trump responded later friday with a four part tweet that blasted both cuomo the brother of fredo and de blasio saying i love new york but new york can never be great again under the current leadership in new york trump is paying a top marginal tax rate to the city and state that adds up to 12 7 percent and because of trump s own tax overhaul two years ago

the hostile reception he s gotten there upset with its democratic leaders and the protests trump has privately raged against the city according to three republicans close to the white house not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations new york city s elite never full accepted the brash tabloid friendly queens born businessman and it got worse after he embraced right wing politics particularly on immigration the deeply diverse and democratic city turned on him and he only received 10 percent of the vote in manhattan when the president elect ran his presidential
