apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion as a young combat correspondent during the boar war in south africa winston churchill observed in the aftermath of one battle nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result iran s terror mullahs now know that when that battle involves state directed not simply state sponsored terrorists like iranian gen qassem soleimani against u s forces fighting terror plots there will be a result soleimani s elimination by a u s reaper drone this month met with approval from president donald trump supporters and overwrought complaining by his persistent critics in iran regime orchestrated outrage by obeisant protesters was ordered up unfortunately for iran s supreme leader ali khamenei regime directed protests have been replaced with genuine ones led by people disgusted with economic hardship official lies about the regime s accidental shootdown of a ukrainian civilian airliner and totalitarian repression many are calling for khamenei and iranian president hassan rouhani to resign in the wake of this what are the results that should grab our attention and iran s top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens first the trump doctrine on full display at the president s news conference after the soleimani attack is working in iran that doctrine which i term relentless engagement seeks to isolate engage compel and resolve major foreign policy threats to world peace through an unambiguous articulation of u s objectives consider iran the president has been quite clear about his objectives iran must end its missile and nuclear proliferation military aggression and acts of terror consistent with his doctrine the president has successfully isolated iran s leaders internationally and has brought them to their knees with punitive economic sanctions designed to compel a non military resolution furthermore mr trump has demonstrated his willingness to employ the full range of u s national power including strategic and tactical force projection as witnessed in his reinforcement of troops to the gulf region and a precision strike against the terrorist soleimani yet the trump doctrine also preserves an avenue to peaceful resolution through unconditional negotiations while making clear the u s dispute isn t with the iranian people but with its repressive leaders consider his adroit message of jan 11 when he reminded iranian protesters in their native farsi language that america stands with them i ve stood with you since the beginning of my presidency and my administration will continue to stand with you we are following your protests closely and are inspired by your courage the president s application of this doctrine and strategy refutes the petulant and vacuous rhetoric of his critics that he has no strategy in iran in fact the result is his strategy is working second it should be clear by now that the iranian regime is crumbling it started with the green revolution of 2009 in response to election abuses a profound opportunity horribly mismanaged by president obama the gasoline protests in the fall of 2019 when many iranians were slaughtered in the streets by the police and revolutionary guards is irrefutable evidence of the regime s persistent brutality over time most recently iran s disgraceful shoot down of a ukraine commercial airliner by feckless revolutionary guards and the overt lies from their leaders denying responsibility enraged conscientious iranians even provoking a popular iranian olympic tae kwon do medalist to defect in disgust now iranians are openly calling for the resignation of the supreme leader and the president resulting in more repression third it should also be clear that even if war erupts iran s fate would be quickly sealed the iranian conventional military is insufficiently capable and ill equipped it depends on asymmetrical terror warfare executed by mercenary militia forces across the middle east to advance their hegemony moreover these surrogates are being badly squeezed by u s sanctions the result neither iran nor its surrogates can win a conventional war finally it s important to understand that some red lines are redder than others that has implications for how the united states chooses to respond to iran s nuclear ambitions or further attacks originating from within its territory or from extraterritorial mercenaries mr trump has laid down two prominent markers first iran will not be permitted to have a nuclear weapon second if iran kills an american through military action that will result in military retaliation however an attack from a militia force or a suicide bomber acting alone and uncoordinated might require a limited response focused on specific perpetrators the president understands the need for nuance and restraint here nonetheless the result unlike the water colored redlines of the obama administration is mr trump s demarcations are a bit more indelible iran is very fortunate that its jan 8 2020 retaliatory missile attack from its territory on military bases in iraq resulted in no american deaths the u s response would have been a cataclysmic result for iran in that regard iran should understand that provoking the u s to violence will not result in exhilarating near misses but devastating target hits l scott lingamfelter
