first global cruise operator to have four ships based in china when it deploys its costa serena to shanghai in april the race for china underscores the growing strength of the leisure and travel industries in the world s no 2 economy as authorities try to spur domestic spending rather than trade and investment as an engine of growth executives are confident about china s prospects even as its economy struggles with a prolonged slowdown from double digit rates of expansion saying that growth is still strong when compared with developed markets miami based carnival expects to carry 500 000 chinese cruise passengers in 2015 up from 350 000 this year we know that s just a drop in the bucket to what lies ahead in terms of the market in china which we believe is going to someday represent more than half of all the cruise guests carnival ceo arnold donald said in a phone interview the asian cruise association estimated last year that the overall asian market which totaled 1 3 million passengers in 2012 could nearly triple to 3 8 million in 2020 including 1 6 million from china carnival is even more optimistic predicting the number will grow to 7 million by 2020 or about a fifth of the global market for the next five to 10 years greater china including hong kong will play a critical role to the global cruise industry s development said zinan liu royal caribbean cruises ltd s managing director for china while the u s and european regions are showing signs of revival there s no region like china and asia that will grow as rapidly he said mr liu said royal caribbean expects
