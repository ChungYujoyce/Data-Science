christian expositor of the 21st century fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state here s some pertinent advice from a fox news channel host greg gutfeld regarding the coronavirus crisis and the liberal news media s unending bias and animosity against mr trump and the white house coronavirus task force we can hold this country together with or without the media s help and believe me they are not helping much if at all mr gutfeld told his audience over the weekend with a warning about what appears to be the media s own malaise i have no doubt we will exit this dark period stronger and better than before jobs will return the economy will roar back the truth will come out and we will have saved many lives and the only sickness that lingers the one that seems impervious to drugs is the media s own incurable bias best to keep your distance permanently said mr gutfeld a handy summation no wonder democrats are nervous despite the relentless attacks from democrats and the media a strong majority of america is behind president trump s leadership during the coronavirus pandemic advises steve guest rapid response director for the republican national committee who supplies this handy summation of public opinion polls conducted in the last week abc washington post poll 66 express confidence in the federal government s ability to handle the outbreak mr guests said a gallup poll revealed 60 approve of the president s response to the coronavirus the gallup poll also showed an increase in the president s approval rating among independents and democrats another hill harris poll found that 61 of voters say mr trump is taking strong measures to slow or stop coronavirus spread while an abc ipsos poll revealed that 55 of the public approve of the president s management of the crisis and finally a cbs news poll found that 53 say mr trump is doing a good job of handling the outbreak getting cranky president trump s approval is spiking and the left can t stand it writes david marcus a columnist for the federalist you would think that most people would view this as good thing i mean in the middle of a crisis having faith in leadership is better than not having faith in leadership right for many on the left though these numbers are cause for consternation mr marcus writes he cited cnn analyst ana navarro cardenas who was perplexed by a recent abc poll with a 51 approval rating for the president who are these 51 of americans who approve of the way this lying narcissistic science denying petty partisan infantile intellectual wasteland lame excuse for a president with the vocabulary of a 4 year old apologies to 4 year olds is mishandling this crisis really the analyst wrote in a tweet mr marcus said that for trump supporters this is all obviously delicious but that really isn t the point the point is that in a time of national crisis trump has changed his behavior and risen to the challenge our friends on the left either can t or refuse to see this but the american people do and they are the ones who decide the fate of trump s reelection chances not the bobble headed pundits that people pbs cnn and msnbc the abortion irony abortion awareness has taken on a new meaning during the coronavirus pandemic particularly when house speaker nancy pelosi and other pro choice factions insist that funds for the procedure should be considered a vital part of the 2 4 trillion national coronavirus aid response you know you live in a healthy society when its elite journalists demand even more dead bodies than those being produced by a pandemic that s precisely what the new york times editorial board asked for in their recent piece that called for even more abortions during the coronavirus outbreak imagine that even as normal life has been interrupted all around us lefties need abortion mills to be one of the few constant and sure things still operating writes gabriel hays a media research center cultural analyst he cites a recent op ed titled make abortion more available during the pandemic not less in which the times made the case that abortions were an essential component of comprehensive health care ah yes killing kids is as essential as the er doctor saving lives this is just a dark orwellian leftist game the notion that someone wanting an abortion is an equal emergency to someone s imminent death from coronavirus or a heart attack is not convincing writes mr hays our old friend deep woods a longtime political commentator who indeed lives in the dense woods of the northeast agrees with the analyst does anyone else see the irony of spending 2 trillion to save the lives of adults and elders yet spend another 600 million to kill a million babies a year he writes from a hunker bunker up north in a
