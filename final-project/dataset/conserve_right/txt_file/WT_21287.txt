it will likely do just as well as her previous book the best selling liars leakers and liberals the case against the anti trump conspiracy and no wonder the new book is essentially a sequel in my previous book i was focused on the justice department and the fbi i became aware of corruption at the very highest levels when i stepped back from it all i realized that there was a whole plot underway to remake america itself respect for law and order and the u s constitution respect for authority it s disappearing this is now a totally different country this is not america ms pirro tells inside the beltway top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens the damage she says is being inflicted by radical leftists who never got over president trump s victory in 2016 ms pirro who has known the president for 25 years is deeply troubled by such issues as open borders and illegal immigration you can t tell these people trying to come into this country to just go ahead and break the law yet they re being told to do that you can t tell hard working americans that they now have to pay for free health care for illegal aliens the author says she is also in disbelief over the ready acceptance of infanticide by many politicians assorted attacks on free speech and the undue influence of social media ms pirro also cites open attacks on law enforcement personnel and the parade of very public investigations such as the inconclusive hearings surrounding both the mueller report and the supreme court nomination of justice brett m kavanaugh this is not the america our forefathers envisioned this is not the america my grandfather or father fought for in two world wars this is not life liberty and the pursuit of happiness happening here ms pirro says the nation has a choice she advises the beginning of a solution is to reinstate law and order and the respect for authority in america we can choose to be a civilized society or a barbaric one we can remember our founding tenets or chip away at them we can reward lawlessness or choose not to the author observes secondly we have to ask illegal immigrants what they have to offer us and who they are their bank should not be the american tax payer and i also believe we should shut down the borders until we sort this all out the book is published by center street the conservative imprint of publishing giant hachette trump s chance of reelection good the number of voters who think president trump will be reelected in 2020 continues to grow according to veteran pollster scott rasmussen in a poll of 1 000 voters conducted mid august

democrats believe a trump reelection is not at all likely the analysis notes adding that 62 of independent voters now believe that mr trump is indeed likely to win practical advice to the media multiple polls have confirmed in recent years that americans don t much trust the news media primarily because the reporting is mired in bias and agenda if media organizations really wanted to improve their image they would address public skepticism seriously taking some very simple steps stop trying to bury every bit of good news for president trump and every bit of bad news for bernie biden co try to acknowledge that policy debates have two sides it is fair to question climate change support our national identity and oppose the abortion industry trafficking human carnage advises brent bozell president of the media research center and tim graham director of media analysis at the conservative press watchdog is it too late conservatives have walked away from these networks and newspapers which means that their audiences are now mostly liberals who reject everything conservatives champion obviously from all we ve witnessed liberal journalists are much more sensitive to criticism from fellow liberals than they are to the american public that s unlikely to change so the credibility crisis will only deepen the two analysts note a hillary sighting three years ago then
