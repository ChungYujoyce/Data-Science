apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic jerusalem ap president donald trump s plan for ending the israeli palestinian conflict paves the way for israel to annex most or all of its settlements in the occupied west bank the settlement enterprise began immediately after israel captured east jerusalem the west bank and the gaza strip in the 1967 war and accelerated through much of the decades long peace process it enjoys wide backing among israelis many of whom view the settlements as a religious national or strategic necessity the palestinians view the settlements as illegal and the main obstacle to resolving the conflict saying they make the establishment of a contiguous viable palestinian state virtually impossible most of the international community agrees the international

previous israeli leaders have said the fate of the settlements should be discussed in peace talks but there have been no talks in more than a decade and prime minister benjamin netanyahu has said the settlements are here to stay for decades the u s viewed the settlements as inconsistent with international law but trump reversed that policy last year his mideast peace team includes prominent

west bank and another 215 000 to 300 000 live in annexed east jerusalem territories the palestinians want for their future state that s according to west bank jewish population stats a settler group

settlements and some 110 outposts built without official authorization the settlements are scattered across the west bank occupying many hilltops the largest are home to tens of thousands of people
