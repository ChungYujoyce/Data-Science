deadline neared oslene johnson 19 was managing the project s twitter account from under the blankets in her bedroom and trying not to be discouraged when you really look at it it s about providing closure for communities families and also as a country said johnson who has since graduated but still works with the students imagine the class considered all the people african americans mostly who have lived with questions about what happened to their loved ones 50 years or more ago the killings and injuries have long passed the perpetrators are gone but the families she said they re still with us the students interest began in 2015 when teacher stuart wexler s advanced placement government and policy class at hightstown high was studying the civil rights movement they couldn t believe that in america so many criminal cases involving racial violence and death could remain unsolved srihari suvramanian 17 a senior said in an associated press telephone interview with the class it s just atrocious that these individuals have gotten away with crimes committed decades ago for so long even though the majority of americans know it s wrong he added we think it s very important to provide a sense of closure even if we can t get a full sense of closure maybe provide some answers to the people that were denied justice the students crowdsourced a list of cases filed freedom of information act requests and then waited research on old cases often runs into dead ends and they could imagine the difficulties that families go through trying to get answers they turned their attention to congress the president john f kennedy assassination records collection act of 1992 which collects records at the national archives from the assassination provided a model for the legislation they wanted they took bus trips to washington to find supporters rep bobby rush d ill was among the first to sign on inspired his office said by the work and the possibility it held then democrat doug jones won a senate seat from alabama in december 2017 they had already reached out to jones the u s attorney who won convictions after reopening the 16th street baptist church bombing case from 1963 in birmingham six months after he was sworn in as the first democratic senator from alabama in a generation jones stood on the senate floor and introduced the bill that would become the civil rights cold case collection act the students watched from the gallery above justice can take many forms jones said reconciliation can be a potent force he said after all this time we might not solve every one of these cold cases but my hope is our efforts today will at the very least help us find some long overdue healing and understanding of the truth republican sen ted cruz of texas who was presiding in the chamber that day has said he was so moved that he told jones he would sign on as a co sponsor cruz helped bring republicans on board by december in the final days of the congressional session the bill unanimously passed the senate and was approved in the house 376 6 from there it was off to the president s desk but the students worried the bill would expire when the new congress convened in january we went on a mad desperate scramble to get the president to sign the bill said james ward a 17 year old senior who helped mobilize the student body class by class to take out their phones and tweet in wexler s classroom students posted photos of trump s midnight advisers aides media celebrities and started putting x s through the ones they had reached out to we were tweeting at as many people as we could suvramanian recalled he was finishing class one afternoon when he dashed off an email to christopher ruddy the ceo of newsmax and a trump ally he got back to me within 30 minutes the teenager said after a short exchange another note came back he said i dropped a message to the president around 10 minutes ago and i really hope your bill gets signed into law even with the new congress starting the next day the actual deadline for signing the bill was still a week away the night of trump s border security address to the nation amid what became the longest government shutdown in u s history johnson a student leader when the project started tried not to lose hope as she tweeted she had graduated and moved on as had many other students there have been dozens in all over the past several years who had been involved in the project then word came jones office told wexler who told the students trump had signed the bill which focuses on unsolved criminal cases from 1940 until 1980 johnson cried the families could now with access to information at least know something about what happened she said along with trump s signature came a lengthy signing statement of potential concerns about the process for review and public release of the documents but also support for congress to fund the effort ruddy confirmed he had reached out to the white house impressed by the students he thinks the president would have been too margaret burnham a law professor at northeastern university and director of the civil rights and restorative justice project said what wexler and his class did was nothing short of amazing the creativity was not so much in framing potentially effective legislation but in strategizing how to get it through the congress said burnham who has worked for years on these issues and similar efforts in washington that s where stuart and his students over several classes were just dogged and creative incredibly creative in their ability to persuade congress people on both sides of the aisle of the meaning and continuing urgency and significance of this issue tahj linton 17 said he hopes other americans understand the power they have to shape political outcomes if we can start to solve some of the racial problems that were never really closed in the past decades or 50 years or so maybe we can start to work on the ones that are happening today and make a difference about
