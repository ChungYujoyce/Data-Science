and military cooperation in the arab world against terrorism pentagon eyes colorado for gitmo detainees president obama in his last state of the union speech tuesday again called for closing the guantanamo bay cuba terrorist prison according to u s defense officials the pentagon wants to build a new prison near the federal high security prison outside colorado springs under a controversial plan to bring more than 50 islamic terrorists from cuba to the united states the pentagon has begun emptying the military prison as part of a white house push to close the guantanamo bay facility before mr obama s term ends but mr obama is facing several serious legal political and financial hurdles first federal law prohibits closing the facility and building a new one on the u s mainland under provisions added by congress to both the defense authorization and appropriations acts signed by the president last year mr obama has said the gitmo provisions of the law don t apply to him since they infringe his powers as commander in chief however analysts in government say the legal barriers to ignoring the congressional provisions are too high financially the costs of setting up a new facility are estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars closing guantanamo and building a new u s military prison would cost about 600 million the wall street journal reported last month the president reportedly ordered the pentagon to explore cheaper options a defense official said a new prison in florence colorado is a favored option because of its remote location and because it could draw on resources from the nearby supermax facility as military detainees the guantanamo prisoners cannot be placed directly within the population at the high security federal prison three sets of guantanamo terrorists have been released by the pentagon since last week two were sent ghana on jan 6 two others were sent to kuwait and saudi arabia on friday and monday officials familiar with detainee plans said the goal is to release 44 of the remaining 103 detainees and send the remainder 59 terrorists considered hard core extremists to a new wing of florence the detainee group the pentagon wants to bring to the united states would include sept 11 mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed two other locations studied by the pentagon are the u s military prison at fort leavenworth kansas and a military prison in charleston south carolina those sent to colorado would join notorious terrorists now housed in florence including mail bomber ted kaczynski oklahoma city bomber terry nichols

with pakistan is running into design and other technical problems according to asian military sources islamabad turned to china for jets after the united states blocked the sale of additional f 16 jet fighters to pakistan in 1989 they are now co producing a third generation fighter called the jf 17 pakistan has been flying jf 17s since 2007 and now has a fleet of around 60 jets the first of an expected 250 fighters that will replace obsolete mirage and f 7 russian design jets according to the sources the jf 17 is troubled with a number of design operational and maintenance problems and limitations they include a weak wing design that resulted in the sudden in flight breakup in november 2011 of the wing of a jf 17 an investigation concluded that the wing design was bad since it could support the weight of wing mounted missiles and launchers the wing problem was fixed but current loads are limited to 1 000 pounds also based on the wing design problem the jet s maneuverability was downgraded limiting flight characteristics other problems include faulty computer software that freezes pilot command systems the software has resulted in pilots being unable to launch missiles and bombs the jet also suffers from multiple engine problems because of its russian rd 93 engine the engine s frequent breakdowns have resulted in lengthy delays for repairs also jf 17s are unable to conduct air to air refueling severely limiting range a retrofit of aerial refueling gear is being installed with the first two jets capable of in flight refueling to be ready by the end of the year jf 17s also lack targeting pods crucial for precision strike capabilities for air to ground bombs and missiles china and turkey are currently studying adding the pods also jf 17s are unable to fly at night and can operate only in daylight or dusk operations another severe limitation the jf 17 also lacks airborne self defense jammers making the aircraft vulnerable to electronic warfare aircraft and its radar lacks range in its look down shoot down mode cockpit displays also are outdated they lack the helmet heads up display and the friend or foe identification system has not met promised specifications according to one military source the current status of the jf 17 aircraft being jointly marketed by china and pakistan does not in any way qualify to be a state of the art aircraft and more so china has not inducted a single jf 17 in its inventory rick fisher a senior fellow at the international assessment and strategy center agreed that the jet has problems nobody will contest that the chengdu jf 17 fc 1 is a work in progress and that it will evolve significantly over its service life said mr fisher a china military expert among potential customers for the jf 17 are nigeria sri lanka myanmar saudi arabia egypt iran venezuela argentina azerbaijan and zambia mr fisher said the asian military assessment is interesting but in the current global fighter market the jet offers the best performing fighter aircraft for the price around 25 million to 35 million per jet or up to 33 percent less expensive than a new u s f 16 but its chinese air to air and ground attack weapons make it almost as capable as much more expensive western and russian aircraft he said north korean general claims small warhead following pyongyang s surprise underground nuclear test last week a senior north korean general bragged that the kim jong un regime is now armed with an arsenal of missiles capable of carrying small nuclear warheads gen no kwang chol the vice defense minister disclosed the
