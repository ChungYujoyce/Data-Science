apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic united nations ap the united states and china said tuesday they are making progress on a new u n resolution that would impose additional sanctions against north korea following its test of an intercontinental ballistic missile the u s gave china a proposed resolution several weeks ago and u s ambassador nikki haley told reporters that china has been negotiating with its close ally russia on possible new sanctions the true test will be what they ve worked out with russia she said top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed china s u n ambassador liu jieyi told two journalists that we are making progress and we are working as hard as we can but neither haley nor liu would estimate how long it will take before they agree on a draft that can be circulated to the rest of the 15 member security council and then put to a vote there is certainly light at the end of the tunnel and we are working towards that light and i can t really tell how much time we would need liu said he wouldn t confirm that china is working with russia on the text saying there is always a process of working out the resolution and in due course i think the resolution will be discussed at a wider circle haley said i think we are moving it s not as fast as i would like but these are pretty serious sanctions and so i think that there is a lot of thought going into this the security council has already imposed six rounds of progressively tougher sanctions against north korea but so far that has failed to halt the country s rapidly advancing nuclear and ballistic missile programs the most recent sanctions resolution to be adopted on june 2 added to the u n blacklist 15 individuals and four entities linked to the north s nuclear and missile programs at the time china was blocking tougher measures pushed by the united states but north korea raised the stakes with its launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile as americans celebrated independence day on july 4 the test marked a significant step toward young north korean leader kim jong un s goal of developing a missile with a nuclear warhead capable of reaching the united states and it changed the reality for the trump administration which moved quickly to give china a new draft resolution with tougher sanctions haley stressed that the united states wants to ensure that a new resolution is a strong resolution because that s what we think we need to have i think we are making progress so we are actually talking about different sanctions she said haley refused to say what measures were being discussed but earlier this month she told the security council that if it is united the international community can cut off major sources of hard currency to north korea restrict oil to its military and weapons programs increase air and maritime restrictions and hold senior officials accountable liu said there is going to be more than the last resolution but he stressed that for china a resolution must serve to promote denuclearization and peace and security on the korean peninsula and a negotiated solution to north korea s nuclear and missile programs therefore liu said the specific measures in a new resolution need to be measured against achieving those three objectives haley said she was pleased with china s response to the initial draft the u s proposed we were waiting to see if it was going to be weak or strong and i think they re showing some seriousness with it haley said we are constantly in touch with china and i can say that things are moving but it is still too early to tell how far they ll move liu said the most important thing is to have a draft resolution that everybody can support one possible stumbling block is whether the new resolution will refer to north korea s test of an intercontinental ballistic missile russia has questioned whether the missile actually was an icbm though china did not i think that everyone that we have dealt with acknowledges it s an icbm haley said whether they re willing to put it in writing or not is going to be the real question liu noted that previous resolutions referred to ballistic missiles without going into further categorization of the missiles and i do not think that for the purpose of working out a resolution you need really to go to the technical nitty gritties of things he said liu said china is still working to convince other governments to support its suspension for suspension proposal in which north korea would suspend nuclear and missile tests in exchange for the u s and south korea suspending their joint military exercises the package proposed by china and supported by russia also includes denuclearization of the korean peninsula and a peace and security mechanism in place for both north korea and south korea liu said we just hope that the other relevant parties wi
