mom susan gill couldn t be more proud of her only child she recalls when he took off for china with little more than a guitar on his shoulder and a backpack a former teacher gill hopes that his story will inspire other kids to think beyond the montgomery city limits i don t think a lot of kids in montgomery dream big they don t think about doing cool things with their lives you know she said after high school macdonald attended auburn university he helped some chinese students with their class assignments and dated a chinese exchange student he bought several chinese language books and learned to speak both cantonese and mandarin he was a student of martial arts for years and was recommended to attend a seminar in china he was excited to go there and further his study of a form of chinese kung fu known as wing chun and to make a little money he arranged for a job teaching english to chinese students he thought he d stay there a few months tops but soon after he met a dutch businessman at a bar and the two struck up a conversation the businessman who was a millionaire in the recycling industry told macdonald that he wanted to open a bar impressed with the young man that he spoke chinese didn t hurt he offered to hire macdonald to help run it and to help set him up with an apartment macdonald took him up on the offer in addition to working at the bar he was able to use his skills as a musician to start doing dj work at clubs and parties that he was a good looking american and knew how to read a crowd gave him some attention he started working with other djs who aren t familiar to most americans but are wildly popular internationally among the young club going set the term dj has multiple meanings in america but some think of them as either radio hosts or those who play records like karaoke hosts what macdonald does is far from either a dj creates a playlist blending multiple songs into one continuous song allowing partygoers to dance without pausing between songs he can adjust the speed of the tracks to match the tempos of different songs the creative djs and the successful ones enhance the performance by finding unusual ways of mixing tracks utilizing anything from sound effects to music samples they also figure out quickly what the crowd wants to hear and play to the vibe in the room empty dance floors are taboo macdonald has several of his own creations or mixes on the online site soundcloud his mixes pull from different musical genres and even different generations one of his creations mixes icona pop s 2012 smash hit i don t care with the opening riffs of van halen s 1978 classic ain t talkin bout love his years of learning music theory have paid off he listens to other artists songs for the chord progressions and figures out which songs in which keys will blend together he uses the beat from one song to seamlessly lead into others and he adjusts song tracks according to the crowd s immediate reaction so it s really like a live fluid machine that way you can control the dance floor and keep it really excited the whole time he said while he doesn t really play his guitar or other instruments anymore he does work as a producer and creates his own beats and music with a keyboard and computers the evolving technology in music creation is fascinating even to a young man like macdonald but for a true musician there is nothing like the feel of an instrument and the pure joy of creating music in that way he does miss american music he said the chinese don t show nearly the emotion and passion that we re accustomed to from musicians in any genre he and lee saw a southern rock band recently they played with so much feeling he said and he tried to explain the cultural difference to her but she didn t quite understand she was like what i ve heard bands before macdonald s visit to america is somewhat open ended but he said he s invested in a club in hong kong that is slated to open at the end of may so he ll likely need to return to check on its progress for now he s eager to show lee the u s she studied english education in china and speaks the language fluently but has never traveled here so far she s enjoyed the experience and likes america he would like to line up some kind of show before returning mainly to help with marketing macdonald thinks that because of the communist mindset the chinese don t really judge for themselves what is hip or cool culturally they just go off of what we think if you re a dj and you have recent work in america then oh you must be good he s been told that to do a show like the ones he does in china his options in the south are in south florida or atlanta but he has contacts in the industry in the u s and has a half brother who is a musician in los angeles so options are available he says he ll stay in music even if it means running a club or managing an act i have thought of being an agent sending american talent to asia and giving them the same opportunities i had
