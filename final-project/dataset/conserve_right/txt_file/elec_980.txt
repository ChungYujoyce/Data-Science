leader chuck schumer d n y fired back on twitter at trump saying in a democracy no one not even the president can prevent the lawful counting of votes we will not allow him or anyone else to steal this election a mandatory recount now appears imminent not only in scott apos s race but also in the agricultural commissioner contest and florida apos s high profile gubernatorial brawl between democrat andrew gillum and republican ron desantis based on new vote totals even though gillum has already conceded florida law requires a machine recount when candidates are within 0 50 percentage points of each other scott apos s first emergency complaintaccuses broward county supervisor of elections brenda snipesof being unwilling to disclose records revealing how many electors voted how many ballots have been canvassed and how many ballots remain to be canvassed and charges that the uncertainty raises substantial concerns about the validity of the election process the nrscspecifically allege that snipes is in violation of the florida constitution and the florida public records act they demand an emergency hearing as well as a court order requiring snipes to turn over information about ballots in broward county scott apos s complaint againstpalm beach county supervisor of elections susan bucher meanwhile alleges first that officials there illegally refused to allow republicans or any witnesses to monitor the county apos s handling of damaged absentee ballots even more alarmingly scott additionallyclaims bucher failed to allow the palm beach county canvassing board to determine as required by law which damaged or improperly filled out absentee ballots were valid and how the voters of those ballots had intended to vote instead scott and the nrsc argue bucher and her staff simply used theirown judgment when determiningvoters apos intent the suit against bucher demands an injunction requiring bucher to make and compare duplicate copies of all damaged absentee ballots in the presence ofscott apos s representatives and to allow the palm beach county canvassing board to determine voters apos intent when counting those ballots rubio in his barrage of broadsides against snipes earlier in the day pointed to the slow drip of tens of thousands of additional ballots that were reported throughout the day thursday most of which were favorable to several democratic candidates rubio said those late disclosures violated florida election law which necessitates that mail in and early voting ballots be counted within 30 minutes of polls closing bay county was hit by a cat 4 hurricane just 4 weeks ago yet managed to count votes submit timely results rubio wrote yet over 41 hours after polls closed broward elections office is still counting votes he added friday every other county including neighboring miami dade which had 100k more votes cast was able to canvass tabulate report to state by deadline but broward still hasn t finished won t disclose how many ballots are left rubio and scottboth made it clear they haveno confidence in snipes apos integrity a u s senate seat a statewide cabinet officer are now potentially in the hands of an elections supervisor with a history of incompetence of blatant violations of state federal laws rubiowrote linking to a miami herald article describing several scandals that have grippedbroward county s elections department earlier this year a judge found that snipes had illegally destroyed ballots in a 2016 congressional contest leading the secretary of state apos s office to assign election monitors to supervise her i think the problems are blown out of proportion snipes said in october in an interview with the miami herald broward is nitpicked to the bone other places have the same problems different problems it s just that they are not spotlighted like we are at his thursday press conference scott outlined some of snipes apos troubled history in 2016 brenda snipes office posted election results half an hour before polls closed a violation of election law scott said that same year her office was sued for leaving amendments off of ballots in 2014 brenda snipes fellow democrats accused her of individual and systemic breakdowns that made it difficult for voters to cast regular ballots all floridians should be concerned about that vote totals in severalmajor races in the state are changing rapidly on an irregular schedule and sometimes late into the evening scott was ahead ofnelson by roughly one fourth of one percentage point as of thursday morning according to the tampa bay times the paper also said the agriculture commissioner candidates wereseparated by only0 06 points that raceflipped in favor of the democratic candidate on thursday afternoon broward county reported that significantly more votes were received in the agriculture commissioner contest than the much higher profile senate election an attorney for nelson apos s campaign suggested a computer error might explain that anomaly in the closely watched gubernatorial race desantisheld a narrow 0 52 percentage point edge over gillum as of thursday morning extremely close to the 0 5 percent threshold needed to trigger a machinerecount gillumhas conceded the race although his decision is nonbinding but by thursday afternoon unofficial figures had desantis up by just 38 515 votes out of the more than 8million cast a lead of just 0 47 percent low enough to trigger a mandatory recount according to the tallahassee democrat no recount has yet been announced by florida apos s secretary of state the first unofficial vote count is expected to be verified saturday on tuesday night the gillum for governor campaign operated with the best information available about the number of outstanding ballots left to count gillum apos s campaign said in a statement thursday evening since that time it has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported our campaign along with our attorney barry richard is monitoring the situation closely and is ready for any outcome including a state mandated recount without providing legally sufficient justification rubio said democrat controlled broward and palm beach counties on wednesday afternoon continued to report new ballots cutting into scott apos s already thin lead and also flipping the state apos s agriculture commissioner race to democrats palm beach county supervisor of elections susan bucher told fox news thatpalm beach is still counting about 2 000 mail in ballots where voters circled or highlighted by drawing an arrow pointing at the candidate s name their choice instead of filling in the appropriate bubbles bucher told fox news that elections department staff is going through each of the 2 000 mail in ballots and where voter intent is determined a worker is fillingin a new ballot on behalf of the voter where voter intent cannot be determined the ballot is sent to the canvassing board to undergo review elections officials are also reviewing 1 500 military and overseas ballots which are still being counted florida law allows military servicemembers to mail or faxballots in a provisional vote report is due in tallahassee on saturday by noon broward election supervisors ongoing violation of florida law requiring timely reporting isn t just annoying incompetence rubio wrote it has opened the door for lawyers to come here try to steal a seat in the u s senate florida cabinet florida law dictates that if the margin in any race hits 0 25 percent or lower a manual recount of any ballots set aside from the machine recount will be ordered reminiscent of the scene in the 2000 presidential election when the country was gripped by images of poll
