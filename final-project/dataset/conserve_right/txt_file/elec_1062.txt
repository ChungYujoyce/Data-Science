against president obama on tuesday night in the first of their debates to involve foreign policy the republican challenger will take a page from ronald reagan s playbook by attempting to portray the democratic incumbent as the second coming of president carter and himself as the champion of the gipper s peace through strength mantra with a confidence that seemed out of reach six months ago when mr obama enjoyed a hefty lead in the polls on foreign policy mr romney will point to the past month s desecration of american flags and the killing of a u s ambassador in the middle east as proof of the president s failure to maintain american power abroad some conservatives will cheer mr romney s rhetoric but analysts generally say that it will be little more than that when it comes down to details they say the foreign policy the republican ultimately will pursue is unlikely to stray far from mr obama s or those of his predecessors top stories purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces russian fighter jets intercept u s navy patrol aircraft over mediterranean he really isn t that different from obama said joseph nye a clinton administration official and foreign policy professor at harvard he s trying hard but when you get past the rhetoric of we need to be strong and you ask what do we really need to do it s not there syria where an armed rebellion is battling the regime of president bashar assad to a stalemate likely will be a chief flash point of tuesday s debate which will have a town hall format but be devoted in equal parts to foreign policy and domestic policy the first obama romney clash centered exclusively on domestic policy and the third will be devoted to foreign policy mr romney has slammed the administration for failing to lead an international search for solutions to the syrian bloodshed when it comes to a romney white house he says he would work with such u s allies as saudi arabia to arm syrian opposition rebels an approach analysts say the obama administration already is doing albeit clandestinely mr romney also calls out the administration for being soft on iran and blames it for failing to prop up pro democracy demonstrators in 2009 but the republican nominee stops short of saying his own white house would back a pre emptive military strike he hasn t spelled out any other measures beyond the types of sanctions that the obama administration already has spearheaded including an international oil embargo that is crippling the islamic republic s economy indeed the chief claim mr romney will make is that mr obama lacks a coherent doctrine that american allies can rely on and american foes can react to the sort of defining u s role that he says created peace in the decades since world war ii it was reagan who pushed the peace through strength mantra to the fore of political debate in 1980 his campaign ran a tv attack ad claiming mr carter wasted four years in the white house failing to understand that it takes strong leadership to keep the peace and that weak leadership will lose it switch out carter for obama and the romney camp s message parallels the reagan era ad with almost plagiaristic precision alex wong the romney campaign s foreign policy director told reporters during a conference call last week that the former massachusetts governor s philosophy is one of peace through strength that began with truman that continued through kennedy continued through reagan and now to candidate romney the only two exceptions said mr wong have been jimmy carter and barack obama nowhere will that argument be more pointed on tuesday night than toward mr obama s middle east posture mr romney can be expected to criticize the administration s reaction to and honesty about the muslim world s recent protests against america as well as the sept 11 terrorist attack that killed american ambassador j christopher stevens in libya but when it comes to an overall alternative strategy for libya left leaning analysts said mr romney is unlikely to offer much more than a snub to mr obama for leading from behind in last year s nato intervention romney is a guy saying nothing but with an impressive delivery said gordon adams another clinton era policymaker who teaches foreign affairs at american university he s holding his own without being forced into the details because in the details he s out of his depth the romney camp sees attacking obama as weak as a good political opening said mr adams who noted the tons of advice mr romney is receiving on foreign policy from a very dispersed group of advisers coming from positions all over the map from neoconservatives such as john r bolton to more diplomacy centered internationalists like richard williamson the romney foreign policy tent is ideologically broad but everyone in the tent rallies around the same rhetorical pole of peace through strength which they say is an important difference with mr obama s peace through strength is a slogan said james phillips a senior research fellow for middle eastern affairs at the heritage foundation that symbolizes a number of more concrete policy positions especially with regard to the need to keep a strong military to set a certain tone in which diplomacy is strongly supported by military action as opposed to the obama carter approach where military action is essentially ruled out in a way that i think unfortunately weakens our diplomacy not everyone agrees while mr obama has withdrawn u s forces from the heart of the middle east in iraq he has kept up a ubiquitous drone war against suspected terrorists across the region and has green lighted a variety of clandestine military operations including the one that killed osama bin laden in pakistan i don t think historians will look back 20 years from now and say ah this is the man who abandoned peace through strength i mean it just doesn t fit the facts mr nye said others are less eager to accept peace through strength as anything more than trumped up campaignspeak it might have been a doctrine back during the cold war said xenia dormandy a senior fellow at chatham house the london based foreign affairs think tank but i don t think it has any relevance in the post cold war era foreign policy challenges today ignore borders are often led not by states but non states and are often intangible for example energy limitations environmental issues pandemics and terrorism mrs dormandy said they don t lend themselves to these kinds of one on one staring down battles in the same way that the cold war did and therefore they need a different set of tools but in a presidential race voters want simple ideas simply expressed she said adding that peace through strength is an enormously simple and therefore powerful rhetorical flourish copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view
