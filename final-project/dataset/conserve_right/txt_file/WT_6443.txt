billion in chinese imports he hasn t already taxed the move immediately sent stock prices sinking u s consumers will likely feel the pain if trump proceeds with the new tariffs trump s earlier tariffs had been designed to minimize the impact on ordinary americans by focusing on industrial goods but the new tariffs will hit a vast range of consumer products from cellphones to silk scarves the president s announcement via twitter on thursday came as a surprise in part because the white house on wednesday had said beijing confirmed that it planned to increase its purchases of american farm products that word came just as u s and chinese negotiators were ending a 12th round of trade talks in shanghai which the white house called constructive top stories bill clinton slams trump era

he was attending a meeting of the association of southeast asian nations the chinese foreign and commerce ministries didn t immediately respond to questions about how beijing would react though the negotiations concluded without any sign of a deal they are scheduled to resume next month in washington the dow jones industrial average which had been up nearly 300 points earlier in the day was down nearly 200 points after trump s tweets announcing the new tariffs the dow closed for the day down 280 points more than 1 trump has long said he was preparing to tax the 300 billion in additional chinese tariffs but he had suspended the threat after meeting with president xi jinping in osaka japan in june it isn t clear when american consumers are likely to feel the impact of the additional tariffs but higher prices could show up in stores this fall attention all target wal mart shoppers the price on the goods you buy ahead of the holidays are going up due to trade policy tweeted joseph brusuelas chief economist at the consultancy rsm besides announcing the additional tariffs on chinese imports trump tweeted that we look forward to continuing our positive dialogue with china on a
