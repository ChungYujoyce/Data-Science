made at a university forum continuing atrend of old remarks resurfacing to plague the billionaire apos s bid for the democratic nomination joining the distinguished speakers series at the university of oxford sa d business school bloomberg was responding to a question about whether it is possible to unite people in middle america and the coasts one of the issues standing in the way of that bloomberg said was the inability of blue collar workers to adapt to the information economy even if they have their education subsidized the agrarian society lasted 3 000 years and we could teach processes i could teach anybody even people in this room no offense intended to be a farmer bloomberg said it apos s a process you dig a hole you put a seed in you put dirt on top add water up comes the corn you could learn that then we had 300 years of the industrial society you put the piece of metal on the lathe you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow and you can have a job and we created a lot of jobs at one point 98 percent of the world worked in agriculture now it apos s 2 percent in the united states bernie sanders tears into michael bloomberg says dem billionaire can apos t beat trump bloomberg continued now comes the information economy and the information economy is fundamentally different because it apos s built around replacing people with technology and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze and that is a whole degree level different you have to have a different skill set you have to have a lot more gray matter it apos s not clear the teachers can teach or the students can learn and so the challenge of society of finding jobs for these people who we can take care of giving them a roof over their head and a meal in their stomach and a cell phone and a car and that sort of thing but the thing that is the most important that will stop them from setting up a guillotine someday is the dignity of a job bloomberg who has faced a litany of negative stories in the past week about his past comments regarding women african americans and others concluded his point saying the problem is not the redistribution of wealth it is the job where you go in every day tom steyer key to nevada south carolina success is spending time there not just money the former mayor apos s comments drew the ire of many on twitter including the organization people for bernie which is dedicated to boosting sen bernie sanders i vt and began before the senatorannounced his candidacy time and again we see bloomberg insulting the middle class and the working class union members and not yet union members the organization tweeted maybe it apos s time for pundits to stop pretending he apos s just another candidate bloomberg is an oligarch spending his play money to buy the white house click here to get the fox news app in a statement on the video bloomberg campaign spokesman stu loeseraccused trump allies of taking the video out of context while shorter clips of the speech were circulating on social media fox newsreflected the full context of the video in this report and the full talk is embedded above thetrump team cut off the first part of mike apos s sentence where he said apos ifyou think about the agrarian society that lasted 3000 years we could teach processes apos he said mike wasn apos t talking about today apos s farmers at all and team trump is deliberately misleading americans because donald trump s erratic policies have devastated american farms including a 20 increase in us farm bankruptcies last year the bloomberg campaign apos s statement however does not mention that he was talking about educating modern farmers for a modern economyin the video and does not address his comment on farmers and factory workers needing more gray matter to do jobs in the information economy trump campaign communications director tim murtaugh also denied circulating edited clips of the remarks saying in a statement no but it s enlightening to know how much disdain he holds for farmers and factory workers he s flattering himself if he thinks we re paying that much attention to him he s got a bunch of other democrats to worry about and besides that his worst enemies are himself and his public record rep fred keller r pa who represents a very large rural district with over 10 500 farms condemned bloomberg apos s comments in a monday morning statement i bet mike bloomberg could not even change a tire on his car let alone deal with the myriad of issues farmers deal with on a daily basis bloomberg apos s

hardworking individuals across our nation thanks to president trump apos s administration 17 000 pennsylvania agricultural jobs will benefit as a result of the united states mexico canada agreement and better trade deals with countries like china in another moment during his oxford remarks bloomberg implied that more intelligent people are more likely to believe in individual rights we the intelligentsia the people who could make it in this room bloomberg told the oxford crowd we believe in a lot of things in terms of equality and protecting individual rights that make no sense to the vast bulk of people they apos re not opposed to the idea of you having some rights but there apos s a fundamental disconnect between us believing the rights of the individual come first and the general belief around the world i think it apos s fair to say that the rights of society come first bloomberg who has made clear he is willing to spend 1 billion or more on his presidential campaign is counting on his advertising advantage to put him over the top in super tuesday states after deciding to skip iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina that strategy appears to be making at least some progress as bloomberg registered at 10 percent in the latest national fox news poll after entering the presidential race late and missing every debate so far and he has appeared to make even more progress since that poll apos s late january release checking in at third place nationally with 14 2 percent in the realclearpolitics national average of polls fox news apos john roberts contributed
