dicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic iran likely would turn to russia or china for help in reverse engineering a u s drone that landed in its territory last year because the islamic republic lacks the manufacturing capability to replicate the technology u s experts say china and russia each have a broader scientific and manufacturing capacity than iran and the proven capability to reverse engineer advanced technology last year china unveiled its first stealth jet fighter which experts say is modeled after a u s f 117 that crashed in serbia more than 10 years ago top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning we did a big solid for chinese aeronautics peter singer director of the 21st century defense initiative at the brookings institution said of the u s spy drone that landed in iran in december the joke i ve made is that the airline flights from moscow and beijing to tehran were probably full the next week after the consequences of u s drone technology falling into iranian russian or chinese hands are not disastrous but definitely aren t good said joe cirincione an arms control expert china and russia aren t adversaries but they re not exactly friends you never like to give your competitor any advantage and them having your most secret technologies is a problem said mr cirincione who is a member of a scientific board advising secretary of state hillary rodham clinton a pentagon spokesman declined to comment and instead referred to white house press secretary jay carney s dec 13 statement that iran s claims that it had a role in bringing the drone down are an attempt to distract attention from a lot of internal strife an economy that has ground to a halt and a level of isolation that they have never experienced even if iran cannot create a replica of the u s drone mr cirincione said it can glean valuable information such as what the u s is watching and how for example he said if iran knows the u s has ground piercing radar it would try to configure its facilities so that they are outside the range of u s surveillance knowing what the enemy can see helps you better conceal your activities he said engineers who have worked with the u s military can only publicly speculate as to what sensitive technologies were on the rq 170 surveillance drone everything about that unmanned aircraft is classified except that it exists said retired lt gen dave deptula the air force s first deputy chief of staff for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance sensitive features could include the drone s shape coating software and sensors for example tail pieces and inlets are usually placed in such a way to minimize detection by radar said brian argrow director of the research and engineering center for unmanned vehicles at the university of colorado in the past rq 170s have carried active phased array radar a next generation radar that allows one to use radar while staying stealthy mr singer said it also has carried full motion video sensors and other sensors that can detect material composition or radioactive traces the rq 170 is not fitted with a weapons platform like the predator and reaper drones which have been used to launch deadly airstrikes on insurgents in pakistan s north warizistan and elsewhere there are some limitations as to what iran and others could learn from the captured rq 170 according to reza marashi research director for the national iranian american council the rq 170 is now a few years old and no longer represents the best of u s technology he said this wasn t our best drone but it wasn t anywhere near our worst even with assistance from china and russia iran would find the drone hard to replicate said edward walby a business director for u s defense technology firm northrop grumman if your grandmother bakes you a really good chocolate cake and gives you the recipe it s how you put it together that matters how you use it what are your techniques knowledge and experience said mr walby a retired air force colonel who commanded the first squadron of drones in the afghanistan war but there are also political consequences from the lost drone for instance iran can give china and russia access to the drone in exchange for their support against punitive actions over its nuclear program talks between iran and the permanent members of the u n security council and germany are expected to resume soon and china and russia wield veto power in the council overall experts say the lost drone is more of an embarrassment than a game changer we re the equivalent of the guy from apple that left the iphone in the bar mr singer said it didn t destroy apple or the iphone but it made it a lot easier for everybody else to understand what this thing is and maybe
