and japan that begins wednesday given the scourge of human trafficking in thailand and japan s use of capital punishment and high suicide rate as a young jesuit francis dreamed of being a missionary in japan inspired by the courage of japan s hidden christians who braved two centuries of persecution to keep their faith alive top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century in some way this is the fulfilment of his dream said the rev bernardo cervellera editor of asianews a vatican affiliated news service in thailand francis will also be reunited with his second cousin sister ana rose sivori an argentine nun who has lived in thailand since 1966 and will serve as francis official translator there here are some highlights of francis pilgrimage his fourth to asia and one that could also touch on the vatican s delicate relations with china asian martyrs and missionaries one of the highlights of the trip will be francis prayer at the memorial of the 26 nagasaki martyrs who were crucified in 1597 at the start of a two century wave of anti christian persecution by japanese rulers francis own jesuit order had introduced christianity to japan with the arrival of st francis xavier on the archipelago in 1549 after converting more than a quarter million japanese missionaries were banned at the start of the 17th century japanese christians were forced to renounce their faith suffer tortuous deaths or go underground francis will greet some descendants of these hidden christians whose story was recounted in the 2016 martin scorsese film silence francis will also honor

but the mere possession of nuclear weapons is to be firmly condemned japanese bishops are hoping he goes even further and calls for a ban on nuclear power francis will likely repeat his appeal for a total ban on the bomb when he visits nagasaki and hiroshima meets with survivors of the 1945 bombings there as well as victims of the march 11 2011 fukushima nuclear plant disaster in northern japan

radioactive waste in response japanese bishops in 2016 called for the abolition of nuclear power to protect our common home we can only hope francis will speak about nuclear power given his frequent exhortation to care for the environment said nagoya bishop michael goro matsuura minority catholics and interfaith dialogue catholics make up just 59 percent of thailand s population of 65 million most of whom are buddhist the percentage is even lower in japan estimated at 42 percent of the mostly shinto and buddhist population of 126 million as a result francis will be stressing interfaith ties and the positive role catholics can play in mostly buddhist societies especially in the service of the poor the needy and for peace he said in a video message to thais the pope on life and death francis has made the fight against human trafficking a cornerstone of his papacy a message that is likely to resonate in thailand which the u n considers a key trafficking destination as well as a source of forced labor and sex slaves in japan hopes are high among catholics that francis will send a message opposing the death penalty and perhaps meet with a former boxer and human rights activist held for nearly five decades on death row the vatican confirmed that iwao hakamada who converted to catholicism while in prison has been invited to the pope s mass in tokyo but it s not clear if he

acceptable a message that could resonate in japan which has one of the highest suicide rates in the developed world vatican china relations when francis travels from bangkok to tokyo next saturday he ll fly through chinese taiwanese and hong kong airspace and will send telegrams to their leaders as part of typical papal protocol that could offer francis a rare opportunity to address not only the
