his wife michelle vice president joe biden and his spouse jill acknowledge applause after obama delivered his victory speech to supporters gathered in chicago 2012 ap only in america can a president who inherits a deep recession and whose policies have actually made the effects of that recession worse get re elected only in america can a president who wants the bureaucrats who can t run the post office to micromanage the administration of every american s health care get re elected only in america can a president who kills americans overseas who have never been charged or convicted of a crime get re elected and only in america can a president who borrowed and spent more than 5 trillion in fewer than four years plans to repay none of it and promises to borrow another 5 trillion in his second term get re elected what s going on here what is going on is the present day proof of the truism observed by thomas jefferson and alexander hamilton who rarely agreed on anything in public when the voters recognize that the public treasury has become a public trough they will send to washington not persons who will promote self reliance and foster an atmosphere of prosperity but rather those who will give away the most cash and thereby create dependency this is an attitude that though present in some localities in the colonial era was created at the federal level by woodrow wilson and theodore roosevelt magnified by fdr enhanced by lbj and eventually joined in by all modern day democrats and most contemporary republicans mitt romney is one of those republicans he is no opponent of federal entitlements and he basically promised to keep them where they are where they are is a cost to taxpayers of about 1 7 trillion a year under president obama however the costs have actually increased and so have the numbers of those who now receive them half of the country knows this and so it has gleefully sent obama back to office so he can send them more federal cash taken from the other half it is fair to say that obama is the least skilled and least effective american president since jimmy carter but he is far more menacing his every instinct is toward the central planning of the economy and the federal regulation of private behavior he has no interest in protecting american government employees in harm s way in libya and he never admits he has been wrong about anything though he took an oath to uphold the constitution he treats it as a mere guideline whose grand principles intended to guarantee personal liberty and a diffusion of power can be twisted and compromised to suit his purposes he rejects the most fundamental of american values that our rights come from our creator and not from the government his rejection of that leads him to an expansive view of the federal government which permits it and thus him to right any wrong to regulate any behavior and to tax any event whether authorized by the constitution or not and to subordinate the individual to the state at every turn as a practical matter we are in for very difficult times during obama s second term obamacare is now here to stay so no matter who you are or how you pay your medical bills federal bureaucrats will direct your physicians in their treatment of you and they will see your medical records as well obama is committed to raising the debt of the federal government to 20 trillion so if the republican controlled house of representatives goes along with this as it did during obama s first term the cost will be close to 1 trillion in interest payments every year as well everyone s taxes will go up on new year s day as the bush era tax cuts will expire then the progressive vision of a populace dependent on a central government and a european style welfare state is now at hand though i argued during the campaign that this election was a hobson s choice between big government and bigger government and that regrettably it addressed how much private wealth the feds should seize and redistribute and how much private behavior they should regulate rather than whether the constitution permits them to do so and though i have argued that we have really one political party whose two branches mirror each other s wishes for war and power it is unsettling to find obama back in the white house for another four years that sinking feeling comes from the knowledge that he is free from the need to keep an eye on the electorate and from the terrible thought that he may be the authoritarian we have all known and feared would visit us one day and crush our personal freedoms
