connecticut post july 17 even at this late date four years after he launched his presidential campaign in a spasm of xenophobia there s a desire on the part of many americans to believe that racism from the president of the united states is something other than it appears to be surely he must have been misunderstood or taken out of context that desire rests on the notion that the country s highest office should be held by someone who seeks to unite people rather than divide them but there s no sugarcoating the latest round of ugliness president donald trump using the twitter feed that has long been his preferred method of communication made explicitly racist statements last weekend in attacking four women of color who serve in the u s house of representatives why don t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came he said referring to reps alexandria ocasio cortez d n y ilhan omar d minn rashida tlaib d mich and ayanna pressley d mass of the four only omar was not born in this country she was a somalian refugee who came to the united states with her family in the early 1990s she is every bit as american as any other citizen the other three were all born in the united states they aren t from anywhere other than this country pressley of massachusetts is not a child of immigrants or even a grandchild of immigrants but she is black the nonwhiteness of the four congresswomen is what sets them apart and provokes the president s ire and there is simply no question his statement was racist and sexist nothing he or his supporters have said since changes that fact he is saying that if you re black or hispanic no matter where you re born you re not really american sen chris murphy said it s just naked disgusting racism it s racist there s no other way to describe it said rep jahana hayes the fifth district democrat who last year became the first black woman to represent connecticut in congress rep jim himes who actually was born in another country made the same point unlike the democratic congresswomen trump attacked today i actually am a foreign born member of congress but i m a white male of european descent so there s no chance he ll attack me the fourth district congressman said rather than disbelief at the president s racism the real danger is becoming numb to it it s been a near constant barrage of divisive and hateful commentary from trump ever since he rose to prominence in national politics by questioning the citizenship of the nation s first black president that s why it s important to call his statements what they are hateful and racist the history of the united states on race relations is fraught but we must always attempt to be better than we have been unless we re willing to clearly condemn the indefensible no matter where it comes from we have no chance to move forward as a society online https bit ly 2xq6wxz massachusetts justice john paul stevens exemplified different era the republic of springfield july 18 after former supreme court justice john paul stevens died on tuesday media reports of his passing widely described him as the longtime leader of the high court s liberal wing this was true enough of course but for those not versed in the ins and outs of the high court over time it told only a small portion of the story one can imagine someone on the younger side an individual who knows a little about today s hyper partisan court assuming that stevens had been some sort of lifelong liberal undoubtedly having been named to the court by a democratic president the truth though is a very different story indeed stevens who lived to be 99 years old was named to the supreme court in 1975 by president gerald ford he was a moderate republican back in a time when such creatures still roamed the earth stevens was confirmed in the senate in december 1975 by a vote of 98 0 though stevens began his tenure on the high court as a sometime conservative he was no one s ideologue rather he often forged his own path but over the years as the supreme court moved rightward stevens slid to the left by his retirement in 2010 his transformation had been complete at a 2005 symposium at fordham university law school marking his 30th year on the supreme court and his 35th as a judge stevens said his change in attitude had come about naturally i know that i like most of my colleagues have continued to participate in a learning process while serving on the bench he said learning on the job is essential to the process of judging he added at the very least i know that learning on the bench has been one of the most important and rewarding aspects of my own experience over the last 35 years though one would hope that a current member of the supreme court might one day make a similar statement after a long tenure as a judge pointing to the natural learning process as having been responsible for his or her evolution such a wish seems little but fantasy at least at the moment imagine say either associate justice clarence thomas or sam alito each a dyed in the wool conservative who is about as immovable as the supreme court building itself changing over time and chalking his new stance up to having learned on the job don t hold your breath the supreme court that stevens left in 2010 was a far cry from the one he had joined in 1975 and not only because of the rightward shift it had undergone over those decades it had also become more predictable more ideological another partisan branch of our federal government perhaps no decision better summed up the changed landscape than the court s 5 4 ruling in the case that halted the recounting of votes in florida in the overtime 2000 election that pitted republican george w bush against democrat al gore that decision with the five conservative justices in the majority handed the keys to the oval office to bush in his dissent stevens wrote although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year s presidential election the identity of the loser is perfectly clear it is the nation s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of

friday amid growing questions about his handling of the case of jeffrey epstein the rich and well connected financier who pleaded guilty to prostitution charges a decade ago as the u s attorney in miami acosta agreed to a watered down plea deal and his office did not notify epstein s victims of the agreement questions have lingered about why a prosecutor would cooperate so much with a criminal like epstein and then new sex trafficking charges were brought against epstein last monday by federal prosecutors in new york they allege that dozens of girls some as young as 14 were brought to epstein s homes in new york and florida where they provided massages that progressed to sexual abuse including rape the girls were paid to recruit more girls to come to epstein s houses in this way epstein created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit often on a daily basis the u s attorney s office for the southern district of new york said in a news release faced with a similar indictment in florida in 2007 epstein accepted a plea agreement that kept the extent of his alleged crimes secret and mostly kept him out of prison he was allowed to serve his sentence in a private wing of the county jail and even then was allowed to leave jail up to 12 hours a day six days at week to work at his office a violation of sheriff s department rules that prohibited work release for sex offenders like epstein this is the deal that acosta defended and then resigned over it is also a deal that highlights how the legal system too often fails victims of sex crimes acosta s office wasn t alone in failing to ensure that epstein met the full consequences for his crimes in 2011 a prosecutor in the manhattan district attorney s office argued against the recommendation of the new york board of examiners of sex offenders that epstein should not have to register as a top level sex offender the prosecutor jennifer gaffney asked a judge to reduce epstein s sex offender status to the lowest possible classification the new york times reported this would have stopped him from being listed as a sex offender for life and would have limited publicly available information about him the request was denied as a registered sex offender epstein was required by law to report in person to the new york police department once a year and to notify the department of his address every 90 days failure to do so can result in jail time epstein did neither and the nypd did not enforce the requirements the new york post reported in fact epstein largely escaped scrutiny until the miami herald published a series of stories about his crimes last year investigative reporter julie k brown doggedly pursued his victims and law enforcement officials to build a detailed timeline of epstein s actions and how he avoided stronger legal penalties this is the story of how epstein bolstered by unlimited funds and represented by a powerhouse legal team was able to manipulate the criminal justice system and how his accusers still traumatized by their pasts believe they were betrayed by the very prosecutors who pledged to protect them brown wrote in the first story in the series called perversion of justice i don t think anyone has been told the truth about what jeffrey epstein did one of those accusers michelle licata now 30 said in the story he ruined my life and a lot of girls lives people need to know what he did and why he wasn t prosecuted so it never happens again licata s plea resonates well beyond the epstein case sexual assault is one of the most underreported crimes there are myriad reasons that victims don t come forward fear of not being believed is a significant one but so too is a belief that nothing will be done about it out of every 1 000 rapes only 310 are reported to police and of these only 57 lead to arrests according to department of justice figures of those arrests only 11 of the cases will be referred to prosecutors with only seven resulting felony convictions and only six perpetrators go on to serve time in jail in the face of these numbers it is even more distressing that prosecutors like acosta would cooperate with an abuser like epstein to so minimize the consequences of his crime our justice system must put the lives of victims ahead of those of perpetrators no matter how well connected they are online https bit ly 2lyj4oh new hampshire protecting vulnerable seniors from abuse foster s daily democrat july 13 by 2020 the u s census predicts 20 percent of new hampshire s 1 3 million residents will be 65 years or older up from 13 5 percent in 2010 notes cheryl steinberg director of new hampshire legal assistance s senior law project while there are many reasons to cheer this increased longevity it also brings with it some challenges that need to be addressed a bill passed by both the house and senate and awaiting gov chris sununu s signature addresses one of those challenges the financial exploitation and abuse of senior citizens especially those who are most vulnerable due to physical or mental impairment such as alzheimer s disease which affects more than 25 000 men and women in the state state rep renny cushing d hampton is the prime sponsor of house bill 696 which gives seniors who believe they are being financially exploited the ability to receive emergency legal protection while the courts sort out the facts of the case that emergency relief includes ordering someone to stop taking a senior s property against their wishes in 2014 recognizing the financial exploitation of seniors was a growing problem the legislature created criminal laws so that those who took advantage of seniors can be prosecuted unfortunately while these laws are sometimes able to get justice after the fact they do not empower police the courts and other protective agencies to stop the exploitation before damage has been done cushing s bill hb 696 does just that as steinberg explained in a letter to the house criminal justice committee which cushing chairs while criminal prosecution is vitally important in combating financial exploitation and other forms of abuse it does not give the victim the opportunity to take immediate action to stop the abuse preserve assets or recoup damages incurred from abuse in this same letter steinberg notes the bill has been supported by a wide range of stakeholders including the new hampshire attorney general s office aarp nh the alzheimer s association the nh bankers association the nh chapter of the national academy of elder law attorneys and the disability rights center nh when someone has been financially exploited their money is gone and it is very difficult to get it back said douglas mcnutt associate state director of aarp nh as this bill provides a mechanism to quickly stop the abuse hb 696 will be a significant tool to protect against financial exploitation and preserve people s independence cushing steinberg and portsmouth police detective rochelle jones visited our editorial board this week to explain the importance of the bill in the face of a misinformation campaign by those who are trying to frame it as a gun confiscation bill the bill is an essential new tool to help strengthen our state s response to this ever growing problem said detective jones who also serves as the portsmouth pd s senior services liaison it is our duty as a community to protect those who cannot protect themselves for the record house bill 696 is not a gun confiscation bill and there is not united opposition to the bill among second amendment rights groups in the state in fact the bill does not even mention guns a reference was removed at the request of gun rights stakeholders we urge gov sununu to ignore the politically motivated distortions about the bill and to focus on the facts of the very real protections it will provide to our vulnerable seniors we urge gov sununu to sign house bill 696 rep cushing put it well the governor cares about vulnerable people by passage of this bill it takes a large step forward to making sure that our elderly and vulnerable population is not exploited online https bit ly 2lpjycx rhode island stealing from u s companies the providence journal july 13 the united states has entered a trade war with china a communist dictatorship that uses unfair trade practices to help create an enormous trade imbalance with america president trump announced that last year s tariff of 10 on chinese goods roughly about 200 billion would increase to 25 in may he also initiated an executive order banning u s companies from using telecommunications equipment made by sources potentially posing a national security threat specifically targeting china s huawei technologies in retaliation mr xi announced in june an increase of tariffs on 60 billion worth of u s goods it is obvious that china greatly needs trade with the united states to sustain its economic growth and build up its military a deal of some sort is thus probably coming but the administration must do more than wildly exaggerate the virtues of any agreement something mr trump is prone to do it is vital to the future of u s businesses that it actually use this process to pressure china to reform its business practices a july 3 story by tom benning of the dallas morning news offers one of countless examples of what american firms are up against hks a large architecture firm in dallas won a high profile competition to design the centerpiece of the 2014 international horticultural expo in qingdao this is a coastal city in china with more than 9 million residents for a time hks tried to work out the required financial deal with qingdao officials then abruptly the chinese officials cut off negotiations without explanation or compensation but that was not the end of the story the expo went on as planned but with a striking inclusion according to ralph hawkins hks s then chairman emeritus the venue featured a pale facsimile ripped off by a local design institute of the firm s plans for a striking conservatory filled with lush biomes the chinese city effectively stole the designs without paying for them there s nothing we can do mr hawkins explained the company had made money working in china in the past but every attempt carries a serious risk the lack of rule of law means that american businesses basically have no recourse against anybody lance josal a dallasite who once worked for mr hawkins and recently retired as ceo of the international architecture firm callisonrtkl agrees that happens all the time mr josal said his company had three offices in china and said that while doing business can be lucrative and very successful the rules in china can be manipulated or broken mr hawkins who retired in 2014 supports the president s efforts to change the way u s companies do business with china in the long term if the tariffs could bring us to the table to negotiate some of these items everybody would be for it believe me he told the dallas morning news because it is unfair trade wars are fraught with peril they can damage u s industries and consumers that depend on cheap goods from overseas free trade is better than government interference in a market but the u s market remains an extremely important one for other countries for years china has been taking advantage of america particularly in stealing the intellectual property of u s companies that has damaged our economy badly we hope the ongoing struggles with china will help create a more level playing field and fairer

remaining silent on president donald j trump s most recent open display of racism and misogyny it s been mindboggling to see some supporting his hateful words with that in mind gov phil scott s public rebuke of trump on wednesday is welcome even if he stopped short of taking his criticism to its logical conclusion and leaving the party trump speaking of u s reps ilhan omar d minn alexandria ocasio cortez d n y rashida tlaib d mich and ayanna pressley d mass said sunday on twitter that the four congresswomen of color originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe and they should go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came five days later scott at his media availability at the statehouse spoke out i find these statements offensive racist and certainly not what we expect from the leader of the greatest country in the world scott said words matter and we ve seen the same rhetoric used throughout history to discriminate degrade and divide i m not trying to lead the gop on this i m trying to stand up for what i believe he added i think we all have an obligation to step up and call it out for what it is scott joins maryland gov larry hogan and massachusetts gov charlie baker both republicans in criticizing trump s statements trump s tweets represented an historic low moment for the presidency but that did not stand long as his new low trump then turned his full focus on rep omar who came to this nation as a refugee from somalia when she was 6 years old rep omar was freely elected by the voters of the minnesota 5th congressional district with 78 percent of the vote in the general election whether she represents that district in congress is the voters decision and no one else s but rep omar does not agree with trump on anything trump ever the narcissist conflates opposition to his policies to a lack of patriotism he s gotten his minions to go along with that misguided logic and rep omar is black a woman and a muslim making her in trump s eyes a target as if on cue following trump s wild accusatory rant against omar on wednesday night in greensboro n c a crowd of his followers chanted send her back it was as ugly a moment as american politics have ever seen two years ago when trump was a candidate for the republican nomination party members called him out for bigoted comments now there is largely silence and it is deafening very few republicans have been willing to publicly distance themselves from trump to his credit scott has been among those willing to do so most notably when he signed gun safety legislation in 2018 but he equivocated somewhat when asked if trump is a racist i don t know him well enough to know whether they were racist and that s the way he feels scott said but again does it really matter the words are there so whether it s something he believes or something that he s using for a politically strategy both are equally bad from my standpoint it would have been better if scott stated the obvious that trump is indeed a racist a fact proven by his words and deeds and declared himself an independent the republican party has no credible mandate to lead this country so long as is misled by a race baiting bully there s no reason why scott should wait for the next outrage perhaps it s time for him and for all vermont republicans who see trump for who and what he is to abandon ship and chart a better course for themselves as a group but this cannot begin and end with scott it s up to every other vermont republican from town committees to state representatives and senators and party leaders to follow the governor s example and stand for the principles of equality upon which vermont was founded vermont voters will surely remember next
