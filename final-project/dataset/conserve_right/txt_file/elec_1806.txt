people from what i ve read on the subject high speed trains are big energy hogs and aren t really any more efficient or environmentally friendly than flying we re trying to save the planet here zeb you can t let yourself get distracted by facts and logic focus on the willingness to sacrifice and your faith in the experts and eventually it ll all start to make sense hey when all the cool kids seattle denver et al have one you gotta have one too no matter how much it costs or how many people actually use it europe japan has them and these people took a vacation once and they were great and fun so we need them regardless of anything else i m pretty sure that s what it s really all about those europeans are just so cool and with it european rail is really hit or miss if you go to italy you ll understand why making the trains run on time was such a big deal it s become abundantly clear that just as europeans have no clue about how large the us is americans too have no idea just how small europe is my grandpappy had to learn real fast i assumed europe was quite large it took my dad and some of his buddies nearly 2 years just to travel from one end of italy to the other of course they were using tanks instead of high speed rail and there were all those german tourists clogging up traffic but that s still a long trip they would ve made it faster except mark clark was a stupid fuck americans too have no idea just how small europe is this partly it s perception it seems the opposite because small distances seem very large to europeans vs americans and vice versa i once nearly caused several english people to faint by declaring my intent to drive from manchester to bath in one day it can take like three hours and when you get there the place is full of those weird southerners unfortunately it s not just europe that americans don t understand the vastness of most americans by number live within spitting distance of a shoreline ocean great lake or gulf of mexico and have never ventured inland trains are great when the distance is a few tens or maybe a couple hundred miles and when the population densities are mindnumbingly high but let the population density drop to a reasonable number a few score per sq mile and it doesn t work financially like it or not if we re going to inhabit a country this big and move around even a bit we re gonna be using personal cars i ve ridden on those trains in europe very nice they re quite proud of them they should be but they ain t cheap even with massive subsidies and unless it s an express from paris to vienna stopping only in bern and salzburg all the speed in the world doesn t matter station stops however brief are real time killers trains are great when the distance is a few tens or maybe a couple hundred miles and when the population densities are mindnumbingly high but let the population density drop to a reasonable number this is simply untrue there is no passenger rail system anywhere in the world that can cover it s operating expenses entirely from passenger fares passenger rail can t function without constant government subsidies there is no passenger rail system anywhere in the world that can cover it s operating expenses entirely from passenger fares groundtruth never made an argument that it could and it doesn t work financially but they ain t cheap even with massive subsidies he made the comment that trains a great under certain conditions i they can t operate economically without subsidies excluding capital costs then they aren t great are you familiar with the history of the united states railroads were instrumental in the development of countless towns cities to imply you can t inhabit a country this big without personal cars makes no sense at all totalitarian control best practice to control a population is to abolish private ownership of cars transportation and guns and or self defense more public transportation will push people away from privately methods of transportation this helps the progtards control the movements of the little people aren t really any more efficient or environmentally friendly than flying it s worse than that passenger trains aren t even competitive with cars for energy efficiency even on a per passenger mile basis while accusing a democratic candidate for president of being a socialist for reasons other than supporting the green new deal is entirely possible i don t think a candidate can support the green new deal without at the very least being open to socialist programs this article breaks down the democrat candidates by their level of support for the green new deal as following co sponsors of the green new deal bernie sanders cory booker kamala harris elizabeth warren amy klobuchar kristin gillibrand supporters of the green new deal john delaney jay inslee beto o rourke wants to spend 5 trillion on climate change and be carbon neutral by 2050 instead of just in ten years far as i m concerned if stalin s 5 year plan had been a 15 year plan it still would have been socialist https www axios com 2020 presidential candidates green new deal 22faff60 3fee 45f3 8636 09e437c82431 html joe biden declared himself for president after that article was published he s since announced a green new deal plan of his own so i d put him in at least the supporters list adding up the support for each of those candidates you get north of 80 support from democrats for green new deal candidates surely some of the undecided vote can t decide which green new deal candidate they like best and we haven t started adding in democrats who support medicare for all democrats who support their idea of a universal basic income etc they re a bunch of fucking socialists and i d rather vote for the devil something tells me that very few of them have any real intentions of doing much if any of that stuff but it is absolutely terrifying that it gets taken seriously at all by anyone that s what they said about obamacare right up until the day it passed suderman was sure it wouldn t that s what they always say about socialists too they aren t really doing to do that stuff one of the problems with socialism is that once you start going down that route it s difficult or impossible to stop the same things always happen for the same reasons once you decide to set the price of food or electricity below the cost of production you can pull back as production slides to the level of reimbursement but if you don t do that right away eventually you have to start throwing the producers in jail or nationalizing things during the electricity crisis in california gray davis threatened to throw pg e executives in prison if they stopped producing electricity luckily california saw the light and pulled back from nationalizing that stuff when chavez did the same thing with food instead of pulling back he felt like he had to go through with it the more he nationalized the worse it got but he wasn t in a position any different from when the bolsheviks took over or when castro took over cuba you don t get to choose anything other than nationalization and authoritarianism once things go south because of your socialist program if you do you end up out of power and once you re in a position of power after a revolution there are few retired revolutionaries when maduro falls from power he either ends up in a foreign country like idi amin or he ends up like ceausescu few of the socialist revolutionaries after pol pot really think they re going to the wall to transform society but you don t need to think it s going to be that way when you begin you just need to get the ball rolling and once you make the decision to keep going past a certain point all the rest of your decisions are more or less made for you dread those first steps the rest of them will be made on autopilot look at how deeply unpopular truman was because of the end of wartime price controls his decision to pull the rug out from under his own popularity may have been tougher for someone in power than the decision on whether to wipe out the civilians of hiroshima and nagasaki doing the hard thing to undermine their own power that s not what people in power usually do on purpose its official in every single poll and metric they are marxists https fivethirtyeight com features the young lefts anti capitalist manifesto zeb california is now instituting a state mandate for health insurance under the aca which will go towards illegal immigrant healthcare colorado will introduce an abolish tabor constitutional amendment question in november the intentions are real hey obama said aca wouldn t benefit illegals don t forget to account for those democratic voters who would vote for the worst possible democratic candidate they can imagine just because republicans evil people here may think i m a republican shill but the worst republican to run in my lifetime mccain did not come close to securing my vote that would never happen didn t vote for obama either i just threw away my vote on whatever loser the lp ran i think it was barr and here s why we don t need high speed rail of airports by country china 463 european union 1 882 india 253 russia 594 usa 5 054 compared to other countries with large land masses we re the only one build around aviation to tear it down and rebuild a rail based country is as ridiculous as it is mindless airports by country what s the hold up for electrically powered commuter aircraft is it the charging times for batteries is it weight of the batteries is it the lack of competition in the industry they can put a tesla in orbit but they can t build a hybrid commercial airplane combustion keeps going in a lightning strike weight is a huge one so you can only have so much battery capacity on board which means range is pathetic even at more efficient slow low power settings charging time would be too long for anything that needs a turn around time of less than an overnight pit stop and the batteries still do catch on fire way too often from overcharging improper cell balancing minor damage overheating etc on the non technical side the aviation world in general moves at a snail s pace and everything costs way above the cost of development production thanks to faa certification regulations the insurance industry and parasite lawyers suing aviation manufacturers into the ground in theory you could just have enough battery power to reach a decent altitude and run for the rest of the over land flight using beamed power via microwaves while recharging the battery for the landing but you d lose all flexibility that way you d be stuck using defined flight corridors with expensive infrastructure unless the microwave beamer was located in orbit which for a long time will be even more expensive basically batteries are always going to be less energy dense than fuel because you have to carry around both ends of the chemical reaction not just one end though metal air batteries have the potential to change that if they ever get them working well they can put a tesla in orbit but they can t build a hybrid commercial airplane the rocket that put it in orbit was internal combustion and not by accident the rocket that put it in orbit was internal combustion and not by accident actually it was an external combustion oxy kerosene engine what s the hold up for electrically powered commuter aircraft the energy density of current batteries is still quite a bit less than gasoline even more so for jet fuel battery technology is improving daily however what s the hold up for electrically powered commuter aircraft the unavailability of fusion reactors that are both small enough to fit on an aircraft and large enough to generate sufficient power to run the aircraft seriously it might be possible to build a small 4 seat single engine bush plain that s all electric and has a decent range but there is no way you get to commercially viable passenger plains on batteries 7 upgrading all existing buildings in the united states and building new buildings to achieve maximal energy efficiency water efficiency safety affordability comfort and durability including through electrification these people are fucking regarded if they think all of that is possible never mind the rest of it it s not supposed to be possible it s supposed to enable the government take over of everything look even if democrats fully embrace socialism we koch reason libertarians should still support them because we stand for immigrationaboveall and the republicans have been taken over by alt right white nationalists open borders socialists anti immigration capitalists votedemocratforopenborders i remember back when democrats took the label socialism as a smear those were the days the problem is that there s no way to know how socialist programs will end up before you enact them yeah we ve seen what happened in the ussr china cuba venezuela but that s different because bernie sanders liz warren and other democrats well they really care about people maduro doesn t and that s ultimately why people are fleeing venezuela are fleeing by the millions and those who stay behind are suffering from malnutrition have we really seen what socialism can do with a woman like liz warren in charge so anyway that s the problem we have to pass socialism to see what s in it i m definitely becoming a prepper used to think those people were all crackpots but that was before princess lizawatha and her ilk took the stage now i m pretty certain we re all gonna starve to death well within the 10 year doomsday timetable the reason the framers thought we might need the second amendment right to keep our powder dry was not because they were against crime or big on hunting and target shooting they had to fight a revolution like that themselves they really knew what they were doing i was in la during the riots in 1992 1 100 buildings were burned and koreans were targeted specifically when you see the left dehumanizing people especially it s really disturbing whether they intend to or not they re painting the opposition as white racist homophobic misogynistic rapists who want to destroy the very earth with their selfishness and capitalist ideology if present trends continue this isn t likely to end well but the good news is that these trends haven t continued in the past generation y is fleeing the inner cities for the suburbs like their white flight grandparents did this wouldn t be the first generation that became more conservative and less socialist as they got older plenty of the hippies turned into yuppies wasn t it churchill who said that if you aren t a socialist when you re young you don t have a heart and if you don t become more conservative as you get older then you don t have a brain we ve been through this before the cost of freedom is eternal vigilance though i hope we never need to use the second amendment for its intended purpose but that need for eternal vigilance will always be present that s why cromwell told his men to have faith in god but to keep their powder dry we may live to seem some incidents but we saw worse than this in the early 70s the socialists were a bigger threat than this during the great depression and before it too hope for the best plan for the worst gosh i even remember when democrats weren t actively opposed to property ownership and capital accumulation they really aren t now at least not for themselves you nah you don t qualify nowadays they insist that appending the word democratic to socialism cleanses it of ill effect it s sort of like an overeater who cleans out a buffet table but insists that it s okay because he washed it down with a diet soda you know what else was democratic https en wikipedia org wiki popular sovereignty 1850s national socialist german workers party it just proves that the democrat party must go it is nothing but a clearinghouse for marxism subversion and at times outright treasonous behavior the sooner it goes and we deal with the enemy within the better the democrats aren t socialist enough they need to be much more open about their dreams of re education camps gulags firing squads a complete redistribution of wealth choosing the right dictator ration stores etc instead of keeping silent about these wonderful ideas that have proven successful down through the decades in other socialist paradises like cuba north korea and venezuela so be honest and show your true socialist colors democrats if you want even more idiots to vote for you in the next election proven successful down through the decades in other socialist paradises like cuba north korea and venezuela no not successful these socialist states never went all in in wiping out the kulaks and wreckers therefore their socialist paradises have failed only those who truly care for people can be trusted to liquidate all those who get in the way of creating the soviet man the awesomeness of bob dylan sorta documentary not likely come now is there a musician who s been as under appreciated as dylan sixto

now you re talking take me some frog galliard any day g g allin how socialist are the democrats a fair amount a fair and equal amount some animals are more equal than others democratic socialist reminds me of the general example of democracy being two wolves and sheep voting of what to have for lunch and that s just democracy or buttplug pedo jeffy and a 10 year old voting on rape laws democracy two wolves and a sheep voting on what s for lunch democratic socialism two wolves a lion and a sheep voting on how to divide lunch among them how socialist are democrats lol there s been one mainstream socialist democrat in basically the history of this country the great irony is that if democrats were half as liberal as the right likes to pretend they d actually win elections it s disheartening to me that a group of people so concerned with the deficit almost completely ignore the substance of tulsi gabbard s platform instead of discussing principles or policy we have matt uh uh welch promoting a smear peice to discredit her religious choice that s why he says we should read past the headline tulsi is the only presidential candidate to publicly state she would stop wasteful regime change wars she s the only candidate on record that she would not prosecute whistle blowers and would pardon julian assange and edward snowden now i don t agree with a lot of her policies but endless wars and 1st amendment protections should be major issues for libertarians that need to be discussed openly i expected more from reason i was suspect after their half assed reporting on venezuela but after listening to this podcast dedicated to disseminating democratic candidates they ve proved they re establishment boot lickers just like the rest of mainstream media if
