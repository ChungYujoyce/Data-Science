 thoughts on last night 1 on policy substance ideology aside hillary clinton was more informed and prepared than donald trump by a wide margin as expected she also remained mostly cool and collected even as the debate threatened to veer off the rails on several occasions she was smug rehearsed and pedantic at times and exhibited some breathtaking hypocrisy yes let s hear some more about the importance of data security madame email scandal but my instinct is that she won this exchange overall she did so over the last hour plus of the debate pulling away after trump held his own early he may have been a little heavy on the interruption over that opening stretch for someone with atemperament problem but he hit his central themes hard and pretty effectively when clinton went on offense over tax returns the federal race discrimination lawsuit against trump s company and birtherism his responses were woefully insufficient despite some flashes of decent parrying like highlighting her deleted emails and noting her 2008 campaign s scurrilous anti obama tactics she won because she baited him and he took the bait every time missing far too many chances to land obvious thematic and specific counter punches on emails on the clinton foundation on benghazi rarely did he put her on the defensive which isn t especiallyhard to do his lack of focused preparation was once again quite clear 2 poor debate performances temper flare ups and manifest ignorance occasionally dented trump during the primary but he always prevailed in the end my instinct is that this night hurt him and helped her but my instinct also told me more than a year ago that he was an unserious candidate with no chance which was wrong and quickly abandoned as a working theory last summer we will not have any solid grasp on how the public felt about this debate until a full round of solid scientific polling is conducting which will take several days in the meantime here is whatcbs news focus group

bombastic sloppy unanswered questions clinton firm same old knowledgeable afterimpressing in the early stages some of his worst moments with this panel of undecided pennsylvania voters involvedbirtherism tax returns andtemperament did he come across as a plausible president for 90 minutes we ll see what the voters say i have my doubts then again i m not convinced his performance was as disastrous as many talking heads are alreadysaying as trump pointed out several times over the course of the night mrs clinton has prosecuted many of these lines of attack against him in a massive bombardment of paid advertising spreadover many weeks her standinghas fallen did swing voters learn anything negative tonight that they didn t already know if trump takes a polling hit and he might it ll be because he failed the plausibility test among people who ve been giving him a chance so far 3 the debate over the moderator began before the evening concluded lester holt did a fine job for most of the evening not intervening too often and using a light touch to allow the candidates engage each other some trumpsupporters and surrogates believe his tougher questions and challenges were directed at their man and not hillary clinton they re right on birtherism a legitimate question on which trump did himself no favors on his withholding of tax returns on his iraq war record on say it to her face and even on the will you respect the election s outcome question the sharper push back and skeptical premises all went in one direction off the top of my head i can t recall a single question slanted againsther statements or record i won t be surprised if voters at the town hall style debate prod her with harder questions than holt did so while he wasn t horribly biased it seems clear that holt took note of the left sover the topoutcry against his nbc colleague matt lauer and overcompensated working the refs works for democrats 4 i saw a fair amount ofthis type of analysis immediately after the debate and i think it s wrong trump going to the spin room is a sign he knows he lost the debate by a large margin that would be true of a conventional candidate in a conventional year but this is donald trump and we re living through 2016 trump personally rolling into the spin room after a debate isn t an indication of much of anything other than the fact that he floods the media zone whenever possible he did this in the primary he s doing it again in the general and he s pummeling away at his message every chance he gets it s that simple i think 5 an incompletehodgepodge of memorable moments for trump his refrain about hillary embodying the same old disappointing under performing system broke through early he turned her experience argument against her twice first when she stated that she d thought about a lot of issues he shot back yeah for 30 years and toward the end of the debate after her strong stamina line he recovered with hillary has experience but it s bad experience meanwhile clinton s ad makers will be busy when she attacked trump for rooting for the housing crash in order to make money he didn t deny it it s called business he boasted when she speculated that he hasn t turned over his tax returns which he later conceded he could do against his lawyers advice because he s avoided paying any income taxes he appeared to confirm her suspicion that s smart he said but again i ask will moreseemingly devastating adsmatter at all and when he was making a case against president obama s record at one point he gestured at hillary and referred to obama as your president i m fairly confident he meant your party your administration but democrats pounced all over it as a racial code word it will almost certainly be used to motivate black voters finally anothersolid clean hit for her was admitting to have prepared for the debate as well as for the job she s seeking the implication about trump in that well delivered likely also prepared ironically soundbyte was obvious it was a very unusual debate which was always going to be the case to my real time eyes and ears in the moment she won despite not making much any headway on likability but hey given the insanity and throw out the rulebook vibe of this entire cycle what do i know let s see how and if the polls move my gut says that they will a bit toward her but there s a reasonable chance that they won t or that any impact will be short lived update various quasi scientific flash polls distinct from unscientific online polls show aclinton win ofvarying
