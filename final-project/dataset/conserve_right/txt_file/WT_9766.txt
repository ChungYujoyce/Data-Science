take any questions the spokesman who declined to be identified in line with internal regulations said he did not know why no questions would be taken rousseff unlike her charismatic predecessor silva

seemed uncomfortable in public and was criticized for a mechanical speaking style the trip comes as china has surpassed the united states as brazil s top trading partner and in the wake of recent discoveries of vast oil reserves off the brazilian coast the reserves estimated at between 30 billion and 80 billion barrels place brazil in the top 10 countries in the world in reserves since brazil
