apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap china s surprising suspension of north korean coal imports puts pressure not only on pyongyang but also on president donald trump the question for him should the u s respond with new north korea negotiations years of failed efforts to stem north korea s nuclear and missile programs have followed a usual pattern the united states seeks tougher action from china the north s traditional ally beijing urges u s diplomatic engagement but china s move this weekend appears to change the dynamic addressing the long standing american demand one trump has vociferously repeated if enforced the loss of coal revenue could tighten the screws on leader kim jong un after his government s acceleration of nuclear and missile tests this last year top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed china rarely makes concessions for free and will want trump to respond in kind if china is squeezing north korea it is for one purpose and one purpose only to offer a cooperative gesture to the incoming trump administration in return for an initiative on negotiations said stephan haggard a north korea expert at the university of california san diego beijing indicated such a strategy was in play foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said the country wants parallel negotiations on nuclear matters and a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice ending the 1950 53 korean war a longstanding north korean request washington has said the north s nuclear weapons program must be settled first meanwhile the newspaper of china s ruling communist party global times published a pair of editorials wednesday calling for aid for disarmament talks to restart they ve been on ice since 2009 any breakthrough would almost surely require u s chinese cooperation kim has shown little interest in relinquishing his nation s nuclear deterrent as he closes in on a weapon capable of targeting mainland america and sino american disputes over the best approach to dealing with the confounding north korean leader have hamstrung international diplomatic efforts we continue to urge china to exert its unique leverage as north korea s largest trading partner to convince pyongyang to return to serious talks on denuclearization state department spokeswoman anna richey allen said trump has vowed to deal with north korea without saying how his administration is conducting a broad ranging policy review including how to make sanctions bite negotiations haven t been ruled out said a u s official who wasn t authorized to discuss internal deliberations and demanded anonymity china s decision on coal could change the u s calculus a second administration official described it as a potentially hopeful sign though the u s was still gauging the significance north korea s coal exports to china totaled 1 2 billion last year according to chinese customs representing more than a third of the north s total export income geng the chinese spokesman explained china s decision by saying the coal imports this year already approximated a 400 million annual cap set by the u n security council but china has exploited loopholes in the past raising questions about alternative motivations these could include embarrassment over the apparent assassination of kim jong nam the north korean leader s exiled half brother who was spending much of his time in china or a pre emptive effort to forestall a new u s south korean missile defense system regardless of motive enforcement will be the key said joseph dethomas a former u s diplomat who advised the obama administration on sanctions dethomas now a professor at pennsylvania state university said china s suspension could cost pyongyang hundreds of millions of dollars in much needed hard currency but troy stangarone senior director at the washington based korea economic institute questioned how significant the economic impact would be official chinese figures don t account for services and illicit border trade between the countries he said china has long resisted applying severe economic pressure on north korea while it opposes the north s pursuit of nuclear weapons beijing fears any policies that might lead to an influx of north koreans into china or a u s allied unified korea emerging on the chinese border in any case questions will now be asked of the trump administration as a presidential candidate trump expressed a willingness to speak with kim a politically risky move given north korea s history of reneging on past agreements president barack obama refused to re engage without a commitment from the north to pursue denuclearization cranking up sanctions while waiting the approach failed to stop pyongyang s rapid advances in weapons development trump will need to come up with a strategy soon a high profile north korean defector reported that kim wants to finish an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the u s mainland in the next year it s unclear what if anything trump can offer kim to bargain over a nuclear program he likely sees as essential to the survival of his totalitarian regime stangarone said the question for kim becomes this can he weather whatever storm is coming and finish the program and make this fait accompli editor s note matthew pennington has covered asian affairs for the associated press since
