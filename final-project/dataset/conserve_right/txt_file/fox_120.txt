panel about biden aposs strategy all right now on fox news sunday end videotape hemmer and hello again from fox news in washington it aposs been a busy august recess so far for the president and for members of congress the nation aposs political leaders facing calls to do something in the wake of last weekend aposs mass shootings in el paso and dayton ohio but the politics of gun control are complicated and the stakes are even higher heading into the election of 2020 we will get to all of that in a moment when we speak exclusively with white house counselor kellyanne conway but first the stunning news of jeffrey epstein the rich and politically connected financier found dead in his jail cell this weekend kristin fisher has the latest on that here in washington kristin kristin fisher correspondent bill the department of justice says jeffrey epstein died of an apparent suicide but several politicians including president trump are floating unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that epstein was killed or at least had help begin videotape fisher just hours after jeffrey epstein was found dead inside his new york jail cell president trump retweeted a post implying former president bill clinton was linked to epstein aposs death with the clintonbodycount the post also referenced the trumpbodycount that was trending as well the president and former president knew epstein and had flown on his private planes but both deny any knowledge of epstein aposs alleged international sex trafficking ring involving underage girls prosecutors say the case will continue despite epstein aposs death while an attorney for epstein aposs accuser says his clients are shocked spencer kuvin attorney representing epstein accusers we find it very hard to believe that he would be allowed to commit suicide especially when he was on suicide watch from just a few days ago fisher epstein aposs death comes less than 24 hours after court documents were unsealed implicating several powerful men including former met new mexico governor bill richardson former senate majority leader george mitchell and britain aposs prince andrew attorney general bill barr says he was appalled by epstein aposs death and that it raises serious questions that must be answered a furious republican senator ben sasse told barr that epstein quote should have been locked in a padded room during unbroken 24 hour constant surveillance obviously heads must roll end videotape fisher the fbi and justice department aposs inspector general are now investigating but will the public believe whatever those investigations dig up with this many conspiracy theories being floated by people as prominent as the president of the united states bill hemmer what a story kristin thank you here in washington joining us now counselor to the president kellyanne conway and kellyanne welcome back to fox news sunday kellyanne conway counselor to president trump good morning bill hemmer i have a number of issues to get through first on epstein can you assure the accusers that their claims will still be pursued conway what i can assure them is that the attorney general took action immediately when he learned of the death of jeffrey epstein and there will be there is an active investigation i can apost really comment on that any further and i think that those victims should have justice and they aposve been looking for justice for many many years and i really can apost comment beyond that i think that this is the ultimate macabre final episode to a man who clearly was an evil monster doing terrible things to young girls hemmer why then the president then retweet that clinton suggestion conway i think the president just wants everything to be investigated as you as your reporter just revealed just the day before there was some unsealed information implicating some people very high up and i aposm not going to repeat their names you already did that i aposm not seeing anything beyond that and i won apost but i will say bill that there aposs always this rush to we need transparency we need accountability when it involves fictional accusations like collusion with russia to swing an election this seems to be very concrete and that jeffrey epstein has done some very bad things over a number of years and so let aposs continue to investigate that i don apost think that somebody aposs on ph crimes and accountability for that necessarily perishes with them we know that the law can allow for many different investigations maybe there are co conspirators maybe there are not but again it aposs an active investigation i think everybody should be at least relieved when an attorney general takes the action swiftly as attorney general barr did yesterday and he aposs disturbed by this death hemmer ok let aposs see where that goes crosstalk conway and let aposs see where it goes it aposs really new this all happened within the last 24 to 28 hours hemmer understood and we should go slow with this just back on the retweet quickly it aposs clear what he was trying to say wasn apost it conway i think the president just wants everything to be investigated and you know trying to connect the president to this monster from years ago where they are seen dancing in the video versus other people who were actively i suppose flying around with this monster on his island which was known as pedophilia island perhaps there aposs a public interest in knowing more about that but again this is all speculative and it aposs not for me to go further than where the doj and the fbi are right now but you do hear different people asking questions and they want to know who else was involved in epstein aposs crimes or even just activities and and i guess that that will be revealed in time hemmer ok let aposs move to guns in america what a week it was the president said this on friday at the white house begin video clip trump i think i have a greater influence now over the senate and over the house i think we can get something really good done i think we can have some really meaningful background checks end video clip hemmer the first part about that comment where he says i have greater influence over the house and the senate what is his plan to influence to use that influence now kellyanne conway well the president has been actively talking to republicans and democrats on the matter of background checks and just being able to have meaningful measurable reforms that don apost confiscate law abiding citizens apos firearms without due process but at the same time keep those firearms out of people who have a propensity towards violence you know when the president signed into law fix nics in march of 2018 that was a big deal because fix nics would have prevented those stronger background checks and data information sharing between federal and state authorities would have prevented sutherland springs charleston south carolina any number of these mass shootings where these people have felony charges they should not have been able to procure a firearm and so this president signed into law something that was not done by the previous administration i know you aposre going to have congressman ryan on later ask them why no legislation of any import was presented by speaker pelosi and the democrats when president obama was inaudible when they had a veto proof majority in the senate they could have passed things and they did not crosstalk hemmer but perhaps we get to that ph with congress congressman ryan ph but just to factor the question about the president he also said on friday that mitch mcconnell is quote totally on board now in a radio interview on board mitch mcconnell said this in his hometown begin audio clip sen mitch mcconnell r ky the president called me this morning about this he aposs anxious to get an outcome and so am i we aposll be front and center as we see what we can come together on and passed end audio clip hemmer what he talked about were background checks and red flags but yet friday republican senator john barrasso was quoted with reporters saying this he said i aposve got a lot of concerns about the due process component of red flag laws i don apost want to punish law abiding citizens that aposs the that aposs the number three republican in the senate so then how was the party on board kellyanne conway that aposs all reconcilable it aposs exactly what i just said we want to make sure that people who should not have firearms don apost and i think the fact pattern in dayton that man aposs shooter who is now dead is really very compelling to many americans bill in that they say how in to vote for somebody who has a rape list for girls a kill list for boys a history in high school where some of his classmates schoolmates were afraid to come to school that then when he becomes an adult that information does not follow into his record so that he legally procures a firearm so most people look at that right left and center and apolitical look at that and say how can this happen so i mean the fbi is very focused on domestic terrorism they aposre very focused on mass shooting they aposre very focused on information analytics technology to help them but that has to go across federal state and local law enforcement so they can share more information we can protect people aposs civil liberties privacy constitutional rights and public safety all at the right time but i predict that this president president trump is the president who will get this done hemmer ok he has suggested something conway he will have more meaningful measurable background checks hemmer he suggested things in the past on background checks and then reversed himself too kellyanne conway no look we aposve got republican senators publicly saying they are for some type of background checks now that aposs rob portman of ohio susan collins of maine lamar alexander of tennessee mike braun of indiana you aposre talking about members of the republican senate who have come forward and say let aposs take a look at this you know that chairman graham lindsey graham and dick blumenthal of connecticut had these red flag laws we had to take a look at what the final product is we aposre looking at that the fix nics violation is being put forward i believe by toomey coons the democratic senator of delaware who aposs endorsed joe biden crosstalk hemmer there have been there have been many violations too on that yes conway you know this this well that aposs right but the fix nics is important because there actually would have stopped it should have stopped some of these mass shooters in the past but you know this president did what presidents do he went and he visited the victims he went and thanked law enforcement and health professionals he talked to many of the survivors many of the victims apos families he and the first lady expressed their condolences he aposs tried to heal a nation he came out monday morning and in no uncertain unequivocal terms denounced hate bigotry racism and yes white supremacy and he will continue to do that hemmer ok conway but you know when people say do something we need to do something that aposs meaningful that will stop these mass shootings hemmer understood and let aposs see what we get done crosstalk conway not something that makes everybody feel better but what makes us all safer hemmer two minutes two topics north korea the president said he received a letter a three page letter from chairman kim said that on friday tweeted this on saturday it was a small apology for testing short range missiles and that this testing would stop when the exercises ended i look forward to seeing kim jong un in the not too distant future he aposs tested missiles five times in two weeks why would you entertain the idea of meeting with him conway because the president has made very clear he would like there to be denuclearization of the korean peninsula it was former president obama who told president elect trump north korea will be your most vexing challenging issue so this president dove in from the very beginning he aposs met with kim a few times he has sanctions going on in korea everything in north korea everything stays the same there are sanctions in place until we see irreversible verifiable complete denuclearization and we don apost see that yet but some of these short range missile tests also i aposm informed by our nsc do not violate the singapore agreement and the president has made talk about transparency and accountability tweeted out that after to the south korea exercises are over are completed that he and kim can get back to the negotiation table this president has also dangled in front of kim a more economically prosperous more free north korea for his people so that aposs up to kim hemmer ok conway and when this president walked away from what he considered to be a bad deal as several months ago everybody was shocked how can he do that he does that every time he doesn apost see a good deal for america and he didn apost see seriousness of purpose there but he wants to continue to talk to him talk to president xi about trade definitely get a vote on usmca for that crosstalk hemmer there aposs no meeting on the schedule now correct at the moment there is not just conway not at the moment no but this will come together fairly quickly when the time is right hemmer understood last thing on the campaign on friday the president said this about joe biden begin video clip trump joe biden is not playing with a full deck this is not somebody you can have as your president but if he got the nomination i aposd be thrilled end video clip hememr do you believe or does president believe rather that joe biden will be his opponent conway well it aposs possible i mean there still 23 or 24 of them running i saw on the latest quinnipiac poll released this week that 20 of the democrats were at least below 1 percent or at 1 percent and a couple more at 2 percent including one you aposre about to have onto your show so i aposm just reading the polls and telling you that no matter how much the democrats are attacking president obama aposs vice president joe biden for being out of touch and for working with segregationists democrat senators for not being able to say a couple of numbers six numbers to text you of really the only one out there who seems to be propping up obamacare which is left 28 million plus americans with no health insurance whatsoever it may be joe biden it may be someone else but it doesn apost really matter because they are all stuck raising their hands saying they want to give health benefits to illegal immigrants that they want to have green new deals that cost 32 trillion and get rid of airplane travel and cows they are stuck saying that they want medicare for all which is socialized medicine that apart from the monetary cost the moral cost of making us all wait for care the way those veterans five years ago died waiting for care they have to run but you think they aposre going to against donald trump they are running against the trump economy also they aposre running against the trump deregulation they aposre running against the fact that america is now the world aposs largest net exporter of natural gas and oil they aposre running against this big boom in manufacturing and small business ownership hemmer it sounds like a conway and they can apost ph do that running against a president who signed into law something president obama and joe biden did not which was fix nics which actually could stop a lot of these mass shooters so whoever it is they have to really defend socialism now and government run things but joe biden is being attacked from within he aposs being attacked by kamala harris and cory booker hemmer that aposs what primaries are about conway and others because they see him as a serious threat that aposs right hemmer and that aposs what elections are about too thank you so much for your time thank you allow you to get back to your family on this sunday conway thank you bill hemmer thank you kellyanne conway with us today conway thank you sir hemmer in a moment ohio congressman democratic presidential candidate tim ryan is back on the campaign trail after the shooting in dayton he will join us next exclusively plus we aposll bring in our center group to discuss what can be done about the rise in rhetoric on both sides commercial break hemmer following the mass shooting in dayton last week ohio congressman and democratic presidential candidate tim ryan took his call for gun control on the road begin video clip ryan is either up or we are getting up end video clip hemmer he led a caravan of into mitch mcconnell aposs hometown of louisville calling on senate republicans to take action on gun control measures the house passed earlier this year congressman ryan joins us today from charleston south carolina outside the mother emanuel ame church where nine people died in a racially motivated shooting four years ago sir welcome back to fox news sunday ryan thanks for having me yes hemmer on gun control dylann roof is facing the death penalty for what happened inside the church behind you in his case he had a criminal record he was still able to buy a gun a mistake in the system allowed him through and since then the fbi has taken responsibility for that mistake that was human error how would you stop someone like dylann roof ryan well one of the bills before mitch mcconnell takes goes from three days to 10 days that if you are not properly vetted you would get the gun anyway and so this after three days and our bill says we are going to get it to ten days the other bill is a comprehensive universal background check that 90 percent of the american people support i think almost 70 to 80 percent of hunters and sportsmen support and that would make sure there aposs a background check if you get a gun at a gun show if there aposs a person to person sale that that should require a background check so this is a pretty popular thing i wish everything and washington d c had 90 percent support of the american people this does it aposs common sense when you see what happened in dayton and el paso the tragedies the lives that have been lost and ruined quite frankly and the heartbreak we can do something that 90 percent of american people agree upon crosstalk hemmer you mentioned you mentioned background checks several times here in a moment we aposre going to talk with the ohio governor back in your home state he aposs a republican he has several proposals on gun control but the nra said the following the inconvenient truth is this the proposals being discussed by many would not have prevented the horrific tragedies in el paso and dayton ohio worse they would make millions of law abiding americans less safe and less able to defend themselves and their loved ones end quote here aposs what we learned this past week a background check did not prevent the killers from buying a gun in either case and on that point the nra is correct ryan the nra their suggestion is we do nothing we do nothing we know that mass shootings happen primarily in the united states at least at this level there aposs mental illness in other countries there is video games other countries how do we take some modest steps to start getting these guns out of the hands of people it aposs not just the mass shootings it aposs the day to day killings a hundred a day 30 some thousand a year in the united states women 52 a month through domestic violence are victims of gun violence i mean this has got to stop and for the nra to just not even be part of the solution and want to sit down and talk look i take my son hunting at least once a year our son and we go duck hunting in ohio we have a huge sportsman aposs tradition and culture i appreciate that i would never want to take someone aposs hunting rifle from them i would never take someone aposs ability to defend their own home away from them this is about getting these weapons of war that were designed to kill a lot of people really quickly this kid in dayton nine people almost 30 injured in less than 30 seconds you can apost ask for a better response time and he had 100 magazine drum 100 round magazine drum that was in his car that doesn apost belong on the streets of the united states and i say that as someone who goes hunting these are two separate conversations crosstalk hemmer but specifically on the background law it would not have prevented them from acquiring the gun and whether it aposs the law or the gun it aposs something we can debate but i want to talk about the political rhetoric crosstalk ryan it would prevent it would prevent a lot it would prevent a lot hemmer ok ryan it would prevent a lot of gun violence hemmer you have said the president is a racist several other candidates have leveled a similar charge this was the scene outside mitch mcconnell aposs house this past week begin video clip unidentified female this is expletive deleted house he is in there nursing his little broken arm it should have broken his raggedy wrinkled neck just stab the mother expletive deleted in the heart end video clip hemmer some of these comments could be considered death threats what is your responsibility for bringing down the temperature ryan i aposll tell you there should be zero tolerance for that kind of rhetoric there aposs no place in that in the united states of america i took that caravan we went to louisville we did not go to mitch mcconnell aposs house i think that is that is i quite frankly think going to people aposs homes is out of bounds you keep it you keep it civil you keep it in the public discourse that should not be condoned i do not condone it and i think we do need to lower the temperature my only point was and i aposve said this that the white supremacists think that donald trump is a white supremacist so don apost take a political candidate aposs comments because people don apost really take a lot of credibility with what anybody says i would just say when you look at this kid in el paso you know he was saying similar things that president trump has said about the invasion and all of this and all i aposm saying is sometimes that the rhetoric does get so hot around immigrants othering people making people not feel a part of the united states not part of the country look these are complicated issues let aposs deal with them but to incite and say go back to the country that you came from that aposs not appropriate either the president is a cultural figure crosstalk hemmer but in the political in a political sense joaquin castro democrat from texas he is trying to shame to trump donors on social media you know that story his twin brother is running to be the nominee the point is members of your own party are contributing to all of this ryan bill i aposm just going to say this i aposm so sick of the left and right and left and right and back and forth i aposm trying to project a campaign for president that is about new and better we are locked in these same arguments that we aposve been having i believe we need to call out racist activity when we hear it and words when we hear it there are ethical lines that we should not cross i think the president hasn apost done a good job at all of setting a tone of bringing people together he aposs the first one that torched the joint on twitter and start a fight i mean even the supporters of him say this like he can apost do that if this country needs to heal and i aposm looking for new and better not left or right and we aposve got to get out of this left right divide it aposs been going on since vietnam and quite frankly it aposs going on my whole life i aposm 46 is old i aposm ready for america to come together and heal around issues where 90 percent of us agree like on this gun issue hemmer on that ryan the social and emotional learning in school and all these other things we can come together on some of this hemmer on that point about the campaign let aposs talk about that now you aposre in south carolina to campaign it would appear your campaign is in trouble here are the nine candidates who have qualified for the next debate in early september and you aposre not one of them the deadline is about two weeks away sir have you reached the end for 2020 ryan no we have not we literally have the best week of the campaign i aposve had the best fund raising week right after the debate i have the best fund raising day the day after the debate we are continuing we had a great showing yesterday at the iowa state fair we are continuing to build volunteers and low dollar donors look my name recognition isn apost like that from someone from a big state or a really big city so i aposm pushing a campaign as i said about not left or right but new and better i aposm talking about bringing manufacturing back and start building things like electric vehicles and solar were china right now is cleaning our clock they control 60 percent of the electric vehicle market 60 percent of the solar panel market i aposm going to have a chief manufacturing officer that moves us down that road and that aposs resonating with people bill and i just need to continue to go and build my name recognition anybody that wants to help my campaign and wants to get out of this left right divide and get into a new and better go to timryanforamerica com send me ten bucks we aposre just going to continue to build this thing out hemmer ok ryan but i aposm nowhere close to being done hemmer you aposve got some work to do but i know you realize that but thank you for your time today in charleston south carolina ryan yes we do hemmer tim ryan thank you ryan thanks bill hemmer time now for our sunday group charles hurt of the washington times former dnc chair donna brazile howard kurtz host of media buzz and kristen soltis anderson of the washington examiner a great group happy sunday to all of you donna brazile former dnc chair good morning to you hemmer let aposs get back to the rhetoric for a moment here here was a sample from the last week with several democratic candidates on the stump begin video clip biden it aposs both clear language and in code this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation pete buttigieg d presidential candidate there is no national security when we don apost have racial justice let alone when we have a president who is coddling white nationalists sen kirsten gillibrand d n y presidential candidate what he aposs done is spew hate and division his entire presidency the incidence of hate crimes have risen all across the country end video clip hemmer so this was just in the last few days by my count charlie he aposs been called a white supremacist or racist and a white nationalist charlie hurt the washington times you know tim ryan rightly says that he wants to bring the country together and one of the truths after a horrific series of events like we aposve been through as terrible as they are people are kind of united they are 100 percent or at least 99 percent united in agony over what we have witnessed and the idea that donald trump didn apost start this the idea that democrats are going to come out of the gate here after events like these and accuse and claimed that somehow the president is responsible for this that the actions of clearly deranged disturbed people are somehow the fault of the president of the united states it aposs just beyond the pale and you know is there any sort of situation that these people aren apost willing to exploit for their political gain the idea that president trump is somehow a racist because he highlights the problem that there is that we have a true problem at the southern border illegal immigration is a concern for people across the country both democrats and republicans and the idea that somehow all of that equates to donald trump being the inspiration for a mass murder oh my goodness we aposve lost our minds hemmer on that point donna tim ryan said he aposs sick of it but he also he called the president a racist brazile you know i grew up in the segregated south at a time when the country didn apost come together around race but we forced the country to have a conversation through the civil rights movement i aposm bothered by the rhetoric for several reasons one i aposm disturbed that we never get a chance to talk about the real reasons behind whether it aposs domestic terrorism whether it aposs you know a kid who i get a gun and go shoot up innocent people here aposs what i believe we should do we should take responsibility for our words our tweets our actions but at a time when we aposre trying to heal on the second anniversary of charlottesville we should leave behind the rhetoric and start looking at ways that we can come together and solve these problems these are real problems and we need leadership hemmer i aposm not i aposm not sure how many people are listening to that call but it is a noble one howie howard kurtz host mediabuzz we have seen an absolute climate change were democrats and some in the media not only feel free to call president trump a white supremacist but to say that he is condoning and inciting violence now it is fair game to criticized the president aposs sometimes divisive rhetoric but a giant leap to say that he is somehow responsible for the actions of a crazed gunman so he gives a speech this week and he explicitly condemns white supremacist and the reaction in some corner is oh he didn apost really mean to oh he was just reading someone else aposs words and so it seems to be bill that again i aposm not saying the president bears no responsibility for this climate but we are at a point now where these democratic denunciations of some of the language you just played it becomes so constant and so over the top that i think it aposs becoming just noise hemmer kristen kristen soltis anderson echelon insights well and every time democrats are spending time talking about is the president of white supremacist or not they aposre not talking about issues like health care they aposre not talking about the sorts of issues that really help to get democrats big victories in the 2018 midterms it aposs it aposs having this debate over what type of definition you want to place or the terrible word you want to call the president now what i think is is also an important opportunity for the president is when you look at polls a majority of americans do not think president trump is a white supremacist but troublingly a majority do not think he opposes white nationalism a lot of americans responded to that poll question with they don apost know they don apost think he has an opinion and even though the president comes out and he does make remarks where he says i condemn white nationalism clearly there aposs a large portion of america that is still sort of ambivalent on this question where he stands an opportunity here for him to make more and clearer statements saying these democrats have absolutely got it wrong brazile it aposs hemmer donna i i want to get back to the point that you were just making about is it the mood in america i aposm not so sure how you frame it but this was the scene in times square in new york city this past week on tuesday night so there was panic and this was caused by the backfire of a motorcycle several people were injured the gunfire was not real but clearly the panic was when you consider the attitude of the country do you find us to be a nation on edge brazile oh no question the anxiety is everywhere it aposs in your church it aposs in your workplace it aposs going to the mall it aposs going to the theater we keep hearing the mass shooting we keep hearing that we aposve got to ban video games we aposve got to deal with mental health we aposve got red flag laws and yet nothing changed nothing changes you know one of the reasons why i love to see people protest peacefully non violently is because sometimes they get heard by politicians and this week we saw the governor of ohio get shouted down when they said do something do something and a few days later he heard the cries of the people and he began to do something that aposs what people they want us to do something hemmer that did happen we aposll shot it in a moment in fairness to him he aposs been on this issues for years you aposre going to hear from him in just a moment here brazile of course i aposve known him for a long time hemmer but charlie there was this scene at usa today just right down the road false alarm there was a sign that fell over in a shopping mall in utah and people scattered and police were called to her points hurt yes and i think that aposs one of the reasons why the conversation about doing something about guns worries people because at a time when people feel uneasy across the country the last thing they want to be talking about is disarming themselves or having their own rights in any way trampled ph you know tim ryan said that you know the people opposed to these proposals that he aposs talking about their response is they want to do nothing well that aposs absolutely not true you can go around and talk to any gun owner in america and and first of all they aposre absolutely devastated by what has happened the second thing is they do want to do something they want to enforce the laws that we have if if and if those laws that we have were enforced a dirt bag like dylann roof never would have gotten a gun but but hemmer quickly howie i aposve got kurtz you know who wants to do more president trump and he hasn apost gotten much credit for reaching out to both parties to try to get some kind of consensus he could give enough republicans cover it aposs a nixon goes to china moment to actually get something passed we can debate the details but he has stepped up here of course he has done this before and nothing has happened hemmer ok standby one moment ok in a moment i mentioned this we aposll talk to the republican governor in ohio he aposs proposing several proposals for gun control in his state governor mike dewine joins us exclusively on his ideas coming up next commercial break hemmer coming up the republican governor in ohio proposing mental health and gun control legislation after the shooting in dayton begin video clip gov mike dewine r oh everything i aposve proposed i aposm dead serious about and everything i proposed i think we can get passed end video clip hemmer we aposll talk to governor mike dewine next on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip dewine we pray for you and this great crowd represents this great community crowd do something do something end video clip hemmer that aposs a crowd at a vigil for shooting victims in dayton last sunday night calling on the republican governor mike dewine to do something about gun violence now governor dewine has announced a plan to do that joining us now in columbus ohio his home state governor dewine in this exclusive interview and sir thank you for your time on this sunday dewine thank you bill hemmer let aposs see how much we can move through over the next seven minutes or so on gun control you aposve been aggressive on the issue for decades part of your proposal deals with the so called red flag laws i want to play for you and our audience an interview from this past week with the ex girlfriend of the killer in dayton ohio just listen to what she said begin video clip adelia johnson shooter aposs ex girlfriend i wasn apost entirely surprised that he did something bad that he ended up in the news i just didn apost think it would be for this end video clip hemmer as you know she went on to say a lot more and i aposm using her comments as an example based on what you aposre proposing how would you take that comment get a judge aposs order and then take the killer aposs gun away before he strikes governor dewine well what we propose we don apost call a red flag or what we call it is a personal protection order and we use that term because it has built into it constitutional protections you can apost take someone aposs gun unless there aposs a judge that makes that determination but what the our law would say is if if someone is a threat to themselves or a threat to others then you can go into court the family can it aposs usually the family frankly that reports it or the police can go in and i know bill there aposs been a lot of emphasis on mental health care but the truth is that 93 percent of the people who have a severe mental health problem are not violent at all in some cases it would be a mental health issue but our law would also say someone who has a propensity for violence for example someone who is a chronic alcoholic so there aposs a number of different things that could trigger it the court would have to determine that person is a menace to themselves or to society and it would make a difference it will save lives hemmer and one that point yes i want to get back to mental health in a moment i think you make a very interesting point but you statehouse is run by republicans you know what the arguments are they argue your ideas are open to abuse you aposve got a lack of due process especially what we just laid out right there that you make people guilty before innocent how do you prevent that dewine you aposre prevent it bill by the way we aposve written the law the previous governor tried what they called a red flag law it did not have the procedure it did not have the due process we develop this particular bill in consultation with a number of our second amendment friends they have always told me look we know there aposs some people that we need to separate them from their guns temporarily or maybe longer than that but we aposre really worried about due process we aposre worried about a neighbor getting mad at the neighbor and coming over and calling the police and the police go confiscate the guns so we put this together with them it has due process in it you have to go to court a judge has to make that determination hemmer many a suggestions center on mental health and they focus on that one of your ideas is to free up space in psychiatric hospitals as a country we aposve moved away from that do you think that was a mistake dewine well we aposre not going to turn back the clock bill and i don apost know whether we should or not but we have to be realistic about this we have a problem in ohio i don apost know whether it aposs unique to ohio are not but in our state run psychiatric hospitals they are taken up primarily by people who are charged with misdemeanors people who are not violent and they are sent by court order to these psychiatric hospitals to actually teach them how to talk and listen to their own defense lawyer our proposal says look let aposs don apost clog our psychiatric hospitals up with this let aposs get people in there who really need the help and who are being denied the ability to go in and now and let aposs let aposs do this teaching of these individuals that courts are ordering let aposs do this in the community we can do it that way so our proposal will really open our psychiatric hospitals up to the people who really need it hemmer i picked two examples and honestly i could pick a dozen parkland florida 2018 17 dead the killer described as a walking red flag no action taken sutherland spring texas 2017 26 dead the killer had a criminal record there the record was not updated bought a gun air force took responsibility after the fact one case involves a red flag another involves human error your state went for donald trump by eight points and he talked this week about making meaningful background checks he said that repeatedly well the killer in dayton ohio passed a background check and he still murdered nine people so governor what are we up against dewine well i bill i don apost think that we can look at every case and say ok what do we have do for this case we have to look at all of them together just just as you did we aposve got to do a better we aposve got to do better in reaching people at a very very young age we have in the budget that was just passed by the general assembly and i congratulate them for giving us the money that we need we have the ability now to arm our schools give our schools the ability to have better counseling more mental health virtually every one of these cases as you said somebody has looked up a long time ago and said hey this guy is giving all the signs anti social behavior this guy is a menace and we need to be able to do something the schools need the tools we are now giving them the tools to do that hemmer right dewine we are also doing something else we aposre going to be monitoring and are monitoring social media to pick up pick up these things when we see key words that indicate that person is simply going to be a menace and may eventually you know commit this violence hemmer well last point here when we talk about laws and guns in the last 12 months texas they aposve passed several laws related to gun violence most of them dealt with schools and school safety not one would have prevented the killer in el paso from owning a gun is this about laws or is it about guns dewine it aposs about a lot of different things it aposs about people speaking up one of the things that we aposre going to do after we get this legislation passed and i believe we aposre going to get it passed is we aposre going to broadcast this information look if you see a problem speak up get some help so that individual notify the police notify the mental health people or whoever need to be notified speak up in the case of the guy in bellbrook ph ohio that committed these atrocities in dayton there were warnings long long time ago that should have been should have been heated we have provisions in our budget to make to make a difference look i can apost guarantee what we aposve proposed will eliminate every mass shooting but what i can say is that every one of our proposals we can get bipartisan support democrats and republican we need to bring ohio together we are doing that and we can get these things passed and they will each one of them come in each one of them save lives hemmer governor thank you for your time dewine thanks bill hemmer mike dewine back there in columbus our thoughts are with everyone back there in ohio thank you sir in a moment joe biden had a rocky week on the campaign trail will his repeated gaffes impact his race for the presidency we aposll bring back our sunday panel when they return on this when we continue commercial break begin video clip biden poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids wealthy kids black kids asian kids no i really mean it but think how we think about it trump joe biden has truly lost his fastball that i can tell you end video clip hemmer joe biden committing a gaffe during a town hall in iowa over this past week president trump then critiquing rather the frontrunner aposs performance on the trail that was earlier in the week then this was from saturday in iowa begin video clip biden those kids from parkland came up to see me when i was vice president and they went into the and some some of you covered it end video clip hemmer well the problem was parkland the shooting in florida happened two years after he had left office back with the panel now to discuss this and kristen what do you think we learned about the biden campaign this week anderson well the number one thing that democrats care about this election is electability they want to know that whoever they choose to be their party aposs nominee is going to be able to defeat donald trump come november 2020 and joe biden for the most part i mean he has stayed pretty stable in the polls the last fox news poll had him at 33 percent among democrats over twice the support of anyone else in the field but the types of gaffes you aposve begun seeing the former vice president commit on the campaign trail are a little different in nature than what he sort of used to do his gaffes in the past have been that sometimes he says things in artfully it happens but if he doesn apost necessarily have the stamina to stick through and go all the way to next november democrats now may be looking at him and going we may like you uncle joe but maybe it aposs time for to turn the page hemmer donna you want to take a swing at that brazile well i aposm not going to take a swing at it i aposm going to sit back and watch this because i think the vice president made a he made a gaffe no question about it but he quickly got back on his feet and corrected himself i don apost know how many more he will make over the next several months before voters go to the polls but here aposs what i do know people know joe biden this is already baked in the candidate but i do believe that some of the other democrats will start taking advantage of these gaffes and say you know what do you want this guy to go up against donald trump or you or you want me i aposm the fresh face et cetera hemmer you wonder when they aposre going to pull that out of their quiver there was one more this past week when this happened in iowa also begin video clip biden we choose unity over division we choose science over fiction we choose truth over facts question are you able to you think go through a whole campaign with this kind of scrutiny biden yes i have to it aposs a legitimate scrutiny fire away question mr biden they say the gaffes dim your electability biden well that will be determined pretty soon won apost it end video clip hemmer well you heard the question there are you able to endure this in the long run charlie hurt yes you know having you know the guy aposs been around forever he aposs been in washington for what you know 45 years and those of us who have covered him know that this is kind he aposs always been sort of a gaffe machine he and the only way and he aposs run for president numerous times and of course the only way he ever got the closest he got to the white house was because barack obama needed him but the problem i think for for democrats is and kristin is exactly right at the end of the day they want they just want somebody electable and when when when voters operate on with that in mind they often unintentionally make a terrible mistake they try to figure out sort of in their heads who would be the best person to go up against donald trump and i could see them at the last minute doing just what democrats did in 2004 with john kerry what republicans did in 2012 with mitt romney they vote with their brain and they say oh well biden fits all of these parts so let aposs go with him the problem is that the gaffes that biden make biden says things that are just absolutely categorically stupid they think that that aposs like what trump does but it aposs not like what trump does what trump does is he says things you aposre not supposed to say but that everybody agrees with hemmer i aposm hearing kurtz smirk ph twice during that kurtz well joe biden was making gaffes back when he was chairman of senate judiciary and i covered him then and this was a bad one the one about the white students but it seems to me that the reason they get so much attention is because he aposs 76 and it plays into the notion that he has lost a few steps and is is he having problems president trump loves to stoke that but here aposs the thing bill the left wing of the democratic party and many in the media have been trying to bury biden since before he got in his campaign he aposs going to implode on day one he aposs never going to survive that bad debate and all of that and the reason that he is still out front in this race hemmer a commanding lead kurtz yes and the reason despite all the pundit predictions is that he is where most of the democratic rank and file are which is a moderate liberal who is not for open borders who is not for blowing up private health insurance and i think for a lot of the people in the sort of twitter media political industrial complex he is not liberal enough but that may actually be also his strength hemmer you know kristen you wonder with the commanding lead maybe that holds maybe it doesn apost but what does it say about the rest of the field the strength of the other candidates anderson well it has been fascinating to me that really very few of the serious candidates those polling above 1 percent have tried to challenge joe biden for this more moderate lane of the party in these debates you see elizabeth warren and bernie sanders fighting over who aposs the furthest left and you even see someone like mayor pete pete buttigieg of south bend indiana who i think could have been an interesting person to kind of challenge joe biden for some of those more heartland moderate democrats really sort of avoiding opportunities to do so the rest of the democratic field is not taking joe biden on on that turf hemmer ok so this has come up twice now in his conversation who does it first brazile it aposs already being done i mean there aposs no question that hemmer they aposre going after him and president obama brazile yes they aposre going after him but you but but and you know what that is a huge mistake joe biden the joe biden i aposve known for over 30 years is is deeply respected within the democratic party he aposs likable people know him they respect him and they know that he aposs a strong fighter he may not have every you know left jab right or whatever but you know what we know what aposs in his heart and that aposs why people love him hemmer all right i just have a few seconds for this howie but i aposm just wondering the state of play for jeffrey epstein and that story quickly what do you think that is kurtz it is stunning and i have no sympathy for this predator the federal prison officials allowed this guy to apparently commit suicide despite the previous attempt and we need to investigate and find out more i think all of us in this business should avoid the speculation and the conspiracy theories until we know more hemmer ok let aposs leave it there thank you howie thank you charlie kristin donna have a great sunday we
