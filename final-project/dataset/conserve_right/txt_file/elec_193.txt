republican nominee donald trump had a disastrous post convention cycle but ever since the associated press released their analysis of hillary s state department calendar thus far showing thatmore than halfof her nongovernmental meetings were with donors to the clinton foundation the narrative of intrigue and unethical dealings that seem to follow the power couple was rehashed clinton droppedseven points in three days over trump hillary remains in the lead by five but still within striking distance of the republican nominee who has pivoted towards more disciplined messaging hammering clinton over allegations of paid access emanating from the nonprofit he also headed down to louisiana to assess the flood damage while democrats remained lethargic in responding to the worst disaster since hurricane sandy now a new morning consult poll shows that clinton s lead over trump has been halved in a week via the hill one week ago clinton led trump by 6 points 44 percent to 38 percent voters view both candidates unfavorably pollsters found with 58 percent holding a negative view of trump and 57 percent saying the same about clinton the real clear politics average has trump trailing by six which isn t terrible at the same time he s weak in some traditional republican states and he s fairing poorly with clinton in the swing states right now if the election were held today clinton would easily clinch the 270 electoral votes needed to win yet nate silver of fivethirtyeight added that we re in the third quarter of this election cycle and clinton shouldn t be counting on living in government housing again just yet then again both candidates are especially weak and flawed this cycle making cobbling togethernew voters a difficult obstacle it s nice to have a model at times like these instead of just throwing up your hands or worse cherry picking polls to suit your case and that model as i said shows trump as having gained about 2 points over two weeks if trump keeps gaining 1 percentage point a week he ll beat clinton by a couple of percentage points on nov 8 hence clinton should probably not be picking out the white house drapes just yet continued gains may not be so easy for trump however he s still at only 37 or 38 percent in national polls that include third party candidates that might seem like an easy number to improve upon but his favorability rating is only about 35 percent meaning that he s already relying on support from a few voters who don t like him but may vote for him to prevent a clinton presidency clinton also has some work to do she s at about 43 percent in national polls and in polls of key swing states not enough to clinch victory even if 6 to 10 percent of the vote eventually goes to third party candidates as appears increasingly likely she ll need to persuade a few undecided voters toward her side or get some of those third party voters more of whom have clinton than trump as their second choice to turn out for her this election at least for the time being presents something of the opposite case it isn t all that close clinton is up by around 6 percentage points as best as we can figure a larger lead than obama had at almost any point in 2012 or until the very end of the 2008 campaign but it s august and the number of undecided voters is high and so the outcome remains fairly uncertain furthermore while the state polls are fairly good for clinton right now we don t know how they ll react if the race tightens further we re going on three weeks without a live caller poll in pennsylvania for example coincidentally or not the clinton campaign was more proactive last week it pushed back quite aggressively at an associated press story about donations to the clinton foundation and it instigated a fight with trump over his connections with what clinton called the emerging racist ideology known as the alt right clinton remains in a strong overall position but she shouldn t be playing prevent defense yet we re still in the equivalent of the third quarter for trump thatmeans there can be zero room to engage in disastrous public relations antics as i ve said before the fact that clinton is only ahead by less than ten points only shows what an awful candidate she is for all intents and purposes clinton should be trouncing clinton by over ten points she s can t deliver those critical blows she hamstrung by her baggage alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist twitter fact checks a pair of president trump s tweets update trump responds townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
