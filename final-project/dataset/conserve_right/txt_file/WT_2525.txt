strictly on political grounds it doesn t seem to be making progress impeachment is a political process no sentient being after all believes that adam schiff or nancy pelosi are good faith guardians of constitutional order and judging the process strictly on political grounds it hasn t been a success for democrats he writes for one thing impeachment if it happens will effectively end up being a partisan censure of the president democrats haven t gotten any closer to convincing a single senate republican to contemplate removing the president certainly not mitch mcconnell who says there will be a quick trial not even mitt romney who at this point is aptly troubled but uncommitted mr harsanyi says democrats and the media have covered every development of the many investigations into trump tending into histrionics that has in many ways obscured legitimate criticism of the president by constantly overpromising and under delivering democrats have guaranteed not only skepticism but apathy from voters outside their own tribe he later adds foxified fox news remains the most watched cable network of all for the 46th consecutive week acing such non news rivals as espn and the hallmark
