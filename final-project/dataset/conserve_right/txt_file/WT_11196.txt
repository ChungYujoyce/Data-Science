tim ryan ohio democrat called the president s move one of his biggest flip flops yet rick manning president of the conservative americans for limited government said reconsideration of the tpp withdrawal would be a disaster both for our nation and for president trump who won the election promising to get out of this deal the 11 nation tpp which includes japan mexico vietnam australia and others would open more markets overseas to u s farmers those countries signed the pact last month i m sure there are lots of particulars that they d want to negotiate but the president multiple times reaffirmed in general to all of us and looked right at larry kudlow and said larry go get it done said sen ben sasse nebraska republican as a candidate mr trump blasted the obama era tpp as the sort of multination trade deal that causes job losses and factory closures in the u s he pulled the u s out of the deal in 2017 as a defining action in his america first agenda after years of negotiations by the obama administration in january however mr trump said he would be open to revisiting tpp if the u s could negotiate better terms i would do tpp if we were able to make a substantially better deal mr trump said at the world economic forum in davos switzerland the deal was terrible the way it was structured was terrible if we did a substantially better deal i would be open to tpp he spoke similarly thursday night taking to twitter to say the u s would only join tpp if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to pres obama we already have bilateral deals with six of the eleven nations in tpp and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations japan who has hit us hard on trade for years during a february news conference with australian prime minister malcolm turnbull mr trump again raised the possibility of rejoining tpp if the u s could obtain better terms the administration has been floating a multi billion dollar proposal to provide temporary relief to farmers who would be hurt by chinese tariffs in a series of escalating trade threats by beijing and washington china has vowed to impose tariffs on u s soybeans pork apples and other products but lawmakers emerging from the white house meeting said they are more interested in opening new markets for trade than obtaining temporary subsidies a congressional staffer familiar with the discussion said when it came up senators and governors expressed no appetite for subsidies we prefer trade as opposed to aid mr roberts said mr sasse who has criticized proposed subsidies said mr trump repeated several times that the tpp trade deal might be easier for us to join now because the other 11 countries have already agreed on the terms the farmers and ranchers of america they don t want welfare payments mr sasse said they want to feed the world lawmakers said the subject of emergency agriculture subsidies was broached only briefly during thursday s hour long meeting we need markets said sen john hoeven north dakota republican we need free trade we need fair trade he said the discussion included proposals to talk to tpp nations to decide how do we do more trade with each other to put more pressure on china to play fair china is not a party to the tpp agreement the obama administration envisioned the deal as a counterweight to china s economic influence in the pacific region mr sasse said mr trump s current course of tariffs first u s alone action won t solve america s trade problems china cheats in lots and lots of ways mr sasse said the single best way we can counter that is by leading all the rule of law nations in the pacific who would rather be aligned with the u s than be aligned with china while free trade republicans praised mr trump s possible reversal on tpp liberals blasted the president s move rejoining the tpp would be a betrayal of american workers and a step in the wrong direction said sen bernard sanders vermont independent joining the tpp would not bring back one american job that has been outsourced to china instead it would force more american workers to compete with desperate workers in vietnam who make 65 cents an hour and migrant computer workers in malaysia who are working as modern day slaves democrat hillary clinton praised the tpp negotiations while she served as mr obama s secretary of state but as the party s presidential nominee she came out against the pact i urge the president not to break his campaign promise and rejoin the tpp said rep rosa delauro connecticut democrat the era of trade agreements drafted by and for corporate interests while exploiting workers must end white house spokeswoman lindsay walters said mr trump in withdrawing from the trade agreement last year kept his promise to end
