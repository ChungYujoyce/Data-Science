the end of march china has opened a new front in its global diplomacy the covid 19 virus originated in the chinese city of wuhan from where it rapidly spread around the world initial cover ups about the extent of the virus by the people s republic of china and beijing s crackdown on whistleblowers played a role in the slow international reaction and donald trump has dubbed covid 19 the chinese virus but now that indigenous coronavirus infections appear to have dropped in china and its economy shows signs of recovering xi jinping is turning a propaganda disaster into a political opportunity by offering humanitarian aid to italy the hardest hit country in europe and to other european states from spain to serbia and even ukraine his vigorous pandemic diplomacy is a skilful piece of improvisation seeking to reframe his country s role in the corona affair at a time of euro atlantic disunion but it should also be understood in the larger context of chinese foreign policy as nothing less than the new health silk road italy is currently the epicentre of the pandemic in europe its death toll from covid 19 has overtaken china s given the other eu states initial focus on themselves rome has felt abandoned the sudden surge of generosity from far distant china in the form of tens of thousands of ventilators masks medicines and protective gear has therefore come at a perfect time

encouraged in europe china s helping hand could make a difference a barbed allusion to the eu s apparent lack of solidarity with italy china s generosity is of course calculated and it fits into china

leader made similar offers to several other leaders in europe africa and the middle east when the coronavirus crisis is eventually over european and global politics will have transformed can the bonds between rome and brussels be restored or will the crisis precipitate a general weakening of the eu has trump s america first approach to covid 19 further undermined washington s position as global leader will italy look more to china less to the eu and the us will that be true for other countries as well this is a grave moment for the eu during the balkans crisis in 1991 jacques poos then president of the european council claimed that this was the hour of europe but this bold assertion came to nothing as the eu failed to enact a unified european foreign policy and prevent the bloody implosion of yugoslavia this is also a crucial moment for the transatlantic community because eu inertia and trumpist isolationism have left a vacuum that china s unilateral internationalism seeks to fill europeans should not be surprised if the new health silk road from china to rome is named after marco polo after returning from china around 700 years ago the venetian merchant s travel notes
