emergency homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen canceled her work trip to europe to return to the u s to oversee the response she has ordered officers to be pulled from legal ports of entry and deployed to help the border patrol process and transport the migrants they are catching she also ordered the expansion of a pilot program to make asylum seekers wait in mexico while their cases are
