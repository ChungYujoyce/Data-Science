doctors for coronavirus global survey this ima technology was developed originally for the u s military specifically the f 22 and f 35 fifth generation fighter programs though it is now regulated as dual use export controlled technology mr forbes said in the oct 17 letter given the technology s military origin i am deeply concerned once in china it will wind up aiding the military aviation programs of the people s liberation army air force which is even now developing its j 20 fifth generation fighter that appears intended to threaten u s air supremacy in east asia mr forbes said the pentagon has so far only conducted an informal review of the deal between ge and the aviation industry corp of china avic he urged mr panetta to immediately direct a formal review which would examine the potential damage to u s national security if china diverts the technology involved to its military he cited china s reputation for stealing u s intellectual property and technology and its aggressive cyber espionage additionally mr forbes asked mr panetta whether the ge deal should be reviewed by the treasury led committee on foreign investment in the united states a pentagon spokeswoman had no immediate comment a ge spokeswoman told inside the ring that the obama administration notified the company oct 4 that the ge venture with the aviation industry corp of china to develop aircraft avionics does not require an export license it s important to understand that our avionics technology has no current direct military application which includes no use on the f 35 or f 22 mentioned in rep forbes letter said ge s jennifer villarreal a congressional aide said that approval was done without the formal review sought by mr forbes ge spokesman rick kennedy said earlier that no military technology is involved in the chinese venture and that the company has taken steps to prevent current or former chinese military officials from taking part in the deal the venture is also under scrutiny in congress because ge chairman jeffrey r immelt is the obama administration s point man for jobs and competitiveness raising concerns about possible pentagon favoritism in not scrutinizing the avic deal dtsa told congress last june that its experts were concerned about chinese data theft and questioned ge s self determination that no export license is required an email to congress stated that dtsa opined that there was the potential possibility for china to exploit civil technologies for use in its own military modernization start arms cuts threatened the house subcommittee chairman who oversees u s strategic nuclear forces is threatening to hold up strategic arms cuts outlined in the obama administration s new start arms treaty with russia if funding for u s nuclear forces modernization is cut rep michael r turner chairman of the house armed services strategic forces subcommittee said during a speech tuesday that passage of the start treaty in december 2010 was based on promises that the administration would fully fund an urgently needed program of nuclear weapons modernization it s clear that new start s reduction and modernization are a package deal and as such if they re not both implemented neither should be mr turner said at the heritage foundation mr turner said president obama promised in letter to the senate that he would modernize strategic nuclear delivery systems and bolster key infrastructure but the president s promise is falling apart because of cuts to the funding bill for the national nuclear security administration which is facing a 10 percent cut in funding despite 8 billion that was transferred to it from the pentagon budget he said additionally 2 billion for nuclear modernization was taken from nuclear programs by the appropriations committee to use for water projects in members states the current house version of the defense authorization bill links reductions under new start to execution of the nuclear modernization plan mr turner said as the nuclear posture review pointed out it is nuclear modernization that would enable deeper reductions in the stockpile without added risk to national security he said in other parts of the speech mr turner issued a sharp critique of the administration s conciliatory reset policy toward russia i think it s clear this policy has been a failure with few successes achieved at disproportionate cost he said seals avenged the u s military used spy planes and intercepts to locate the taliban fighter who fired the rocket propelled grenade that knocked

was often too close to civilian areas but he finally stopped at a compound a break for trackers that led to the dropping of an extraordinary amount of ordnance to kill one man the individuals got out moved out into an orchard area settled into kind of a tree line vegetated area and we executed kinetic strikes with both f 16s the briefer said i think we dropped eight 500 pounders and then we also had air weapons team four or eight 500 pounders and then 30 millimeter from the air weapons team ah 64 apaches as well and then we got positive reflections after that we had killed the shooter and
