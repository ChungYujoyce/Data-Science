state visit and an audience with queen elizabeth ii in london d day commemoration ceremonies on both sides of the english channel and his first presidential visit to ireland which will include a stay

all the leaders stay focused on the extraordinary heroism of that of d day and focusing on what brought allies to that position said heather conley senior vice president of the center for strategic and international studies dark clouds are forming once again in europe and rather than encourage those forces we need to find much better tools to defeat them trump is to arrive in london on monday for a two day whirlwind of pomp circumstance and protests including meetings with the royal family and an extravagant state dinner at buckingham palace he is likely to be shadowed by demonstrators who during his visit to england last summer flooded the streets and flew an inflatable balloon depicting the president as a baby a year ago trump played the ungracious guest blasting may in an interview

nasty tweeting i never called meghan markle nasty made up by the fake news media and they got caught cold the newspaper posted the audio of the interview on its website trump will make his first presidential visit to ireland on wednesday but what should have been a routine visit with the prime minister grew complicated due to the president s unprecedented blending of government duties and

balked a deal was struck for trump to meet prime minister leo varadkar at shannon s airport the centerpiece of the president s visit will be two days to mark the d day anniversary likely the last significant commemoration most veterans of the battle will see the anniversary events will begin in portsmouth england where the invasion was launched and then move to normandy france where allied
