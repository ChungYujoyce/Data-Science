isolated him amid concern he apos d hurt republicans apos chances of winning control of the senate democrats have already used akin apos s comments in which he claimed women apos s bodies can fend off pregnancy in cases of legitimate rape to raise campaign money and cast other republicans as insensitive toward women gop leaders tried to minimize the damage by first condemning akin apos s remarks and then one after another urged akin to get out of the race akin though resisted he told fox news host mike huckabee on his radio show tuesday afternoon that he apos s staying i believe that we can win this akin said citing a tremendous outpouring of support from individual donors even as party heavyweights freeze him out akin called the fallout a little bit of an overreaction going forward akin

support the national republican senatorial committee in addition to well funded conservative groups reiterated that stance tuesday if he continues with this misguided campaign it will be without the

statement accusing republicans of having passed the akin amendment akin made the controversial remarks in an interview with fox affiliate ktvi he claimed a woman apos s body can typically fend off
