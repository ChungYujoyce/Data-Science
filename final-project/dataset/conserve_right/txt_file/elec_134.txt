 sign in he either can t tell the truth or doesn t know what the truth is manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion liar or idiot it is hard to tell which of these best describes former vice president joe biden in fact i really don t understand how he can even be a contender considering his past during the summer of my freshman year in college then u s sen biden plagiarized the words of the leader of the british labor party neil kinnock these are the exact words he used during his closing statement at a democrat debate at the iowa state fair on aug 23 1987 top stories coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history 500 doctors tell trump to end the coronavirus shutdown say it will cause more deaths australian researchers see virus design manipulation i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright is it because i m the first biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that i was smarter than the rest two months earlier on may 15 1987 mr kinnock delivered a speech to the welsh labor party conference saying why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university why is glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick mr kinnock pointed to his wife glenys in the crowd when talking about her in his speech mr biden did the same thing during his closing statement at the debate he included several other items taken from the earlier speech without attribution to the labor leader the kinnock address was rebroadcast in 1987 during the general election in the united kingdom it wasn t too long before the media started reporting on mr biden s plagiarism at the time another report came out that showed mr biden used major parts of a 1967 speech by former attorney general robert f kennedy in his comments to the california democratic party on feb 3 1987 the reports also said he used a portion of president john f kennedy s 1961 inaugural address during his california speech and the reports contended that he lifted portions of a 1976 speech by former vice president hubert h humphrey but there s more the tsunami of media attention to his plagiarism started by the kinnock speech opened the door to a closer look at mr biden s academic record at the syracuse university school of law the media focused on the fact that mr biden had received a failing grade in an introductory class on legal methodology because he wrote a paper relying almost exclusively on an article in the fordham law review that he only cited once in the paper the media noted that he was allowed to repeat the course and he passed and that his failing grade was removed from his record on sept 17 1987 mr biden held a press conference where he acknowledged the story about the law school paper but claimed that he did not know the proper rules of citation a strange argument considering he was studying to be a lawyer he dismissed the plagiarism as much ado about nothing at this point i am thinking that mr biden is a serial liar but then i learned that he gave the media a 65 page file of his academic records from law school idiot clearly an idiot the media looked at mr biden s academic records and compared them to his statements in public about his academic career exhibit 1 is a c span video of mr biden at a campaign stop in claremont new hampshire a local resident asked mr biden how he did in law school mr biden responded i think i probably have a much higher iq than you do he also said the first year in law school i decided i didn t want to be in law school and ended up in the bottom two thirds of my class and then decided i wanted to stay and went back to law school and in fact ended up in the top half of my class the associated press noted that the law school records given to them by mr biden himself show that in his first semester he ranked 80 out of 100 by the second semester of his second year he was 79 out of 87 ultimately he graduated 76th in a class of 85 hardly rising to the top half of his class now i am not making the argument that joe biden needed to rank in the top half of his class to run for president what i am saying is that he either can t tell the truth or he doesn t know what it is either that makes him a liar or an idiot unfortunately i think it might be both scott walker was the
