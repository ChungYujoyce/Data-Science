defense mounted by a group of rifle wielding colorado teens with a cast of young unknowns and the mpaa s first pg 13 rating the film was one of the top grossing movies of the year directed and co written by john milius an avowed gun enthusiast red dawn featured so much gunfire that some called it the most violent movie ever made between the gun violence and the supposed right wing undertones or overtones it was one of the more controversial movies of its time a cult hit of the reagan era it was practically preordained then that hollywood would greenlight a remake of red dawn the new film is due out later this year but mgm s attempt to retell the story in a post soviet world this time with red china as the aggressor is already facing its own controversy according to movie blogger jason apuzzo who saw an advance screening last summer this version of red dawn depicts the chinese army invading the west coast of the united states in an apropos mission to collect on the debt we owe some young americans aren t willing to give up so easily and the seattle based band of wolverines launches their counterattack in the name of freedom mr apuzzo founder of the film blog libertas writes that

over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century so why is hollywood meddling with what sounds like a surefire hit in the heartland mgm which filed for bankruptcy last year has partnered with distributors wary of isolating themselves from what they consider a growing market for american movies in the people s republic of china the los angeles times reports that producers are digitally erasing chinese flags and military symbols from the movie and replacing them with references to an invasion by north korea an isolated country where american media companies have no dollars at stake a source close to the production of red dawn says these changes make the plot more credible and sophisticated noting that the filmmakers consulted experts at the departments of state and defense as well as non governmental think tanks true or not mgm badly needs a blockbuster and the chinese market is one they can t afford to ignore the creative changes to red dawn may just be good business according to veteran hollywood producer doug urbanski who contends there s nothing political about the way studios tinker with the movies they produce hollywood is not run by madonna sean penn and alec baldwin it s run by serious businesspeople says mr urbanski an unabashed conservative and occasional actor who turned in a memorable cameo in the social network as harvard president and former obama economic adviser larry summers if i were in a situation where the chinese offered me money to make movies there would i take the money the answer is no mr urbanski says but he says studios have a moral responsibility to make good on their promises to investors two other producers often associated with the handful of out of the closet hollywood conservatives are also unsurprised and unconcerned by the sacrifice here of creative choices to the profit motive this sounds like an economic issue says joel surnow the creator of the hit fox series 24 china would be a bad market to alienate writer director producer cyrus nowrasteh says foreign sales are always a concern for studios and distributors his 2008 film the stoning of soraya m was banned in iran but mr nowrasteh says it was also not screened in some european countries like france italy or germany because distributors there were concerned the film s brutal portrayal of islamic fundamentalism might incite riots the red dawn remake isn t the only recent entertainment product to receive a cleansing of all references chinese the recently released video game homefront coincidentally written by mr milius was also to feature an invading chinese army according to gaming blog kokatu that was changed much earlier in the production process to north korea as well all this china experts say is part of an attempt to open up the world s largest market through conciliation the biggest problem for hollywood in china right now is that beijing places strict limits on the number of foreign films that are allowed to be legally imported into the country says kelley currie a senior fellow at the project 2049 institute the industry wants to make and sell movies there and there s a prevailing idea among studio execs that we sit at the cusp of china s long awaited opening the hope of an open china is a major reason why studios and distributors are wary of productions that could embarrass the communist regime including any depiction of china s known atrocities besides a handful of movies about tibet hollywood has done a good job of avoiding making things uncomfortable for beijing although there is ample material from recent history from the tiananmen square massacre to the plight of the falun gong movement the studios seem unwilling to rock the proverbial boat lest china move even further out of reach there s little indication though that china is getting any closer to opening up in the way that hollywood hopes on free speech on human rights the chinese are all going in the wrong direction says ethan gutmann of the foundation for defense of democracies this is a massive blindspot and unfortunately for mgm the sidestep on red dawn will probably be a fruitless endeavor this movie is unlikely to get past the censors in china ms currie says even with the north korean switcheroo the changes won t get hollywood any closer to the mythical
