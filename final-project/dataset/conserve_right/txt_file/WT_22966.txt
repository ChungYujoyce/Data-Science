apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion some of the most notable policy victories take time and they seldom generate banner headlines take the arms trade treaty there s an excellent chance that you re saying the what there was a relatively minor ripple in the news cycle when president trump announced he was withdrawing the united states from it but believe me it matters and it was the right move top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey the arms trade treaty att probably sounded harmless enough to most people when the united nations first voted on it about a decade ago its goal establishing common international standards for the import export and transfer of conventional arms what could go wrong plenty and the heritage foundation s ted bromund who has monitored the att from the start wasted no time in sounding the alarm bells although putatively intended as a measure that would reduce conflicts and limit the ability of terrorists and organized crime to obtain weapons the treaty contemplated by the resolution would in reality be a license to almost all states no matter how irresponsible to buy and sell arms he wrote in a 2009 report the projected treaty would endanger u s arms export control policy clash with the constitution offer a dangerous justification for dictatorial rule and make it illegal under international law for the u s to support freedom fighters abroad unfortunately it often takes more than one report no matter how well reasoned to stop a bad idea in its tracks so mr bromund kept at it he attended the 2012 2013 2015 and 2018 arms trade treaty conferences he even addressed the united nations in 2012 and 2013 along the way he published more than 200 related reports op eds scholarly articles lectures and blog posts on the arms trade treaty he also gave countless media interviews on the other side in full support of the treaty was a large coalition of gun control proponents and left wing non governmental organizations they campaigned hard and found a sympathetic ear in the obama white house in 2013 secretary of state john kerry signed the arms trade treaty the senate however never ratified the treaty and now with president trump s announcement it s off the table so what s wrong with the arms trade treaty for one thing as the white house pointed out it provides a platform for those who would seek to constrain our ability to sell arms to our allies and partners that s a key goal of the arms trade treaty s supporters tying the hands of the united states which unlike many other signatories to treaties actually honors its commitments another problem the arms trade treaty has a track record of being used by groups to try and overturn sovereign national decisions on arms exports the white house says no one who cares about national sovereignty should consent to such an agreement just ask the british who have been sued repeatedly by the activists in the name of the treaty then there s the matter of the second amendment oh the treaty s supporters assure us that the att won t affect our right to own guns but as mr bromund points out they also refuse to make that clear in the treaty text so sure the treaty at least as now written is no gun grab but gun control activists could still use it to advance their goals and let s not forget a major flaw in the arms trade treaty at least if we re to take it seriously china and russia both of which are major arms exporters aren t party of the treaty so president trump was right to say he was un signing the arms trade treaty but we shouldn t stop there the treaty still has 102 state parties around the world so the united states should follow up by pulling all u s funding from the treaty plus notes mr bromund there are other bad treaties out there like the arms trade treaty it s time to quit them as well and work to ensure we never get to this point again ed feulner is founder of the heritage foundation www her
