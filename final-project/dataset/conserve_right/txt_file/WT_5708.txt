turkish troops moved into the area after mr trump began withdrawing american troops who had been supporting kurdish forces in the area the turkish offensive which rights groups say has involved atrocities against kurdish civilians fleeing the war zone has upended a complex mix of alliances that had brought a period of relative stability to the near decade long civil war in syria where the islamic state terror group once held significant territory russia as power broker tuesday s moves by russia were widely seen as an attempt to cement its role as de facto power broker for the region as
