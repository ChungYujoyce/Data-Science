donald trump s tweets but they were about other things like bedbugs his tweets railed about the incompetent mayor of san juan in the unnerving hours before the gathering hurricane dorian brushed past puerto rico en route to the mainland when the stock market took a dive he poked fun at a little known democratic presidential contender getting ready for dinner with world leaders he took on critics who think he has a messiah complex trump s twitter feed is rarely normal but over the last seven days it has revealed a striking disconnect between matters of gravity and his trivial excitations top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director these tweets have come both when he is very busy and apparently idle often published by his own hand sometimes by the hidden hand of aides tweeting his wishes under his account some in his orbit say he s worried about an economic downturn and what that might do to his reelection chances and that pressure is showing in his tweets divining a change of winds in trump s twitter performance much less his overall temperament can be a fraught exercise a master of provocation and changing the subject he famously uses the medium for visceral venting and as a cudgel when anyone or anything raises his ire his only reliable pattern is erraticism but those close to him acknowledge this is a particularly scattershot stretch from an always restive president four officials and republicans close to the white house none authorized to discuss private conversations and therefore speaking anonymously say trump has become consumed by his reelection chances and begun to fret privately about the economy slowing down and hurting his prospects as the trade war with china takes a deeper bite they also say trump has grown more confident in his ability to do the job and less in need of the cooler heads who constrained some of his impulsiveness before given churning staff turnover there are fewer such people anyway one result a president bouncing from attack line to attack line in tweets divorced from or only marginally connected to the real world events at hand over seven days friday aug 23 trump typically uses the performance of the stock market as a barometer of his

whoever that may be has dropped out of the 2020 presidential race saturday aug 24 trump comes away from a two hour meeting with french president emmanuel macron at the g 7 and is getting ready for dinner with the other leaders he wants to explain a messiah complex flap on twitter when i looked up to the sky and jokingly said i am the chosen one at a press conference two days ago referring to

the g 7 summit of world leaders french diplomacy produces an unexpected meeting with iran s foreign minister a potentially groundbreaking development with an adversary of the west as this unfolds in the halls trump tweets in honor of talk show veteran regis philbin happy birthday regis a truly special man trump plays up an opinion poll he likes and makes the improbable claim that the other world leaders mainly want to know from him why does the american media hate your country so much monday aug 26 trump is in a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel and speaking to reporters about islamic state fighters not fumbling with his phone when an aide tweets under his name the story by axios that president trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous i never said this just more fake news axios stood by the story which quoted unidentified officials and referred to a 2017 national security council memo said to have captured one conversation about bombing hurricanes the government analyzed the idea generations ago and concluded it would not work tuesday aug 27 a hurricane watch is in effect for puerto rico still recovering from the devastation of hurricane maria in 2017 trump no bedbugs at doral the radical left democrats upon hearing that the perfectly located for the next g 7 doral national miami was under
