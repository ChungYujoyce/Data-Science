as the u s national security agency are now available to the highest bidders from companies in dozens of countries the private companies offer equipment and services that can eavesdrop on cellphone calls monitor internet activity tap into fiber optic cable the equipment then can search filter and index the vast quantity of data obtained through all this surveillance privacy advocates say there is nothing to stop foreign intelligence services from using the equipment to spy on their own people or americans even if american companies as they claim only sell to governments and law enforcement there s no real regulation of end users even in the united states let alone china and russia said christopher soghoian an online privacy advocate and graduate fellow at the center for applied cybersecurity research at indiana university there s nothing to stop this equipment from being used in the united states he added sure it s illegal but you re never going to get caught he said cellphones can be monitored easily with a widely available device called an imsi catcher because almost all voice traffic is unencrypted what is being done to protect americans from this technology asked mr soghoian the answer is nothing privacy international an advocacy group based in london with which mr soghoian works and the anti secrecy website wikileaks last week published a database of more than 130 companies worldwide that market internet monitoring phone interception computer logging or other surveillance technologies the database is the fruit of a yearlong investigation during
