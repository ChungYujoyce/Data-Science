trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore it is our hope that through the belt and road development we will unleash new forces for global economic growth xi told reporters at a conference center in the hills north of the chinese capital the two day meeting included presidents vladimir putin of russia and recep tayyip erdogan of turkey and presidents or prime ministers from italy hungary greece kenya and most of china s asian neighbors but no major western leaders britain france and germany were represented by finance or trade officials the united states sent a delegation led by the asia director of president donald trump s national security council a joint statement by the leaders appeared to be crafted to defuse fears beijing is trying to create a china dominated bloc and rewrite global trade rules it endorsed a rules based system a possible attempt to reassure western governments that worry beijing might try to erode the world trade organization
