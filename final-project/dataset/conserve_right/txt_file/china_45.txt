U.S. policymakers shouldn’t assume that stopping major military exercises around the Korean Peninsula is a boon for China — although it might be, according to President Trump’s nominee to be the next ambassador to South Korea.

“It’s too early to tell if it's a benefit to China or not,” retired Adm. Harry Harris, who led U.S. Pacific Command until Trump tapped him for a diplomatic post, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday.

“I think that South Korea is looking at this in a positive way, this being the summit, and I believe that we are, in fact, in a new landscape with North Korea. For the first time — certainly in my career — we’re in a place where peace is a possibility.”

President Trump, following his meeting with Kim Jong Un this week, announced that he was halting "war games" between the U.S. and South Korea, which sent the Pentagon scrambling to define what he meant.
