apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump on wednesday said parts of the country deserve to get back to normal sooner than others arguing the lamestream media is using the coronavirus to hurt the economy and his reelection chances even as the u s suffered its deadliest day of the pandemic and new york said efforts to restrict society have paid off there s big sections of our country that are very little affected mr trump told a white house briefing mr trump has advised americans to work and learn at home avoid essential travel and use takeout instead of frequenting restaurants for 15 days that guidance expires this weekend however and the president is eager to reopen the country as he revs up a reelection bid staked on the once robust economy see also trump says lamestream media wants to keep nation closed to hurt him the president says new york city and parts of the west coast might be hampered by the pandemic for some time but he wants to give flexibility to parts of the country such as the midwest that might have less of a problem right now it s confined to certain areas high density areas he said adding our country wants to get back to work mr trump also personalized the pandemic wednesday drawing a straight line between widespread fears around the virus and his electoral prospects the lamestream media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success the real people want to get back to work asap we will be stronger than ever before he wrote his position sets up a clash with health experts who say it will take many weeks to get the pandemic under control governors around the country say they want to get their economies humming again too but they re worried mr trump s push to get things raring to go by easter is too optimistic citing the arc of the coronavirus outbreak and public health experts recommendations the u s recorded at least 185 fatalities on wednesday alone making it the worst day so far and the death toll exceeded 900 the total number of u s cases is above 65 000 new york is far and away the hardest hit u s state in the coronavirus outbreak as of wednesday there were more than 30 800 positive coronavirus cases in new york state and at least 285 coronavirus related deaths as mr trump looks to loosen strict guidance new york gov andrew cuomo said social distancing appeared to be slowing down the virus in his state the evidence suggests that the density control measures may be working mr cuomo said at his daily briefing on the covid 19 outbreak in his state he said on sunday projected hospitalizations were doubling every two days compared to a rate of every 4 7 days by tuesday i don t place a great deal of stock in any one projection mr cuomo said but this is a very good sign and a positive sign he also cited progress in westchester county which was the hottest cluster in the u s before the state ordered closures and ramped up testing hoping to ramp up the pressure he said new york city would try closing some streets to cars so that pedestrians have more space around them when they go out for fresh air he s also asking the public not to play basketball or other close contact sports in playgrounds mr cuomo is among governors who ve ordered all non essential employees to work from home and closed bars and restaurants except for takeout or carry out orders he said no one thinks it s sustainable to keep the economy closed but there are two parallel thoughts at play in that he s not willing to risk lives as congress rushed to pass stimulus measures for the economy mr trump congratulated his administration for its response to date saying its performance has saved lives we ve done one hell of a job mr trump said praising his team you wouldn t even have a country left yet mr trump s push to open up the country easter has made health experts uneasy saying the outbreak hasn t peaked hard hit places and may spread to new parts of the nation it s unclear if mr trump s push to loosen white house guidance will matter in certain places governors are signaling they ll put health recommendations first so the economy doesn t face greater harm down the road ohio gov mike dewine a republican says the only way to slow it down is through social distancing he says the outbreak might not peak until may 1 the truth is that protecting people and protecting the economy are not mutually exclusive mr dewine tweeted in fact one depends on the other we save our economy by first saving lives and we have to do it in that order the coronavirus was discovered in wuhan china in december it has infected over 450 000 people worldwide upending normal life in much of the developed world and forcing japan and the international olympic committee to postpone the summer games in tokyo to 2021 in europe spain has reported over 3 400 deaths from the new coronavirus making it the second nation to pass china s death toll of nearly 3 300 italy was the first country to reach that sobering milestone its death toll has surged to over 7 500 by far the worst in the world it s gotten so bad that military trucks are transporting coffins out of hard hit bergamo the u s is trying to avoid the same fate though mr cuomo said the state s needs are still outpacing projected capacity and supplies projections put the expected need for hospital beds at 140 000 though the current capacity is about 53 000 yet coupled with his order that hospitals expand capacity by 50 plus additional makeshift hospitals being set up with fema assistance and other measures the total supply could end up somewhere around 119 000 beds mr cuomo said they might have to borrow an idea from italy in which one ventilator could be used on multiple patients mr cuomo said the state is going to need 30 000 ventilators there are 4 000 in the system the state purchased an additional 7 000 and the federal government is sending 4 000 he said the governor is urging the white house to use a rolling deployment of ventilators and other gear as different places in the country see a peak in cases let s talk about addressing the critical need in that hot spot he said once you address that hotspot then shift to the next hot spot mr trump said he s ready to invoke the defense production act to direct companies to produce more equipment though companies are coming forward on their own it s a great point of leverage it s a great negotiating tool mr trump said of the korean war era law mr trump says testing which lagged at first is increasing exponentially and now exceeds that of south korea which won praise for its response to the coronavirus although the asian country conducted more testing per capita mr trump requested medical equipment from south korean president moon jae in on tuesday acc
