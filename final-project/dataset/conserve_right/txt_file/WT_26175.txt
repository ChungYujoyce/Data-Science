tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn laconia n h ap amy mcinerney at first saw joe biden as democrats best hope to beat president donald trump an experienced politician with the potential to peel off some of trump s working class supporters then she heard pete buttigieg speak i felt like pete more represented my generation said mcinerney 33 as she held her 6 month old daughter who sported a pink buttigieg 2020 onesie there need to be voices that are younger represented separated by 40 years biden and buttigieg represent the generational poles of the crowded democratic presidential primary biden 76 would be the oldest person elected president buttigieg the 37 year old mayor of south bend indiana would be the youngest biden casts his decades of experience in washington as a remedy for trump s turbulent tenure while buttigieg argues that the moment calls for the energy of a new generation top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time a lot of this is simply the idea that we need generational change that we need more voices stepping up from a generation that has so much at stake in the decisions that are being made right now buttigieg said shortly after announcing his candidacy at a time when the democratic field is sorting out its differences on issues from health to immigration that call for generational change and how democrats resolve it could prove to be even more consequential it s a fight not just over which candidate gives democrats the best chance of defeating trump in 2020 but the direction of the party for years to come so far biden s and buttigieg s strategies have yielded early success biden has led primary polls for much of the year while buttigieg tops the most recent fundraising race amassing 24 8 million in second quarter fundraising the benefit of some of the older candidates is being able to show that experience said tom perriello a former democratic congressman from virginia who was elected at age 33 but newer candidates can sometimes run on the sense that they are more genuinely committed to change having not necessarily been part of the system that people feel has not delivered democratic voters have long been drawn to calls for generational change president john f kennedy laid the predicate in his 1961 inaugural address when he said that the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans the last two democrats to win the white house campaigned in part on the promise of a fresh start bill clinton whose 1992 win at age 46 made him the first baby boomer president and barack obama who swept to victory in 2008 at age 47 over 72 year old john mccain the 2018 midterms also ushered in a younger generation of democratic lawmakers including a historic number of women and minorities who were first time candidates the wait your turn approach to politics has never been particularly effective in democratic politics said ben labolt a democratic strategist who worked for obama s 2008 campaign but for some democratic voters the draw of a younger less experienced candidate is tempered in 2020 by the risks of losing to trump a candidate many in the party view as an existential threat to democracy i don t think the mayor of south bend should run for president in 2020 when the stakes are so high with trump said kate bailey a 30 year old health care advocate from hooksett new hampshire i would love to see the generational torch be passed but honestly i don t feel like this is the best time for a 37 year old to run for president biden s campaign had begun to subtly make a similar case vice president biden believes the issues facing our country today aren t generational challenges they re existential challenges said kate bedingfield biden s deputy campaign manager part of the allure for democrats of a younger candidate has been the prospect of energizing younger voters with obama on the ballot in 2008 nearly 2 million more young people voted in the presidential election yet biden s campaign also sees an opportunity to appeal to older americans who vote at higher rates according to the census bureau s current population survey 71 percent of those age 65 and over voted in the 2016 presidential election as did 67 of those between the ages of 45 65 just 46 of americans under 30 voted while younger democratic voters skew more liberal than older democrats the ideological lanes are more scrambled in the presidential campaign biden hews to the center but two of the other oldest candidates in the race are also the most liberal 77 year old bernie sanders and 70 year old elizabeth warren during the 2016 democratic primary sanders had broad support from young voters who were drawn to his plans to lower college costs and eliminate student debt it s not the age of the messenger it s the freshness the ideas sanders adviser jeff weaver said in an interview with the associated press buttigieg meanwhile shares some of biden s more moderate views including backing a health care plan that would preserve a private insurance market so does beto o rourke the 46 year old former texas congressman but both have called for broad structural changes to the u s government including changing or abolishing the electoral college and reforming the makeup of the supreme court there has to be a new approach and a new way of meeting these challenges or we will not overcome them o rourke said in an interview some of the enthusiasm for o rourke who narrowly lost the texas senate race last fall has been overtaken by buttigieg a gay military veteran buttigieg s call for a generational handoff in democratic politics has resonated with rhu mcbee a 68 year old from tilton new hampshire she sat outside a buttigieg town hall event on friday holding a loaf of homemade bread decorated with the mayor s name she was also wearing an o rourke shirt from the texas primary but had used tape to turn the word beto into pete i ve been working since the late 60s on change and all that but it s time for me to hand the torch to someone who can get out of bed in the morning mcbee said more power to the people who are my age or older who are running for this office but i can t imagine doing that i experience every day what it s like to be 68 and it isn t the blast 37 was the generational divide between biden and buttigieg is indeed striking biden was born in the midst of world war ii and is too old to be part of the baby boomer generation buttigieg served in afghanistan after 9 11 and frequently reminds voters that he is a millennial biden was elected to the senate a decade before buttigieg was born biden is clearly sensitive to suggestions that he s too old to run for president or that he represents a return to the past during remarks friday night at a fundraiser for the new hampshire young democrats organization biden drew comparisons between young people compelled to action by trump and the forces that motivated his generation like the civil rights movement and the vietnam war he put a finer point on the matter the next day telling voters in atkinson new hampshire i don t want to go back to anything old nothing associated press writer
