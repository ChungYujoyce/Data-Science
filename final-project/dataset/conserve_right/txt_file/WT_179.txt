apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic house speaker nancy pelosi is under increasing pressure to send the senate the articles of impeachment against president trump with a group of republican senators introducing legislation monday that would allow the senate to dismiss the impeachment charges altogether if she doesn t turn them over in five days the effort to force mrs pelosi to hand over the articles of impeachment came as former national security adviser john bolton announced he is willing to testify in the impeachment trial if he is subpoenaed by the senate since my testimony is once again at issue i have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best i could based on careful consideration and study he wrote in a statement i have concluded that if the senate issues a subpoena for my testimony i am prepared to testify top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier

investigation of mr trump s july 25 phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky in which he requested a corruption probe into mr biden whose son hunter landed a high paying post on the board of ukrainian energy company burisma holdings while his father now a 2020 democratic presidential frontrunner spearheaded obama white house policy in that graft riddled country democrats argue that mr trump was using his oval office power to influence the 2020 election mr bolton could provide a first hand account of some of the events central to the impeachment case including meetings with ukrainian officials he had declined to cooperate with the investigation citing a court case that weighed a congressional subpoena for fellow white house official charles kupperman against executive privilege that case was dismissed last week shortly before leaving for the christmas recess the house voted dec 18 to impeach mr trump charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of congress but as of tuesday mrs pelosi california democrat will have withheld from the senate the two articles of impeachment against mr trump for 20 days sen josh hawley introduced the measure that would change senate rules allowing the upper chamber to dismiss the impeachment charges after 25 days if the house doesn t hand over the articles of impeachment now when it s time to put up or shut up actually put the evidence forward to be judged now speaker pelosi is saying she may withhold the articles indefinitely the missouri republican said on the senate floor mr hawley accused the speaker of obstructing a senate trial which is to occur after the house votes to impeach a sitting president under the u s constitution we now have the longest delay in american history he said the resolution would deem articles of impeachment transmitted to the senate if the house fails to do so within 25 days according to the text of the measure a senator then could introduce a motion to dismiss the articles with prejudice for failure by the house of representatives to prosecute the full senate would have to vote on dismissal which would require a majority 51 votes majority leader mitch mcconnell has not signaled if he s inclined to support mr hawley s resolution the kentucky republican though did express frustration with mrs pelosi s delay house democrats are treating impeachment like a political toy mr mcconnell said these bizarre stunts do not serve our constitution or our national security they erode both but not all republicans are eager to alter the chamber s rules sen john cornyn texas republican backed away from the push during an interview with fox news i doubt senate democrats would join us in this effort to start this trial and i think the ball is in speaker pelosi s court mr cornyn said no republicans joined house democrats on the impeachment vote making it the first impeachment in the nation s history without bipartisan support mr trump said mrs pelosi s delay is an attempt to impact the 2020 election i think what they re trying to do is affect the election illegally mr trump told radio host rush limbaugh monday mr trump also vented about former special counsel robert mueller s investigation which failed to find a criminal conspiracy between his campaign and russia he said democrats decided to double down by digging into his interactions with ukraine they come up with two articles that aren t even a crime mr trump said mrs pelosi and senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat have insisted that senate republicans agree to a fair trial and allow witnesses to be called mr schumer has said he wants to hear from white house chief of staff mick mulvaney and mr bolton as well as two others from the president s inner circle the house during its 12 week impeachment inquiry did not subpoena either mr mulvaney or mr bolton and senate republicans have charged they shouldn t be responsible for cleaning up mrs pelosi s work but now that mr bolton has said he is willing to testify mrs pelosi suggested that senate republicans have no choice the president sen mcconnell have run out of excuses they must allow key witnesses to testify and produce the documents trump has blocked so americans can see the facts for themselves she wrote on twitter the senate cannot be complicit in the president s cover up most senate republicans however back mr mcconnell s plan for a trial that would hear the case presented by the house before deciding if additional witnesses are needed which is the same process followed in president bill clinton s impeachment trial in 1999 mr schumer hopes at least four senate republicans join democrats in calling for mr bolton s testimony that would give him the 51 votes needed to call a witness during an impeachment trial republicans hold 53 seats in the senate democrats hold 45 seats and can count on the chamber s two independent senators who caucus with democrats given that mr bolton s lawyers have stated he has new relevant information to share if any senate republican opposes issuing subpoenas to the four witnesses and documents we have requested they would make absolutely clear they are participating in a cover up mr schumer said sen lindsey graham chairman of the senate judiciary committee suggested the senate should take control during the impeachment impasse as mrs pelosi holds out mr graham is not listed on mr hawley s measure as an original co sponsor but he said he believes he s on the same page we are talking about the same thing but from my view i think we should urge the speaker to send over the articles if she doesn t i would like to change the rules he told the washington times i don t want to turn the senate over to nancy pelosi mr graham added you can t let her use the rules against us mr mcconnell has bucked mrs pelosi and mr schumer s demands saying his chamber should stick with the same rules and procedures as the senators unanimously agreed to in 1999 the issue of whether to call witnesses during mr clinton s trial was decided after senators heard from both house prosecutors bringing the charges and the president s legal team s response mr hawley s measure has 10 original co sponsors indiana sen mike braun florida sen rick scott texas sen ted cruz tennessee sen marsha blackburn montana sen steve daines arkansas sen tom cotton wyoming
