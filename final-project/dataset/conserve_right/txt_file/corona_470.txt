source ap photo andrew harnik pool with the wuhan coronavirus wreaking havoc to the u s economy the trump white house put together a 2 trillion relief package that was needlessly derailed by politics thanks to sen chuck schumer d ny and house speaker nancy pelosi you remember the theatrics senate democrats and republicans had a bipartisan package after working through the week and weekend on march 21 it was pretty much a done deal and then pelosi who had taken the week off decided to announce that house democrats would put forward their own relief bill killing the senate package the markets tanked which is what democrats wanted to do the house relief bill was trash loaded with left wing goodies and voting rights provisions that had nothing to do with helping american businesses and workers afflicted by the wuhan virus outbreak and after all of this the package that was passed was not all that much different from the one that was unnecessarily nuked by sore loser democrats who still cannot get over the 2016 election pelosi is still trying to play politics during this crisis yet while she does that she s also trying to give the core of the democratic party relief as well millionaires yeah only a moron believes that the democratic party is the party of the working man the working poor or the little guy a large slice of the house democratic majority hail from california connecticut and new york that s where a lot of rich democrats live you have to give these poor people relief right for a party that bashes the rich trump and gop for not being for working families the democratic party sure likes to make maneuvers to ensure millionaires can collect their benefits too via nyt more than half the benefits of such an effort would go to millionaires https t co kzuqozbkgn if you support eliminating the salt cap a 620 billion tax cut of which 56 would go to the richest top 1 and 96 to the richest 20 then you deserve to be mocked every time you yell tax the rich ever again https t co sa2fjcqijc as lawmakers prepare for another round of fiscal stimulus to address economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic speaker nancy pelosi suggested the next package include a retroactive rollback of a tax change that hurt high earners in states like new york and california a full rollback of the limit on the state and local tax deduction or salt would provide a quick cash infusion in the form of increased tax rebates to an estimated 13 million american households nearly all of which earn at least 100 000 a year in the 2018 midterm elections democrats wielded the salt limits in house campaigns against republicans in wealthy blue state suburbs of cities like new york los angeles and chicago democrats voted last year to repeal the cap but the effort died in the republican controlled senate republicans called the effort hypocritical saying that it would primarily benefit wealthy households in high tax states democrats had roundly denounced the 2017 law which included rate cuts for businesses and individuals as a handout to the rich but the salt deduction overwhelmingly benefits high earners the congressional joint committee on taxation estimated last year that a full repeal of the salt limit for 2019 alone would reduce federal revenues by about 77 billion americans earning 1 million a year or more would collectively reap 40 billion of those benefits most of the rest would go to households earning 200 000 or more that is a contrast with the bill mr trump signed on friday which began to phase out direct payments for households earning 150 000 or more oh yes we have limousine liberals going for a joy ride here also you can totally see why a supporter of bernie sanders wouldn t vote for anyone else but him in an election because if you re a die hard progressive revolutionary why would you back anyone who votes for a salt rollback you can also bet that if this is taken for a spin and makes its way to the senate sanders will and should block it if he is truly a left wing revolutionary who is hurting more small businesses and workers impacted by the wuhan outbreak or millionaires do they really need their projected 40 billion in benefits now do they thom tillis s first tv ad of the election is a candid one townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
