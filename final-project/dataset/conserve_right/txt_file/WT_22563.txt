southern states of chiapas and oaxaca this year it has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more who wait endlessly for permits that would allow them to travel legally through mexico u s secretary of state mike pompeo spoke with his mexican counterpart via telephone friday said state department spokeswoman morgan ortagus who s traveling with pompeo in bern switzerland ortagus said the department doesn t comment on details of diplomatic conversations we maintain an ongoing dialogue and close cooperation with mexico on a wide range of issues including border security efforts she said the united states and mexico recognize that managing our shared border is a challenge common to both countries administration officials told reporters in a briefing call thursday evening that mexico could prevent the tariffs from kicking in by securing its southern border with guatemala cracking down on criminal smuggling organizations and entering into a safe third country agreement that would make it difficult for those who enter mexico from other countries to claim asylum in the u s we fully believe they have the ability to stop people coming in from their southern border and if they re able to do that these tariffs will either not go into place or will be removed after they go into place said acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney trump said the percentage will gradually increase up to 25 until the migration problem is remedied mexico has taken advantage of the united states for decades trump said in a tweet friday because of the dems our immigration laws are bad mexico makes a fortune from the u s have for decades they can easily fix this problem time for them to finally do what must be done trump s decision showed the administration going to new lengths and looking for new levers to pressure mexico to take action even if those risk upending other policy priorities like the united states mexico canada agreement a trade deal that is the cornerstone of trump s legislative agenda and seen as beneficial to his reelection effort keeping the economy rolling also is critical to trump s reelection and business was not happy with the
