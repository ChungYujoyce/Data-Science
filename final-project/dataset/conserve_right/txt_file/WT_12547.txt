tion of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic honolulu china has suggested arming hawaii s independence activists in retaliation for u s arms sales to taiwan and recently threatened to challenge american sovereignty by making legal claims to the pacific islands as its territory chinese threats to back several groups of hawaiian independence activists who want to restore the islands constitutional monarchy ousted in a u s backed coup more than a century ago have raised concerns that military facilities on the strategic central pacific archipelago are threatened at a time when the obama administration is engaged in a major shift toward asia as part of its military and diplomatic rebalance michael pillsbury a pentagon consultant and author of the book the hundred year marathon said chinese military hawks known as ying pai told him they are ready to provide arms to hawaiian independence activists in retaliation for u s arms sales to taiwan top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches beijing s extraordinary sensitivity to american arms sales to taiwan even one bullet or a spare tire for a jeep often provokes angry words said mr pillsbury who has held talks with 35 chinese generals in recent years a favorite comparison the ying pai has made to me is how would the pentagon like it if we provide arms to our friends in hawaiian independence movement he said i was incredulous because i had never heard of such a movement in hawaii but after checking i met a few of them mr pillsbury said chinese backing for the independence movement would be a concern some u s archival material shows u s authorities acted on their own in the 1898 annexation of the islands he said something congress later investigated mr pillsbury s book published last week reveals that chinese hawks in the military and communist party are key to a 100 year strategy to vanquish and overtake the united states as the world s leading power another indicator of chinese interest in fomenting unrest in hawaii surfaced in 2012 when secretary of state hillary rodham clinton revealed that beijing threatened to assert legal territorial claims over hawaii mrs clinton said u s ownership of hawaii came up during talks with the chinese after she argued against beijing s destabilizing territorial activities in the south china sea at one point in one of my long discussions about this one of my chinese interlocutors said well we could claim hawaii she said i said well go ahead and we ll go to arbitration and prove we own it that s what we want you to do the hawaiian sovereignty movement is made up at least 10 groups seeking some form of independence from the united states and the re establishment of the monarchy that was ousted in 1893 with support from the u s government and a company of marines the movement is nonviolent and its protests in recent years have been limited to temporary takeovers of government facilities leon siu a hawaiian born musician who holds the title of foreign minister of the hawaiian kingdom one of the groups seeking independence said u s military facilities on the islands are contrary to the original monarchy s neutrality first of all we re not native hawaiians we re hawaiian nationals and we see our country as a lawful independent country and we re working to restore that mr siu said in an interview the bottom line is we want our country back mr siu said he has met with chinese government representatives in the past but was unable to discern their motives or level of support for hawaiian independence he has been working through international organizations and legal institutions for the past 10 years to gain recognition of hawaii as an independent state strategic military site hawaii was ruled under an internationally neutral constitutional monarchy in the late 1800s after the 1893 coup a provisional government and then a republic of hawaii preceded formal u s annexation as a territory in 1898 hawaii became the 50th state in 1959 about 1 4 million people live on the eight main islands hawaii remains one of the pentagon s most important strategic military outposts located in the middle of the pacific ocean some 2 500 miles from california and 4 000 miles from tokyo it is the central point of the military s strategy of shifting forces to the asia pacific region as part of the pivot designed to counter chinese bullying in the region the navy s historic pearl harbor naval base is home to the u s pacific fleet which commands some 200 ships 1 100 aircraft and more than 140 000 sailors and civilians based throughout the asia pacific region the air force operates nearby hickam air force base headquarters of the pacific air force with 45 000 airmen in the region and 300 warplanes the army s schofield barracks is the headquarters for 80 000 soldiers deployed throughout the asia pacific region the army facing sharp budget cuts has announced plans to cut the number of troops based at schofield by 16 000 and another 3 800 at nearby fort shafter the national security agency operates a major electronic eavesdropping post in hawaii known as kunia a defense official said military counterintelligence agencies several years ago conducted routine assessments of the hawaiian independence movement to determine whether it poses a threat if activists turn to violence and threaten u s troops an independence contingency mr siu of the hawaiian kingdom group said he was told by a pentagon official several years ago that contingency plans had been drawn up for withdrawing forces from hawaii in the event of independence but i m sure the u s military would rather renegotiate the military bases to keep forces in place he said pentagon and pacific command spokesmen said they were unaware of any such contingency plan i m not aware of any concerns here in the pentagon for something like this occurring said pentagon spokesman mark wright on a future u s military presence mr siu said hawaiian nationals believe they should be the ones to determine whether u s military bases remain a military presence however would be contrary to hawaii s declared status as a neutral power in 1854 a new hawaiian kingdom government after independence would have to decide the fate of the military facilities i would favor a relationship in which the united states would help protect us because of our treaty of friendship as well as britain and france and every other nation with whom we have treaties such as china japan mr siu said more specifically i would not favor the united states maintaining their military bases here but that s not my decision he said mr siu says that despite the creation of the u s state of hawaii in 1959 the kingdom remained a lawful entity that includes the entire hawaiian islands chain and the remnants of the population at the time of the coup apology resolution under the 1933 montevideo convention the hawaiian kingdom meets all the conditions of a sovereign nation except it is not conducting international affairs on a large scale mr siu said noting that his job has been carrying out that mission at the united nations in new york and geneva for the past 10 years several international court cases also are challenging what mr siu calls the unlawful occupation of hawaii by the united states the independence movement was given new life in 1993 under the administration of president clinton who signed the apology resolution recognizing that the united states apologizes to native hawaiians on behalf of the people of the united states for the overthrow of the kingdom of hawaii on january 17 1893 with the participation of agents and citizens of the united states and the deprivation of the rights of native hawaiians to self determination the hawaiian state government and the federal government dispute the independence activists claims they have tried to placate the movement by offering to recognize native hawaiians as an american indian tribe with the same level of independence indian tribes have had within the u s system of government mr siu said the federal government has dismissed the independence claims as water under the bridge and that past claims of independence are no longer valid because of long u s government control native hawaiian people are quite insulted to be grouped as an american indian tribe and so that has been totally rejected by our people he said cindy mcmillan a spokeswoman for hawaiian democratic gov david ige said the governor was unavailable to comment chinese embassy spokesman zhu haiquan said he has never heard any chinese officials use such rhetoric as you mentioned it is either a serious misunderstanding or a rumor with untold intentions he said china opposes arms
