president this was a very positive day very positive event and i think it aposs good really for the world wallace while the u s and china agree to new talks to and their trade war trump we are going

how it will reshape the democratic race and our power player of the week the new archbishop of washington on moving beyond a crisis in the church wilton gregory archbishop of washington the past is real it aposs painful but the future is also possible and hopefully very positive end video clip wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington president trump has wrapped his trip to asia with a handshake with kim jong un a walk into north korea and an agreement to revive nuclear talks all this just a day after hitting the reset button with china in the ongoing trade war between the world aposs two biggest economies in a moment we aposll speak with the president aposs top white house economic advisor larry kudlow but first chief white house correspondent john roberts reports from south korea on today aposs dramatic developments begin videotape john roberts chief white house correspondent the two leaders walked right up to the line between north and south shook hands then president trump stepped into history becoming the first sitting american president to walk on north korean soil trump this is a historic moment the fact that we aposre meeting roberts after a photo up to document the moment the president and kim jong un and walked back into south korea completing a diplomatic journey without precedent trump a lot of progress has been made a lot of friendships have been made and we like each other from day one and that aposs very important roberts president trump said that invitation to meet kim was on a whim tweeting that he planned to visit the dmz with south korean president moon jae in with kim like to join them the meeting was supposed to last just a few minutes but stretched to more than an hour trump i enjoyed being with you and thank you very much roberts their last meeting in hanoi in february ended badly after president trump rejected kim aposs offer to shutter the yongbyon nuclear facility and said only full and verifiable and irreversible denuclearization would lead to sanctions being lifted in an impromptu bilat today the two agreed to restart talks that had been suspended since hanoi today aposs meeting was a gamble it could have yielded nothing and may still lead nowhere but making history president trump hopes to shake something loose end videotape roberts south korean president moon had high praise for president trump today saying he hopes the president will finally be the one to bring peace to the korean peninsula we are still a long way from that but president trump is in no hurry saying better to get it right than to rush chris wallace john roberts reporting from seoul john thank you if the handshake with kim is the indelible image from this trip the most important development may well be the decision by president trump and chinese president xi to resume trade talks to discuss that let aposs bring in chief white house economic advisor larry kudlow larry welcome back to fox news sunday larry kudlow chief white house economic adviser thank you chris appreciate it wallace would have the u s and china committed to as they resume these talks and is there a deadline for how long these talks will go on kudlow well the first point is just resuming the talks has president said continuing the talks which had been interrupted for a while is a very big deal i think that is the banner headline from this and i think everybody aposs going to be pleased at that there aposs no promises there aposs no deal made there aposs no timetable i want to emphasize that the president said several times this is about the quality of the deal there aposs no timetable there aposs no rush he is comfortable where he is in any case but i think coming back we will resume the talks the two teams will be getting together tariffs will not be raised there aposs no lifting of tariffs on the remaining 325 billion that aposs an important concession by president trump and we also expect the chinese while the talks are going we expect the chinese to begin large scale purchases imports of the u s agriculture products and services so new talks resume talks no new tariffs and agriculture purchases and the rest of it is going to go on for quite some time frankly wallace you aposre saying quite some time are we talking months are we talking years i also want to ask you you had said that the two nations were 90 percent of the way to a deal before the talks broke down have they agreed to keep the commitments they aposd already made or are we starting from scratch kudlow well the president himself mentioned a couple of times in his press conference and elsewhere that he would like to go back to where we left off in early may whenever it was and yes that 90 percent number is fair although the last 10 percent could be the toughest and there aposs no guarantees that the deal will go through look it aposs very important i know from the american side the relationship with china has to be rebalanced it has been very unbalanced in recent years as you know we have had tremendous problems with intellectual property theft force transfers of technology tariffs nontariff barriers various cyber hacking going on and other issues ok those have to be remedied i mean that aposs a very important point of these talks however long that may take it is impossible to predict but we would prefer to go back i don apost know what the chinese side is going to say and we won apost know until ambassador lighthizer and secretary mnuchin and so forth get back together with their chinese counterparts wallace all right one thing we do know is that the big u s concession is president trump has agreed to lift his ban and to allow u s companies to sell some products to the chinese telecom giant huawei here is what president trump said about huawei last month begin video clip donald trump president huawei is something that aposs very dangerous you look at what they aposve done from a security standpoint from a military standpoint it aposs very dangerous end video clip wallace question why is the president agreeing to do business again with a company that he says is an extension of chinese intelligence and that a lot of people say if huawei products going to other countries it will allow the chinese to spy on people using their products kudlow well that very well may be now let aposs be quite careful here the president aposs announcement that these meetings in osaka he was very clear to say that american companies can supply huawei with various products and services provided that there is no national security issues or problems so the commerce department as you may know already offered a number of general service licenses for some sales to huawei on the other hand i think commerce will probably go back after the president aposs decision and take another look at that maybe open it up you know there aposs a lot of technology services telecom related services that really you can find on general markets and we don apost think have any national security implications so i think there aposs a good chance the commerce department secretary ross will open the door on that and greatly licenses crosstalk wallace let me interrupt here though larry let me just interrupt here though because there are number of senate republicans who are concerned about that idea of opening the door and to some degree lifting the ban i want to take a look at what some of them have said begin video clip sen ted cruz r tx huawei is a communist party controlled surveillance agency veiled as a telecommunications company sen ben sasse r neb so if our allies decide to just trust huawei they aposre deciding to trust the chinese government with their big data end video clip wallace and republican senator marco rubio tweeted this after the president aposs announcement this weekend if president trump has agreed to reverse recent sanctions against huawei he has made a catastrophic mistake end sasse so if our allies decide to just trust huawei they aposre deciding to trust the chinese government with their big data end video clip wallace and republican senator marco rubio tweeted this after the president aposs announcement this weekend if president trump has agreed to reverse recent sanctions against huawei he has made a catastrophic mistake larry senator rubio said that the senate will put in place all of the sanctions despite what the president has agreed to with president xi will put in place all of the sanctions with as he put it a veto proof majority kudlow well i appreciate that and by the way i appreciate their national security concerns and the president shares that point of view this is not a general amnesty if you will huawei will remain on the so called entity list where they are serious export controls and any national security inferences or suggestions there won apost be any licenses but having said that i think all this kind of happens is the commerce department will grant some temporary additional licenses where there was a general availability i mean for example some of the chips the chipmakers in the united states are selling products that are frankly widely available from other countries and we don apost think there aposs any national security so we will look at this carefully we will undoubtedly i think the president will be meeting with senators and others our own principles are going to be meeting to take a look at this so this is not general amnesty they will remain on the so called entity list and national security concerns will remain paramount wallace i want to squeeze two more questions so let aposs do quicker questions and answers as you well know the democrats held two debates this past week and they said for all the presidents bragging about a strong u s economy that isn apost working for all americans take a look begin video clip sen elizabeth warren d mass presidential candidate when you aposve got an economy that is great for those with money and isn apost doing great for everyone else that is corruption pure and simple we need to call it out we need to attack it head on end video clip wallace how do you respond to that kudlow yes i just don apost understand in general i hear some of their policies and i hear some of their narrative i don apost understand what planet they aposre describing the united states economy is booming it aposs running at roughly 3 percent average since president trump took office two and a half years ago on this business about bad distribution the blue collar workers the nonsupervisory workers have done the best they aposre the ones running wages at 3 1 2 percent their growth and incomes and wages is exceeding the growth of their supervisors the unemployment rate is low we just had the best june stock market the dow jones in over 80 years that aposs going to fill up the 401 k s of middle class folks everywhere crosstalk wallace but let me just pick up kudlow i just don apost i don apost understand that this is very important these are factual issues ok i understand that there aposs a political spin but these are factual measurable areas and i would just say i do not understand their narrative we are in a strong prosperity cycle crosstalk wallace let me interrupt your campaign speech i don apost think you would disagree kudlow it aposs not a campaign speech i aposm citing facts and figures my friend wallace i all i aposm saying is this i don apost think there aposs any question you would agree and there are and i aposm going to be talking with tom perez later about the economic record but there is clearly a stark income inequality in this country bernie sanders press that point take a look begin video clip sen bernie sanders i vt d presidential candidate at a time where we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of america while 500 000 people are sleeping on the streets today we think it is time for change real change end video clip wallace i aposve got 30 seconds for an answer if president trump is reelected in 2020 what specifically will he do to reduce not eliminate but to reduce the huge gap between the wealthy and the poor in this country kudlow look what we are doing right now the best manufacturing autos blue collar work recovery the fastest increase in jobs the fastest increase in wages those are facts this goes on for many decades the best performance i do not know what some of the candidates are saying i don apost know what their factual basis is economic growth a strong and durable prosperity cycle and i will make this warning some of the policies i aposve heard in some of these early debates in my judgment would do great great damage to this prosperity and jobs and income and wage cycle that we are experiencing so somebody aposs got to do a little bit of fact checking here on what some of these candidates are saying i would simply say this the economy is strong the narrative i aposm hearing from the other side just ain apost so wallace larry kudlow thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sir kudlow thank you appreciate it wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the president aposs meeting with kim jong un and his plan to restart trade talks with china back in a moment commercial break begin video clip trump the relationship that we aposve developed has been so much to so many people and it aposs just an honor to be with you and it aposs an honor that he stepped over that line and i was proud to step over the line end video clip wallace president trump meeting with kim jong un after making history as the first current president to set foot in north korea and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz columnist for the hill juan williams fox news correspondent gillian turner and former democratic congresswoman donna edwards well gillian let me start with you what do you make of the president aposs meeting today with kim jong un it was obviously a great picture but how much does it move the ball in terms of getting north korea to denuclearize gillian turner correspondent well i would say that five years from now if we are looking back on the events of last night of today and it appears that the korean peninsula has been denuclearize then this becomes a moment that really turned a page in the history book this becomes we aposll be sitting at this table saying this is the masterstroke in the trump doctrine but waking up this morning this is the biggest risk of his administration it aposs the biggest possible overture he could make to the north korean dictator i hate to disappoint me with this answer but it is just too early to say there needs to be some time now to see what the next if this turns into a next step even meaning negotiations resume that i would call this a success wallace but if you are on the national security council for bush 43 and for obama if you aposve been on your old job on the national security council and your boss have come to you and said should we do this or not because of course we don apost know what the result is going to be would you have said it was worth the risk or not turner probably not to be frank and i would also say that based on nearly every single national security source i aposve gotten this administration this is entirely president trump aposs idea and of his making virtually zero advisors thought this was a great idea it was something he felt that they were stone his team was stonewalling on so i think he got there and he said screw it they aposre not getting it done i aposm going to get it done myself turner virtually zero advisors thought this was a great idea it was something he felt that they were stone his team was stonewalling on so i think he got there and he said screw it they aposre not getting it done i aposm going to get it done myself and that aposs how this unfolds wallace the screw it again that aposs part of politics ph congressman chaffetz i want to switch to what i think we all agree as we could be more certain is the biggest development for the summit and that is the decision by president trump and chinese president xi not to escalate the trade war but to kind of keep it where it is and to resume negotiations larry kudlow made it clear that they don apost know what aposs going to happen and how long it aposs going to take but the question i do have for you is we do know the president has agreed to at least partially lift his band and that american companies sell some products to chinese telecom huawei a lot of republican senators and members of the house former colleagues in congress are very concerned about this are you jason chaffetz contributor yes i mean for years we had briefings about what this company was doing huawei and what and the national security implications so i think the senators are on the right path i think larry kudlow will help alleviate a lot of those concerns of course selling information or selling services into but you have to go through the commerce department in order to get that license as long as it aposs not national security that aposs going to alleviate some concerns but the president gave up a lot and doing that but i think overall the market will appreciate what aposs going on here and i do think the president is moving in the right direction it aposs a great look between the combination of north korea and the progress with china because if you aposre ultimately going to get a deal in north korea it aposs also going to have to involve the chinese they aposre going to have to be involved in that decision wallace congresswoman edwards the deal to lift at least part of the ban on selling goods to the chinese telecom huawei huge giant telecommunications company and the chinese very upset when the u s banned all sales of u s technology to them that apparently was the price of the president had to pay to get the chinese to resume the talks too high a price donna edwards former congresswoman d md well i think maybe i mean once you open that door it aposs hard to close it i mean there aposs a very fine line even in the technology of figuring out what eventually might have national security implications and whatnot but i think it sends a confusing message to our allies because trying to get the allies also to hold the line when it comes to huawei and i don apost think i don apost know that they know where they stand today wallace yes in fact we were telling our european allies don apost even do business with huawei don apost buy their products because it will put a foot in the door for them to be able to spy in your country and they got to look and say you know well then why are you opening your door to huawei edwards and we were telling that the south koreans as well wallace you know what aposs extraordinary is just how much news there was from just this week and i want to go to a third subject that came out of the president aposs trip to asia and that is that he met with russian president putin and the two of them talked about reporters and also about meddling in the 2020 election take a look at some of their conversation begin video clip trump get rid of them fake fake news great term isn apost it you don apost have that problem in russia we have it you don apost have that problem vladimir putin russian president yes yes yes we have we do have the same reporter mr president will you tell russia not to meddle in the 2020 election trump yes of course i will don apost meddle in the election please don apost meddle in the election end video clip wallace get rid of the reporters fake news and don apost meddle in the election is this just trump being trump and not wanting reporters to tell him what to say or do you see his byplay there with putin is more serious than that juan williams political analyst well i think it aposs both trump being trump and more serious wallace yes means yes williams in other words it aposs damaging yes to both right because it seems to me like so many people especially trump supporters basically excuse his behavior like when he turns a fourth of july in d c into a trump rally say oh it aposs just trump being trump but when you snicker with putin about a free press and about a free election i think you are i think it aposs damaging i think it aposs a sad reminder of how russia is once again poised to interfere in the 2020 election and not seeing any consequence in terms of a leader standing up and saying this is unacceptable i think it aposs damaging to excuse behavior that aposs contradictory to american values putin this week said you know democratic values are obsolete outdated and we don apost have anybody to say hey you know what we believe that elections and democracy are valuable it aposs why america is a shining beacon to the world instead he acts as if autocratic behavior i mean putin is a guy that kills his political opponent and we are sitting there playing footsie with him to me it aposs outrageous it aposs definitely damaging wallace chairman chaffetz we got to wrap up this segment but do you see the joking about get rid of the reporters and what some people are saying is almost hungry might do you see this is serious or are the trump critics just never going to like them and their reading too much into it chaffetz i think the latter part of that is very true no doubt the president has taken a serious stance on this and done more and remember all this interference in the complaints of the democrats have that happened under barack obama aposs watch donald trump was not the president when that happened i want the president to take a tough stance on this i think he has dealt with them very seriously but yes some of the banter in front of the press i think it aposs done in the lighthearted way wallace all right panel we have you two agree to disagree williams yes laughter wallace everybody agrees to disagree it wouldn apost be a good panel otherwise all right we have to take a break we will see you all a little later up next fireworks at the democrats apos first debate of 2020 kamala harris taking on frontrunner joe biden on race relations we aposll ask dnc chair tom perez what it means for the democratic race next commercial break wallace coming up democratic frontrunner joe biden defends his civil rights record after a clash in the first debate begin video clip biden i want to be absolutely clear about my record and position on racial justice including bussing end video clip wallace what aposs the fallout democratic party chair tom perez joins us for an exclusive interview next on fox news sunday commercial break wallace the democratic presidential candidates squared off this week for the first time in two nights of debates which produced a number of contentious moments and raise new doubts about the party aposs front runner democratic party chair tom perez joins us to discuss where the race for the nomination stands now chairman welcome back to fox news sunday tom perez democratic party chairman it aposs good to be with you chris wallace all right i want to start as i suspect everybody would with a bruising confrontation thursday night between joe biden and kamala harris here is just part of that begin video clip sen kamala harris d calif presidential candidate you also worked with them to oppose bussing and you know there was a little girl in california who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bus to school every day and that little girl was me biden it aposs a mischaracterization of my position across the board i did not praise racists that is not true harris do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose bussing in america then biden no harris do you agree biden i did not oppose bussing in america what i opposed is bussing ordered by the department of education that aposs what i opposed end video clip wallace how badly was joe biden who is the democratic frontrunner damaged by that confrontation perez listen chris voters are going to look at the totality of everybody aposs record and the reality is every single democrat running for president on the issue of civil rights is so far ahead of where this president is whether it aposs fighting for voting rights whether it aposs fighting to make sure we enforce discrimination laws wallace i i understand but let aposs not let aposs not get off joe biden perez no that will be up for the voters to decide we have another debate coming up in a month again they aposre out on the stump every single day and i what what voters are going to do and the reason i aposm excited about what we had last week is i think voters saw that we have a deep bench and that our focus on issues of health care making sure this economy works for everyone those are the issues that animate people and wallace we aposre we aposre we aposre going to get to to all of that on friday because clearly biden thought that he had been damaged he tried to repair what had gone on thursday night with kamala harris let aposs take a look at that begin video clip biden i respect senator harris but you know we all know that 30 seconds to 60 seconds on a campaign debate exchange can apost do justice to a lifetime commitment to civil rights end video clip wallace biden said that he never opposed voluntary bussing but that badly distorts his actual record i want to take a look at this in 1975 biden supported an anti bussing measure from then segregationist senator jesse helms in 1976 he introduced a measure to block the justice department from seeking bussing orders in the courts to desegregate schools and biden said this in an interview and apos75 i oppose bussing it aposs an asinine concept the utility of which has never been proven to me chairman perez biden aposs record against bussing is clear perez well listen biden aposs overall record on civil rights is clear and the democratic party aposs overall record on civil rights is clear and what what i always want when i was running for office and what i know these candidates want is they want you to look at the totality of what they aposve done in their career the totality of fighting for voting rights fighting to make sure we hold police departments accountable fighting to make sure that women have equal pay for equal work and that we pass the violence against women act and on this score vice president biden and other democrats have been leading the charge and and we have a frontal assault with this president on these basic core civil rights and that aposs what the that aposs what this is about that aposs what this campaign is going to be about wallace i understand the dissention between democrats and republicans but i aposm talking about the fight for the nomination within the within your party and the question is is the democratic party going to nominate someone who opposed the main tool at one point to desegregate public schools in this country perez the democratic party is going to that aposs going to be up to the voters and they aposre going to look at the totality of everybody aposs record what they aposve said what they have done and who was fighting for them and on all of these issues whether it aposs the economy whether it aposs civil rights every democrat is has the backs of people and that aposs what i think voters are going to see wallace does it bother you personally you aposre the chairman of the party does it bother you personally that joe biden opposed the main tool to desegregate schools perez well listen it aposs up to the vice president to explain his position it aposs up to the vice president to explain everything he has done in his career and that aposs what he did friday and that aposs what he aposll continue to do because again i know him well he has fought for equality and opportunity you you look at what happened with gay marriage wallace not in this case he not in this case he didn apost perez well well again the voters will have to look at the totality of the vice president aposs record wallace ok perez and every candidate aposs record and i invite them to kick the tires on all of our candidates because the good news is that the difference between us and this president is night and day on these issues of civil rights the party of lincoln used to be the party of civil rights and the party of lincoln is dead it aposs the democratic party that aposs fighting to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to realize the american dream wallace let aposs turn to another key moment in this week aposs debates take a look begin video clip unidentified female moderator raise your hand if government if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants ok end video clip wallace every person on that stage all ten of them said that they would provide health insurance coverage for people in this country illegally either under obamacare or medicare for all whichever they supported no talk about preconditions you aposve got to be working in this country no talk about you aposve got to be paying in taxes the basic point was you aposre in this country legally or illegally you get health insurance coverage perez and it aposs an insurance program so you have to pay into it and as you know immigrants including undocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars in taxes and and that aposs the reality and what what democrats also said chris which is far different from republicans is that if you have a pre existing condition you should be able to keep your coverage democrats believe that health care should be available affordable quality health care should be available to everyone and thanks to obama and thanks to lbj medicare and medicaid we aposre 90 percent of the way there wallace ok but let aposs perez we aposre having a discussion about how to get the final 10 percent wallace ok but where but what we aposre talking about is whether or not people in the country illegally should get government benefits remember what president obama told congress back in 2009 here it is begin video clip barack obama former president september 9 2009 those who claim that our reform efforts would insure illegal immigrants this too is false rep joe wilson r s c you lie end video clip wallace now republican congressman joe wilson was called out and quite rightly so for shouting out in a speech to a joint session of congress you lie but the fact is ten years later joe wilson is right about where the democrats are now perez democrats believe that you should be able to buy into a health insurance system it aposs not a handout and i i believe wallace but barack obama didn apost say that and perez we aposre in a different era i believe that what we aposre doing right now is the right thing to do i live in a community wallace why why is it a different era from 2009 perez i i i i live in a community right now where if you are a pregnant woman and you are undocumented we provide you with access to health care because we believe that having good prenatal care is an essential health care issue it aposs an essential issue of economics and frankly it aposs an essential issue of morality the party of lincoln is dead and one of the things that died with it is compassion and this is not a handout chris again this is allowing people to buy into an insurance program people who pay billions of dollars in taxes and again i think that is often overlooked wallace another proposal that was widely supported in the debates this week is a change to our immigration laws take a look at that begin video clip julian castro d presidential candidate when somebody comes across the border not to criminalize desperation to treat that as a civil violation end video clip wallace now as a civil matter and i it aposs important to make this i didn apost understand this until i looked into it as a civil matter people who come across illegally would still be able to be deported but you aposre you would be removing if you follow what mr castro says secretary castro says you would be removing the at least the threat of legal action doesn apost that provide a magnet for people to come into the country illegally because the threat of legal action and jail time is removed perez chris here aposs why we aposre having this discussion about 1325 the reason we aposre having this discussion wallace that aposs the part of the law the criminal perez that aposs the part of the law wallace right perez that is that secretary castro was referring to the reason we aposre having this discussion is because this administration absolutely abused it it establish this so called zero tolerance and the problem with this president is all is he wants to do is look tough he doesn apost want to be effective this zero tolerance policy which sounds tough had absolutely cataclysmic impact that resulted in children being put in cages if you had exercise the discretion properly as prior presidents have done this wouldn apost happen and so the reason we aposre having this discussion 57 percent of all federal cases criminal cases that have been filed in the last two years have been for entering the country illegally i welcome a discussion about priorities that aposs what democrats want to have we believe that we can be a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants we believe that we can provide effective due process to people we believe the reason why this is happening is because in honduras and guatemala and el salvador the countries are falling apart the people coming to the border now are families with children the warped priorities of this administration wallace ok perez the chaos of their policy that aposs why we have to have this discussion we should be focused on violent felons and this administration is focused on separating children from families i welcome the discussion about a coherent policy wallace well it aposs a perez and i wish this president would stop tweeting and start solving the problem wallace it aposs a it aposs a discussion that is going to continue chairman perez thank you thank you for coming in today please come back sir perez always a pleasure wallace good up next donald trump was a favorite target for democrats especially on night two of the debates how well did they do making the case for a one term presidency our sunday panel returns next commercial break begin video clip biden agree that everybody once they in fact they should anyway my time aposs up i aposm sorry end video clip wallace democratic frontrunner joe biden with an abrupt end to this defense of his civil rights record which a lot of folks on twitter had some fun with and we aposre back now with the panel congresswoman edwards how badly do you think vice president biden was damaged this week both by that exchange that he had with kamala harris and maybe more so by all the reporting that that we in the business have done since about his record on civil rights and especially on busing back in the apos70s edwards i think it aposs tough to know at this stage it was the first debate it was not good by any stretch of the imagination for joe biden but you know this is the beginning of what i think is a long process it aposs going to be competitive i saw a handful a couple of hands full of candidates who really should be on that stage and the field is going to winnow out and i think biden is going to be part of that he aposs going to have to work hard to hold that top you know that frontrunner status wallace juan during the heat because a lot of this i either didn apost know or had forgotten i think that aposs true of a lot of people during the heat of the battle over busing in the 1970s the situation was so egregious was these with segregation in the schools in delaware biden aposs home state that a court order that black kids from the inner city of wilmington should be bused out to the suburbs and that white kids from the suburbs should be bused in to the inner city in wilmington a lot of folks my guess is who didn apost know biden aposs record now do you know it to what degree do you think that aposs going to hurt his standing in the black community juan williams political analyst well i think it was known by a lot of people i don apost i think it wasn apost apos maybe generally known and this is a totally different stage he aposs running for president now and so much of it is that he aposs running for president really almost as an extension of the fact that he was the first black president vice president and so suddenly that puts a dent in that that particular appeal and remember so much of joe biden aposs support right now in the polls which has him you know still at 30 percent compared to i think it aposs more than 10 percent higher than bernie sanders is based on black support and going into south carolina where you have a large black electorate in the democratic party side very important but i will say this also i think that it aposs so important that john lewis a civil rights icon jim clyburn the senior black person now in congress both said making deals with segregation aposs was necessary to gradual civil rights advancement in that time and it aposs not fair to necessarily go back and say oh no we have a black lives matter standard anybody playing around with racist is an unacceptable person older black leader in the country don apost take that position chris gillian turner correspondent neither does nelson mandala just ask him williams right you turner sometimes you aposve got to negotiate wallace let aposs turn to another issue because with all the focus on biden there hasn apost been as much attention paid to the democratic attacks on donald trump in the debates this week take a look at this one begin video clip sanders the american people understand that trump is a phony that trump is a pathological liar and a racist and that he lied to the american people during his campaign end video clip wallace congressman chaffetz how strong do you think and this gets back to the issue i was discussing with larry kudlow that for all the presidents talk about with strong economy that it aposs really working a lot better for the wealthy the top 1 percent than it is for all those working people that donald trump said he was going to protect jason chaffetz contributor these are democrats talking to democrats and there aposs no doubt they can go to the end of the earth trying to disparage donald trump and they will continue to do that but they were very ineffective i really think after the two nights of the debates the president is stronger politically than he aposs ever been before he had a great time in north korea and at the at the summit the economy is doing well they can try to throw out all the stats you want but larry kudlow is going to come back with other stats and i think most people across this country when they see that debate and they see everybody raising their hand and the priority going to illegal immigrants and giving them free health care as opposed to the hardworking americans that does not resonate with america williams oh you think the trump administration is doing a good job of delivering on health care for americans i think that aposs so outrageous there is no policy chaffetz i think when you see the democrats when you see the democrats all raising their hand in unison that they want to give free health care to illegal immigrants williams well you can argue chaffetz there was nothing about homeless veterans there was none of that discussion that aposs what will resonate williams oh i think there aposs no i think there aposs no plan after talk of repeal and replace of obamacare chaffetz getting rid of 180 million williams two years of republicans controlling the house and the senate and the white house nothing chaffetz everybody wants to get the democrats all want to get rid of the private insurance that is not a winning wallace ok let me let me let let me let let me let gillian get into this because you know you heard what larry kudlow says and and the numbers the facts are the facts the unemployment rate is low gdp growth is strong wages are rising so how tough for democrats to say well yes that aposs true but it aposs not working for working americans turner i think it aposs really tough you know it aposs kind of the same argument that mitt romney tried to make in 2012 running against president obama when the obama economy was recovering quite well from the financial crisis he tried to say well you know things are well are going well but they could be better i don apost work then i don apost think it will work now partially because as you mentioned unemployment numbers are so low but partially because that aposs always a difficult argument i think to make to the american people because the numbers don apost lie at the end of the day edwards well what what is true is it also is an empirical fact that there is a significant gap in incomes between our lowest income earners and the that 1 percent and i think when voters show up on election day they are going to be paying attention to their wallets they aposre going to be paying attention to whether their families are making progress or not and i think it is going to be a strong democratic argument and that combined turner but that aposs a separate argument edwards no no but turner income inequality is separate from the strength of the economy edwards no it aposs it aposs not at all because part of the reason that you have this inequality is because wages while they aposve raised they aposve been raised going up in this part of the economy they aposve been stagnant for 20 years where families are struggling to meet basic needs and so those things over the long term i think for democrats are going to play out in this economy and the economy is not the stock market for most americans chaffetz and and turner but we aposre talking about things like unemployment as well chaffetz but you aposve got to remember turner we aposre not talking about the stock market edwards unemployment at low wages is really great no i think that americans understand that if you aposre being if you aposre unemployed and you aposre making 7 35 an hour that aposs not putting food on your family aposs table chaffetz income redistribution is not the winning formula it that edwards not redistributing income chaffetz it is edwards just making sure that they have a fair chaffetz democrats argue that they want to raise taxes edwards no just want to make sure that we have a fair economy ph and chaffetz they want to get rid of your private insurance they want to prioritize illegal immigrants wallace wait let congressman chaffetz go and then i aposll let you go go ahead chaffetz they prioritized illegal immigrants they want to get rid of 180 million people have private health care insurance they want to get rid of that they want to raise taxes they talked they they laid it out on the table they want to raise taxes that is income redistribution and it is not a winning formula wallace congresswoman go edwards no no really simple they want to make sure that the people at the top are paying their fair share so that it really does benefit working people that aposs really pretty simple chaffetz and more government and more taxes is not the answer edwards i think the american the american no the american people the american people understand that if you have people at the bottom who are not making a fair wage and can apost take care of their families that at the end of the day that actually hurts the overall economy and trust me all those millionaires and billionaires that can afford to give up a little bit to make sure that the american people have health care and child care and the things that meet their everyday needs chaffetz more government more taxes is not the solution to that williams but i think when you come to health care edwards good government is the solution williams when you talk about paying for school tuition debts i think the american people say something is wrong here because average families are struggling despite all this talk of a great stock market the stock market is not doing it for most people wallace well i aposm glad we settled all that there aposs nothing more to discuss but fortunately we have what a year and a have to discuss it thank you all panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week washington aposs new our archbishop on leading catholics in the nation aposs capital after a series of deeply troubling scandals commercial break wallace in a catholic church that aposs been plagued by years of scandal no archdiocese has been hit harder than right here in the nation aposs capital now a new leader is trying to help the faithful in washington heal and move on and he aposs our power player of the week begin videotape wilton gregory archbishop of washington the past is real it aposs painful but the future is also possible and hopefully very positive i resolved to serve faithfully the spiritual needs of this local church wallace voice over wilton gregory is the new archbishop of washington and he aposs talking about a deeply painful time for catholics here in february longtime cardinal theodore mccarrick was defrocked after being found guilty of sexual abuse last year his successor cardinal donald wuerl resigned amid criticism he failed to respond properly to abuse allegations wallace on camera how do you help parishioners and priests keep their trust in the church gregory i have to be a man who is committed to telling people the truth as best as i know wallace what do you say about the betrayal by cardinal mccarrick gregory i think it aposs horrific it was just a an egregious betrayal of trust that has deeply wound this local church wallace and what do you say about the failings of cardinal wuerl gregory following the mccarrick disaster the issues that cardinal wuerl faced were magnified because they were already shared with a community that was deeply deeply wounded do this in memory of me wallace voice over since taking over gregory has been talking to parishioners and holding listening sessions with priests discussing all the church scandals wallace on camera have they tested your faith in the church as an institution gregory chris they haven apost tested my faith they aposve tested my patience wallace voice over as head of the archdiocese in the nation aposs capital gregory has to deal with subjects beyond religion gregory supports a path to citizenship as part of comprehensive immigration reform at a time when people crossing the border illegally is highly charged wallace on camera when you hear the president talk about an invasion does it disturb you gregory anyone who denigrates the people who seek a better future a more positive way of living for their family to denigrate them is wrong wallace voice over gregory was in sixth grade when he transferred from public to parochial school in short order he decided to convert to catholicism and become a priest gregory i thought about becoming a priest before i thought about becoming a catholic wallace on camera to be a priest it would help be helpful to be a catholic gregory you said exactly what my home pastor said that if you aposre interested in being a priest we aposve got to take this step by step you can apost steal first base wallace voice over the archbishop of washington is traditionally elevated to cardinal gregory would be the first african american cardinal ever in the u s but he says he aposs in no hurry for pope francis to change the color of his vestments gregory i think he would be very disappointed if he sent me here and i g
