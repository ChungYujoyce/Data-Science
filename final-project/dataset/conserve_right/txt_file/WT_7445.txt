returns the russian intelligence gathering ship viktor leonov which triggered intense american intelligence monitoring last month as it sailed along the east coast is back defense sources said the leonov was spotted last week near kings bay georgia home to u s nuclear missile and attack submarines as it made its way up the coast asked about the latest russian spy ship activity john cornelio a spokesman for the northern command and north american aerospace defense command said that norad and usnorthcom closely track vessels of interest including foreign military naval vessels such as the russian ship victor leonov in our area of responsibility we are aware of russia s naval activities including the deployment of intelligence collection ships in the region he added mr cornelio declined to provide specifics but said joint air and maritime operations are carried out routinely in defense of the united states and canada steffan watkins a private ship tracking expert said he identified the leonov operating about 30 nautical miles off the coast of kings bay on jan 6 the russian navy agi viktor leonov is operating off the u s east coast again for its second pass this year mr watkins told inside the ring agi is the military term used to classify spy ships and stands for auxiliary general intelligence these operations are the same as they have been conducting since at least 2012 when they were first spotted by a keen ship spotter in the port of havana making their almost yearly trips the leonov s erratic actions last month prompted the coast guard to issue a warning to shipping traffic on the east coast on dec 16 three coast guard stations stretching from south carolina to florida issued warnings that the leonov was operating in an unsafe manner off the coast this unsafe operation includes not energizing running lights while in reduced visibility conditions not responding to hails by commercial vessels attempting to coordinate safe passage and other erratic movements the warning stated u s intelligence officials have said that one of the leonov s missions is to track undersea cables used for internet and communications traffic it is believed that the russians would target those cables in a crisis to disrupt u s military and civilian communications mr watkins said the leonov s unusual movements are not erratic to anyone watching them yearly they have been stopping over submarine lanes that the u s navy uses to bring submarines back and forth to their naval bases and are believed to be listening for submarines acoustic signatures as well as conducting signals intelligence gathering with an array of different antennas including one mounted under a distinctive weather protective dome that can be seen in photos he said keeping to their usual pattern the viktor leonov will likely depart in the next week or two to continue on its six to nine month tour in the caribbean or elsewhere before returning to their home port in murmansk oblast russia u s seeks ai rules for private sector the white house last week proposed a new set of regulations to guide the development and use of artificial intelligence among private sector companies the objective according to u s chief technology officer michael kratsios is to develop principles for the cutting edge technology that reflect american values of freedom human rights and civil liberties by reducing regulatory uncertainty for america s innovators increasing public input on regulatory decisions and promoting trustworthy ai development the principles offer the american approach to address the challenging technical and ethical issues that arise with ai technologies mr kratsios said a senior u s military officer has said the united states unlike other nations will never permit strategic nuclear weapons to be controlled by machines and that human decision makers will always be in the command and control loop china s military however is considering advanced drone weapons systems that would be permitted to make autonomous decisions without human intervention in conducting strikes russia s military also has deployed a doomsday nuclear counterstrike system known as dead hand that could autonomously launch nuclear missiles in the event key military and civilian leaders are wiped out in a nuclear strike china russia members of the european union japan and south korea all are increasing ai research development and training said former deputy defense secretary robert o work china in particular sees advances in ai as a key means to surpass the united states in both economic and military power he stated in a report by the center for a new american security mr work stated that artificial intelligence can provide tremendous benefits for society but already is being abused by authoritarian states to surveil and repress their populations ai technology also is enabling the use of sophisticated influence attacks on democratic states the united states must make sure it leads in ai technologies and shapes global norms for usage in ways that are consistent with democratic values and respect for human rights he said contact bill g
