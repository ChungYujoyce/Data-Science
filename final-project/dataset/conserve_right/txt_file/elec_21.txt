clinton have intensified attacks on republican presidential front runner donald trump accusing him of manipulating voters fear and ignorance and using anti muslim rhetoric that helps recruit islamic state terrorists jabs that appear to be energizing his supporters and strengthening his campaign but campaign strategists say the attacks are not aimed at knocking down mr trump instead the smears are part of a calculated ploy by democrats who want to help him win because they are convinced the billionaire businessman will lose in the general election it definitely makes my allegiance to donald trump much greater jeff moorman a trump campaign supporter in iowa said after hearing the insults hurled at his candidate see also obama trump exploiting blue collar fears in campaign that is exactly the reaction democrats want said republican campaign consultant ryan williams it is a calculated effort on the democrats part to elevate trump they clearly want trump to be the nominee because they think they can beat him easily said mr williams who worked for the campaign of 2012 republican nominee mitt romney attacks from democrats like hillary clinton and barack obama do nothing but energize donald trump s supporters and i suspect both clinton and obama are smart enough to realize that he said see also donald trump gop race likely to come down to me and ted cruz in a head to head matchup the realclearpolitics average of national polls show mrs clinton beating mr trump by an average of 6 percentage points significantly higher than other republicans such as sen ted cruz of texas and sen marco rubio of florida who trail mrs clinton by 1 5 percentage points and 2 5 percentage points respectively all the other republican contenders fare better in matchups with mrs clinton than mr trump in the average of national polls mr trump has been a target for democrats attacks throughout the campaign but the attacks have grown sharper as he defied predictions that his unconventional campaign would flare out and remained atop most polls taylor budowich a national spokesman for the tea party express suspects mr obama and mrs clinton were trying to stir up conservative voters but he said the scheme likely would backfire pushing a wave of republican voters to the polls sometimes a lot of these political consultants and political strategists get too smart for their own good he said in trying to control the outcome of an election they end up getting the exact opposite outcome than what they wanted mrs clinton the democratic front runner and the odds on favorite to win the nomination repeatedly hammered mr trump during a democratic candidates debate saturday saying his call for a temporary ban on muslims entering the u s fans the flames of radicalization he is becoming isis best recruiter they are going to people showing videos of donald trump insulting islam and muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists mrs clinton said at the debate in new hampshire mr trump demanded an apology monday during an interview on nbc s today show i will demand an apology from hillary she should apologize he said she lies about emails she lies about whitewater she lies about everything she will be a disaster as president of the united states mr trump said that saying he is being used in videos produced by the islamic state also known as isis was another lie from the former secretary of state you re talking about people dying you re talking about making up tapes and videos which don t exist he said an exhaustive search for islamic state videos and online postings did not produce evidence that mr trump was being used as a recruitment tool so the fact checking organization politifact rated mrs clinton s statement false still clinton campaign spokesman brian fallon said an apology was not in order hillary clinton will not be apologizing to donald trump for correctly pointing out how his hateful rhetoric only helps isis recruit more terrorists he said meanwhile mr obama took a swipe at mr trump and the candidate s supporters he said mr trump was exploiting the anger frustration fear of blue collar men who are threatened by the rise of multiculturalism and a technology based economy i think somebody like mr trump is taking advantage of that that s what he s exploiting during the course of his campaign the president said in an interview with npr mr obama took a similar swipe at mr trump and his supporters in a fundraising email for the democratic national committee in the email the president said that because of his race and his unusual name he had grown accustomed to being questioned about his religion place of birth and even whether i love this country i always dismissed that kind of talk but i ve also learned to listen closely when a conversation starts to lean on fear and ignorance he wrote so i pay attention when i hear the republican frontrunner for president call for a ban on muslims entering this country and when their other candidates say we should only admit christian refugees not muslims or that there should be a religious test to determine which people fleeing a war torn country can enter ours mr williams said the attacks that fire up mr trump s conservative supporters also motivate liberals to open their wallets trump for better or worse is the kind of candidate who elicits reactions on both sides he said people can use a lightning rod like trump in politics to their advantage to accomplish what they are looking for copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission
