differences but common ground among us and we hope to continue our effort to sustain global economic growth he said in striving for common ground however the summit declaration finessed differences and yielded no major new initiatives still german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the fact that the leaders managed to hold the line on the issue of climate change with 19 countries committing themselves to the paris climate accord only the united states dissented reiterating trump s decision to withdraw from the paris agreement because it disadvantages american workers and taxpayers merkel told reporters that this process cannot be turned around she said some leaders in osaka indicated they were willing to up commitments to curb greenhouse gases by aiming for net zero emissions by 2050 merkel also lauded the deal between the eu and the latin american bloc mercosur also struck on the g 20 sidelines to create the world s largest free trade zone after 20 years of negotiations the

plastic waste and recommitting to efforts to counter climate change leaders said they d look into a wide range of clean technologies and approaches including smart cities ecosystem and community based approaches the g 20 leaders have long sought to present a united front in promoting open markets and calling for smart policies to fend off threats to global economic growth but the schisms over such issues as protectionism and migration are straining efforts to forge the usual consensus on a broad array of policy approaches and geopolitical issues the summit declaration did not take aim at protectionism but included a call for free fair non discriminatory and open markets weren t we originally seeking agreement on these principles we need to go back to the original point so that we can

koreas on sunday if chairman kim of north korea sees this i would meet him at the border dmz just to shake his hand and say hello north korea s first vice foreign minister choe son hui responded by saying it was a very interesting suggestion and the meeting if realized would serve as another meaningful occasion in further deepening the personal relations between the two leaders and advancing the bilateral relations she said north korea still hadn t received an official proposal for the meeting from the united states trump has at times found himself at odds with other leaders in such international events china meanwhile has sought support for defending global trade agreements against trump s america first stance in gatherings like the g 20 at the outset of their meeting trump told xi he wants to even it up in respect to trade and that he thought it would be very easy to do the two sides have levied billions of dollars worth of tariffs on each other s products and talks on

planned to buy more american farm products china s official xinhua news agency said xi and trump had agreed to restart trade talks on the basis of equality and mutual respect it s unclear however if
