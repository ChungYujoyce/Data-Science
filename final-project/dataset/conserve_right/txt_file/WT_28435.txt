that americans are ready in part for someone who can rebuild the middle class so everyone gets a fair shot but the republican national committee said the first quarter report is proof that the economy which grew 2 9 in 2018 isn t slowing down when voters ask themselves in 2020 if they re better off now than they were four years ago the answer will be a resounding yes thanks to president trump and republican leadership said rnc spokesman michael joyce the economic performance following a disappointing growth rate of 2 2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year came out strong despite a
