group led by aircraft carrier uss george washington is currently under way in waters close to the disputed islands and could move closer if shooting breaks out dangerous lack of talks navy adm mike mullen chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said on wednesday that he regards it as dangerous that china s military is refusing to engage in talks with the pentagon at a time when the chinese military is very aggressive in waters along china s eastern and southeast territory adm mullen said during a breakfast meeting hosted by the christian science monitor that china s military is making a tremendous investment in naval forces and is very aggressive in the waters off their east coast south china sea east china sea even in the waters in the yellow sea a country has a right to build its defense capability tied to its national interests i don t have any problem with that adm mullen said it s the kinds of capabilities that will prevent others that prevent access which is one of their overarching strategic objectives as best i can tell although sometimes it s difficult to see what their strategy is the four star admiral said another worry is that i can t sit down and talk to them about it because i got no mil to mil relationships with them i certainly don t have an expectation that i will sit down and have a conversation with them and we will agree on everything but i think it s dangerous to not be able to discuss the issues even if we agree to disagree defense ceos network as defense secretary robert m gates initiates a major program to cut defense spending by trying to

east german artists a group of eight former east german dissident artists are in washington this weekend to mark the 20th anniversary of the unification of east and west germany with an exhibition of their works the group includes several artists who were imprisoned by the soviet satellite communist regime that fell after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 considered one of the pivotal events of the cold war one artist thomas klingenstein was born in east berlin in 1961 and took part in anti regime art there before he was arrested and imprisoned by the stasi secret political police in 1980 whoever has lived under dictatorship knows that democracy cannot be taken for granted mr klingenstein said in a statement perhaps dialogue and artwork can challenge young people to reflect upon the motives of individuals who engage themselves artistically or socially in the struggle for freedom another artist showing this weekend is frank rodel who also was imprisoned by the east germans i was not allowed to study in the german democratic republic and had to endure the complete loss of all personal freedoms individual rights and dignity for more than three years while a political prisoner he said as a result of being completely stripped of my individuality and freedom a counterreaction developed the complete focus on art which i see as the most individual of all lifestyles he said the american way of life is from the european point of view the one that is the most intensely tied to the concept of freedom for this reason it has special meaning for me to display my paintings in the united states the exhibit is being hosted by breakthrough art organization a washington group that promotes the work of artists who have overcome life s obstacles understanding the risks these artists took to freely express themselves allows us to appreciate our basic freedoms in a very tangible way said breakthrough art founder jeff thinnes the exhibit breakthrough twenty years after german unification is free and open to the public from 12 noon to 4 p m tuesday through friday at the pepco edison place gallery 702 eighth street nw in washington the exhibit runs through oct 8 hunter s passion fresh from a private pentagon briefing on wednesday rep duncan hunter california republican tells inside the ring that the command in afghanistan has made great strides in defeating hidden bombs by doing something basic watching the roads mr hunter who deployed to afghanistan and iraq as a marine corps officer has been pushing the pentagon to adopt in afghanistan what is known as odin observe detect identify neutralize in recent months it has done just that setting up a special task force and sending in more surveillance aircraft and contractors to constantly watch the routes where taliban insurgents hide deadly improvised explosive devices ieds the best stuff is they ve really cut down on the ieds in regional command east dramatically mr hunter told special correspondent rowan scarborough the reason is it s mimicking iraq in the way we were able to cut down on ieds with the surge plus the capability of task force odin which is up and operation in rc east mr hunter s argument is that electronic assets like jammers and detection devices are fine but the best tactic to stop ieds is to watch the roads where they are planted and then kill or capture the enemy in the act he said the command is focusing odin tactics in the east because of its key economic and military routes that are favorite targets of the taliban nobody knows they are having success doing this he said the briefing was provided by the joint improvised explosive device defeat organization jieddo which spends over 3 billion annually to counter the biggest killer of u s troops in afghanistan the task force doing the odin mission in afghanistan is called falcon strike since its recent surge the jieddo office said it has killed 43 enemy involved in ied placements falcon strike has reduced ieds along major eastern supply routes by almost 50 percent it said compared with a year ago it said an aerial detection device known as ursus has found more than 400 ieds the past 60 days contact bill
