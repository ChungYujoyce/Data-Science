dicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the 2020 democratic presidential contenders appear to be growing as divided as their house colleagues over the question of whether president trump should be dragged into the impeachment process they all want mr trump out but they don t agree on whether having the house bring charges against him is the best way to get there signs are cropping up on the campaign trail just as in the house that momentum could be shifting as democratic contenders turn to impeachment as a way to spice up their message and strengthen their appeal with party activists top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches it is red meat for the base of the democratic party in the more liberal cities and more liberal states it is red meat for african americans and it is red meat for women because of the new abortion battle said hank sheinkopf a democratic strategist with all that being said it does help unify the base for someone potentially looking to regain his footing in the 24 person democratic field former rep beto o rourke offered his first full throated endorsement for impeachment at a cnn town hall this week telling iowa voters that the short term risk is worth the long term reward if we do nothing because we are afraid of the polls or the politics or the repercussions in the next election then we will have set a precedent for this country that in fact some people because of the position of power and public trust that they hold are above the law the texas democrat said mr o rourke who has been lagging in the polls could be trying to follow in the footsteps of sen elizabeth warren whose star has been rising since she came out in favor of impeachment shortly after special counsel robert mueller released the findings of his russia probe the report found no evidence that mr trump and his team conspired with russia to influence the 2016 election but it did say the president tried to undermine the investigation leaving congress the option of impeachment and opening the door for the 2020 contenders to take a stand to ignore a president s repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country and it would suggest that both the current and future presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways ms warren massachusetts democrat said at the time a monmouth university poll released wednesday found that by a 56 39 margin voters do not think mr trump should be impeached the survey broke along partisan lines with 74 of democrats 30 of independents and 10 of republicans backing impeachment a separate monmouth survey this month found that more than half of democratic primary

investigative committees should be able to look into some of the questions raised in the mueller report before considering impeachment the congress is attempting to take that up and what the congress should do and they are doing is investigate that former vice president joseph r biden said late last month if in fact mr trump and his allies blocked the investigation members of congress have no

misdemeanors mr trump likely would be acquitted in the republican controlled senate where two thirds of the chamber must vote to convict and remove him the pro impeachment forces argue that the effort could unearth information that the trump administration has refused to hand over to congress damaging him politically and forcing gop lawmakers to pick sides in what could be an ugly public battle sen bernard sanders of vermont has yet to join those calls but inched closer in that direction wednesday telling cnn that it may well be time for an impeachment inquiry to begin but mr sanders continued
