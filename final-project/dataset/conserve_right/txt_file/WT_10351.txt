cted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic a towering bronze statue of karl marx a gift of china s communist government arrived in germany on tuesday two months ahead of a celebration honoring the communist manifesto author s 200th birthday in his birthplace of trier but the gift is getting a sharply mixed reaction some say the statue honoring the author of das kapital and the communist manifesto celebrates a thinker whose ideas were embraced by some of history s deadliest regimes the head of the european union s executive arm is taking flak over reports that he may take part in the bicentennial celebrations this spring european politicians and opponents of communism have denounced the statue s installation and other festivities marking the bicentennial they say the celebration is a slap in the face to millions who suffered under governments acting in the philosopher s name top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches marion smith executive director of the victims of communism memorial foundation a washington based nonprofit questioned the wisdom of celebrating a thinker whose ideas have led to some of the greatest episodes of human suffering in all of history every time marxism has tried it resulted in abject economic collapse or a repressive police state or as we are seeing right now in venezuela both mr smith said in a statement the 200th anniversary of karl marx s birth should not be celebrated but instead marked by serious historical reflection on the human calamities caused by more than 100 years of communist tyranny designed by sculptor wu weishan the 14 foot tall superstructure depicts marx with a bushy beard pensive gaze and flowing frock coat he carries a book in his left hand and steps slightly forward with his left foot the statue will be unveiled may 5 in trier s simeonstift plaza right next to the house where the revolutionary thinker was born other celebrations marking marx s 200th birthday will accompany the unveiling the karl marx house now a museum will debut an exhibition from trier to the world karl marx his ideas and their impact to this day jean claude juncker president of the european commission the european union s executive arm and one of the continent s most well known leaders is expected to speak at the opening of an exhibition karl marx 1818 1883 life works time at the basilica of constantine in trier daniel kawczynski a british member of parliament who fled the soviet dominated communist regime in poland as a 7 year old said an appearance from mr juncker would be in very poor taste and encouraged him to turn down the invitation marxism led to the killing of millions around the world as it allowed a small band of fanatics to suppress the people we must learn the lessons from this and share with our children mr kawczynski told express a spokesperson for mr juncker did not confirm nor deny his plan to attend the marx exhibition saying his schedule is released publicly only a week in advance troubled relationship trier a rhineland town in southwestern germany best known for its spectacular roman ruins and architecture has always had a troubled relationship with its famous son marx and his wife jenny were born in the city and the young scholar and revolutionary spent the first 17 years of his life in trier more than four decades after his death in london in 1883 the leftist social democratic party turned his boyhood home into a museum adolf hitler s nazis gutted the site and used it for a party newspaper the museum was resurrected after germany s defeat in world war ii and got a post cold war boost in interest when the financial crisis shook the world in 2008 officials say the site now attracts some 40 000 visitors a year and that the biggest non german contingent comes from china mr kawczynski said erecting a statue of marx in germany which endured decades of division before the soviet empire collapsed in 1989 is equivalent to unveiling a statue of mussolini in italy since the fall of the berlin wall germany has grappled with how to acknowledge a thinker as consequential and controversial as marx the trier city council approved the statue s installment last year on a 42 11 vote despite objections from some residents who are ashamed of the town s association with the revolutionary thinker and suspicious of china s motive behind the gift setting up a statue of a man who played a major role in the development of communism is a shame and not an honor for trier one resident of trier told the local newspaper as reported by the english language website deutsche welle but trier mayor wolfram leibe told the british telegraph newspaper at the time that the vote has nothing to do with glorification of marx or his ideas those times are over andreas ludwig who heads trier s planning department told the newspaper that the largest country on earth has thought about

regimes were relegated to what marxists would call the dustbin of history it s telling that the statue in trier is being donated by the people s republic of china the largest totalitarian state in the 21st century he said right now beijing is building a digital surveillance state the likes of which even george orwell could not imagine conducting campaigns of outright cultural genocide in tibet and
