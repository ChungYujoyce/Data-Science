the republicans strategy could include using televised hearings to turn the tables by putting on trial the leader of impeachment rep adam b schiff california democrat and chairman of the house

challenge to mr schiff you want to be ken starr be ken starr said rep doug collins georgia republican referring to the independent counsel who investigated president bill clinton come to the judiciary committee be the first witness and take every question asked of you starting with your own involvement with the whistleblower folks this ain t over get ready the whistleblower who initiated the case against the president contacted mr schiff s staff before filing a complaint accusing the president of improperly pressuring ukraine s president in a july 25 phone call to investigate mr biden the contact with democratic staff raised accusations by the president and republicans that democrats probe was rigged from the start mr schiff has denied any improper contact i think they ll try to put adam schiff on trial a source close to the white house said but the president needs to let others do that when did you talk to the whistleblower you lied to us president trump needs to focus on being president republicans well funded campaign coffers also are coming into play a republican super pac released digital ads thursday targeting 29 house democrats who voted for the impeachment measure and represent districts that mr trump won in 2016 and mr trump s reelection campaign went on offense by running a 30 second ad wednesday night during game 7 of the world series promoting the president s political victories and attacking democrats over the impeachment inquiry the campaign spent more than 1 million on the ad buy which president obama s former campaign manager david plouffe called unprecedented so early in the campaign he s no mr nice guy but sometimes it takes a donald trump to change washington the ad stated said mr o connell the fact that he s an incumbent gives him advantages the party apparatus is going to walk in lock step with him and he s got a lot of money if he comes out on top it could be his best reelection ad the white house responded rapidly to the party line vote in the house to move forward with the impeachment probe calling it proof that democrats are still fixated on overturning the 2016 election white house press secretary stephanie grisham called it a blatantly partisan attempt to destroy the president the president has done nothing wrong and the democrats know it ms grisham said nancy pelosi and the democrats unhinged obsession with this illegitimate impeachment proceeding does not hurt president trump it hurts the american people the white house statement emphasized the cost to the nation in terms of unfinished legislative business such as a trade agreement with canada and mexico a plan for rebuilding infrastructure and a measure to lower prescription drug prices the white house also is focusing on the unfair process that democrats have set up to prosecute the president speaker pelosi chairman schiff and the democrats conducted secret behind closed door meetings blocked the administration from participating and have now voted to authorize a second round of hearings that still fails to provide any due process whatsoever to the administration ms grisham said the democrats want to render a verdict without giving the administration a chance to mount a defense that is unfair unconstitutional and fundamentally un american some conservatives are raising alarms about what they view as the white house s ineffective pushback so far to the threat from democrats jack goldsmith a former assistant attorney general in the george w bush administration and a senior fellow at the conservative hoover institution noted that six current administration officials have answered lawmakers questions behind closed doors despite white house orders not to do so this is a really remarkable breakdown of soft and hard presidential power mr goldsmith said thursday on twitter adding that the white house isn t even putting up a fight the wh has no juice no tools he tweeted in so so many ways trump is a weak not a strong president mr o connell said there was another piece of great news hidden in the house party line vote even the dozen or so never trump republican lawmakers in the house voted with the president the rules that were set up by pelosi and schiff were so bad you even got the never trump republicans to agree with trump he said the republicans are going to drive home over and over that the democrats are violating historic precedent they are violating the president s due process and that the democrats have pre planned this from day one david sherfinsk
