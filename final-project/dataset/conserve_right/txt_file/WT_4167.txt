activities in a calculated breach of the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and the trump administration leveled a slate of fresh sanctions targeting an inner circle of officials around iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei the developments coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the hostile 1979 takeover of the u s embassy in iran and the 444 day hostage crisis that followed are likely to trigger further escalation as the trump administration ramps up its maximum pressure campaign against iran the pressure campaign has been central to president trump s strategy since pulling out of the obama era nuclear deal last year administration officials say the goal now is to push iranian leaders into new negotiations addressing not only their nuclear activities but also ballistic missile programs and backing of militant proxies around the middle east top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest

are now operating 60 advanced ir 6 enrichment centrifuges devices essential to developing nuclear bombs the figure is twice the number allowed under the 2015 nuclear deal iranian officials have a history of claiming their nuclear activities are purely peaceful but analysts say the advanced enrichment is not necessary for electricity generation or civilian medical research analysts warned that monday s move may shorten the one year time frame that iran is believed to need to break out and enrich enough nuclear material for bombs ali akbar salehi the head of the atomic energy organization of iran said tehran is also separately experimenting with a centrifuge prototype designed to enrich 50 times faster than the current capability prompting some to warn that tehran is now bent on developing bombs quickly to counter washington s mounting pressure campaign embassy takeover anniversary mr salehi s claim came against a backdrop of anti american rallies in tehran where demonstrators shouted death to america and likened the united states to a poisonous scorpion at events commemorating the 40th anniversary of the embassy seizure an associated press report from tehran
