apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the current uproar over national security agency nsa activities both in this country and internationally as a result of edward snowden s treasonous conduct has caused undue focus on u s intelligence capabilities to the net detriment of our national security sensitive intelligence leaks by mr snowden have received wide coverage by european media under the byline of the hard left activist glenn greenwald their objective seems to be to curtail u s superior intelligence collection capabilities which has kept us safe since sept 11 2001 mr snowden s leaks have left a false impression that the nsa is violating international norms which clearly is not the case every major country is conducting similar electronic monitoring for example former secretary of state madeleine k albright recently stated that she knew the french were intercepting her private conversations when she was our u n ambassador she went on to state that this should not be a surprise to anyone countries routinely spy on each other therefore the french outrage as expressed by french foreign minister laurent fabius that this is an assault on privacy and totally unacceptable is particularly galling former french foreign minister bernard kouchner said everyone is listening to everyone else it should come as no surprise that both russia and china maintain extensive intelligence collection capabilities in a shocking revelation the now deceased russian president boris yeltsin related in the second volume of his memoirs that in 1996 he received a classified cable from russian intelligence reporting that president clinton was having a potentially dangerous sexual relationship with intern monica lewinsky yeltsin wrote that he pondered whether and how to exploit this intelligence we know that this explosive intelligence got back to the oval office the tipoff came from miss lewinsky who in sworn testimony stated that in late march 1997 mr clinton called her to the white house and stated he had reason to think that his phone conversations were being intercepted by a foreign embassy he proposed that he and monica come up with cover stories for their phone sex the kremlin knew and mr clinton knew the kremlin knew this raises the question of what impact did this have on mr clinton s policies toward russia was the transfer of 4 6 billion in hard cash by the international monetary fund in 1998 with mr clinton s support reportedly over the objections of then treasury secretary lawrence h summers to the russian central bank which was promptly stolen related in any way to this intercept top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time since we know russia had intercepts of the president s phone sex we have to assume china with its aggressive cybercapability could have also known if so did it affect mr clinton s policies toward china did loral space and communications ltd under investigation by both congress and the justice department in 1999 for turning over sensitive information to china help correct the repeated failures of its long march satellites the revelation that the united states has monitored the cellphone of german chancellor angela merkel as well as other international leaders has caused obvious frustrations but it is a commonly acknowledged practice director of national intelligence james r clapper stated in his testimony to members of the house select committee in intelligence on nov 5 that targeting foreign leaders including our allies is a fundamental aspect of intelligence collection the fact is that european governments seek nsa assistance in assessing terrorism risks from data the agency collects in war zones and elsewhere it should be noted that when the chinese hacked into mrs merkel s computer in 2007 there was no uproar it was business as usual in all the hyperventilating over nsa s spying capabilities it is easy to overlook how critical nsa s intelligence collection capabilities are to supporting our military forces the information and monitoring of our enemies communications is critical to success on the battlefield nsa intelligence is a key element of planning any military operation it provides the necessary information to our commanders so they can retain the initiative and achieve ultimate success in any conflict it was the nsa s intercept information that allowed judge royce lambert to find iran guilty in washington s u s district court in september 2007 of the bombing of the u s marine barracks in beirut nsa information contributed to judge george daniels decision in new york district court in december 2011 that found iran guilty of providing material and training support to the sept 11 hijackers it was nsa intercepts that linked iran and hezbollah to the 1994 bombing of the buenos aires jewish cultural center most disturbing is president obama s knee jerk response to the current uproar over nsa s activities which his administration had approved precluding nsa from carrying out its mission will not discourage our friends and allies nor our potential enemies including russia china and iran from continuing their spy activities to the net detriment of our national security mr obama must resist efforts to emasculate the nsa as he has already done to our military forces with his social engineering which is destroying not only our military capabilities and traditions but also the will to win retired adm james a lyons was commander in chief of the u s pacific fleet and senior u s military representative to the unite
