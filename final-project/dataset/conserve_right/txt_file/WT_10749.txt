nations representing 55 percent of worldwide carbon emissions formally ratify the agreement the u s and china the world s two largest emitters represent about 38 percent of total global emissions with the formal entry of washington and beijing into the deal the agreement now has been joined by 25 nations representing slightly more than 40 percent of total emissions mr obama is hoping to push the agreement to completion by the end of this year as one of his prime legacy goals white house climate adviser brian deese said saturday s action is intended to provide confidence to other countries to join the pact he said there are commitments from more than 55 nations including brazil argentina and south korea republican presidential nominee donald trump has said he would cancel the agreement if elected mr deese said despite opposition by mr trump and by many republicans in congress there is broad support among the public and the business community for an international climate agreement we re quite confident the united states will continue to be a part of this agreement going forward he said environmental groups hailed the move greenpeace east asia s senior climate policy adviser li shuo said political ambition must keep up with rising sea levels faced by vulnerable communities around the world sierra club executive director michael brune said the historic announcement has set a global precedent that has catapulted the world to the cusp of formally implementing the paris climate agreement and will have major positive implications for generations to come the agreement forged by 195 nations last december in paris sets non binding targets for the reduction of carbon emissions that most scientists blame for rising temperatures and sea levels the obama administration is not calling the pact a treaty thereby avoiding the step of taking it to the senate for a ratification vote and likely rejection myron ebell director of the center for energy and environment at the conservative competitive enterprise institute said the senate should make it clear that the agreement will have no force or effect until such time as it is ratified by the senate then the congress should prohibit any funding for the paris climate treaty the green climate fund and the underlying un framework convention on climate change mr ebell said finally if the obama administration ignores the congress the senate should take up and vote on ratification of the paris climate treaty a vocal opponent sen james m inhofe oklahoma republican has criticized the deal as full of empty promises that will have no meaningful impact on the climate white house aides say the president has the legal authority to ratify the accord without the two thirds senate vote required for treaties they say the pact is merely an executive agreement the united states has a long and well established process for approving executive agreements that is distinct from treaties mr deese said executive agreements represent over 90 percent of the international agreements that the united states enters into he said republican presidents ronald reagan and george w bush joined important international environmental agreements by using executive agreements steve groves an analyst at the conservative heritage foundation said mr obama s action is a shameful unilateral power grab the white house has long sought to call the paris agreement anything other than a treaty in order to avoid the senate s advice and consent role under article ii of the constitution mr groves said but let s be clear the paris agreement is a treaty by every definition of the word and should be submitted to the senate for its consideration this action by the president is an intentional end run around the american people and their elected representatives done to advance an ineffective expensive climate agreement the u s should stay out of the paris agreement in a head to head meeting later mr obama and mr xi discussed issues including north korea s nuclear belligerence maritime security trade and human rights the president reiterated america s unwavering support for upholding human rights in china and stressed the need for china to protect religious freedom for all of its citizens the white house said there were tense moments upon mr obama s arrival in china as the president disembarked from air force one a chinese
