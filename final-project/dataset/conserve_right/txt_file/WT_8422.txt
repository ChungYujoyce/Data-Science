apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion china s foreign ministry on friday blasted state department spokeswoman morgan ortagus the day before ms ortagus called china a thuggish regime the state department s harsh words were in response to chinese targeting of an american diplomat stationed in hong kong and her family relations between beijing and washington have markedly deteriorated in recent weeks over various issues especially the escalating protests in that territory a special administrative region of the people s republic of china i don t think that leaking an american diplomat s private information pictures names of their children i don t think that s a formal protest that is what a thuggish regime would do ms ortagus said at a press briefing thursday that s not how a responsible nation would behave top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ms ortagus did not mention the name of the diplomat but it was clear she was referring to julie eadeh the chief political officer in the u s consulate in hong kong on tuesday at the j w marriott hotel ms eadeh met with joshua wong and other protest figures the subject of the talks according to mr wong was the hong kong human rights and democracy act of 2019 a bill in congress and the u s sale of tear gas to the hong kong government soon after ta kung pao a pro beijing hong kong newspaper that often carries beijing s positions ran a photo of the meeting and released ms eadeh s personal details beijing had apparently launched a coordinated attack china central television the chinese state broadcaster called the american diplomat the behind the scenes black hand creating chaos in hong kong chinese officials immediately chimed in there were reports suggesting julie eadeh is a trained subversion expert at the us consulate in hong kong chen weihua bureau chief of the official china daily tweeted thursday morning her meeting with hk protesters would be evidence of us inciting and instigating the riots in hong kong is she under the direct order of former cia chief mike pompeo the black hand was caught red handed tweeted lijian zhao a chinese diplomat in islamabad who also used language similar to mr chen s in addition china on thursday summoned senior officials of the consulate in hong kong to lodge stern representations over the meeting with what the global times a tabloid controlled by people s daily called hong kong secessionist forces beijing of course has every right to file a protest but its release of a diplomat s personal information is out of bounds that ms ortagus correctly said is completely unacceptable it is also lawless despicable and dangerous especially dangerous in the context of the increasing violence in hong kong the demonization of an american official and the naming of her husband and young children can only be described as an incitement to injure wound maim or kill activists have accused beijing of encouraging by similar signaling vicious attacks by about 100 white shirted thugs on july 21 in yuen long in hong kong s new territories the attack in the mass transit railway station left 45 bloodied in any event it s clear american diplomats and their families now being targeted by beijing officials are no longer safe on chinese soil china is more than just talk last spring american diplomats assigned to the guangzhou consulate suffered brain injuries caused by mysterious sonic attacks because beijing runs a semi totalitarian surveillance state chinese officials were either perpetrators of the attacks or complicit in them more violence against americans is undoubtedly on the way the targeting of ms eadeh and her children is an indication that beijing s mid may declaration of a people s war against the u s people s daily and xinhua news agency both carried the declaration run by global times was more than just a propaganda blast at the moment washington has to assume beijing will continue its campaign to injure u s diplomats because the u s government cannot adequately protect them washington should begin pulling personnel and dependents out of china there is no point in leaving potential hostages in the country beijing has shown what it is capable of it has for instance detained and held for months the two michaels canadians michael kovrig a former diplomat and michael spavor a businessman they are being held in apparent retaliation for the lawful detention at the request of the u s of huawei technologies chief financial officer meng wanzhou china cannot acknowledge that it has by its own actions lost hearts and minds across hong kong society the inflammatory and baseless allegations against washington in general and ms eadeh in particular show that beijing is lashing out desperately seeking an enemy the people s republic is a lawless criminal state it does not belong in the community of nations and it is wrong to ask the representatives of our government to put themselves and their dependents in harm s way gordon g chang is the author of the coming collapse of china follow him on twitter gor
