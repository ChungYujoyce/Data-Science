underwhelming when i told him i was in the keystone state i think he sounded just a little bit jealous the vice president said to a few audible groans and tepid applause but when pence turned to his assignment for the trip last week to york pennsylvania selling the administration s new trade deal with mexico and canada the group warmed up by the time he got to the part about calling on congress to pass the u s mexico canada agreement his audience cheered him on top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free

another with mexico pence has been traveling the country trying to build support for a free trade deal while his boss promotes the power of tariffs pence has been in places like eau claire wisconsin and lebanon indiana speaking about the benefits of lowering them the vice president isn t just trying to boost support for the trade agreement which the administration wants passed this summer he s
