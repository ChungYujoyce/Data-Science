 the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic chinese artist and outspoken activist ai weiwei has had a complicated relationship with the communist regime in beijing one of china s most revered artists he was chosen as chief designer of the so called bird s nest stadium for the 2008 olympics in 2007 mr ai distanced himself from his olympic contribution calling the stadium a pretend smile from the same regime that imprisoned his family during mao s brutal cultural revolution of the 1960s and 70s he also denounced steven spielberg for his involvement in the choreography of the beijing olympic opening ceremony a project from which the legendary hollywood director ultimately withdrew after some

weiwei continuously marches forward he will inevitably touch the red line one day the editorial chillingly concluded ai weiwei will be judged by history but he will pay a price for his special choice leaving many observers to worry that mr ai has been imprisoned and possibly even killed what makes mr ai s arrest particularly remarkable is his stature both within china and internationally mr ai not only comes with artist activist pedigree his father poet ai qing was imprisoned during the cultural revolution but his work is prominently featured in galleries and exhibits throughout the rest of the
