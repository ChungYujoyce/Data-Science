apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic recent editorials of statewide and national interest from ohio newspapers it s past time to put country first akron beacon journal top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state nov 17 how did america get here this fractured place where facts matter less and less and neighbors can t even share how they really feel how did we become a nation split by extremists on both sides of the political spectrum people willing to say and do anything to win and hold power witness the shameful defense of president donald trump by those who privately know the facts show his unforced ukraine error replaced national interests with personal ambitions and more important why do the many americans who fall in the middle of most political debates tolerate the insanity we see daily in washington d c and even in columbus at times elected democrats actually called for impeaching trump before he took office republicans had similar plans for hillary clinton that magically disappeared when she lost both sides exploit every perceived political opportunity while finding more brazen ways to punish or embarrass the other for putting it through the last so called scandal sure deny us a supreme court candidate until a new president arrives we ll show you how would republicans be handling the ukraine affair if clinton was linked to the same set of facts unless something miraculously changes the next democratic president had better make sure he or she never tiptoes near any problems we can blame partisan cable news coverage filled with talking heads and extremist websites masquerading as legitimate news operations facebook surely has done plenty to spread false and highly partisan information the mere ability of people to find others with similar prejudices online creates opportunities for once niche causes to gain momentum perhaps it s the fault of the two party system that consistently produces partisan presidential candidates a significant number of americans will dislike or even despise primary victories require promises that impress the left or right with the winners trying to convince moderates they didn t mean what they said a few months before yet the blame really rests on all of us we continue to allow elite power brokers to play games with our lives we ve allowed them and rich special interest groups to drive wedges between young and old even families does anyone believe pre existing medical conditions should be excluded from medical insurance coverage does anyone believe universal health care is possible without higher taxes do we want to deport children brought to america by their parents do we want our border to be a lawless waypoint don t we wonder why our government failed to stop the opioid epidemic these are not democratic or republican issues they are american issues that reasonable people should be able to resolve with respectful dialogue many of us are too busy with life to navigate beyond the partisans carefully crafted talking points including outright lies designed to exploit our prejudices and get us angry at the other side repeat the same lie enough times and it can become fact to those who don t consider other viewpoints inside their political cocoon if you don t think that s dangerous just wait for a deep fake video putting words in a leader s mouth and worst of all we re willing to explain away unacceptable behavior by our side just to preserve power democracy can t be a spectator sport being a citizen demands more than just voting it requires our engagement in our communities and nation it demands a willingness to put country and community before one s self interests especially if you hold public office it s time to ask what s best for america or your town when will we say enough is enough online https bit ly 359xt7m central booking pilot in cuyahoga county should move ahead quickly it s a matter of justice cleveland plain dealer nov 17 criminal justice reform advocates prosecutors and others have pressed for years for a centralized booking facility in cuyahoga county for many reasons these include fairness and equality before the law as well as keeping more people from unnecessarily long jail stays that potentially would also help suspects keep their jobs and avoid other disruptions in their family obligations while reducing jail crowding and the jail costs paid by taxpayers so we applaud cuyahoga county executive armond budish and chief of staff bill mason the former county prosecutor for their plan to proceed as soon as possible to convert unused space at the justice center into a temporary centralized booking facility to test out this concept central booking deserves buy in from all stakeholders in this county who care about the smoothest fairest and most cost effective operation of the county justice system setting up a temporary booking center in the building is a separate issue from the future of the justice center and should not be tethered to those big dollar bricks and mortar deliberations that will likely take months maybe years to resolve county officials are still working out details on their central booking proposal including how much it will cost yet reducing jail stays would also save money the dayton daily news recently reported that statewide ohio taxpayers pay about 266 million annually to hold suspects in jail prior to trial the arguments for centralized booking dovetail with strong arguments for bail reform reform that s already been implemented in cleveland municipal court and is now being pushed statewide by the ohio supreme court via significant proposed changes in ohio criminal rule 46 which sets statewide bail setting requirements the high court s bail reform proposal now being reviewed after a public comment period that ended nov 6 would require all ohio courts to release defendants on the least restrictive conditions subject to flight and public safety risk considerations as with earlier ohio legislative attempts to reform bail practices statewide the high court s proposal is getting pushback from the bail bond industry but is supported by the ohio state bar association the dayton paper reports online https bit ly 33z5zv3 does this make us better toledo blade nov 17 how is impeachment working out so far it is hard to see that anyone is better off the president the republicans the democrats it is hard to see how the country is better off the democrats have put on their blue jerseys and the republicans their red ones three state department professionals at least gave us respite from the buffoonery but at the end of the day we were left with adam schiff s unctuousness and jim jordan s ranting interruptions and badgering neither leaves a good taste in the mouth of the body politic watergate was different the proceedings had substance and dignity in large measure because the people conducting them did the watergate crisis following as it did the vietnam war the anti war movement and the killings of the rev martin luther king jr and robert kennedy was a trauma for the country we had been through a lot and now we were considering removing a president from office no small thing the leaders who guided us through watergate sam ervin in the senate and peter rodino in the house approached their task with great sobriety and care they followed rules of evidence and procedure and treated their republican counterparts not as adversaries but partners they did not have to do that they wanted to because they wanted the system and the people to be stronger at impeachment s end those men and their gop colleagues took pains to step back one step from pure partisan politics as a result as evidence mounted that the president had broken the law men like republican sen howard baker and senate watergate committee minority counsel fred thompson detached from the party line they went with the evidence eventually a series of juridical proceedings caused the president s political support to erode in the senate politics followed a serious deliberative process conducted by responsible people some of whom emerged as statesmen doing things in the reverse order will not work if we start with politics highly partisan politics it is unlikely that we will get a result that seems fair and just yes impeachment will always be an inherently political process but as with judicial nominations if it is totally political if there is no weighing of evidence or balancing of values the process will not be seen as honest or honorable by much of the public as traumatic as watergate was the country emerged stronger and feeling positive about our constitutional system and the ability of our leaders to manage crisis and conflict it has only been a week but these hearings are not accomplishing a similar end they are not educating informing and uplifting us they are simply deepening already deep divisions what we have learned so far is that the president made at least one phone call and maybe more that many perhaps most would see as improper and a violation of presidential norms that information is not new we have learned that professional diplomats and politicians had legitimate policy differences with the president that is not new either we have learned that aid to ukraine was held up for a time by the president democrats say it was bribery and a circuitous path to meddling in the 2020 election republicans see it as appropriate presidential bargaining based on concern about corruption there is similar disagreement about the intent and actions in ukraine by the obama biden administration an election is surely the time and place to debate policy and norms impeachment is a totally different instrument it is not a debate a contest or a campaign but a juridical proceeding it seems most likely that at the end of the process democrats will see the president s actions as impeachable just as they did at the start of it and that most republicans will see them as justified in fact and this ought to sober all of us it is quite possible that not a single democrat will say that violations of norms are not generally impeachable and that there must be a high crime to impeach and it is quite possible that not a single republican will say this was beyond the pale and impeachable no one will take off his or her jersey and behave with the indifference of a judge or jury no one will even try no statesmen and no nobility or deeper understanding will come of all this and if that is the outcome of these hearings the moral intellectual and constitutional health of the nation will not be helped but will be hurt and the bitterness of impeachment will further infect our already rancid national politics online https bit ly 2rrlzpf a dozen years later jim jordan has not changed nov 16 the lima news republicans never made it a secret they wanted jim jordan to be one of their nine members on the house permanent select committee on intelligence the panel s hearings will determine whether president trump s behavior warrants impeachment and jordan has clearly defined himself as the person who will go toe to toe against any and all of trump s critics his unflinching loyalty actually comes to a fault we believe yet it is exactly what s wanted by those who voted him into office seven times in the highly conservative 4th congressional district which snakes all the way from central ohio to the shores of lake erie it s been called a district where the name of a potted plant could win an election as long as the plant s name had an r beside it the 4th district has voted republican in all but 16 years since the civil war while jordan is beloved by most in his home district he s loathed elsewhere the accusations against him are many he s been criticized for being bombastic too combative being accusatory playing up to the sean hannitys and rush limbaughs of the world and even for not wearing a suit or sport coat to hearings on wednesday and friday jordan showed up to the impeachment hearings wearing his trademark look shirtsleeves and a yellow tie what people don t understand about jordan and probably why he s such a darling of the republican s right wing is that jordan doesn t just drink the conservative kool aid he manufactures it there s nothing wish washy about him which in itself is unusual for almost any politician inside the beltway twelve years in washington has not changed the 55 year old jordan if anything it has invigorated him to the point where he is known as the conscience of the gop s conservative wing that at times has come with a price even from inside his own party in 2013 jordan and 150 other republicans broke with house speaker john boehner to oppose a compromise to extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for families earning less than 450 000 jordan voted against it because it raised taxes on upper income americans and contained puny budget cuts later he joined a group of conservative republicans to torpedo a house republican leadership plan to provide health care coverage for people with pre existing health conditions some ohio republicans were so irritated with his resistance to compromise on both issues that they briefly toyed with eliminating jordan s congressional seat during the 2011 redistricting battles as recently as the past two weeks jordan had to again defend himself against accusations that he had knowledge of the perversions facilitated by dr richard strauss when jordan worked as an assistant wrestling coach at the ohio state university is it a coincidence the claims by a wrestling referee came just before the impeachment hearings began you be the judge jordan s political rise began in 2006 when he won a surprisingly easy congressional primary over findlay banker frank guglielmi then cruised past democrat rick siferd in the november general election it was no secret that then u s rep mike oxley a republican who held the office for 25 years before announcing his retirement favored guglielmi but jordan despite overwhelmingly being outspent by guglielmi won the old fashioned way he knocked on doors shook hands and spoke to church groups veteran organizations rotary clubs and women s groups send him an invitation and chances were good the 43 year old state senator would make a visit happen in that regard jordan hasn t changed a dozen years later he s still highly visible throughout his district he ll tell you he was sent to washington to reduce the size of government cut the deficit and halt tax increases the people s business as he likes to call it in recent years however he s spent less time on those objectives instead he s taken on the role of government watchdog and as the president s protector in chief that s made him a frequent visitor of the sunday morning talk shows which has drawn the ire of democrats but back in ohio s flat lands he still wins elections by double digit margins you can bet jordan will continue to have strong support across the 4th district as the impeachment proc
