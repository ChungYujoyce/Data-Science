announcing his travels until kim returned home analysts said beijing appeared to be trying to normalize such visits cheng xiaohe an associate professor at renmin university s school of international studies in beijing said the frequency of kim s visits was unprecedented he noted that unlike on previous visits china s state broadcaster cctv announced kim s visit before his departure this is an improvement this shows that china is moving toward a healthier and more normal direction in relations with north korea cheng said the visit comes as a dispute over the large trade imbalance between china and the u s has been escalating straining ties between the world s two largest economies and moving them closer to a potential trade war trump recently ordered tariffs on 50 billion in chinese goods in retaliation for intellectual property theft the tariffs were quickly matched by china on u s exports a move that drew the president s ire on tuesday morning china woke to news that trump directed the u s trade representative to prepare new tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports a move swiftly criticized by beijing a trade war with the u s could make it less attractive for china to use its influence over north korea to help the u s achieve its objectives of denuclearization the potential comprehensive trade war will make the cooperation between china and u s in north korea s nuclear issue more complicated cheng said there will be a big question mark over whether china and u s will continue this cooperation associated press writers gillian wong and adam s
