national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge two weeks ago i wrote an analysis of the presidential race for the australian newspaper the polls still showed hillary clinton far ahead but the race had begun to tighten the smart money should still be placed on clinton i argued but that could soon change 2016 now looked as if it had morphed into a battle between hillary s lies and trump s gaffes it would now be decided by whichever of these turned out to be the more outrageous and by two extraneous factors the debates and events since then trump has caught up with clinton nationally and in many battleground state polls the two candidates are currently level pegging overall and when it comes to gaffes lies the debates and events the advantage has gone marginally to trump the debates have yet to happen new information continues to trickle out that contradicts clinton s explanations of her e mail scandal the main event has been her apparent public collapse from pneumonia a turn right out of p g wodehouse unseen in the background fate was quietly placing lead into the boxing glove clinton has blundered into gaffe territory with her basket of deplorables remark while trump s latest gaffe his hemming and hawing on whether obama was born in the u s and the subsequent chaotic press conference in which he attempted to disavow the birthers and blame clinton for creating them is two edged it is embarrassing to him and guaranteed to earn another round of negative press but it also rekindles discussion of a discredited conspiracy theory that will now serve as a distraction for her trump may now even be the favorite how could he make that slim probability a near certainty by sticking to the campaign scripts that he writes with his generally shrewd and conservative advisors while avoiding gaffes and ad libs at this point that may well be enough but he could make assurance doubly sure by adopting a slightly different political persona that nonetheless incorporated all the distinctive policies that made him popular in the first place i think i knew this before but as it happens charlie cooke beat me to it in a recent column he imagined how trump might fare if he ran a campaign on the same issues immigration protectionism rejection of political correctness nationalism but in the opposite spirit that of a compassionate conservative or in uk terms a one nation tory how would he do if he were to exude smoothly benevolent platitudes to the voters as he gladhanded his way through a feel good campaign mexicans splendid hard working guys great family folk love em and when we ve got the economy booming again as a result of my policies they ll have their place in the sun until then though we have to give our own hard working americans the first crack at the new jobs look the mexicans are fine people they ll understand cooke concludes persuasively in my eyes that trump would then walk through an open door trump is nonetheless the master of his own fate at this point he lives by the gaffe and if he dies he will die by the gaffe of course it s getting a little late for such a personality make over and trump evidently chafes at least in practice at the notion of adopting a false front for the campaign it would be easier for him if he had gradually worked on these campaign issues in advance and legitimately made them part of his own thinking about what would make america great again but by and large he blundered into the issues that have fuelled and sustained his campaign he didn t know the arguments for them and though he s perfectly able to mug them up he sometimes forgets what they are and contradicts himself and his policy papers he hires knowledgeable advisors but often ignores them in a way it s like watching a man who midway through an attempt to cross niagara falls on a tightrope suddenly consults a book with the title how to cross niagara falls in six easy lessons but finds it boring and throws it away trump is nonetheless the master of his own fate at this point he lives by the gaffe and if he dies he will die by the gaffe clinton is a kind of puzzled bystander at her own fate as she tries to recall what will be in the next batch of e mails to hit the fan charlie points out that his advice to trump stemmed from disinterested tactical machiavellianism and that he wouldn t like trump as harold macmillan or a tory fied gop at all as an un reconstructed thatcherite i largely agree with him but as someone who lived from 1942 until 1975 under with and in such a party i can assure him that it s not too bad muddled decent split the difference tories were kind decent patriotic people who had no desire to remake society in accordance with some utopian plan their problem was ideological laziness they went with the statist flow complaining mildly but thinking it inevitable until its costs in tax and regulation became unignorably heavy at which point mrs thatcher seized control of her dozy party and gave it what it had always said it wanted something like that would doubtless happen here were the gop to follow charlie s insights if trump either loses or fails in office indeed one wonders why it hasn t happened already if the electoral appeal of such a policy is as strong as he says why haven t ambitious republican entrepreneurs taken up the themes of immigration control rejection of political correctness and nationalism and won elections by making those themes as blandly palatable as possible and seriously addressing the plight of those hit by economic change even if we have to come up with more imaginative policies than a self destructive protectionism after all persuasion is part of the politician s job despite trump s gaffes and personal baggage he has shown the strength of his platform s appeal to the republican half or 40 percent of america from moderate suburbanites to blue collar ex democrats if we assume that gop moderates are not too greatly hampered by addiction to political principles why have they avoided these popular issues it s not as if they have either a great package of their own moderate policies or a growing affection for the classical liberal conservatism that charlie and jonah goldberg espouse i don t want to call this package trumpism or trumpery but for the sake of a last line i have to do so trumpery is too important to be left to trump and the trumpettes conservatives have to incorporate its main elements into yet another fusionist new conservatism that offers enough to all legitimate conservative factions to keep them inside the big tent they have to devise and argue for credible responses to automation and the new economy that don t reek of excessive long term optimism and they should notice and exploit a linked set of issues with growing appeal such as the rise of global governance the growing assault on the nation state the erosion of democracy and the spread of political correctness from the student left to courts themedia the internet and the federal and state bureaucracies and most interesting of all to the german government and the eu that increasingly determine how we live and are governed conservatives have largely allowed the left to monopolize the interpretation of such issues as a mindless populism in their different ways trump s rise and brexit have revealed their wider importance it can be done and all suggestions to the contrary should be met with active resistance please don t tell me that nationalism is incompatible with classical liberalism
