apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic israeli military intelligence is facing criticism for failing to comprehend the network of tunnels and other underground facilities built by hamas terrorists in the gaza strip dan pollak co director of government relations for the zionist organization of america said early estimates of israel s operation to root out hamas rockets has diminished the terrorist group s arsenal hamas 10 000 rocket arsenal is now believed to be half that number we ll see when the war was over mr pollak said in an interview but it is clear that the underground tunnel complex was far more extensive than israeli military intelligence understood photos best concealed carry handguns information that israel defense forces reportedly obtained from captured hamas fighters revealed that the group was planning to use several gaza tunnels that extend under israeli territory for a major attack timed with the beginning of the jewish new year rosh hashanah on sept 24 the plan called for hamas fighters to surface from the tunnels in israel and kill as many people as possible the plot was first reported by the israeli newspaper maariv israel s military operation against hamas in gaza has gone on longer than expected because of the discovery of the extensive tunnel network which is estimated to have cost as much as 2 billion to construct photos top 10 u s fighter jets many of hamas longer range rockets have been destroyed although the israeli military is looking for other tunnels in gaza where rockets could be kept the next 9 11 could be a cyberattack army lt gen michael t flynn director of the defense intelligence agency last week called the threat of cyberattacks against u s infrastructure a major strategic vulnerability eighty percent of the affected areas in our country are what we would call a critical infrastructure and they re in the private world gen flynn said during a security conference they re not really in the government world so most of our vulnerabilities are not on the government side where we do a lot of things to protect ourselves it s out there in the private world cyberattacks are key strategic threats as states such as china and russia have been detected mapping u s electrical grids and financial networks two of the most critical elements of infrastructure speaking saturday at the aspen security forum in colorado gen flynn said u s efforts to counter cyberattacks against infrastructure are at the infant stage one of these days we ll be really good at this he said we are very good we are the best at it but we are still growing and learning and we re growing capacity in this country pentagon cyberdefense and cyberwarfare capabilities are growing but not fast enough gen flynn said and i think all of our leaders in the department of defense would absolutely agree with me additionally greater government and private sector cooperation is needed to identify vulnerabilities to cyberattacks because it s not just that they shut down our telecommunication system or they shut down our health care system and it s not just a nation state like china or russia or some of these other countries that are a bit more sophisticated it s also these non nation state actors out there that actually do form as groups at times anonymous that see that one of these groups gen flynn said so we have to understand this and this is a really a big problem the three star general who announced in april that he would retire this fall said his gripe is that the country needs to decide what it wants to do in the cybersecurity realm and how to go about it before we have the next 9 11 kind of event but it may be time to sit down and particularly on cyber and really look at are we properly organized to deal with this threat because it s coming it s here he said the obama administration has taken a passive approach by rejecting policies that call for conducting offensive operations aimed at thwarting foreign cyberspies and cyberattackers asked whether the u s should scale up its cyberoffensive capabilities gen flynn gave a one word reply yes semper infidelis by corps a new york lawyer representing the family of a slain marine recently sent 10 page letter to the commandant protesting how the corps has characterized the murder and rebutting the claim that it provided survivors with critical information on the case the dispute is related to the 2012 premeditated murders of three marines by an afghan civilian who had a close relationship with sarwar jan a reputedly corrupt police chief who abused children and collaborated with the taliban the corps issued a press statement friday disclosing that the assailant ainuddin khudairaham received a seven year prison sentence from an afghan court it also addressed complaints from the family of one of the war dead lance cpl gregory t buckley jr that the corps failed to provide information such as why jan and his followers were allowed to operate on the forward operating base delhi in afghanistan s helmand province the marine statement said attorneys and the naval criminal investigative service have talked with the families continually and expressed an unwavering commitment to loyalty to survivors attorney michael j bowe of the law firm kasowitz benson torres friedman called this version a callous lie the sole message touted by this publicity stunt was how well the marine corps had treated these gold star families mr bowe who represents the buckleys wrote july 29 to marine commandant gen james amos while the press statement trumpets how often the marine corps has communicated with the buckley family and how many different people have communicated with the buckleys it nowhere describes what facts were provided in all these communications this is because none were provided instead for two years the buckley family has chased the information to which it is legally and morally entitled and been stonewalled throughout by sympathetic sounding words followed by inaction the buckley family is not now and never has been informed of any substantive information concerning these murders and they have been repeatedly misled no amount of lip service platitudes and rhetorical flourish can overcome these facts mr bowe said jan had been evicted from his previous marine forward operating base because he and those under his control were extorting now zad residents keeping afghan boys as sex slaves trafficking narcotics providing arms munitions and afghan police uniforms to the taliban and otherwise facilitating insider attacks mr bowe said base commanders were warned two weeks before the murders that jan was a danger yet they did not act china s odd spy ship navy adm samuel j locklear commander of the u s pacific command this week called china s dispatch of a spy ship near hawaii a little odd however adm locklear said the good news about the agi as electronic listening ships are called is that china has accepted the legitimate right of nations to conduct intelligence gathering within the 230 mile exclusive economic zone around a nation s territory china has demanded that all u s military flights and ships that conduct electronic surveillance against china leave its exclusion zones the four star admiral said the agi spying on the rim of the pacific exercises which china s navy joined for the first time this year is an acceptance by the chinese of what we ve been saying to them for some time that military operations and survey operations in another country s eezs where you have national your own national security interest are within international law and are acceptable but adm locklear noted the introduction of the agi kind of made it look a little odd but it hasn t stopped the exercise and it hasn t created any difficulties in the exercise contact bil
