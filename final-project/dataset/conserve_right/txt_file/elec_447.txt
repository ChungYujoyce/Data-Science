monday on npr s morning edition abc political commentator cokie roberts offered her thoughts on the apparent health issues regardingdemocratic presidential nominee hillary clinton and the how the party could be looking to handle things if a replacement is needed for clinton according to roberts there was already conversation within the party about such a possibility the fact that it comes now when the polls are tightening and democrats are already saying that hillary was the only candidate who could not beat trump and it is taking her off of the campaign trail canceling her trip to california it has them very nervously beginning to whisper about having her step aside and finding another candidate when asked if that really could happen roberts called it unlikely to be a real thing but floated the name of vice president joe biden as a possible replacement i think it is unlikely to be a real thing she added and i m sure it is an overreaction of an already skittish party but you know they have looked at what happens in that circumstance the democratic national committee chair convenes the committee and they vote now ironically the candidate who everybody looks at is joe biden who is older than hillary clinton but then again so is donald trump and by the way we know nothing about his health h t mediaite follow jeff poor on twitter jeff poor clipspoliticscokie robertsdemocratic partyhillary clintonnpr please let us know if you re having issues with commenting copyright 2020 breitbart
