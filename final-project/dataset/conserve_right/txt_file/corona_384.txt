utterly fanciful and the other intolerably vague with no intervention the main graph says the united states could see 1 5 million to 2 2 million deaths from the disease but with intervention it says the number of covid 19 deaths plummets to somewhere between 100 000 and 240 000 the no intervention scenario is clearly counterfactual since it ignores all the steps governments businesses and individuals already have taken to curtail the spread of covid 19 the intervention scenario assumes continued social distancing of the sort currently recommended by the federal government and enforced by state and local governments what s missing anything in between which is the area that really matters for policy makers governments right now are not deciding whether to do nothing or do something rather they are confronting choices about which restrictions should be imposed where they make sense and how long they should be maintained in this context a simple binary choice between intervention and no intervention is highly misleading since it obscures myriad options for confronting the epidemic including measures more carefully tailored than mass business closures and stay at home orders sooner or later those options will have to be weighed taking into account not only the deaths they might prevent or allow but also their economic impact which under the current approach is already severe and could get much worse in addition to presenting a false choice the trump administration s framing relies on assumptions that may prove to be mistaken one important variable is the number of americans who will ultimately be infected by the covid 19 virus another is the case fatality rate cfr because existing data are very limited in the absence of wide testing we can do little better than guess at those numbers yet getting them wrong has profound implications potentially leading to an overreaction that wrecks the economy while saving relatively few lives or less likely given the current political climate an underreaction that costs many lives and allows hospitals to be overwhelmed by covid 19 cases the white house seems to be relying on projections by the university of washington s institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme some of which were included in yesterday s presentation the ihme model which assumes that current policies are maintained until june predicts that an estimated 97 of the population of the united states will still be susceptible to the disease at that point which implies that 3 percent of americans or nearly 10 million people will have been infected if that happens we can be pretty sure it will not be reflected in the official numbers which include only confirmed cases that tally underestimates the true number of infections because many people with mild to nonexistent symptoms which are typical of covid 19 will not seek medical treatment or testing the extent of that gap which is by definition unknown is crucial in estimating the true cfr which federal public health officials say could be anywhere from 0 1 percent making covid 19 about as lethal as the seasonal flu to 1 percent making it 10 times as deadly the ihme projects that approximately 81 000 people will die from the virus by late june if current policies are maintained which implies a cfr of about 0 8 percent projections by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc assume the same cfr while modeling by researchers at imperial college in london is based on a slightly higher rate of 0 9 percent both of those estimates are near the upper end of the range that u s officials consider reasonable that does not mean those estimates are wrong but their accuracy makes a big difference if the cfr turns out to be 0 5 percent the number of deaths in the ihme scenario of about 10 million infections by june would be fewer than 50 000 rather than 81 000 a cfr of 0 2 percent still twice the estimated cfr for the seasonal flu would reduce the death toll at that point to fewer than 20 000 by comparison the cdc estimates that influenza has killed 12 000 to 61 000 americans each year since 2010 the true cfr matters even more when you consider alternatives to current covid 19 control measures it is hard to weigh the risks and benefits of relaxing restrictions whether in may as currently envisioned by the trump administration in june as some experts suggest would be possible with wide testing or even later than that as assumed in the imperial college s best case scenario when you don t know the potential cost in terms of additional deaths which could number in the thousands tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands depending on your assumptions one thing we know for sure is that the economic burden on millions of innocent people will be magnified with each passing week it seems that many people who are pessimistic about the covid 19 death toll want to have it both ways when it comes to justifying immediate sweeping and sustained control measures they emphasize how quickly the virus spreads but high estimates of the virus s reproduction number the number of people the average carrier can be expected to infect imply a bigger gap between confirmed cases and total infections which in turn implies a lower cfr there is also a tension between the short term goal of avoiding a hospital crisis by reducing transmission of the virus and the longer term goal of mitigating the impact of covid 19 through herd immunity which requires widespread infection after three months of lockdowns the ihme model predicts 97 percent of the population will still be susceptible to the disease i do not pretend to have the answers but given the high level of uncertainty i am skeptical of people who claim they do and it seems to me that the potentially devastating economic effects of aggressive and prolonged interventions have not received the consideration they deserve eventually we will have a clearer picture of the price exacted both by the epidemic and by efforts to fight it but that knowledge will come too late for it to figure in the decisions politicians are making now next another trump

after week in your profit just working from home three hours every day check out this link read more well someone is a crankypants what do you hope to achieve by spouting meaningless invective rather than making a point a question better asked of almost every reason article the media hacks are now really hoping things don t get better otherwise unemployed americans might just be coming for them with pitchforks for hysterically nuking our economy i noticed that they ve shifted to corona related deaths in the last few days i m sure it s nothing you mean like being killed in a car crash while shopping for toilet paper or maybe all deaths since the first pandemic headlines cuz only covid 19 infected people die both funny it s disappointing because most of what sullum has been writing lately has actually been pretty darn good so it s sad to see him resort to erecting such a riduclous strawman at no point did trump ever say we should do nothing at all to combat the virus it s a total fabrication he didn t say it but the curve he showed had that assumption last month trump should sit back and let his medical experts take control trump does this month trump should stop listening to his experts tds trump delusional supporter its still trump derangement syndrome lefties are riddled with it like herpes change your life right now work from comfort of your home and receive your first paycheck within a week no experience needed cdv no boss over your shoulder say goodbye to your old job limited number of spots open find out how here see more here the trump administration eh how about pretty much every government around from the uk to new york to whatever because it isn t the administration that is pushing these numbers it is a couple of researchers who created a very bad model trump tried urging calm tried encouraging people to do the in between type stuff and people like you quickly said that he wasn t taking it seriously simply put the desire to pin on trump or any politician any bad thing to happen will merely encourage them to clamp down the hardest because you can always say hey look at the millions dead but you will never be able to point out the millions who wouldn t have died anyways and so all levels of government are going to over react and over react hard because you journalists won t let them do anything else precisely well said trump is either a panic merchant or a non chalant ignoramus depending on whatever narrative the tds crowd wants to roll with that day these journalists would blame trump in any event so watching them whine about trump doing what they condemned him yesterday for not doing and vice versa is particularly infuriating fucking clowns ya and you wouldn t be doing that if this was a democrat of course you would you partisans are stupid as fuck and not really americans you are in fact pathetic hypocrites you probably get so many high fives at your hs democrat club not lately sheeple like him have to isolate themselves so they dont spread the delusional defective disorder the ones over reacting should be held to account but journalists aren t interested in actually speaking truth to power no not every government around sweden the netherlands and japan have chosen more relaxed protocols that don t shut down non essential businesses the uk was originally set to go with this model too until the media pressured them into a lockdown i m going to skip over japan which has low rates because i don t see reliable data but so far sweden and the netherlands aren t doing worse than countries with lockdowns i think pres trump would personally like to move to something more relaxed the cure can t be worse than the disease but there s a lot of political pressure on him not to and in the end its up to the state governors and local mayors maybe after april there might be some change um you might want to check your premise sweden they changed their minds based on the data japan s moving in that direction as well we need a lockdown of democrats forever this country won t survive with so many of them suppression fascism so does everyone else if you don t believe me try telling your typical cnn viewer all these lockdowns are overkill their response will be something along the lines of so we should just do nothing and let the virus kill everyone so we should just do nothing and let the virus kill everyone the level of pants shitting explains the run on toilet paper brilliant plenty of republicans feel the same what you re saying then is republicans are spineless and giving in to the left panic what you re saying then is republicans are spineless and giving in to the left panic that s exactly what i m seeing even disappointingly president trump who could get some credit for hesitating but caved to the nazi s when the cares act signing came into play thomas masse proved to have more backbone true that bill is bullshit the democrats should have all been taken to gitmo as traitors for ever voting for it it was a republican bill smirk a republican bill written entirely contradictory to the gop platform and in consistency with the dnc platform denial is a severe mental disorder

republicans are acting just as pathetically cowardly as the democrats are hey loser rasmussen polling is the most prominent republican pollster voters strongly endorse fines ban on interstate travel voters are turning hardline in the face of the coronavirus two out of three now want to ban travel between states and fine those who violate social distancing guidelines again to minimize the risk to

june 2009 obama s fifth month in office pees pants laughing yet you pick the years after republicans had full congress control you said the recovery began after gop controlled both houses heck it didn t even start getting better until the republicans had full majority of both houses of congress proven liar republicans had full control under trump s first two years plus the white house 2 9 2 3 5 2 obama gave him 3 o5 2 17 5 2 with no tax cut lower deficits and more jobs now you go full psycho and after obama caused the great recession to support a statistical claim that by destroying it and republicans saving it as an obama effect snort the recession began in dec 2007 and here s the proof crazed trumptard official dates for our business cycles since the 1850s recessions begin when the

december 2007 the date the recession officially began and it was published in 2008 before obama took office 2008 12 01 and gomer never read his own link a committee of the national bureau of economic research has declared that the united states is in recession and has been in it since december 2007 i just linked you to the official recession dates at the same source nber well you ve made a total public ass of yourself anything else i can humiliate you on sonny boy typical brainwashed trumptard lying gomer insists the words in bold are the same your exact words trump started from the longest recovery ever for an incoming president from obama recovery from obama lie about my words shame on you you are he liar smirk he deleted the longest recovery ever for an incoming president so he could change the topic a chickenshit failure his proven lies are boldface recovery from obama lmao that is the new democratic hoax who was presiding during the worst of the great recession again heck it didn t even start getting better until the republicans had full majority of both houses of congress this is every bit as pathetic as trump sneer posted in self defense of multiple crazed assaults squirrelly commit suicide right away you are worthless and shouldn t live no one will ever love you and it s the most libertarian thing you will ever do whiny pussy sneer stop with the media hysteria sullum the answer is for everyone who can go back to work and end this charade where everyone stuck in residential recycled air will solve this the kungflu is no more deadly to americans than the seasonal flu cold johns hopkins abx guidecoronavirus covid 19 sars cov 2 relevance it s even worse than that first they say this is all trump s fault he didn t test quick enough the fda is not approving things quick enough trump downplayed the virus and now they are saying it s not all that bad i ve been carefully ignoring or avoiding everything trump says and everything anyone says about stuff trump says it s much better that way so i ll just say i m sure the federal bureucracy fucked up in lots of ways and i m glad trump hans t been more activist and tried to impose a national lockdown or something it s disgusting that lockdown is something that can even be seriously discussed for free citizens he s a half coolidge lukewarmidge now they are not even testing unless you need to go to the hospital so i guess all that not testing enough was typical political bs it was bullshit from day one you don t need to test people to prescribe robitussin chicken soup and bed rest for a week or so the treatment for 99 of people is exactly the same for covid 19 as it has always been for anyone with a bad cold or the flu true until the lungs start to fill up then it s ventilator or die which is true of the flu chicken little life is tough death is ultimately unavoidable i don t what else to say why aren t you panicking my balls probably pneumonia is 1 killer of really old people their response will always be whatever makes trump wrong the good dr s literally said several times yesterday that the actual curve will be somewhere in between the two options depending on several factors that aren t known hack reporters asked question after question to get them to commit to one so they could say they were wrong in the future i m really starting to wonder how many times reason has lied in the past that i didn t know about because i hadn t watched the live press conference the day before reason is no better than the msm that is because of o sullivan s first law all organizations that are not actually right wing will over time become left wing that s robert conquests second law of politics notice the media are trying to pin this on someone else besides them the writing is on the wall that americans are not following unconstitutional orders this kungflu is not going to kill every american it touches and the us economy is holding fast in spite of treasonous media types trying to nuke it they were wrong here s why in this day and age that is the ultimate headline any journalist can aspire to foist upon the world we were wrong we re sorry is not an option that would take journalistic integrity and it would never be a headline in any event journalists live to skewer people never to report the good dr s literally said several times yesterday that the actual curve will be somewhere in between the two options depending on several factors that aren t known exactly right fauci has said this over and over i m noticing that people who had trouble moderating their skepticism about covid 19 as data came in early on just cannot figure out how to reconcile the cognitive dissonance created by current reality and their initial instincts can t wait for a followup podcast with richard epstein to set us straight reason uses twitter as their primary sources generally i m really starting to wonder how many times reason has lied in the past that i didn t know about because i hadn t watched the live press conference the day before always i ve got a nose for their bullshit now finding a complete source only confirms the lie for me listen for tortured language it s tortured to make it confess to a lie listen for the dog that didn t bark the fact that s obviously the crux of the matter must be known but is left out but for the true moron listen for the absurd objection without further evidence one can dismiss the false choice characterization as bs with metaphysical certitude you know that there s absolutely no way they literally stated that the two alternatives they gave were the only possible alternatives if they gave 3 scenarios could not that have been equally called a false choice 4 5 n n 1 the joy of this characterization is that it will always apply you can always bitch that there are more alternatives they didn t show false choice they gave two response scenarios to bound expectations for deaths not delineate all possible responses the whole premise of the article entirely misses the point of giving the scenarios seems that all the old people that would be me and my wife and those who s health is known to be at risk could just stay home costco and others have special shopping hours for those groups so staying out of the way is fairly easy let the young and healthy go back to work or to the beach or school and get covid 19 they will have a bad two weeks or so if they are not among those with little or no symptoms and the herd will develop immunity after 60 or so have gotten sick and recovered we can crawl out from under our rocks there are a million ways to get old people supplies so they can stay locked down if they wish rich celebrities can donate money for food delivery off hour shopping as you mentioned amazon food delivery charities deliver food local residents deliver food to their elderly neighbors americans need to go back to work the thomas masse video also on reason brings up another one where the fda went in with police and shut down a charity that was door step delivering supplying to those infected and in self isolation its amazing how the fda is so determined in keeping the spread going rich celebrities largely take care of themselves wing a progressive is easy because you re being generous with other people s money old rip van dinkle up here gets it 100 according to gov cuomo your willingness to accept a certain amount of risk is going to kill his mother let the young and healthy go back to work or to the beach or school and get covid 19 they will have a bad two weeks or so if they are not among those with little or no symptoms and the herd will develop immunity after 60 or so have gotten sick and recovered we can crawl out from under our rocks and perhaps have an economy which isn t in such ruin that it might kill more than the disease that s actually an alternative proposed at promarket org let younger people work course the author there unlike reason or the commentariat here is honest enough to calc the cost of that by his calculation the cost is 110 000 under 50 s dead up to the point where 50 of them have been infected i think he s low by about 50 because 150 million young people getting sick still quickly and easily breaks our medical system for a cost of 1 trillion to the economy not sure what s really in it for that generation they get sacrificed they pay the debt burden forever all so that the older folks can hang on and bleed them dry even further for an extra 2 3 5 years from a purely darwinian perspective the herd will be a lot stronger long term if everyone is equally exposed to the threat the virus will kill off the weaker the unhealthy and the burdensome and the surviving herd will be stronger younger healthier and immune and jfree is creaming his jeans with every new death headline he finds this is jfree who celebrates the rousing patrick henry quote give me liberty unless it might mean i can catch a flu bug go hide in your bomb shelter you dishonest piece of cowardly shit what s missing anything in between which is the area that really matters for policy makers bwahahahahaaa i say people can still go to work if they just wipe everything down with disinfectant not touch each other and wash their hands a lot shutting the whole thing down is unnecessary meekly raises hand are you an expert who s an expert medically it s not necessary politically it s absolutely necessary because anybody who doesn t do that will get blamed for all the dead bodies the fact that such blame would be misplaced won t matter we made a mistake not doing something about our propagandist media in this country a long time ago yeah that fucking free press must be suppressed along with your suppression of free speech sieg heil they re not a fee press they re coordinated propagandists are you capable of understanding that you repealed the first amendment any worse than your proven bullshit here https reason com 2020 04 01 the trump administration presents a false choice between current covid 19 control measures and no intervention comment 8194398 puppet dancing on a string i think there is a role for government when it comes to public health but that role should be limited so far all the data points to a virus that is contagious but not very deadly government s role in this should be on the lowest end of the scale of action to be taken the best response would be to let private companies and labs perform the testing without interference pay for the test if you must do something and ultimately let individuals be in charge of their own response if you want to go to work and take the risk of the virus then that is your informed choice government s role in this should be on the lowest end of the scale of action to be taken the best response would be to let private companies and labs perform the testing without interference and goddam riot in the streets when the government takes over the entire economy if you want to go to work and take the risk of the virus then that is your informed choice virologist the flaw in your premise is asymptomatic transmission that is what makes it different imo and yes we are all autonomous actors i agree i think there is a role for government when it comes to public health but that role should be limited so far all the data points to a virus that is contagious but not very deadly sucker covid 19 death rate 25x worse than swine flu less than two years ago the seasonal flu was especially deadly it killed an estimated 61 000 americans but it didn t overwhelm health care workers and hospitals as covid 19 did in italy and threatens to in the u s those people with seasonal flu were spread out from november to april or may our healthcare system is designed to handle that kind of load not so with covid 19 the challenge with covid 19 is we are all eligible to get sick and spread the disease all at the same time eligible because none are immune unlike seasonal flu duh last week trump said this at a news conference in the oval office if you go back and look at the swine flu and what happened with the swine flu you ll see how many people died and how actually nothing was done for such a long period of time as people were dying all over the place still blaming obama like obama kept blaming bush and this is 25 times worse keep reading data from the u s centers for disease control and prevention track the increase of h1n1 swine flu in 2009 from the day of the first death april 28th 2009 compared with the rise of covid 19 since the first u s coronavirus death was reported in washington on feb 29 the cdc had confirmed 4 226 covid 19 cases in 16 days since the first death at the same stage in 2009 the cdc had tallied 3 352 h1n1 cases but contrary to trump s claims the death rate for covid 19 has far outpaced h1n1 over the same span the cdc had confirmed 75 covid 19 deaths 16 days after its first death by contrast 16 days after the first swine flu death there were only three h1n1 deaths reported to the cdc 75 3 covid 19 is 25 times more deadly than swine flu the cdc estimates about 12 000 americans ended up dying from swine flu between april 2009 and april 2010 12 000 x 25 300 000 graphic comparison charts at source swine flu didn t go away many people don t realize it s now part of the seasonal flu and covered by the annual flu vaccine covid 19 is completely new is hitting on top of the seasonal flu has no vaccine and clearly warrants the stronger response because nobody is immune wow that is some idiotic cherry picking now go back and look at all the data and you really shouldn t post here you re not taken seriously in part because of things like this it also appears you re going into another manic period and ranting again either way you have no credibility you babble i prove you full of shit sneer https reason com 2020 04 01 the trump administration presents a false choice between current covid 19 control measures and no intervention comment 8194398 so you link to a crappy article that as an embarrassment your concept of proof is lacking you are clearly more senile than biden i m trying to be nice about this since you clearly don t understand math or anything related to decision sciences you sick fuck re the cares act wrong again sickfuck of the woodchippets pelosi s bill do you to actually follow these things better than you do lol it was passed by the republican senate then passed off to the house educate yourself gomer senate passes massive 2 trillion coronavirus spending bill washington the senate overwhelmingly passed a massive 2 trillion stimulus package late wednesday the house is expected to vote on the stimulus bill on friday house majority leader steny hoyer d md said which will allow democrats enough time to review the legislation whose final language was not released until late wednesday your hatred spewing primitive tribal bigotry has exploded on you again the drooling imbecile had said this that bill is bullshit the democrats should have all been taken to gitmo as traitors for ever voting for it a republican bill o fg mcconnell s gop committed treason sneer now goes totally off the rails i m trying to be nice about this since you clearly don t understand math or anything related to decision sciences that s being nice has nothing to do with math one sick fuck on steroids shutting the whole thing down is unnecessary but probably the very goal as i m still baffled why the fda is making home testing illegal like wtf are they purposely trying to spread covid 19 or what with over the counter and at home testing which have already been made but gov held up all working units could pre test the employee crowds and everything could start moving again nope though i guess the gov will stop that from happening that first graphic was used in yesterday s task force briefing the lack of proportion and axis scaling in this schematic caused confusion on their best days most people can contemplate just two options or alternative scenarios universal democracy is a government of the people therefore we should expect our government to only present two cases this is not a false choice this is the only way they can present something voters can understand and more revealing of our bizarro society most people are pre wired to automatically embrace one option and reject the other based on political source and favorite media bias there is no thinking that s not true at all people and businesses are perfectly capable of understanding a nuanced plan of action like wearing masks washing everything reasonable distancing protecting the vulnerable you have too little faith in people will everyone do it no but most would and if they wouldn t then we re fucked anyway there has to be some level of social trust or shit just won t work this is not a false choice this is the only way they can present something voters can understand are you trying to tell us something about your mental capabilities no one ever lost money underestimating the intelligence of the american people no one ever lost money underestimating the intelligence of the american people yes they have but you seem to be trying to prove otherwise governments right now are not deciding whether to do nothing or do something what can we take we won t have to give back it seems that many people who are pessimistic about the covid 19 death toll want to have it both ways when it comes to justifying immediate sweeping and sustained control measures they emphasize how quickly the virus spreads but high estimates of the virus s reproduction number the number of people the average carrier can be expected to infect imply a bigger gap between confirmed cases and total infections which in turn implies a lower cfr yes i have noticed this there is a lot of omg this is super contagious everyone who looks at someone who has it will get it we might have a lot of asymptomatic carriers out there spreading this disease and never even know they had it so no one can leave their house followed by this is super deadly and i think deaths are under reported and the real fatality rate is probably at least 10 well which is it either it s a disease that is super contagious and tons of us have had it and don t really know and therefore it is much less deadly than feared or it has a 1 fatality rate it can t be both because if it was we would have bodies littering the streets however it can be neither which is where the smart money is i don t think it s something that everyone or even most people have contracted outside of areas like nyc but it s almost certainly true that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than those diagnosed perhaps by an order of magnitude thus making fatality rates vastly overstated asymptomatic carriers out there spreading this disease and never even know they had it we re all angels of death stay 27 feet away from everybody is the 27 feet significant i note that it is 3 3 or maybe i suffer from ocd i ll be carrying a 6 spear with me from here out if anybody gets within range they re too close and i feared for my life make it 28 just to be safe if you can find it you can see that the infection rate is about 10 that s the percentage of people tested that turn out to actually have c19 i dug the number out two times after i first heard it cited in a briefing that one was when we d tested about a quarter million the second was a week later when we were just past half a million and the third was this past weekend when the number of tested wasn t mentioned instead the 10 infection rate was just mentioned in passing as an established fact but it s a hard number to find because it undermines the whole house of infected cards of that 10 about 80 are asymptomatic or only having mild symptoms and 15 get a symptoms like a bad cold only around 5 get anything worse so it s 5 of 10 of all tested people it is 10 of people with symptoms string enough to test let s do some quick math shall we 330 000 000 10 33 000 000 total infected rate could be higher 33 000 000 80 26 400 000 afflicted mild symptoms 33 000 000 15 4 950 000 afflicted more severe 33 000 000 5 1 650 000 afflicted require hospitalization severe 33 000 000 0 5 165 000 dead you need to really reflect on what we are talking about here this is far worse than any influenza the hospitalization cost here should not be underestimated the cost to american society will be tremendous it is time to erect a great wall around china lying fucks well walls do work we need to finish the one on the mexico border that joker meme has never been more appropriate tell people that 600 000 will die this year of heart disease and obesity and no one bats an eye tell them between 100k 240k will die of bataids and everyone loses their minds then tell them that 65 75 of those 100k 240k are coming from the ranks of those who were going to die anyway of heart disease obesity etc and they ll look at you like a deer in the headlights yep i ve yet to hear the phrase co mortality it s going to be a bad year for covid 19 but a damned good year for everything else the only thing we have to fear is fear itself said in 1933 by f d r one of the heroes of the democratic party and most historians and in every famous quotations book ever written imagine the howls if trump made that kind of happy talk today we must remember however that five years after f d r said that the unemployment rate was 19 yet most historians and the public believe f d r was a demi god fdr was basically a fascist that s why historians love him not all historians i buck my peers to the their annoyance in addition to presenting a false choice the trump administration s framing relies on assumptions that may prove to be mistaken trump isn t presenting a false choice he s simply giving a baseline furthermore so far it s the states that have imposed most of the draconian and involuntary measures so i m not sure what you re complaining about when it comes to trump in particular since reason has effectively attacked trump in the past for not being draconian enough because if they can t find a legitimate reason to criticize trump they re duty bound to shift the goalposts to create a fake reason to criticize trump quite possibly the smartest thing that the trump administration has done in this crisis is ignore all advice from people like jacob sullum if he d listen to that crowd we d have a million plus dead in the streets while sullum sniffed that at least we stayed true to libertarian and free market principles while allowing the human right to migrate wherever you want with no regard for consequences a pure libertarian is no different than a hard left communist they only care about winning the argument and maintaining ideological purity they could care less about how many bodies their preferred policies create in a crisis they only care about winning the argument and maintaining ideological purity they could care less about how many bodies their preferred policies create in a crisis you are full of shit libertarians have nothing in common with unreason staff because the staff are not libertarians and in fact hate much of what libertarians stand for and like this is the problem with the politically based coverage of well everything it is pretty clear that more local action is what is needed even in a state the size of florida there were counties that needed to lock down weeks ago as we did here in sofla and there are counties that still don t have significant issues desantis just ordered the entire state on lockdown today which was the right move he specifically talked about local governments taking appropriate actions based on the local situation now the usa is a nation of 330 million people spread out over 50 states covering a large chunk of a continent absent closing the border 75 days ago before any cases got here there isn t much that could be done at a national level even state wide level was too large look at washington california new york and florida they took different actions and had different levels of compliance from their citizens and despite being late to the party new york city and mayor i will not close the schools ever have nearly caught up with italy in terms of cases over 2 short weeks meanwhile florida started closing everything down way back when we had less than 50 cases i think broward had 4 cases when they started cancelling school events absent a huge bump from new yorkers travelling south we d likely still be under 1 000 cases the rest of the nation has largely forestalled the spread of the virus meaning that the nation as a whole is going to be experiencing rolling epidemics for quite some time to come so a federalized reaction is the only way to handle it there s no way to send out one size fits all orders and have that succeed heck look at the eu they shut down borders all over the place in there and they ve had massively divergent results from state to state but if you look at their case load as a group they are well north of where the us is despite having recorded first cases at about the same time some 65 70 days ago and representing a similar population size so because of the political basis for all news coverage of all types in the us we have no idea how we are doing i have not even seen anyone bother adding up the cases for the eu to compare directly with the us interesting since ny can be our italy and maybe cali is our germany or maybe our france in any event nobody is actually analyzing the events of the day or running down the details of the story they are entirely engrossed in finding the political angle that benefits their team lockdowns arent necessary he specifically talked about local governments taking appropriate actions based on the local situation well said a constitutional principle that seems to have been forgot by many citizens with the ever growing federal show boating and steps to power grab for national socialization implementing the nazi system the trump administration presents a false choice between current covid 19 control measures and no intervention screeched the cosmotarians who had been screaming for open borders for the entirety of trump s presidency and who opposed his travel bans to fight coronavirus no he didn t maybe the moron writer just didn t get it he is a reason writer afterall not the sharpest knives in the drawer they are sullum you always do the same shit with numbers pick the most favorable number to your case in this case 0 1 cfr even when it is proven to be either a lie or utter bullshit and then repeat it and repeat it and repeat it as if that makes it true and then wave your hands around creating policy options and scenarios based on that bullshit you did the same thing with that opioid addiction number from the corporate marketing literature you are without question the most deliberately dishonest author on this site may god have mercy on your soul you are without question the most deliberately dishonest author on this site i still think it s boehm or suderman but i leave open the possibility that they re both merely too dumb to understand the issues they write about the current run rate coronavirus is now the 3rd leading cause of death in the us behind cancer and heart disease it took one month there are so many alternatives to deal with it all of which suck to one degree or the other but it boggles my mind that people are still insisting on being taken seriously when they basically keep repeating comfortable lies that this is just the flu short of giving out a ton of darwin awards i m not sure what s going to change that the current run rate coronavirus is now the 3rd leading cause of death in the us behind cancer and heart disease it took one month by a factor of greater than two you dishonest piece of cowardly shit give it time predictions are for an increase of substantial size when does the sky fall chicken little which predictions give you the biggest euphoria the 2 million dead one given his whiny adolescence i m guessing he s hoping for mommy government control of his life until 15 going on 50 it dawns on him he s never going to grow up that responsibility shit who needs it it s cute that you are using peak data and not comparing the data over large time periods idiots do as idiots do when covid consistently has 1k deaths a day for a year let us know further cute that the scumbag jfree had to search all over the web to find the scariest and least honest headline to post why it s almost like turd finding

it s just the flu you are without question the most deliberately dishonest author on this site i still think it s boehm or suderman shikha has a sad stuff your panic flag up your ass stick first well if it makes you guys feel better the federal liberals up here lost the plot early in the game when the chink virus was spreading around doing its thang justin sent masks to china even though experts were cautioning against then when people suggested he shut down airspace he and the heath minister said that would be racist then he changed his tune when his wife got it and still hadn t shut down an illegal immigration path known as roxham in quebec even as he announced a border closing deal with the usa at every turn they took an internationalist stance putting canadian interest and safety at risk now tam the health minister is telling canadians to wash their hands and social distance even though she said it wasn t a problem the virus early on now justin is trying to look all dignified trying to lead a county but i don t know of anyone who takes this guy seriously a party of clowns made by clowns and for clowns chink virus yeah that didn t narrow it down much do you use a paypal in the event if you have you can generate an additional 300 a week to your account only working from home for 5 hours per day check out this link read more well you obviously have not been watching cnn because they have made it clear that if trump had only listened to the science people this whole thing would have been averted but he listened to political advisors instead so now we have a quarter of a million people scheduled for death cnn s coverage of today s press conference followed a formula the instant they cut away they went to a political analyst who told us that it was terrible first the president is trying to make himself look good which is always a terrible thing for a president to do but particularly horrible at this time our analyst made it clear that it is irresponsible to try to make political points during this serious crisis and it is also clear that trump has completely botched the entire thing and because of that people are going to die so instead of talking about insert topic here he should be explaining to the american people in detail exactly how he screwed everything up and why he wants so many americans to die then they went to their white house reporter with wolf blitzer they discussed how terrible it is that nobody is answering the serious questions that the american people have and because of that people are going to die probably at least 250 000 if only trump would take the questions of the american people seriously things would be much better they went on for even longer than the overly long briefing explaining exactly why everything they had to say is terrible and a lie and trump killed people they even said that trump talking about a big drug interdiction is going to kill people because he didn t properly schedule a separate news conference for that topic so if this article really represents how you are feeling i suggest you go turn on cnn because they are totally right and all of their insider background information from senior political advisors to the president is that trump is doing everything wrong and everyone is going to die seriously they actually tried that gambit fauci telling us that he s basically calling the shots and trump has done everything fauci has recommended notwithstanding i ve noticed that nobody in a position to have the question heard is asking the serious question that this american person has are the reported deaths from covid 19 in this country only those whose actual cause of death is covid 19 or do they follow the example of other countries such as italy and report anyone who dies from any cause while infected with the virus as being a covid 19 death a headline linked earlier today was claiming covid 19 related deaths pretty sure that answers your question i remember looking up smoking related deaths and found it was largely propaganda if you got run over by a truck while smoking well the covid 19 deaths are obviously underreported perhaps severely but impossible to count there are presumed to be many who die from the virus but were never tested and diagnosed the covid 19 deaths are obviously underreported your tds ate your cite shitstain google covid 19 deaths underreported you ll get tens of thousands of reports this is at the top my emphasis doctors and nurses say more people are dying of covid 19 in the us than we know medical professionals around the us say that the official numbers of people who have died of covid 19 are not consistent with the number of deaths they re seeing on the front lines in some cases it s a lag in reporting caused by delays and possible breakdowns in logging positive tests and making them public in other more troubling cases medical experts say they think it s because people are not being tested before or after they die we just don t know the numbers are grossly underreported i know for a fact that we ve had three deaths in one county where only one is listed on the website the doctor said and two of the hardest hit areas in the nation new york city and los angeles county released guidance earlier this week encouraging doctors not to test patients unless they think the test will significantly change their course of treatment that means that potentially more people in both places could be admitted to hospitals with severe respiratory symptoms and recover or die and not be registered as a coronavirus case anything else yeah fuck off and die you pathetic excuse for humanity because i proved him wrong btw is your mommy still around to tuck you into bed and keep the boogey man away if you have a wife is she solicitous of such a cowardly piece of shit that you are willing to let the government run your life in the hopes you don t get a flu bug if you have children are they honest enough to laugh in your face regarding your cowardice if not i presume you ve infected them with your pathetic lack of principles fuck off and die slaver you owe it to the world reuters 81 said the country should continue social distancing initiatives including shelter at home orders despite the impact to the economy 89 of democrats and 70 of republicans only 19 said they would like to end social distancing as soon as possible to get the economy going again including 11 of democrats and 30 of republicans the march 26 27 opinion poll released friday also showed that the public is much more likely to heed the advice of doctors and local government officials than president donald trump 66 said they would follow the instructions of medical doctors 64 said they would follow the advice of the cdc 51 said they would follow the advice from their state s governor 46 would follow healthcare directions from local police only 31 are very likely to follow president trump s recommendations and advice are the reported deaths from covid 19 in this country only those whose actual cause of death is covid 19 or do they follow the example of other countries such as italy and report anyone who dies from any cause while infected with the virus as being a covid 19 death the cdc only has two outcomes recovered and dead if you die from something other than covid you still didn t recover so you go in the dead pile even if you were hit by a bus umm the other disease is what makes them a high risk for infection with deaths shortly thereafter obviously the other disease would not have killed them you ll need a different excuse to deny reality yes covid was the reason for the bus cyto the press in this country has been horrific there is just no other way to say it absolutely disgraceful and shameful at a time in out national history when we truly need the dissemination of accurate unbiased information all we get is worthless pablum when this passes the american press should take time to self reflect on their actions the press have served america poorly how so researchers in the u s found a temporary flight ban following 9 11 didn t stop the spread of the flu but delayed it by a couple of weeks and led to a prolonged flu season in 2009 during the outbreak of h1n1 swine flu some countries imposed travel restrictions on flights coming from and going to mexico a study two years later found it only led to an average delay in the arrival of the infection in other countries i e the first imported case of less than three days no containment was achieved by such restrictions and the virus was able to reach pandemic proportions in a short time the authors wrote no link bullshit i love charts without scales what kind of fucking moron cooks this shit up a five year old could make that chart that wh provided i hope that whenever this thing finally ends there is research done on how recovery takes hold in areas that went full bore on raising the minimum wage it won t but it s pretty obvious that the companies forced to pay over market m w were already stressed before being put out of business by government edict they re toast and will reopen with increased automation or not at all fool me once what do you think is the probability that some or any of these jurisdictions that had already legislated increases in future years dial them back i won t say zero point zero but i reckon it ll be close can t help seeing your handle as november juliet 2 alpha zulu tail number i don t see any of them doing shit in that regard i m far more certain that given a major dose of government help they ll double down there s a real danger that the damage might be permanent aye i moved here in my mids 20s after being born and raised in nj i m not a republican but i learned my lesson that the democrats aren t the solution either at least out here my inept government costs be a bit less though i will say i am proud of the fact that we spent the last few years building a rainy day fund despite countless forward thinkers demanding we spend every last penny that came into the coffers i m in ca but by careful planing wife and i have ended up under the radar of most of the ca government agencies but there s no hope at all that the spend thrift ca governments have done other than to spend every penny and more so i ll voted against the tax increases in the next election for all the good it ll do but outside of minimal exposure we re pretty bullet proof my continued ranting against government control has to do with the principle of accepting that control rather than any personal financial issues and my contempt for the scumbags who would so cheerfully hand over their freedoms for the chimera of security i m sticking with az until they start going full tard on guns there are a few bills that get introduced by the minority party that go no where but part of me believes even if the state legislatures were to flip they d suddenly stop with them because people in az loooooooooove guns but if bans on this and that actually start passing here i m heading to wyoming or some damn place the parasites hopefully won t take over til after i m gone sullum ignores a critical aspect of these projections the professionals who do them accept varying degrees of personal accountability for their conclusions that means they add a safety margin to minimize the loss of needless lives what are the odds of 5 greater deaths 10 when so much is unknown a mere journalist has no such accountability zero qualifications and zero experience we do know with ample proof that accurate predictions are impossible it took 66 days for the first 100 000 cases only 5 days for the next 100 000 future unknown it took 26 days for the first 1 000 deaths the next 1 000 was only 2 days the third thousand again a mere 2 days it took 2 days for the deaths to double and 4 days to triple we know each infected person infects 2 5 others hence the growth keeps accelerating future is unknown simple math suggest that trump s delays denials lies and the democrat hoax allowed needless deaths to comprise at least 2 3 of out total deaths many other countries do not face our potential economic collapse by paying workers 80 of their wages if laid off and covering employers combining all we know the best way our of this is a full lockdown enforced by fines for less than one month 28 days covers the full 14 day incubation even for those infected on day 14 and does justify a full lockdown exclude only groceries and medical treatment pay all affected workers 80 of their salary for less than a month cover employer costs for rent and utilities reimburse all covid 19 treatment to avoid massive rate hikes next year to employers repay the total debt within 20 years from economic growth that would be otherwise destroyed plus a small tax surcharge jefferson argued that all federal debt should be repaid in 20 years by the generation who borrowed it this is a good place to start i can already hear the screeching costly yes but government will spend far more without it and many more will die needlessly after 28 days we ll have only those infected at grocery stores and hospital waiting rooms easily within the available testing and the contact tracking so successful in other countries test anyone who had recent contact with new infectees a lot fewer tests than a partial or no lockdown fewest deaths near zero permanent economic damage and a lot less costly than trump s half hearted measures will cost 28 days is the reason for a total lock down anything less is costly denial as we continue failed policies for many more months of needless deaths and needless trillions in spending the future will be known oh goody the shitbag hihn is here to pass out lies and propaganda and as a claimed libertarian he is firmly behind that rousing patrick henry quote give me liberty unless it means i might catch a flu bug yep real champion of liberty here except where he might get sick in which case all the rest of us have to accept the government as our savior fuck off and die you scummy pile of hypocritic shit thank god for sevo his foul mouth screaming saved us from 6 trillion in bailout spending and loan guarantees right no he s screeching at a libertarian proposal that would result in much fewer deaths fastest possible end to the virus crisis no lasting damage to the economy at less total cost and no permanent debt increase hmmm thelibertytruthteller april 2 2020 at 12 08 am thank god for sevo thank whoever your please you pathetic piece of cowardly shit please daddy save me im so scared i ll do anything what about the hospital overload i don t want to die from appendicitis because the hospitals are too full of covid 19 cases to take me if you really don t care about minimizing deaths which it sounds like most of you don t because unemployment or poverty must be worse than death then at least stop bitching about inaccurate mortality rates and death totals and instead consider that a certain amount of social distancing among the young and healthy is needed so that the young and healthy in a sample under 45s made up 20 or so of the covid 19 cases in the hospitals in the u s and 38 were under 55 don t keep the hospitals too full to treat anyone else see this https www cdc gov mmwr volumes 69 wr mm6912e2 htm among 508 12 patients known to have been hospitalized 9 were aged 85 years 36 were aged 65 84 years 17 were aged 55 64 years 18 were 45 54 years and 20 were aged 20 44 years less than 1 of hospitalizations were among persons aged 19 years figure 2 the percentage of persons hospitalized increased with age from 2 3 among persons aged start highlight 19end highlight years to 31 among adults aged 85 years table there are lots of obese younger people who think they are perfectly healthy they won t stay in unless forced they are now taking up space in nyc hospital beds thanks one more fucking coward whining so brave you are so spineless you are are you proud of that willing to trade your freedom and liberties in the hopes you might not catch a flue bug is your mommy there to comfort you in these trying times do you know how pathetic you sound on a site supposedly dedicated to personal freedom and minimal government go crawl into your safe space you pathetic excuse for humanity is that supposed to frighten me only when you stop laughing is that supposed to frighten me of course not you are already a pathetic coward willing to trade your freedom in the hopes your mommy might save you you re already frightened beyond any rational comment go hunker down in your safe space you pathetic piece of shit lester224 april 1 2020 at 10 05 pm what about the hospital overload i don t want to die from appendicitis because the hospitals are too full of covid 19 cases to take me aw go whine to your mommy or grow up you are more than welcome to hide under whatever shelter you can find until mommy says it s ok to come out i don t care stress from not being able to work collect a pay check pay rent etc not to mention fear of coronavirus from rampant fearmongering will cause consequences including health consequences measured in bodies potentially more bodies than will ever be counted for coronavirus https consistentprinciples wordpress com 2020 03 23 the powerful reason covid 19 lockdowns may cause more deaths than they prevent with links to medical literature also since it ll be over a year till there s a vaccine there s really no escaping a huge number of infections social distancing won t reduce total infections it ll only make us suffer for longer cue more stress not that anyone s willing to talk about the real costs of the lockdowns people at risk including older people should self isolate but for the rest of us infection is probably near inevitable anyway let people set their own risk tolerances life isn t free of risk and we live with a lot of other risks every day coronavirus is just scary because it s new the flu killed 61k people in the 2017 2018 season and hospitalized another 810k and the news media didn t even blink cdc statistics can t post a second link anyone naively thinking that taking drastic action to flatten the curve is without significant and severe consequences of its own hasn t bothered to do a real risk analysis of both worlds social distancing won t reduce total infections umm it s a communicable disease infections come from people infecting other people if there is 80 90 fewer social interactions there will be 80 90 fewer infections and deaths fuck off coward we got your number and we need to interact with other people it slows the spread not eliminates it and the spread doesn t stop until herd immunity is achieved estimates i ve seen are 60 70 of the population the spread stop point isn t measured in time it s measured in number of recovered infections the longer you make it take to reach that number of recovered infections the longer the disease persists as an epidemic omfg you want 200 230 million americans infected to get herd immunity 2 million dead what about the hospital overload only with a government over regulated industry like our healthcare it seems there can be shortages hmmm kinda like venezuela shortages medicare for the win medicaid for the win obamacare for the win fda dictates they have full monopoly on charity and shuts down resource supplies to infected households fda bans over the counter in home covid testing units the picture is the same the fda cdc is what is causing the shortages trump caused the shortages by denying there was a problem until 19 days ago thereby allowing at least 2 3 of out total deaths insanity insisting the king wolf tend all matters of the sheep then complaining that the king wolf ate the sheep lefty ideology the problem is the solution insanity insisting the king wolf tend all matters only the presidency bullshitter no trump fan here but why did trump have that power in the first place if people decided it was a problem they should have been able to act before the government did anything that the fda and cdc has tied private actors hands is entirely the problem trump denied it was a problem until 20 days ago sneered that it was a democrat hoax that would just go away magically it s just one guy back from china way back when we had only 15 infections said it would be down to nearly zero in a few days since then instead of near zero 239 000 new infections 5 784 deaths while he kept refusing the mantle of leadership personally allowing over 2 3 of those 5700 deaths and he won t return phone calls to governors unless they re nice to him like everywhere else must kiss his ass while he screws them over lester two things that have not really been commented upon the virus strikes military aged youth at an unusually high rate they re down for the count and go on to recover but tie up a lot of resources along the way you could not engineer a more effective take down of a country a remarkable co incidence i d say sarc we are about to see one of the largest transfers of wealth in history i have to wonder how this plays out over time what about the hospital overload i don t want to die from appendicitis because the hospitals are too full of covid 19 cases to take me well you can thank stupid government regulations licensing and restrictions on hospital capacity for that in a free market this would be between you and your health provider you would make the choice to pay a bit more for disaster preparedness or take your chances and you d live with the consequences in our collectivized system of medicine you don t have that choice except perhaps for the very wealthy now noyb2 blames stupid government because we don t always have enough hospital capacity to handle a major pandemic totally useless costs 95 of the time well you can thank stupid government regulations licensing and restrictions on hospital capacity for that what about trump s months of delays denials and lies democrat hoax which alone allowed at least 2 3 of all our deaths now noyb2 blames stupid government because we don t always have enough hospital capacity to handle a major pandemic we don t have enough hospital beds period government regulations limit the number of hospital beds and are intended to keep prices high totally useless costs 95 of the time insurance is totally useless cost 95 of the time we still have it what about trump s months of delays denials and lies democrat hoax which alone allowed at least 2 3 of all our deaths what about your constant lies and factual errors now noyb2 blames stupid government because we don t always have enough hospital capacity to handle a major pandemic we don t have enough hospital beds period prove it what about trump s months of delays denials and lies democrat hoax which alone allowed at least 2 3 of all our deaths what about your constant lies and factual errors lame how many people did i allow to die be specific so i can jam the proof up your lying ass well we obviously don t have enough hospital beds to handle this emergency for example you pointed that out yourself qed nice sullum is kinda right in that with intervention maybe 200 000 thousand people will die instead of 2 million is arbitrary and not much of a choice what would happen if we loosened restrictions and let hair salons open what about stores like best buys which offers repair services what if churches were allowed to open as long as they limited capacity would that lead to 500 000 additional deaths 75 000 deaths 1 5 million 164 723 deaths if this thing drags out to july more and more people will head outside for cinco de mayo memorial day fourth of july birthday parties whatever they ll be creative in skirting lockdown protocols without directly breaking them consumer behavior will take strange turns as certain cravings and demands start to take place underground commerce and speakeasies are all but inevitable as is the usual tragedy that comes with enforcing prohibition i see local politicians in corona virus updates sort of pat the citizens on the head for heeding state recommendation good job we re in this together etc that s not going to last for 8 straight weeks tv ads show people practicing yoga playing piano and dancing with their kids in quarantine that s not 90 of america if something happened to the booze supply and streaming services things will go sour fast what about stores like best buys which offers repair services what if churches were allowed to open as long as they limited capacity would that lead to 500 000 additional deaths 75 000 deaths 1 5 million 164 723 deaths obviously a lot more would die it s communicable the easiest most accurate estimates are for a full lockdown or obvious reasons fuck off coward we know exactly the price you ll pay for government control over your life you ve made it clear save you from the flu bug and the government can control all of your life what sterling principles a hypocrite claiming to be libertarian has the first hint of danger and you turn over your entire life to the government fuck off and die slaver i love watching lefties faces when their so smart progressive plans are so easily defeated by if its such a great idea then why not start a demons membership club by contract where anyone s can freely join and have their communist community which always follows with one of two answer we know better than they do and so must dictate them our plan wont work without stealing from unwilling people all underlining the root cause of their flawed belief in gun power force wealth which is what criminals do vs value wealth there s no full lockdown because people can still go outside to thousands of essential retail stores and restaurants that are open the chinese could either drag people to quarantine zone or imprison an entire apartment by welding their doors shut we can t do that here but to save 200 000 lives maybe we should you think americans will spend 3 months stuck at home without a peep get real yawn hysteria 28 days is enough to almost eliminate it if done properly what would happen if we loosened restrictions and let hair salons open what about stores like best buys which offers repair services what if churches were allowed to open as long as they limited capacity would that lead to 500 000 additional deaths 75 000 deaths 1 5 million 164 723 deaths so you too are in love with patrick henry s stirring quote give me liberty unless i might catch the flu no we are not in this together when you go to city hall kneel down and beg them to tell you what to do for the next month that won t be me next to your pathetic pleas i ll be laughing at you while i m going about my business fuck off slaver i d love to see an actual scale on those flatten the curve graphs since it claims to measure in days first confirmed community spread in the us was in early february ffs we re well past the point where we should have spiked for no intervention of course we also only have a window that looks at the state of infections 2 weeks into the past too so we may possibly have peaked already but we won t know till the middle of the month reuters 81 said the country should continue social distancing initiatives including shelter at home orders despite the impact to the economy only 19 said they would like to end social distancing as soon as possible to get the economy going again including 11 of democrats and 30 of republicans the march 26 27 opinion poll released friday also showed that the public is much more likely to heed the advice of doctors and local government officials than president donald trump 66 said they would follow the instructions of medical doctors 64 said they would follow the advice of the cdc 51 said they would follow the advice from their state s governor 46 would follow healthcare directions from local police only 31 are very likely to follow president trump s recommendations and advice 99 here think you re generally pretty stupid must be a fact video trump s coronavirus calendar of delays denial and lies a democrat hoax while infections and deaths tripled video the problem is the solution the government must cure this but the governmental president is the problem perhaps the real problem is your incessant focus ideology that this nation has a monarchy king you d have a hard time blaming president trump if he wasn t the monarchy king in nazi land now wouldn t you you d have a hard time blaming president trump if he wasn t the monarchy king in nazi land now wouldn t you smirk you blamed trump the video is undeniable proof video fucking hypocritic libertarian now asks government to save him from what his mommy won t poor slimy piece of shit is willing to turn over his entire life to the government if they please please please save him from getting the flu and willing to use the government to make you help this slimy cowardly piece of shit fuck off and die slaver oh goody fucking lefty coward posts links showing other lefty cowards support this lefty coward who claims to be libertarian libertarian someone who proposes that individual efforts are better than government coercion hihn stuff your love for government coercion up your ass perhaps your head needs some company you scumbag hypocrite it s not surprising that people respond to the fear fascistlietellers like you are spreading 66 said they would follow the instructions of medical doctors 64 said they would follow the advice of the cdc 51 said they would follow the advice from their state s governor 46 would follow healthcare directions from local police so none of your fascist orders are actually needed because people will follow advice voluntarily and your whole narrative falls apart lied about my words pathetic the words and context he lies about are in bold face the march 26 27 opinion poll released friday also showed that the public is much more likely to heed the advice of doctors and local government officials than president donald trump 66 said they would follow the instructions of medical doctors 64 said they would follow the advice of the cdc 51 said they would follow the advice from their state s governor 46 would follow healthcare directions from local police only 31 are very likely to follow president trump s recommendations and advice how crazy are they so none of your fascist orders are actually needed advice fascist orders to alt right chicken littles voters strongly endorse fines ban on interstate travel voters are turning hardline in the face of the coronavirus two out of three now want to ban travel between states and fine those who violate social distancing guidelines again to minimize the risk to themselves and their loved ones as the death rate accelerates rasmussen polling is the most prominent republican pollster accelerating death count mar 26 first 1000 deaths 26 days mar 27 28 next 1 000 deaths double in two days apr2 5 01 pm eastern 5 800 total deaths up 580 in less than 7 days correction what noyb2 lied about the march 26 27 opinion poll released friday also showed that the public is much more likely to heed the advice of doctors and local government officials than president donald trump 66 said they would follow the instructions of medical doctors 64 said they would follow the advice of the cdc 51 said they would follow the advice from their state s governor 46 would follow healthcare directions from local police only 31 are very likely to follow president trump s recommendations and advice nobody trusts him recommendations and advice are not fascist orders sneer recommendations and advice are not fascist orders sneer i m glad you acknowledge that trump is not a fascist that s why you hate him i think pres trump would personally like to move to something more relaxed the cure can t be worse than the disease but there s a lot of political pressure on him not to and in the end its up to the state governors and local mayors maybe after april there might be some change i made 64 000 so far this year working online and i m aade such great money it s really user friendly and i m just so happy that i found out full time student i m using an online business opportunity i heard about and i ve mabout it here s what i ve been doingr read more i am now getting paid every month more than 25 000 by doing very easy job online from home i have earned last month 2540 from this easy job just by giving this job only 2 to 3 hrs a day using my laptop everybody on this earth can now get this job and start making more cash online just by follow instructions on this web page details here you complain and tell president trump listen to the doctors however you then bashing president trump for listening to the doctors the doctors have presented statistical models they use the model without any intervention to compare with proposed intervention methods president trump is not a doctor and should not be expected know all the nuances of this or any other pandemic or virus nor should we expect any president to be an expert in any field we do expect president s to gather knowledge people ranging from doctors and others regarding the economic concerns we should also expect that president s will make difficult decisions balancing the conflicting positions the reality is that no one really knows how it is going to eventually land one thing i do know for sure is that the doctors are much more credible than the author of this article or anyone in the media the media including this author have an elevated sense of self that is borderline narcissistic at best the media does not report news and has not for several decades it is far too tempting for the narcissistic media to spin opinion articles as news you ve raised a very important and seriously underrated point about leadership here nor should we expect any president to be an expert in any field this is spot on not just for the president but any leader leaders shouldn t be doing everything themselves that s not leadership this isn t even an effective way to get the job done leadership is about trusting your people bringing them together and synthesizing their subject area expertise to help everyone focus on the bigger picture i usually lose the argument and get people to laugh at me the moment i say this but ceos really are a minority and deserve a more fair shake from society most people aren t going to have the luxury of their parents already being leaders the stakes just aren t comparably high enough anywhere else and the leadership lessons they might get from sports or their church don t apply to the harsh world of scarcity i think this skill is what serves trump best his lack of expertise makes everyone think he s a bumbling idiot but he s really not in the slightest nor should we expect any president to be an expert in any field except for obama he was brilliant he knew nuclear physics and general relativity and understood internet protocols health care economics and history as if he had been there we need more brilliant geniuses like obama sarc the doctors have presented statistical models they use the model without any intervention to compare with proposed intervention methods if we do nothing isn t about intervention it has to do with behavior social distancing business closures and other measures many of those measures can be taken voluntarily without intervention trump wasn t primarily advocating for intervention he was advocating for voluntary changes in behavior big difference in fact the nba march madness cancellations happened before they were forced clearly the people were already doing something long before government stepped in voluntary changes in behavior which the vast majority of us are doing we are learning and adapting quickly the real heroes are the people who produce transport and deliver essential items food all of the others at the pharmacies medical workers police ems they are not giving up humans are astonishing really they are faux conservatives now screech that governments are not formed to protect and defend life they claim a god given right to infect and kill innocent people and have no clue what they advocate have yet to figure out how this is a false choice seems to me to be saying hey if we did nothing predictions are this many would die at this rate if we do this this and this predictions are this many less would die at this lower rate can t see anything false there only imbeciles see false choices sullum completely missed the point of these press conferences they aren t for abstract academic discussions about semantics they re for the american people the graph is saying if we do nothing at all like if people and corporations don t continue to respond the way they are 1 5 2 2m could die why is he saying this because we still have fucking retards holding large gatherings and getting more people infected good on trump for hitting the messaging home you can lead a horse to water but can t make it drink may be true but that doesn t mean you stop trying to lead the horse to water and sullum apparently has trouble understanding the difference between the baseline trump was using if we do nothing i e if everybody in the us behaved as if there were no epidemic and government action if we do nothing as in if the government does nothing and the action trump was advising wasn t more draconian federal measures but self restraint individual responsibility and state level actions that s because at heart sullum is a progressive who doesn t believe in any of those things at heart sullum wants the jackboot of government to stamp down on the country whenever he feels it s beneficial to america s collective well being that horizontal axis of days since first case conveniently leaves off any numerical labels does anyone have any idea what they should be or equivalently where we are now on that axis government is interested in determining where we are on the curve because they are getting to play masters of the universe thanks to a government caused lack of data isn t dammit accelerating death count mar 26 first 1000 deaths 26 days mar 27 28 next 1 000 deaths double in two days mar 29 30 next 1 000 deaths triple in two days apr2 12 37 pm next 2 300 deaths up 530 in 6 1 2 days so you talk about this as if it were news or surprising how is this related to what we re talking about whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooosh it s not a false choice anything else he didn t present a choice at all whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooosh he said it was a false choice it s in the fucking title yes sullum s title said it s a false choice but sullum is wrong because trump never presented a choice in the first place i corrected sullum and you simply keep repeating sullum s false statement deaths day are a terrible way to measure where you are on infections because current infections will cause deaths in the future deaths today were caused by infections in the past covid 19 has a relatively long incubation period at least 5 days till first symptom and possibly as long as 9 or longer even longer till symptoms become severe nor is it a good proxy for infections because not all people infected die in fact it s a pretty small percent especially since most infections are never confirmed because most people have mild cases or no symptoms at all those people can still spread the virus exactly what the true cfr ends up being can t be known now but estimates are 0 1 to 1 percent with the likely truth being somewhere in the middle it s also significantly age dependent so it will vary across communities based on age distribution so we could well have peaked already for infections but still be seeing the death toll climb rapidly cdc incubation period can be as long as 14 days https www cdc gov coronavirus 2019 ncov hcp clinical guidance management patients html we know there are 5 300 deaths in only 6 1 2 days and the pace is accelerating please no gummint conspiracies we know there are 5 300 deaths in only 6 1 2 days and the pace is accelerating really where is the evidence that the pace is accelerating for the last few days we have had about 1000 deaths per day attributed to covid wtf for the last few days we have had about 1000 deaths per day attributed to covid bullshit i gave you the actual pace and you sneered so you talk about this as if it were news or surprising six minutes later you say it s not news and is surprising what s your next dodge 1 your numbers were wrong you confused a report of ny s total death toll up to 12 37pm on april 2 2300 with a national daily increase in death toll 2 an increase in the daily death toll does not automatically imply an increase in the pace of the epidemic so even if your numbers had been right you d still be wrong anything else if daily deaths change from 5 to 500 the pace is faster if daily deaths change from 500 to 5 the pace is slower pace means how fast the total deaths are changing 5 000 5500 6100 6900 is increasing the pace from 500 dpd 600 dpd 800 dpd still confused equate deaths per day with mph 50 mph 60 mph 70 mph 80 mph is an increasing pace pace means speed 5 000 5500 6100 6900 is increasing the pace from 500 dpd 600 dpd 800 dpd so you admit that your numbers were wildly wrong good that s a start 50 mph 60 mph 70 mph 80 mph is an increasing pace correct but an accelerating pace is different from an increasing pace the second problem with your reasoning is that current death rates tell you little about the effectiveness of countermeasures because current death rates reflect infections from weeks ago therefore today s death tolls tell you little about the state of the epidemic right now rasmussen polling is the most prominent republican pollster voters strongly endorse fines ban on interstate travel voters are turning hardline in the face of the coronavirus two out of three now want to ban travel between states and fine those who violate social distancing guidelines again to minimize the risk to themselves and their loved ones again to minimize the risk to themselves and their loved ones yes that s how the fascists justified murdering millions of people to minimize the risk to themselves and their loved ones of course you d be on board with that chicken little hysteria confuses government and voters omfg yes that s how the fascists justified murdering millions of people to minimize the risk to themselves and their loved ones fascists were the government millions of people are the ones you would allow to die and they reject your fascism fascists were the government yes fascists were the government plus the voters that voted them into power voters who thought that minimizing the risk to themselves and their loved ones was more important than anything else voters just like you see in a free society it s your responsibility to minimize the risk to yourself and your loved ones and if you have failed at doing so you don t get to demand that others do it for you you don t want a free society you want a fascist society in which collective outcomes override individual choice and individual responsibility millions of people are the ones you would allow to die indeed i think people should be allowed to die if they choose to die or make bad choices yes fascists were the government i appreciate your retraction millions of people are the ones you would allow to die indeed i think people should be allowed to die if they choose to die or make bad choices the survey you ridiculed is millions of people who choose to live and you deny them that choice what s your next mind game i appreciate your retraction no you just demonstrate your ability to selectively quote let me write it out again for you yes fascists were the government plus the voters that voted them into power voters like you the survey you ridiculed is millions of people who choose to live and you deny them that choice not at all those millions of people can shelter at home in any way they like what i deny them is to do so at my expense and i don t ridicule them i condemn their choice a choice rooted in the misguided propaganda brownshirts like you are spreading please log in to post comments eugene
