romney and president barack obama in 2012 ap get ready presidential swing states now the campaign ad crush and tv spending spree really begins the tv ad war for the 2012 presidential contest its total spending expected to swell to 1 1 billion is set to start anew now that both party conventions are over and the two month sprint to the general election is under way just over a third of that amount has been spent so far according to the kantar campaign media analysis group which tracks campaign ad spending that means the campaigns and independent groups will spend more on the air in the final eight weeks of the presidential contest than they did in the first five months the biggest change is on the republican side with mitt romney now free to tap millions in general election funds he had collected but could not spend until becoming the party apos s official nominee with that accomplished the gop apos s already significant spending advantage over president barack obama and his democratic allies will grow larger still the first time in history an incumbent president will have been outspent on the air by his opponents while the level of spending may be eye popping the playing field is even narrower national polls show obama and romney in a virtual dead heat but only eight states are considered true battlegrounds colorado florida iowa nevada new hampshire north carolina ohio and virginia obama carried all of them against republican john mccain in 2008 but they are too close to call for now flush with new cash the romney campaign moved quickly to take advantage pouring nearly 5 million into a new ad campaign across those states beginning this weekend after being dark for nearly two weeks a series of state specific ads hit obama on defense spending business regulations and housing while another ad uses president bill clinton apos s words from the 2008 primary race against obama a proliferation of republican leaning independent groups led by the two pronged juggernaut american crossroads and crossroads gps kept romney in the game throughout the summer while he regrouped from a bruising gop primary contest that tapped considerable campaign

spent 166 million on ads through aug 30 compared with 74 million by the romney campaign and 22 million by the republican national committee but now with romney apos s general election resources unleashed and the republican leaning groups continuing to air ads backing his candidacy the obama campaign will be all but swamped on the air it will be no holds barred on the republican side all that money the obama campaign has been expecting romney to spend on ads will finally start to flow kantar cmag vice president elizabeth wilner said the obama campaign is betting on their message while the romney campaign is betting on tonnage obama campaign officials acknowledged friday how outmatched they are by republicans on tv but said they had enough money to compete they also pointed to their sophisticated ground organizing efforts saying their ability to identify voters and get them to the polls would in part offset their advertising disadvantage romney and the independent groups spent 245 million on ads through the end of august while obama and his allies spent 188 million according to information from media buyers provided to the associated press obama apos s team front loaded its ad spending in the spring but republicans caught up in june and began outspending obama by mid july often by a 2 1 margin republicans abandoned their efforts in michigan and pennsylvania after hoping to make those democratic leaning states competitive for romney the gop hopeful was born in and grew up in michigan where his father served as a popular two term governor and pennsylvania has a large population of white working class voters which has long been one of obama apos s weakest demographic groups a significant shift in momentum for romney could put those and other states back in play
