apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap first the united states imposed a tax on chinese steel and aluminum then china counterpunched monday with tariffs on a host of u s products including apples pork and ginseng on wall street the stock market buckled on the prospect of an all out trade war between the world s two biggest economies but it hasn t come to that not yet anyway we re in a trade slap fight right now not a trade war said derek scissors resident scholar and china specialist at the conservative american enterprise institute top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century china is a relatively insignificant supplier of steel and aluminum to the united states and the 3 billion in u s products that beijing targeted monday amount to barely 2 percent of american goods exported to china but the dispute could escalate and quickly already in a separate move the united states is drawing up a list of about 50 billion in chinese imports to tax in an effort to punish beijing for stealing american technology or forcing u s companies to hand over trade secrets china could respond by targeting american commercial interests uniquely dependent on the chinese market the aircraft giant boeing for example and soybean farmers the possibility that the u s and china will descend into a full blown trade war knocked the dow jones industrial average down as much as 758 points in afternoon trading the dow recovered some ground and finished down 458 92 points or 1 9 percent at 23 644 19 for weeks in fact president donald trump s aggressive trade actions have depressed the stock market but many trade analysts suggested that the wall street sell off may be an overreaction china s swift but measured retaliation to the u s steel and aluminum tariffs is meant to show that it will not be pushed around but that it does not want a trade war said amanda debusk chair of the international trade department at the law firm hughes hubbard reed it is possible for the countries to pull back from the brink it seems to be pretty measured and proportional agreed wendy cutler a former u s trade official who is now vice president at the asia society policy institute they didn t seem to overreach and they didn t hit our big ticket items like planes and soybeans even if china s tariffs don t have a huge impact on america s 20 trillion economy they will bring pain to specific communities take marathon county in wisconsin where 140 local families grow ginseng a root that is used in herbal remedies and is popular in asia around 30 million or 85 percent of the area s ginseng production went to china as exports or gifts the county which gave trump nearly 57 percent of its vote in 2016 holds an international ginseng festival in september crowning a ginseng queen and drawing visitors from china and taiwan china s new 15 percent tariff on ginseng is definitely going to hit the growers hard if this happens said jackie fett executive director of the ginseng board of wisconsin it is the livelihood of many people we re still holding on to a little bit of hope that the tariffs can be reversed jim schumacher co owner of schumacher ginseng in marathon wisconsin said the 15 percent tax will hurt you ve got to be price competitive even if you have the top quality product we re definitely concerned we hope something can be resolved trump campaigned on a promise to overhaul american trade policy in his view what he calls flawed trade agreements and sharp elbowed practices by china and other trading partners are in part responsible for america s gaping trade deficit 566 billion last year the deficit in the trade of goods with china last year hit a record 375 billion in his first year in office trump s talk was tougher than his actions on trade but he has gradually grown more aggressive in january he slapped tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines last month he imposed duties on steel and aluminum imports but spared most major economies except china and japan now he is moving toward steep tariffs to pressure beijing into treating u s technology companies more fairly in the meantime his administration has lost two voices that cautioned against protectionist trade policies secretary of state rex tillerson and white house economic adviser gary cohn given the increasingly hostile rhetoric backed up by tangible trade sanctions already announced by both the u s and china it will take a determined effort on both sides to come up with a mediated compromise that tamps down trade tensions and allows both sides to save face said eswar prasad professor of trade policy at cornell university if the dispute escalates china can pick more vulnerable targets in the year that ended last aug 31 america s soybean farmers for instance sent 12 4 billion worth of soybeans to china that was 57 percent of total u s soybean exports brent bible a soybean and corn farmer in lafayette indiana has appeared in tv ads by the
