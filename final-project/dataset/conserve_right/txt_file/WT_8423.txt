effects investors are taking into account better than expected earnings from some of the globe s biggest companies and other encouraging economic indicators from outside china perhaps most important investors are looking at more than just the public health measures that are being taken against the virus they are taking into account the financial tools available to counter the economic damage they are hoping that even if the virus spreads further central banks can once again come to the rescue and prop up the global economy by cutting interest rates and offering other stimulus much as they have
