illegitimate impeachment inquiry the nonbinding resolution gives senate republicans a chance to show support for trump at a moment when trump is urging his republican allies to get tougher and fight harder for him white house officials who have been treating unified republican support for trump as a given have grown increasingly fearful of defections in a potential impeachment vote by the democratic house and even in an eventual trial in the republican senate while officials don t believe there will be enough votes to remove the republican president as democrats hope the west wing believes more must be done to shore up party support to avoid embarrassment and genuine political peril some trump allies also believe the white house must directly address the increasingly troubling
