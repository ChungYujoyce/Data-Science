netflix and tiktok pulled out and more than 50 000 people signed a petition asking for it to be canceled the more we re able to test the more we ll be able to find coronavirus infections said dr william schaffner an infectious disease specialist at vanderbilt university what we will demonstrate is actually that the coronavirus is likely widely distributed in the united states even a few days ago many of us were not sure whether coronavirus in the united states was very focal just in a few places or whether it was widely distributed we need to do more testing he said adding it appears there was undetected community transmission going on i think reporting locally the identification of cases locally brings to home what many people have thought was far away and that makes everyone think more seriously about what they need to do locally i think we re on the razor s edge from moving from containment strategy to mitigation in efforts to contain the virus some schools have shut down and companies have asked employees to work from home dr schaffner said individuals can become semi hermits and avoid large groups of people that could put them at risk of infection suggesting eating home instead of at restaurants and avoiding grocery shopping at peak hours china where the outbreak began has reported more than 80 000 coronavirus illnesses south korea has reported more than 6 000 cases iran ranks third at more than 4 700 cases while italy ranks fourth with nearly 4 000 infections at least 90 countries have reported cases as cases increase we are continuing to recommend that all countries make containment their highest priority we continue to call on countries to find test isolate and care for every case and to trace every contact mr tedros ghebreyesus director general of the world health organization said friday slowing down the epidemic saves lives and it buys time for preparedness and for research and development mr tedros said who has received
