wants sen marco rubio to be republicans presidential nominee so he s going to vote this week for ohio gov john kasich one of mr rubio s competitors it s part of a divide and conquer strategy designed to derail front runner donald trump s march to the nomination mr rubio mr kasich and sen ted cruz are picking their battles and trying not to overlap each other as they target mr trump ahead of tuesday when voters cast ballots in ohio and florida as well as in illinois north carolina and missouri mr rubio s campaign has explicitly urged its supporters to back mr kasich in ohio mr kasich has declined to do the same for mr rubio in florida but he s stayed out of that state anyway leaving the path clear for mr rubio to maximize votes there mr cruz has also avoided florida instead focusing on the other states see also john kasich catches donald trump in ohio poll analysts say the divide and conquer strategy is not likely to succeed because it requires a lot of very informed strategic minded voters but the fact that the campaigns are implicitly condoning the strategy or in the case of mr rubio explicitly extolling it suggests just how divisive this year s race has become on the gop side i think if donald is the nominee i think it is a disaster texas sen ted cruz said sunday on abc i mean it s a disaster for republicans for conservatives i think it s a disaster for the country because if donald is the nominee it makes it much much more likely that hillary clinton wins the general mr cruz is hoping to get into a one on one battle with mr trump saying the anti trump forces are more than enough to deliver him a victory but mr rubio and mr kasich despite generally subpar campaigns have declined to drop out saying they expected to get boosts from voters in their home states of florida and ohio see also mitt romney joins john kasich on campaign trail in bid to stop donald trump all three share a goal deny mr trump the 1 237 delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention in july mr cruz says he can still win enough delegates to defeat mr trump outright while the other two are unlikely to win a majority and are instead hoping to force the decision past the first ballot at the convention their strategy relies on the upcoming winner take all states such as ohio and florida where the top vote getter will claim all of the delegates to the convention mr rubio had hoped to win in florida and mr kasich in ohio denying mr trump the massive delegate haul in each state and making a contested convention more likely their determination to stop mr trump has only grown in the last couple of days as mr trump has faced increasing questions about his rhetoric and the protests it has spawned we are not going to allow the republican party to become the party of fear and frustration and anger mr rubio said at an evening rally in orlando in ohio mr kaiser says he knows of 20 people who support either mr rubio or mr cruz but who plan to vote for mr kasich in an effort to deny mr trump a path to victory the momentum is building for kasich in ohio but you don t see that in any other state it is building in ohio because people want to stop trump and that is everybody s goal said mr kaiser who is from springboro ohio the polls are showing that kasich was down by double digits in ohio until this talk about this strategy started taking off and all of a sudden he is up five points in some polls mr kasich has indeed surged with the real clear politics average of polls now giving the governor a 2 percentage point lead in the state mr rubio though has not kept up his end of the tacit agreement and trails mr trump by nearly 20 points in florida mr trump meanwhile holds a commanding lead in north carolina though mr cruz has jumped in polls in missouri and illinois suggesting the front runner s recent travails are slowing him trump backers are dismissive of the divide and conquer strategy calling it a last gasp effort that will only perpetuate divisions within the gop and will aid democratic presidential front runner mrs clinton it s going to be successful in electing hillary their divide and conquer for hillary is what that tactic s going to lead to former alaska gov sarah palin a trump backer said sunday as she campaigned at a rodeo in arcadia southeast of tampa it makes no sense to average everyday americans who aren t part of that kind of inside baseball power struggle play that they re all part of she said their divide and conquer is a stupid strategy there s no polling to know for sure whether the tactic is working but analysts said it s been tried before and didn t work larry j sabato director of the university of virginia s center for politics pointed to 1964 when moderate and liberal republicans teamed up to try to stop sen barry goldwater from claiming the gop s nomination it was a different era and primaries were many fewer but govs nelson rockefeller george romney bill scranton and other officeholders tried to orchestrate a group of favorite sons including themselves to deny goldwater a convention majority obviously it didn t work mr sabato said the rubio campaign which has been the most vocal proponent of the divide and conquer strategy said it was mostly a recognition of reality i can tell you that in florida i m the only one that can beat donald trump and whether someone supports ted cruz or john kasich if you vote for them in florida you re in essence voting for donald trump mr rubio said but he said there are limits to how far the coordination can go he ruled out the possibility of joining forces with mr cruz part of the problem this year is that while strategic voting could help mr rubio and mr kasich stay in the race longer it hurts mr cruz s chance to get mr trump in the one on one matchup that polls say he could win florida and ohio are going to have an outsize role in all of this in terms of whether trump has the magic number of delegates or whether he goes in to the convention short of the finish line said florida agriculture commissioner adam putnam a rubio backer if he doesn t get to the magic number i think there s a number of variables out there in terms of how close he actually is whether the other candidates remain consolidate around an alternative or whether they continue to splinter in terms of endorsing trump or not endorsing trump you re writing a new playbook at that point establishment republicans had hoped that as the field narrowed anti trump forces would consolidate but mr trump says he ll get some of the voters who would have backed former candidates and indeed he s won several surprising endorsements new jersey gov chris christie stunned his party by backing mr trump and on friday retired neurosurgeon ben carson who dropped out of the race earlier this month followed suit seth mclaughlin reported from columbus ohio david sherfinski and anjali shastry contributed to this article from washington copyright 2020 the
