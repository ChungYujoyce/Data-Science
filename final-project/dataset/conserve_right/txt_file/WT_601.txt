director of national intelligence witnesses who heard the call testified to the accuracy of that account trump suggesting that atkinson had claimed that the whistleblower complaint regarding ukraine should be discounted because of political bias he even said it was politically biased he actually said that news briefing saturday the facts he actually did not say that atkinson did not state that the complaint was politically biased or suggest that it should not be regarded seriously to the contrary atkinson wrote in a letter to joseph maguire then the acting director of national intelligence that any potential bias on the whistleblower s part did not take away from his overall conclusion that the complaint was credible he noted that an initial review by his inspector general s office had found support for key allegations in the complaint including that trump had put pressure on ukraine s leader to take action favorable to his reelection campaign associated press writer darlene
