national review biden s middle class tax pledge envision a presidential campaign without handshakes rope lines or rallies expose the fraudulent trump russia plot at all levels apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions one of the right s most common and best arguments for the trump presidency is that it shattered the republican party s calcified agenda invested in a coalition of various interests and beholden to a pervasive and outdated reagan nostalgia the gop desperately needed new rhetoric and a new approach for good or ill president trump provided both the democrats effort to come up with a program separate from anti trumpism suggests they re in desperate need of some disruption as well say what you will about reagan nostalgia it s at least fresher than fdr nostalgia which has largely defined the democratic party for the better part of a century when democrats look for a policy vision their framework is the new deal harry truman s fair deal and lbj s great society were both continuations of the new deal after the 9 11 attacks new york senator charles schumer wrote in the washington post that the attacks proved that the era of a shrinking federal government has come to a close this new challenge proved we needed a new new deal even the new deal s biggest competitor john f kennedy nostalgia has always been about aesthetics and atmospherics kennedy s own policy agenda never broke with the new deal paradigm barack obama who had a kennedy esque cult of personality was nonetheless expected by liberals to be a new fdr which is why time magazine ran a picture of a photoshopped obama as roosevelt on its cover after the 2008 election when obama rolled out his sweeping policy vision a new foundation it was a new deal rehash house democratic leader nancy pelosi 78 is a child of the new deal her father thomas d alesandro jr a passionate new dealer in congress named one of his sons franklin d roosevelt d alesandro the new deal remains pelosi s north star which may be why she accidentally referred to their new program as the new deal now the democrats have their better deal agenda yet another new deal retread the democrats even admit it pelosi insisted that the better deal is not a course correction it is a presentation correction schumer says it was chosen in part for its relation to both the new deal and a better deal than trump it s remarkable how democrats call gop ideas tired and outdated yet keep returning to a well that was dug four years after the invention of sliced bread at the rollout of a better deal pelosi said it is founded on strong values that we share strong values fueled by fresh ideas on fox news sunday anchor chris wallace asked house democratic caucus chairman joe crowley to give me one fresh idea that democrats are offering voters for november the fdr coalition is a relic the coalition the democrats want is shot through with divisions the better deal gives democratic pols something to talk about that won t rile one faction or another crowley s confident response a new infrastructure plan but one that unlike trump s plan the feds would pick up more of the tab for can t you smell the freshness ironically the new deal was never a coherent program it was a mixed and entirely ad hoc dirigiste response to an economic crisis to look upon these programs as the result of a unified plan wrote raymond moley fdr s right hand man during much of the new deal was to believe that the accumulation of stuffed snakes baseball pictures school flags old tennis shoes carpenter s tools geometry books and chemistry sets in a boy s bedroom could have been put there by an interior decorator there are many reasons the democrats remain a cargo cult to the new deal but the most important one for this moment is that the approach unifies not democratic voters but democratic politicians the fdr coalition is a relic the coalition the democrats want is shot through with divisions the better deal gives democratic pols something to talk about that won t rile one faction or another that may be good enough to win the 2018 midterm elections because all they really need is some boilerplate to rely on as they ride an anti trump wave but the time will come when it won t be enough the disruption is coming they can help shape it or they await a destroyer not of their own choosing 2018 tribune content agency llc get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
