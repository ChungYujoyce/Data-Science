to your inbox sign up here israel has gone to great lengths and donated generously to protect palestinians in the west bank and the gaza strip from the coronavirus pandemic but our lifesaving assistance has been greeted by palestinians spreading lies and inciting hatred against israel and the jewish people the palestinian authority that governs much of the west bank and the terrorist group hamas that rules the gaza strip have been happy to accept massive amounts of israeli assistance which includes professional medical training for palestinians to share best practices and ensure they
