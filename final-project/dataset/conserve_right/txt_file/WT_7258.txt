apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap how fragile is the global economy the u s china trade war is weakening businesses in both countries germany s economy shrank in the second quarter and britain appears headed for a disruptive exit from the european union this fall those trends have hammered american manufacturers and caused global financial markets to plunge on fears that the world s largest economy could slip into a recession yet most analysts expect the u s economy to power through the rough patch at least in the coming months on the strength of solid consumer spending and a resilient job market top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed the u s stock market plummeted earlier this week when the bond market spooked by the global turmoil sent a possible early warning sign of a recession ahead the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note slipped briefly below 2 year treasury yields that is an unusual shift that indicates investors expect the u s economy to expand much more slowly in the coming months the shift has preceded at least the last five u s recessions though as much as two years can pass before a recession actually hits still most economists were buoyed by a robust retail sales report thursday that suggested that american consumers aren t fretting about bond yields sales at u s stores and restaurants jumped in july by the most in four months online sales soared to their best showing since january spending at restaurants is a sign of confidence given that most people eat out when they feel they have money to spare with the rest of the world sliding into the abyss the july retail sales figures show a resurgent u s consumer riding to the rescue said michael pearce senior u s economist at capital economics a consulting firm if anything it s the trump administration s trade war that has been harming the world economy president donald trump has imposed 25 tariffs on 250 billion of imports from china along with duties on most steel and aluminum imports he has also threatened to hit the remaining 300 billion worth of chinese imports with 10 tariffs though he has delayed that increase on about half of those items to avoid raising prices for u s holiday shoppers still the tariffs and beijing s retaliatory duties on 110 billion of u s goods have dragged down china s growth to its slowest pace in 26 years that slowdown in the world s second largest economy has in turn pummeled germany s economy because germans export industrial equipment to china germany s economy actually shrank in the second quarter other global headwinds remain a threat simon macadam global economist at capital economics said the chances of a no deal brexit have risen sharply since boris johnson replaced theresa may as british prime minister last month johnson is dead keen on leaving the eu by oct 31 the deadline for any deal macadam noted an abrupt exit would most likely lower the british pound raising inflation and cutting into british consumer spending supply chains for british manufacturers and retailers would also probably be disrupted as the country reinstates its customs procedures one of the u s economy s biggest weak spots is manufacturing which is suffering from the trade war and global growth strains factory output has sunk over the past 12 months manufacturing job growth has tapered off during the past year surveys of manufacturers indicate that the uncertainty from tariffs is hurting their businesses american manufacturers appear to be either in a recession or on the verge of a downturn said joe brusuelas chief economist for the consultancy rsm the best possible boost for u s factories would be if trump pulled back on trade hostilities with china and achieved a trade deal brusuelas said right now the recession risks are more policy driven and if policy does not change or the trade and finance war with china escalates then the manufacturing recession will become a broader and deeper contraction that threatens to spill over into other areas of the economy he said trump who promised voters a manufacturing renaissance has yet to acknowledge the sector s bleak condition we re restoring the glory of american manufacturing the president said tuesday in pennsylvania a state that has lost 5 600 factory jobs so far this year in fact many economists say they re nervous that the government has fewer options to juice the economy than it has in the past the short term interest rate that the fed controls is barely above 2 giving it far less room to stimulate growth in the event of a downturn before the great recession in 2007 the fed s rate was more than twice that level and the widening budget deficit on track to hit 1 trillion by 2022 also leaves the government with little room to maneuver it is very uncharacteristic very unusual to be running larger budget deficits every year said tim quinlan an economist at wells fargo the federal government is not in a very strong position to offer a fiscal response in the event that it s needed consumers could also pull back on spending later this year if hiring slows and wage gains slow employers have already reduced on average the number of hours worked for employees in the second quarter which cuts into paychecks and if trump imposes tariffs on all 300 billion of chinese goods by mid december as he says he plans to do american consumers will pay more for such things as laptops cellphones video game consoles and clothing at the same time many economists say they think consumers can withstand the headwinds household debt as a percentage of income is much lower than it was before the great recession and lower interest rates make it easier to pay off debts that s likely to sustain u s growth though at a slower pace consumers financial health has improved and even in the case of an employment and income shock they re going to remain resilient enough to withstand the shock sai
