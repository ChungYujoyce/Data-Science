the world and pushed to bolster struggling coal fired and nuclear power plants he said last year that a rash of coal and nuclear retirements was alarming and posed a looming crisis for the nation s power grid if unchecked the plant closures will threaten our ability to recover from intentional attacks and natural disasters perry said at a speech in texas trump who has frequently promised to bring back coal jobs directed perry in june 2018 to take immediate steps to bolster struggling coal fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open calling it a matter of national and economic security no definitive action has been taken since then a regional transmission organization that oversees the power grid in 13 eastern and midwestern states said there s no immediate threat to system

the white house he has toured energy department sites around the country represented the trump administration at meetings overseas and begun a years long process to revive a shuttered nuclear waste dump at nevada s yucca mountain before taking the energy job perry had been subjected to widespread ridicule after forgetting the name of an agency he pledged to eliminate as president that agency was the energy department despite that perry has emerged as a strong defender of the department s work especially the 17 national labs that conduct cutting edge research on everything from national security to renewable energy i m telling you officially the coolest job i ve ever had is being secretary of energy and it s because of these labs perry told employees at the idaho national laboratory in 2017 trump denied reports that texas gov greg abbott or alaska gov mike dunleavy could replace perry but said they would both be very good colvin reported from fort worth texas associated press
