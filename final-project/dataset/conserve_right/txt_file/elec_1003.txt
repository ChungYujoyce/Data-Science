trying to tilt the playing field in favor of the wealthy and against the middle class mr reid has been a thorn in republicans side serving as mr obama s last line of defense on capitol hill the five

said his former boss is not as well known as house speaker nancy pelosi the californian to whom republicans linked vulnerable democrats with some success in previous elections very few americans know who sen reid is and so if they are going to go after him i don t think it is going to work mr manley said it sure seems to me that the rnc is being awful sensitive these days and sen reid is getting
