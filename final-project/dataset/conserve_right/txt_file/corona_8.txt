interview with cbs at the end of the day i m not going to let it stop me from partying sluder with his sun tinged face and backwards cap probably didn t realize that he d become an unwitting mascot for the perils of ignoring social distancing policies discouraging nearly every form of public interaction from widespread restaurant closures to a prohibition on big box retailers selling paint have popped up across the country in an attempt to curb the coronavirus some of those policies still make sense closing outdoor spaces does not that includes the beaches in florida which have slowly begun reopening on a county by county basis predictably the move wasn t without backlash the trouble is florida s not known for good or safe writes diane roberts a professor of english at florida state university in a washington post op ed citing the derisory florida man stereotype who is known for his ridiculous antics and disregard for the law roberts concludes that floridians simply cannot be trusted with the privilege of going to the beach in times like this but roberts does not cite any infectious disease specialists who are trained to analyze the risks of such situations using science not stereotypes what do those experts have to say it bugs me to see these restrictions on people being outside said edward nardell a professor in the departments of environmental health and immunology and infectious diseases at the harvard t h chan school of public health nardell told slate that he favors opening the beaches so long as social distancing rules are put in place and enforced and no beach has reopened in florida without social distancing guidelines jacksonville the first city to open the proverbial floodgates has banned sunbathing and prohibited beachgoers from bringing coolers grills and chairs organized beach sports are also forbidden put differently you are allowed to walk or jog on the beach and you are allowed to go swimming the beach is no bogeyman when beachgoers follow social distancing guidelines indeed it might even be safer than a busy urban sidewalk where individuals don t always have the luxury of staying six feet apart of course even sidewalks are not necessarily that high of a risk according to daniel kuritzkes the chief of the infectious disease division at brigham and women s hospital i don t think there s a real concern about catching covid 19 from walking past someone kuritzkers told boston magazine that such brief interactions if you can even call them that carry low risk for covid 19 transmissions though it s still recommended that everyone dons a face mask many parks were also shuttered when the coronavirus first hit the u s recently some states and localities have started gradually lightening those restrictions low income residents probably stand to gain the most from that since they often lack large comfortable living spaces to retreat to when practically all other corners of society are blocked off from public use while everybody benefits from getting outside the advantages are perhaps even greater for those who have been forced to shelter in place in small crowded homes but the science hasn t swayed every lawmaker florida s beaches reopening virtually coincided with orange county california closing theirs after photos showed huntington beach and newport beach both teeming with sunbathing visitors the knee jerk reaction is understandable but perhaps gov gavin newsom d could have avoided a prohibition in favor of a more measured approach one with enhanced social distancing guidelines if you re swimming more than 6 feet away from people you re probably reasonably safe michael buchmeier a professor of infectious diseases at the university of california irvine told the guardian the virus is very sensitive to ultraviolet light and very sensitive to heating it s not likely to survive in heat and sunlight lucky for residents of florida california and many other states their beaches have

already told the tyrannical government agents to fuck off and going about activities as they see fit we have been going about in georgia for weeks beaches mountains stores businesses all open when israel was in egypt s land let my people go oppress d so hard they could not stand let my people go of course just the people of color for the whites to claim oppression would be cultural appropriation plus us celts burn like a son of a bitch many public health experts say the benefits outweigh the risks well thank god the experts we elected to decide for us what s for our own good are benevolent as well as wise and noble let us all be grateful for their kindness yea fuck this utilitarian appeal bullshit let people go outside because we re not fucking totalitarian subjects they may let you go outside as long as you behave it s a miracle i haven t thrown something through my tv oh don t get me started on those f ing commercials all with the tinkling piano music and smiling faces i think the worst has been the ones cbs streaming have been running and entertainment tonight makes me want to puke yeah beginning to think i haven t made it clear enough that my rights shouldn t be violated so trivially being outside even if it s just for a walk is beneficial social distancing however is still necessary wear a mask when you go out in public and keep the necessary 6 ft or more away from other people but the science hasn t swayed every policymaker hmmph you re only supposed to follow the science when it keeps those people under control karen science is only what they agree with don t you know i mean how is this different then the anti gmo or anti nuclear power movements jesus christ there is no motherfucking the science goddamn it kind of my fucking point didn t you get the sarcasm but perhaps gov gavin newsom d could have avoided a prohibition in favor of a more measured approach one with enhanced social distancing guidelines expecting governor nodick to do anything in a reasonable or measured approach is pointless the man is a schmuck and after his stupidity is likely to get chippered in the next election let s describe what newsom actually did he saw people not following his vague orders threw a fit and put the state back in a timeout we see the same thing with lightfoot inslee and whitmer don t forget kate brown the maggotnificent blackfast northam whoever wears the crown in new mexico after his stupidity is likely to get chippered in the next election a d lose an election in ca yeah right a very frequently observed characteristic of those particulalry males with certain preferences as the ones the gabbling nuisance has and practices is an inordinate penchant for maintaining strict control over others bossing them around making certain they have no fun except the fun he thinks appropriate power and control drive such peopple and the unironically label the right as authoritarians if governor newson ain t having fun ain t nobody having fun a very frequently observed characteristic of those particulalry males with certain preferences as the ones the gabbling nuisance has and practices is an inordinate penchant for maintaining strict control over others bossing them around making certain they have no fun except the fun he thinks appropriate power and control drive such people many public health experts say the benefits outweigh the risks why should it matter what public health experts say congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances can someone point me to the public health experts exemption in the first amendment in regards to freedom of assembly it s fairly short and i can t seem to find it anywhere the general welfare clause which obviates all other constitutional clauses rights and guarantees provided the authorities are genuinely acting in the best interests of the people which they always are obviously it s funny when you write stuff like that but when ostensibly libertarian journalists write shit like that without any hint of sarcasm it isn t funny at all ostensibly is doing a hell of a lot of work in that sentence i don t think billy has ever claimed to be a libertarian to be sure the general welfare clause which obviates all other constitutional clauses rights and guarantees provided the authorities are genuinely acting in the best interests of the people which they always are obviously you know they always say shit like that they do try to use that general welfare line from the preamble and one could argue that it was true was see the constitution was amended this means that it was changed and it was changed with the purpose of removing such broad discretionary powers in fact those powers were removed with the first amendment they are allowed to promote the general welfare so long as that promotion does not interfere with or establish a religious practice or interfere with freedom of speech or of the press or of the people to freely assemble or of the freedom to petition the government for a redress of grievances i would think the arbitrary taking over of all business in a state might be a grievance it is called a compelling government interest ken and public health is one of those interests this shit isn t hard the constitution isn t what is going to save you here a compelling government interest arguable it is and it gets less arguable every day but that is the debate i wish people understood that if people were being compelled by the government to go out on the beach or associate with others who do that might make more sense since they aren t it doesn t if somebody wants to stay in their house that s great they should be allowed to stay in their house and should not be compelled to leave but to say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do this is fascist this is not democratic this is not freedom give people back their goddamn freedom elon musk https arstechnica com cars 2020 05 tesla stock plunges after musk tweets tesla stock price is too high using the coercive power of the state and threats from the police to force your qualitative preferences on people who do not share them is at least half the definition of fascism regardless of whether you call it a compelling government interest or some other bullshit even elon musk gets it p s there is no estimation of the qualitative best interests of the american people better than that taken from watching what they freely choose to do imagining otherwise is practically the definition of elitism meanwhile if you re using the government to compel people to do anything different from what they want to do of their own free will you have abandoned any pretense at claiming to know or represent their qualitative interests but in framing the debate it should always be noted that the compelling governmental interest is not part of the constitution s text that it is a construct made up by the courts and that the constitution itself does not authorize the courts to balance the liberties protected by the decalogue against the made up compelling interest btw rip coach shula eugenics was a compelling argument per the courts for a decade or two doesnt make it right it s not a debate so much as an assertion government always believes it has a compelling interest in everything that s why the bill of rights exists to clearly list a number of things that the government initially the feds but later incorporated to apply to states can never have a compelling interest in doing a bill of rights that is void when there s a compelling government interest is nothing at all point me to where in the us constituition anything to do wouth the health of either individuals or po ulatioins in general is assigned fedgov and don t give me that carp about general welfare this nonsens is not general welfare it is specific and thus not what is meant by that phrase when did we cede to either fedgov or our separate state governments the job of keepong us safe from this or that or anything or everyting the second article of ammendment is the only place were our security is mentioned being safe and in that article we have the responsibiltu clearly assigned to the people which is why the people already have the right to arms which cannot be taken from us our safety is our respoinibility individuall and collectivelhy it never was to be pawned off onto government their job is to protect our rights as detailed in the bill of rights as a starting set but here we have government at all levels interfering with the day to day business and conduct of individuals in ways that would have made our founding generation looking to find more powder and shot having alreasy expended most of wnat they had already expended their stores against those tyrants closing their churches meeting halls businesses banks public houses restaurants schools ordered folks to stay inside their homes and not visit or gather they d have none of it and don t tell me nothing like this happened in their day plagues pestilsnces infestationis etc killed a huge percentage of them yet they never went into lockdown can t seem to find those words in the first amendment either john and even if i give that inch the interest would be to quarantine sick people not healthy hope you ve been doin ok through all this my dad is in va and said they re stay at home goes to the middle of june there is no real government compelling interest in violating the constitution protected rights of americans none there are firmly established exceptions declarations of war suspension of habeas corpus in time of invasion notice politicians were scared shitless to use terms like martial law or executive suspension of habeas corpus they tried to use shelter in place and it failed for more than a fee weeks as tyrants are fond of saying the constitution is not a suicide pact its not you cannot force americans to follow the constitution if the people dont want to follow the constitution because the government is acting like tyrant it is the right of the people to overthrow that tyrannical government and start anew as in 10th amendment right as kn burn it all down and start anew as in commifornia is trying to force people to wear masks ya put all state politicians and agents of the state in woodchippers and start anew the state can only criminalize liberty if you let them fuck them why should it matter what public health experts say is public health expert an actual job title the closer we get to do as i say or die of covid it sounds more like a mob euphemism vinnie s our public health expert he s here to ensure that everyone does what they re told what s in their best interest so that nothing unfortunate happens many public health experts say the benefits outweigh the risks but

beach holding signs such as recall newsom and waving flags huntington beach police estimated the crowd size at 2 500 3 000 many of them appeared to be standing close to each other not obeying the six foot distancing guidelines issued by the state and most health authorities a line of officers on horseback stood by to contain the crowds to the sidewalks https abc7 com huntington beach protest

home during the lockdown while lecturing the public on the need for strict social distancing the scientist whose advice prompted boris johnson to lock down britain resigned from his government advisory position on tuesday night as the telegraph can reveal he broke social distancing rules to meet his married lover professor neil ferguson allowed the woman to visit him at home during the lockdown while lecturing the public on the need for strict social distancing in order to reduce the spread of coronavirus the woman lives with her husband and their children in another house the epidemiologist leads the team at imperial college london that produced the computer modelled research that led to the national lockdown which claimed that more than 500 000 britons would die without the measures prof ferguson has frequently appeared in the media to support the lockdown and praised the very intensive social distancing measures the revelation of the illegal trysts will infuriate

science the imperial team was originally led by professor roy anderson leading luminary in the 2001 foot and mouth disaster which is a whole other story that i m just starting to put together now with the help of a brilliant colleague and any help on that in the form of recollections and inside knowledge or links would be appreciated it was anderson who established imperial allegedly in an underhand manner as the government s go to team on communicable disease crises this was a world rife with intense rivalries anderson had recently come to imperial from oxford why did he leave oxford turns out it was allegedly mainly because of two things one he had allegedly not declared to the wellcome trust the fact that he was receiving income from a scientific firm even though he was a trustee of the wellcome trust and a director of a wellcome trust centre secondly he had allegedly publicly claimed that a woman in the zoology department was only appointed to a readership ie above senior lecturer but below professor after her five year fellowship ended because she had slept with the head of department who was on the appointing committee there were also allegations that he had been a bit of a bully but his allegation against this lecturer was the main problem and it got him suspended for two months in the end he decided to leave for imperial which offered him a very good position he took many of his team with him including neil ferguson i should stress that i have no idea whether any of these allegations on either side are true although i note that the woman won her legal case against anderson yes it actually went to court and it was a big deal at oxford it wasn t just a little inter departmental spat what i am pointing out is the soap opera nature of the whole thing this sort of thing is not at all rare in university science departments and other departments too and sometimes it s worse in the more high powered ones the crowning glory in this story though is this who was the woman who anderson allegedly accused of sleeping her way into an oxford readership her name was sunetra gupta who is now the head of the oxford team engaged in the bitter struggle against the imperial team that anderson set up and which is still run by his protege neil ferguson https www spectator co uk article six questions that neil ferguson should be asked in 2005 ferguson said that up to 200 million people could be killed from bird flu he told the guardian that around 40 million people died in 1918 spanish flu outbreak there are six times more people on the planet now so you could scale it up to around 200 million people probably in the end only 282 people died worldwide from the disease between 2003 and 2009 in 2009 ferguson and his imperial team predicted that swine flu had a case fatality rate 0 3 per cent to 1 5 per cent his most likely estimate was that the mortality rate was 0 4 per cent a government estimate based on ferguson s advice said a reasonable worst case scenario was that the disease would lead to 65 000 uk deaths in the end swine flu killed 457 people in the uk and had a death rate of just 0 026 per cent in those infected in 2002 ferguson predicted that between 50 and 50 000 people would likely die from exposure to bse mad cow disease in beef he also predicted that number could rise to 150 000 if there was a sheep epidemic as well in

hit the bars and drink margaritas policies discouraging nearly every form of public interaction policies introducing the new socialism why can t you sunbathe by yourself if you stay away from others but you can walk around if you stay away from others seems like the people walking are spreading their germs over a wider area while also possibly picking up more germs must maintain control seems like they re trying to have their cake and it eat it too by opening the beaches while simultaneously banning people from doing any of the things that most people go to the beach to do also they probably know full well that most people will ignore the prohibition on having fun and give the cops more opportunities to hand out citations gotta replace that lost sales tax revenue somehow actual fun police what a time to be alive woop woop what these gummit eedjits refuse to remember because it is sooo inconvenient to their preferred memes is that this virus cannot survive in open sunny air for more than at most a hald minute the ultraviolet sun rays ozone oxygen in the air dismantle corona virus cells almost instantly so half a minute max from eshaling every virus cell in the breath you just launched is dismantled and useless so why cannot people sunbathe on a beach i can tel you why because we can t stand anyone having any fun the idiocy of these social justic er squeeze me social distancing rules is beyond comprehension the vast majority of those mases i see in public are either worthless or worse not properly worn so even if they were effective outof the package they are not now and at best can only reduce by a small percentage the virus being exhaled by the wearer worthless to prevent the wearer being infected normallly exhaled breath moves at about one meter in 1 3 seconds thus it takes about two and a half seconds for one person s breath to travel the six feet what happens when we are all like good little lemmings standing a fathom apart and the line advances one unit right everyone in the line is now breathing what the person next to them was exhaling two seconds ago indoors that breath can maintain a contagious quantity of this virus for ten to twenty seconds i am more likelyh to catch this virus standing in line at the post ofice of the home cheapo or the grocery store all of which are legal but not safe than i am sitting on a park behcn with four other friends whom i know or sunbathing at huntington pier or scripps beach this mess has devolved into a game of thrones power and control version the best outcome possible at this point is that now we have seen conclusivly who all the wanna be kings are many of them are stumping for election or reelection let us hope that come november enough of us will remember who sold us down the river and make certain they do not retain or gain power hi sqrls the trouble is florida s not known for good or safe writes diane roberts a professor of english at florida state university in a washington post op ed it s not the word safety that is on american coins it s liberty there s are terms for people who value safety above all else sometimes they re call paranoid sometimes they re called agoraphobics don t think i ve ever heard them called rational if we programmed robots to keep us safe and happy above all else they d strap us down in rubber rooms and put us on a dopamine drip an excellent way to shelter in place i must say or the robots would just kill us as in every robot movie ever made about robots keeping people safe they d kill us out of kindness since we were the most neurotic species on the planet my logic is undeniable yes but it seems just too heartless strap us down in rubber rooms and put us on a dopamine drip matrix iv chill dude put us on a dopamine drip we re in shock from blood loss there s are terms for people who value safety above all else women more specifically karen isn t that what this whole episode is showing us that the proggressives leftists statists who are largely driving the absurd over reaction are mostly doing so because they are fear driven cowards who think the government exists to keep them safe from every possible harm even if that means government inflicting all manner of harms upon others correct https pjmedia com news and politics jim treacher 2020 05 05 388191 n388191 as of last count the entire state of florida has recorded 1 399 deaths from the virus just by way of comparison how do things look up in new york new york state is reporting more than 1 700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities as the state faces scrutiny over how it s protected vulnerable residents during the coronavirus pandemic if i get corona i get corona mused florida spring breaker brady sluder in a now infamous march interview with cbs at the end of the day i m not going to let it stop me from partying he probably thought the reporter was talking about corona beer and the possibility that someone might hand him a bottle of mexican piss water that is one of the worse things that can happen when you re trying to party soo is brady sluder dead from kungflu now it sure sounds like the takeaway we are supposed to get from that is young mr sluder had a cavalier attitude about the chinavirus and then was struck down by the gods for his hubris certainly the story can t be that he went on spring break didn t worry about the wuflu or take any precautions and nothing else happened can it the splashing sound you hear is the writer s tears shit if i know i was just making a snarky joke about how much corona beer sucks sorry i didn t really intend that to be directed towards your comment but rather the quote from the article reading the quote in your comment got met thinking about how stupid that whole episode is was and i kind of just instinctively replied to your post no worries it s all good sometimes i just can t resist making a pithy retort no he didn t die from it or even come down with it but has been reeducated i mean learned his lesson https www nytimes com 2020 03 24 us coronavirus brady sluder spring break html zing it s so disheartening that the libertarian hot take on kungflu restrictions is people should be allowed to go outside provided they wear masks and observe strict social distancing practices before people jump in no that is not a direct quote but article after article on reason is like this they will defend people s right to protest for example but then throw in a to be sure it is disturbing to see cdc social distancing guidelines not followed or some shit like that i m not entirely sure whether reason hired a bunch of young progs in disguise or if this is just a generational thing i imagine finding a lot of real libertarians to write for almost nothing would be difficult whatever the case this ain t the reason i remember from decades ago but there has been a leftward shift and its annoying the hired young proggs and told them to pretend to be libertarian there was a flu pandemic from 1968 1969 did anti draft protesters practice social distancing it s so disheartening that the libertarian hot take on kungflu restrictions is people should be allowed to go outside provided they wear masks and observe strict social distancing practices before people jump in no that is not a direct quote hell for weeks i ve been mentally substituting armbands for masks no libertarians are literally calling for people to wear armbands they just feel that the government should be able to tell people what to wear and they should do it let people go outside are there any jurisdictions that actually made it illegal for people to go outside seems they might be headed that way in chicago after the mayor spoke about taking violators to jail she harassed innocent people in a park and told them to go home where i live they ve been ticketing people one woman received a ticket for 800 for standing in a public park for too long i can t be arsed to grab links but there was the story about the guy fishing alone and the guy on his jet ski alone and the dad playing catch with his son or something i ll see if i can find some links later are there any jurisdictions that actually made it illegal for people to go outside no they re magnanimously making and keeping it legal for people to be inside many parks were also shuttered when the coronavirus first hit the u s recently some states and localities have started gradually lightening those restrictions luckily colorado s been slightly saner than some states about that parks and open spaces have iirc been open the whole time albeit with the social distancing guidelines in place although there was a story a few weeks ago about a father being arrested for playing softball in the park with his daughter but i suspect that was a case of an idiot cop wanting to act like a jack booted thug and get their authoritah boner off but who knows they even opened back up the golf courses a couple of weeks ago again with restrictions on social distancing fewer tee times to keep people more spread out restaurants closed except for takeout clubhouses closed except for restrooms blah blah blah some allow single rider carts others are walking only i played at a course friday that was not only walking only but also weren t renting push carts so i had to carry the bag i haven t done that in a while suffice it to say i have a newfound respect for what professional caddies do they even opened back up the golf courses a couple of weeks ago those furloughed doctors need some way to get outdoor exercise plus with doctors nearby the players can get help in medical emergencies does that old stereotype still hold by the way doctors playing golf i have no idea i ve only played golf with doctors a handful of times and i m an engineer myself it seems like people from all kinds of walks of life play these days although i m sure if you went to super expensive snob fest country club you d find a higher percentage of doctors lawyers priests judges real estate developers and assorted other rich white guys in ugly hats playing golf there than at a public course oh but it looks good on you though it bugs me to see these restrictions on people being outside said edward nardell a professor in the departments of environmental health and immunology and infectious diseases at the harvard t h chan school of public health if it bugs an infectious disease guy you know he s serious this entire pandemic is fake it was crated by trump haters as a way to prevent his re election it is nothing more then a late season flu it drives me nuts that reason would give any credence to those who spew the virus fear mongering literally nobody here has said that you stupid cunt jesus christ you people can t even mock us properly the left can t meme satire like most humor requires empathy and understanding of other people so that you can mock them more effectively what we re seeing is a group of people that s not very good at imagining themselves in the shoes of the other guy trying to learn what that other guy wants how he feels what frightens him they have concern about those other people give thoughts and prayers when they suffer misfortune but don t want to know them personally or even ask them what they want good humorists do those things and i guess there aren t many good humorists on the left what s the point of allowing swimming and walking but not sitting or lying down exactly what about the fish some asshole spits in the water and then a fish swims through it then that fish takes it back to the school and the whole ecosystem is destroyed bwaaha ha ha if you have to ask you wouldn t understand literally nothing makes sense with these lockdowns you can got home depot but not a taco it s retarded and all theatre i just hope people realize how stupid all this is and actually do revert as if nothing happened i dream of the day i won t have to listen to another fear mongering medical bureaucrat for the rest of my damn life they ve annoyed me that much fuck you i m going outside i truly believe they re hurting our immune systems get naked go outside smoke marijuana and the world will be a better place during the 1918 flu pandemic a hospital in boston was crowded so they wheeled some of the flu patients outside and put them in the sun the article said that the death rate for those left inside was about 40 but the patients in the sun had a death rate of only 13 the 1918 flu is not the same as covid 19 and this was not a precise study just anecdotal evidence but it does indicate that being outdoors has some benefits a study in china found that nearly all traceable cases involved getting infected by someone indoors but they couldn t find cases where it happened outside an md explained that outside the air dissipates the viral load quickly so that four feet of separation outdoors is better than larger distances indoors no keep these lockdowns going in perpetuity until forever because the science trademark the north carolina went to the beach a few days ago the illinois governor s family flew to florida if it s good enough to go to the beach for these oppressive fascist pigs then it s good enough for the masses will that idiot lightfoot go medieval on his ass has anyone else noticed it seems a good portion of these people supporting bootlicking precautionary principle authoritarianism are women i come to realize that brady sluder is really a prophet if i get corona i get corona my sentiment exactly diane roberts a professor of english at florida state university in a washington post op ed citing the derisory florida man stereotype who is known for his ridiculous antics and disregard for the law roberts concludes that floridians simply cannot be trusted with the privilege of going to the beach in times like this ooof the academic smug is strong with this slime go fuck yourself karen meh depends on if you are financially secure enough to stay inside and not get a disease that can kill you i am so i m pretty happy getting my week and groceries delivered to me this new normal is ok with me quick
