china has fielded advanced anti ship and anti aircraft missiles and electronic jamming equipment on the spratly islands a group of reefs and islets located close to u s ally philippines that china claims as its own territory military officials said the missiles threaten u s warships and aircraft that have stepped up freedom of navigation operations near the islands in a bid to counter chinese

beijing the u s china talks followed a sept 30 incident in the south china sea when a chinese destroyer tried to force the uss decatur a guided missile destroyer from sailing near the spratlys the chinese ship came within 45 yards of the decatur causing it to change course to avoid a collision u s china military ties recently soured when the state department imposed sanctions on lt gen li shangfu a senior member of the central military commission and director of the people s liberation army pla equipment development department which is in charge of weapons procurement the sanctions were aimed at punishing china for buying aircraft and other weapons from russia in violation of american sanctions the pla also called off talks scheduled to be held in beijing last month and blocked a u s warship from visiting hong kong the contentious issue of removing the missiles was not mentioned during the post talks press conference mr pompeo indirectly alluded to the issue when he told reporters that i was clear for example that we have continued concern about china s activities and militarization in the south china sea we pressed china to live up to its past commitments in this area mr mattis said the two sides discussed the importance for all military law enforcement and civilian vessels and aircraft including those in the pla navy the chinese coast guard and the prc maritime militia to operate in a safe and professional manner in accordance with international law a reference to the chinese harassment of the decatur mr yang a member of the ruling communist party politburo denied the chinese were militarizing the islands and contended the area is indisputable chinese territory he acknowledged at the press conference that china has built some facilities on islands and reefs in the south china sea but insisted most were civilian at the same time it is necessary for china to build certain security facilities in response to possible threats from outside mr wang said we believe that no country should use any excuse to engage in militarization in the region actually to pursue militarization in the region will not only undermine interest of regional countries but will hurt the countries who take these actions themselves the comment by mr yang contradicted the statement of chinese president xi jinping who in september 2015 promised during a visit to washington that china would not militarize the disputed islands the chinese party official said there is no problem of freedom of navigation or overflight being restricted so to use the freedom of navigation and overflight as an excuse to pursue military actions is unjustifiable hypersonic missile boom ultra high speed missiles being developed by china russia and the united states are at risk of being proliferated to other nations according to a report by the defense firm rand corp to prevent the spread of hypersonic missiles that can travel at speeds up to five miles a second the report suggests creating new arms agreements to limit the exports of the missiles if hypersonic missiles spread into the international market the existing threats posed by ballistic and cruise missiles would be compounded the report said a hypersonic missile attack would take place with very little warning that increases the danger that nations like north korea or a future nuclear armed iran would conduct launch on warning retaliatory attacks carried out before an enemy missile hits in short hypersonic threats encourage hair trigger tactics that would increase crisis instability the report said china is a major arms proliferator and has shared nuclear weapons and missile technology with several foreign states including pakistan and north korea russia has been less willing to sell advanced weaponry abroad but has also done so in the past nato on inf violations nato secretary general jens stoltenberg recently criticized russia for violating the 1987 intermediate range nuclear forces treaty in what is viewed as the strongest statement to date by a nato leader on moscow s noncompliance president trump announced recently the united states will pull out of the cold war arms accord as a result of russian violations mr stoltenberg said in a remarks nov 12 that the 1987 inf accord led to the dismantling of an entire class of intermediate range nuclear missiles targeting europe and was a cornerstone of arms control in europe the deployment of new russian missiles is putting this historic treaty in jeopardy he said for years russia has developed produced tested and fielded a new missile system the ssc 8 these missiles are mobile they are hard to detect they can be nuclear armed they reduce warning time to minutes they lower the threshold for nuclear conflict and they can reach european cities like berlin mr stoltenberg said that nato members allies have raised their concerns time and again with the russians over the new deployment more than 30 times in recent years in total after years of denying the violation russia has acknowledged fielding the new illegal missiles while the united states is in full compliance so while there are no new u s missiles in europe there are new russian missiles he said the new russian missile system poses a serious risk to the strategic stability of the euro atlantic area the nato chief said the alliance does not intend to deploy new nuclear missiles in europe but the alliance is committed to the safety and security of the region and must not allow arms control treaties to be violated with impunity because that undermines the trust in arms control in general he said so we call on russia to ensure compliance and to return to constructive dialogue with the united states contact bill g
