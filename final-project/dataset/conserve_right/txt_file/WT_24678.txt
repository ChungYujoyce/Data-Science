tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn deputy attorney general rod rosenstein has taken some pointed jabs at how the obama administration chose to combat russian election interference noting it stayed mostly mum as moscow hacked democratic party computers in a speech in new york mr rosenstein also complained of fake stories about him while defending his pivotal decisions in the long trump russia saga mr rosenstein was only in office a month when he wrote a blistering attack on fbi director james b comey s handling of the hillary clinton email classified material scandal he then was stunned to see president trump cite it to fire mr comey in may 2017 top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots mr rosenstein a career justice department prosecutor responded by quickly naming former fbi director robert mueller as special counsel to investigate mr trump and 2016 russian election interference the move greatly angered the president as mr mueller assembled a team of prosecutors heavy on democratic party donors the new york times reported mr rosenstein rattled by the comey firing talked of wearing a wire in a white house meeting with mr trump in his speech thursday night all that turmoil was absent mr rosenstein devoted one paragraph to list a number of russia probe events that were made before i got there it was a signal he may well have done things differently had he been sworn in before april 27 2017 mr rosenstein a stickler for investigative secrecy said some critical decisions about the russia investigation were made before i got there the previous administration chose not to publicize the full story about russian computer hackers and social media trolls and how they relate to a broader strategy to undermine america the fbi disclosed classified evidence about the investigation to ranking legislators and their staffers someone selectively leaked details to the news media the fbi director announced at a congressional hearing that there was a counterintelligence investigation that might result in criminal charges then the former fbi director alleged that the president pressured him to close the investigation and the president denied that the conversation occurred so that happened the obama administration knew the russians were hacking democratic party computers in early 2016 and notified the democratic national committee but officials didn t tell the public or warn the trump campaign only after wikileaks began posting thousands of russia stolen democratic party documents in july 2016 did the intelligence community go public it released a report in october that fingered russia mr comey disclosed the counterintelligence probe of the entire trump campaign at a march 20 2017 house hearing a month before mr rosenstein took office trump associates complained it branded them all as targets of a criminal probe two years later no trump aide was charged with collusion republicans didn t like how he began the 22 month trump russia investigation democrats didn t like how he ended it then there are the mercenary critics who get paid to express passionate opinions about any topic often with little or no information mr rosenstein said they do not just express disagreement they launch ad hominem attacks unrestricted by truth or morality they make threats spread fake stories and even attack your relatives i saw one of the professional provocateurs at a holiday party he said i m sorry that i m making your life miserable and i said you do your job and i ll do mine today mr rosenstein seems on more solid ground within the administration as he prepares to retire attorney general william p barr asked him to stay on to receive the 448 page mueller report it found no trump conspiracy with russia but did provide the basis for possible obstruction of justice allegations against the president mr rosenstein joined mr barr in concluding the president s actions during the probe didn t amount to obstruction still there are hard feelings in the trump camp john dowd the president s former attorney told the washington times that mr rosenstein failed to give mr trump or the white house counsel a heads up on naming mr mueller and has never explained why mr rosenstein spoke thursday to the armenian bar association s public servants dinner in new york as four current u s attorneys some still investigating trump associates looked on his wife is of armenian descent mr rosenstein seemed to address conservative critics of mr mueller s democratic aligned prosecutors when he said i do not care how police officers prosecutors and judges vote just as i do not care how soldiers and sailors vote that is none of my business i only care whether they understand that when they are on duty their job is about law and not politics there is no republican justice and democrat justice there i
