apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion when house democratic managers tromp to the senate wednesday to caterwaul their contempt for president trump saddened onlookers will wonder this where s the democratic party we once knew and to which some of us once belonged it certainly wasn t among the unbroken ranks of democrats scathing the president for terminating an iranian general who had crossed mr trump s red line the late general obviously confused the donald s line with the one president obama drew redrew then drew again only to scabbard his sword every time top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens the democratic party we once knew certainly wasn t there among any of the six presidential nomination candidates on stage in iowa last week not one of them mentioned iranians ongoing rebellion against their islamic autocracy not one one of the six presidential aspirants alluded to videos on social media from tehran and other cities no reference to the images of demonstrators chanting death to the dictator and death to khamenei the country s supreme leader not a peep of condemnation for iranian authorities who killed at least two protesters in the city of doroud a few days before the anti dictatorship demonstrations aren t exactly new by the start of last year the regime killed 21 protesters and arrested 3 700 the four men and two women in iowa who would be president uttered not a word about iran s grand ayatollah and his lesser ayatollahs daily belittling of women not a murmur about the regime s intolerance of infidels freedom sympathizers hijab less women beardless heterosexuals homosexuals bearded or not and all who salute the great satan you know who you are no mention by the six iowa debaters of president trump s jan 11 english and farsi tweet the government of iran must allow human rights groups to monitor and report facts from the ground on the ongoing protests by the iranian people there can not be another massacre of peaceful protesters nor an internet shutdown the world is watching that from an american president whom democrats hourly berate on a decibel level that would have made the 9 11 twin towers destruction sound like a whisper yet nothing audible passed the lips of bernie pocahontas mayor pete uncle joe senator amy or that sixth guy about trump s support for iran s protesters nor did we hear the six would be trump successors even whisper anything resembling we got your backs to the people who risked their lives in the streets of cities and towns across iran not before or after the iranian military mistakenly downed a ukraine airliner over tehran killing all 176 aboard there are no saints in these accidental shootdowns in 1988 our navy needlessly downed an iranian passenger flight over iranian air space killing all 290 aboard president reagan expressed deep regret that s not the point here nor is it necessary to argue that iranians who call us the great satan haven t a historic point near the cold war s end london washington and our cia helped overthrow prime minister mohammad mosaddegh a democratically elected secular leader of iran because he was a socialist it might have served us better to say look your experiment with socialism will fail but we re standing by to help you right yourselves maintain your independence and erect a market economy when you re ready instead our hawks grasped the oil drenched hands of the shah of iran who carefully beamed an anti soviet ardor mohammad rez shah pahlavi was one of the all time great embarrassments to humankind in 1971 he threw himself and persia a 2 500 year birthday party that cost a world shattering record 100 million dollars even england s queen elizabeth ii found her schedule too full for such gaudy ostentation ditto president nixon who dispatched vice president agnew to natter over the breast of pheasant that maxim s de paris served up in persepolis again in history s pantheon saint and sinner may occupy the same body the last shah mohammad reza pahlavi was progressive corrupt and regressive all at the same time he took iran s economy from a drop in the bucket to a bucket dripping with bullion from the mid 1960s to the late 1970s he grew iran s economy with the help of oil at three times the average annual rate of america s economy in 1975 iran had the cash in hand to lend 1 billion to a drowning britain and another 1 billion to an equally desperate france the shah unchained women from islam s excesses and chained iran s 29 million people to his galactic self worship and whims and yes as usual our hawks claimed the day they stroked the emperor pahlavi who bought american arms by the billions nose thumbed the soviets by the day and vowed that in a few years iran would have a higher living standard the the u s it didn t it doesn t it won t whether kings or clerics rule they never quite get a handle on market economics as always back in the u s the denizens of what president eisenhower called the military industrial complex profitably wooshed through the revolving pentagon white house congress military contractors pr lobbyists doors the iowa six never mentioned that the trumpster is the only president to publicly vow an end to the endless wars that the hawks use to justify their larceny the dems could have doffed their caps to him for that and then clawed him for not ending all our wars yesterday whether ultimately mr trump ends or extends those wars or ends communist china s cheating on the battlefield of trade he has unsheathed the sword he has made it ok for an american president to talk publicly about putting america s interests ahead of anyone and everyone else s every other nation talks the altruism talk but walks the me first walk the point here lies wrapped in that question where s the democratic party we all once knew and to which some of us once belonged it wasn t only the party s presidential aspirants who ignored the iranian regime s rebels so did journalists and political analysts at cnn the amen corner of the elizabeth warren bernie sanders pete buttigieg joe biden party the late shah of iran established a one party system to serve himself poca pete and bernie are bent on establishing a one party america that will consign democrats to the disappearing wormhole of the self
