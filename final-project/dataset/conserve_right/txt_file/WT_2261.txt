message by putting republicans in the chief executive chairs tomorrow kentucky has a chance to send the radical democrats a message mr trump said to a packed house in rupp arena in lexington you will vote to reject the democrats extremism socialism and corruption and you will vote to reelect kentucky gov matt bevin the president s message echoed one he delivered in tupelo mississippi on friday and is expected to send wednesday in monroe louisiana which picks its governor nov 16 top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches although it is only three chief executive elections in states mr trump easily carried in 2016 he spared no effort monday night to pin what he described as the sins of the national democratic party on the local parties and candidates as evidence he cited the covington catholic school students who were falsely accused of hassling an american indian man in washington d c on a field trip from their kentucky school and then painted nationally as bigots for wearing maga hats we re sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country and the rest of the world mr trump said you see what s happening with the democrats they have gone crazy they want to erase our traditions our culture our history and our heroes they want to subjugate you in addition to mr bevin the president was joined by kentucky s two republican senators majority leader mitch mcconnell and rand paul mr trump said the two men have been instrumental in implementing his program that has led to record employment and the lowest unemployment rate in state history while mr trump has done his best in the past few days to nationalize the gubernatorial races and while many likely will read such elements into the results they may not prove that significant according to many analysts whatever the results are they re going to be overplayed that s for sure said ron faucheux a former louisiana elected official who now is a political consultant and analyst in washington the races are wide open according to the political numbers crunchers all three states are considered more republican than democratic although the incumbent in louisiana is a democrat republican incumbent gov matt bevin is finishing a tough race against democratic attorney general andy beshear in mississippi republican lt gov tate reeves hopes to defeat democratic attorney general jim hood a sweep of the three contests by one party would raise prognosticators eyebrows absent that the elections probably don t provide a window into the 2020 elections state races particularly those held in odd numbered years are less tethered to national politics said political analyst charlie cook whose cook political report rates kentucky a toss up and mississippi as leans republican similarly respected sources such as the realclearpolitics polling average and fivethirtyeight show no clear cut advantage to either party the issues are different people see their state capitols a bit differently than washington mr cook said three state elections in some of the reddest most republican states in the country would be particularly uninformative each one has distinct dynamics indeed while the mississippi race has been less heated than that in kentucky the talk of impeachment and other presidential matters has been largely absent from the campaign trails in 2016 mr trump won all three states mr reeves and mr bevin have both embraced mr trump and done their best to paint their opponents as democrats in the mold of the coastal liberals who dominate the party s congressional leadership mr hood and mr beshear on the other hand have worked to keep mr trump s presidency as much out of the discussion as possible with neither of them offering any firm support of his impeachment or explicit criticism of his policies the democrats in all three states know if they make trump an issue they are going to lose their elections mr faucheux said they have all positioned themselves well to the right of where the national democrats are instead the gubernatorial candidates have kindled more local controversy and focused on issues such as health care and the economy mr bevin has slammed mr beshear whose father was kentucky governor before mr bevin as a pawn of big pharma criticizing mr beshear s law firm s defense of oxycontin maker purdue pharma in an opioid settlement the state reached in 2015 mr hood meanwhile tried to link mr reeves to a road construction project allegedly undertaken to help ease access to mr reeves home neighborhood on economic affairs the republican candidates have understandably attached themselves to the economic coattails of the trump administration with mr reeves arguing voters should continue the progress mississippi has seen under mr trump and the term limited republican gov phil bryant mr bevin points to economic gains for kentucky during his first term still mr trump s stumping on behalf of the republican candidates has injected some drama into the gubernatorial contests no stranger to political fights mr trump has been outspoken in his praise of the republican candidates he says will help implement his platform and his criticism of the democratic candidates he says will resist it either way i am unlikely to read too much into tomorrow s results for their impact on 2020 said scott lasley a political science professor at western kentucky university even if gov bevin would end up not winning it won t be due to dwindling influence by trump in kentucky trump is clearly an asset that bevin has been able to employ in the state
