2018 the suit states cnn is the mother of fake news the lawsuit says it is the least trusted name cnn is eroding the fabric of america proselytizing sowing distrust and disharmony it must be held accountable the lawsuit says cnn s source was mr parnas he is now under house arrest after being charged by federal prosecutors with illegally donating foreign money to u s political campaigns and committees as a way to gain influence mr nunes said that once mr parnas made bail his goal was to concoct stories that might win him immunity from prosecution it was obvious to everyone including disgraceful cnn that parnas was a fraudster and a hustler the lawsuit says it was obvious that his lies were part of a thinly veiled attempt to obstruct justice and to trick either the united states attorney or house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff into offering immunity in return for information about plaintiff a prominent united states congressman and ranking member of the house intelligence committee the lawsuit says mr parnas made up other stories he told cnn that after mr giuliani introduced him to mr trump at a white house hanukkah party he huddled privately with the president to discuss a mission to find dirt on mr biden mr giuliani says mr parnas attended a one minute photo op and there was no meeting for a public figure such as mr nunes the bar is high for winning a libel suit the plaintiff must show that not only a story was false but also that the news organization knew it was wrong or had actual malice mr nunes says cnn should have known the vienna tale was false from all the evidence in its possession cnn was well aware that parnas was a renowned liar a fraudster a hustler an opportunist with delusions of grandeur a man in financial in extremis

his new york attorney joseph a bondy the lawsuit says that on his congressional trip from nov 30 to dec 3 2018 mr nunes visited two countries libya and the city of benghazi and malta where he met with prime minister joseph muscat to discuss security and intelligence issues related to malta he also attended a repatriation ceremony for a fallen world war ii army air corps member the court filing includes photographs of mr nunes meeting officials in both countries at no time during his visits to libya or malta did plaintiff or his staff ever meet any ukrainians or have any discussions with anyone about the bidens the suit says according to the democrats impeachment report released tuesday mr nunes and mr parnas did have contact on one day at least april 12 2019 an examination of mr parnas cellphone showed he called mr nunes in a one minute call later they spoke for 8 34 phone records indicate at the time mr parnas was working with mr giuiliani in investigating former vice president joseph r biden and his son hunter over business dealings in ukraine after mr nunes announced plans to sue cnn last month mr bondy told the washington times i read rep nunes remarks with close care i remind him that in addition to a free press one of the cornerstones of our democracy is that a person is presumed innocent unless and until if ever they are proven guilty by proof beyond a reasonable doubt mr parnas has been charged in new york with federal election act violations and his indictment is not a conviction his evidence and potential testimony is nonpartisan and not intended to be part of a battle between the left and the right but rather an aid in the determination by our government of what is in the best interests of our nation mr bondy said mr nunes has portrayed himself as being targeted by the liberal news media ever since he began investigating the role a democratic party funded dossier sourced to the kremlin democrats used the unverified anti trump charges during and after the campaign hillary clinton agents delivered the dossier to the fbi which relied on it as a guide in its investigation he has sued twitter and the mcclatchy news service for defamation he also plans to sue the daily
