sunday titled the lonely lives of latinos for trump mark f who wishes to leave his last name anonymous was interviewed by politico and briefly mentioned in the article because he produced many videos for a group on twitter latinos for trump he said he thought it was unfair that politico portrayed latinos as lonely i am not lonely my whole family is voting for trump i am very vocal in my family about it i don t hide it mark f told breitbart news in response to the politico story if it was latinos for hillary or latinos for bernie the mainstream media would never ask such questions i felt insulted that he would write how lonely we are victor who also wouldn t disclose his last name but is on twitter as elvatoteporocho added afteralso being approached for an interview by politico it felt like there was an ulterior motive for reaching out to us not to actually do a story on us but to do a type of hit piece to disenfranchise us to try and show people we are not real or try and prove we were fake it was very insulting to a few of us mark f says onevideo he produced received 100 000 views on youtube within the first 24 hours and was shared by trump on his facebook page where itthen received more than one million views i thought it was odd he was trying to interview everyone in the latinos for trump video i had a feeling he was trying to dig dirt ontrump mark f added of the politico reporter saying many of the individuals in the video were approached for an interview angelo gomez an 18 year old unpaid intern for the trump campaign was featured in avideoshared by mark f and also briefly mentioned in the politico article he expressed the same frustration as mark f during an interview with breitbart news on monday he was definitely trying to dig up dirt on donald trump gomez said of the politico reporter he was asking if we were paid and he was also asking if i was offended by trump s comments about illegal immigration and i said that no one is being paid it s completely grassroots and i m not offended by what donald trump is saying because i m an american first and i even told him that i m offended by what the media says that they don t call latinos americans they just call us latinos i m offended when they group us all together with illegal immigrants gomez added i m not offended by what trump is saying because i have huge dreams for my future too and based on what trump is saying and what hillary is saying hillary is never going to put americans first because she sin the pockets of so many foreign countries i think that donald trump is the only one that is going to be able to preserve our country for me to be ableto achieve success and for my generation to be able to achieve success gomez added he said the politico article shows how biased the media is politico wants to mess with latinosfortrump now they dont realize who they re messing with or the energy behind us pic twitter com dys7oywrmp angelo ray gomez angeloraygomez june

interviewed by breitbart news last september is connected to a number of fellow latino trump supporters and told breitbart newsabout their outrage over the mainstream media the real connection is through patriotism and the love for this great country of ours and the leadership that trump has demonstrated has given us the voice to unite and do what we can to help elect donald trump and really bring change he explained in an email to breitbart news since it is evident that he is not controlled by the status quo and does not have to adhere to their rules we are further united and connected based on his record of bringing excellent results as a business man all around his record is damn good but the mainstream and left wing distort it so much with false narratives we see the viciousness against him as a real agent of change and now that politico has chimed in with their dirty tactics we are united and connected more than ever before we know we are making a difference the media is mostly unfair on how they cover latinos for trump or any other minorities for trump especially online outfits like politico they never cover the substance relating to why we support him herrerachallenged as an american born mexican i look at many things that trump has brought to light i think about how we lose 113 billion per year on illegal immigration thats well over one trillion dollars over the next 10 years that doesn t even count the last 30 years and people wonder why folks like us pay close attention to 50 cents on every dollar earned or how 78 of illegals who are working here paying taxes are using stolen social security numbers i look at the crime associated with illegal immigration and the high volume that we incarcerate here and the cost associated with that there is nothing wrong racist xenophobic bigoted and any other false left wing label about wanting a secure border and immigration reform so people can come here properly vetted and accounted for herrerastressed the left wing has conditioned half the country to feel that the current system is ok and its not it only exploits the illegals themselves and the middle class who suffer and pay for it while the only benefit goes to the elites breitbart news reached out to politico about the public blowback on the article the lonely lives of latinos for trump but did not receive a response
