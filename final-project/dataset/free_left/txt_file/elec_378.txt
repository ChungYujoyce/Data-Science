advertisement supported by transcript a former vice president known for my love affair with amtrak back on amtrak and his famous friend this also gives the internet one last chance to talk about our bromance joe biden is running for president today i am announcing my candidacy for president of the united states he s tried it before and with the grace of god and the support of the american people i mean to be that kind of president twice this is not about experience it s not about change it s about action so why does he think the third time s a charm biden may be betting that in this politically tumultuous time voters are looking for a familiar face he arrived in washington before c span existed and before these members of congress were born his credentials are unmatched in the democratic party he served two terms as vice president 36 years in the senate and has chaired powerful congressional committees and he s earned himself a few nicknames along the way working class joe working class joe biden old uncle joe biden crazy uncle joe biden just being biden so what are biden s priorities he s a moderate democrat and is likely to focus on expanding health care investing in education and rebuilding relationships with allies the america i see does not wish to turn our back on the world or our allies we will be back but his decadeslong record comes with some baggage including his support for the iraq war president bush is right to be concerned about saddam hussein s relentless pursuit of weapons of mass destruction tough anti crime policies first we have to join together to ensure that drug dealers are punished swiftly surely and severely and his role in the anita hill hearing it is appropriate to ask professor hill anything any member wishes to ask her to plumb the depths of her credibility more recently several women have come forward saying they were uncomfortable with the way biden touched them i feel joe biden put his hands on my shoulders get up very close to me from behind lean in smell my hair and then plant a slow kiss on the top of my head biden responded on twitter the boundaries of protected personal space have been reset and i get it i will be more mindful and respectful of people s personal space so how has biden taken on president trump they ve had their share of fighting words if we were in high school i d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him trump shot back on twitter and said biden would go down fast and hard crying all the way biden later said he regretted his comments so what are biden s odds he entered the race as an instant front runner and he s already leading in early polls but as a white man in his late 70s biden s test will be whether his popularity can outweigh the party s thirst for generational change by alexander burns and jonathan martin former vice president joseph r biden jr announced thursday that he would seek the democratic nomination to challenge president trump in 2020 casting the election as a national emergency and asking democrats to put the task of defeating mr trump above all their other ambitions in a three and a half minute video that focused on excoriating mr trump mr biden presented himself as a steely leader for a country wracked by political conflict unlike the wide field of democrats competing for the affections of the left mr biden avoided almost any talk of policy or ideology signaling that he believes voters will embrace him as a figure of stability and maturity even in a partisan primary election in doing so mr biden 76 is making a bet of sorts that the democratic party s leftward shift in recent years has been greatly overstated and that the moral clarity of his rhetoric and his seeming strength as a general election candidate will overpower other considerations for democratic voters who tend to prize youth diversity and unapologetic liberalism laying out for the first time why he wanted to run for president mr biden invoked the white supremacist march through charlottesville va that ended in bloodshed in 2017 and mr trump s comment that there were very fine people on both sides in that moment mr biden said in the video i knew the threat to our nation was unlike any i d ever seen in my lifetime we are in the battle for the soul of this nation mr biden said warning that if mr trump is re elected he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation who we are and i cannot stand by and watch that happen mr biden elaborated on his opening argument at a fund raising event in philadelphia on thursday evening again decrying mr trump s response to the charlottesville march he rebuked what he described as mr trump s embrace of dictators and oligarchs and the onslaught and constant attack on the courts the constant attack on the press the constant attack on even the congress according to a recording of his remarks mr trump did not directly address mr biden s video assailing his comments about charlottesville responding instead with personal taunts calling mr biden sleepy joe on twitter and not the brightest light bulb on fox news the field of democratic presidential candidates has been historically large but all have dropped out except joe biden the presumptive democratic nominee to challenge president trump mr biden enters the democratic race as something of a front runner albeit one beset by challenges from all flanks and looming questions about his long political record two of mr biden s populist rivals senators bernie sanders of vermont and elizabeth warren of massachusetts were already jabbing at his relationships with moneyed interests on thursday and mr biden s allies believe he must soon explain to voters his evolution on a range of issues including elemental ones like criminal justice abortion rights and the iraq war in a sign he may recognize the urgency of that task mr biden recently spoke privately with anita hill who in 1991 was questioned harshly by a senate committee led by mr biden after she accused clarence thomas now a supreme court justice of sexual harassment mr biden expressed regret according to an aide but in an interview ms hill said she left the conversation feeling deeply unsatisfied and did not describe mr biden as having apologized anita hill said that i m sorry was not enough mr biden s long awaited entry effectively completes the list of democratic candidates a cast of 20 characters that is the most diverse presidential field ever atop it for now are two white men in their eighth decades of life mr biden and mr sanders mr biden s position as the leading democratic candidate is an unfamiliar one for him his two previous presidential bids in 1988 and 2008 failed to catch on though he campaigned twice as former president barack obama s running mate mr biden has never been the starring actor in a major political production of his own inception the overarching question of mr biden s campaign is whether he can fill that role with sufficient competence and imagination to both dispel democratic concerns about his personal discipline and inspire younger voters for whom he is a relatively distant figure he gave a brief preview on thursday evening of how he might talk about issues besides mr trump telling the fund raising gathering that he would focus on economic dignity as an organizing concept my north star of what we re going to talk about in terms of the economy is restoring the middle class but looking at dignity not just the g d p mr biden said mr biden is seen by most democratic voters as a sympathetic figure a trustee of mr obama s legacy whose life has been touched repeatedly by grievous tragedy he has spoken frequently about the death of his first wife neilia and his infant daughter in a 1972 car crash the death of his son beau in 2015 became an occasion of national mourning but mr biden differs in profound ways in his identity and political orientation from the rising generation of voters and activists that has increasingly come to define the democratic party mr biden is a white man who became a senator during richard nixon s presidency in a party seen as prizing youth and diversity he is a centrist and a determined champion of bipartisanship vying to lead a coalition that views the republican party as irretrievably malignant and he plans to finance his campaign chiefly through large contributions from traditional party bankrollers in an age of grass roots hostility to corporations and the very wealthy mr biden has appeared alternately eager to campaign as mr obama s natural heir and also wary of subsuming his candidacy entirely in nostalgia for an earlier administration he did not mention mr obama in his announcement video and he told reporters in a brief exchange thursday at the wilmington del amtrak station that bears his name that he did not want mr obama s backing at the outset i asked president obama not to endorse and whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits mr biden said a spokeswoman for mr obama issued a statement on thursday praising mr biden warmly but not endorsing him and over the last year mr obama has quietly encouraged a range of other candidates to pursue the presidency the dividing line in democratic politics around mr biden s candidacy was immediately apparent on thursday morning he was instantly endorsed by a number of prominent moderates including senators bob casey of pennsylvania and doug jones of alabama and the international association of firefighters is expected to back him early next week in the crucial early state of new hampshire a popular former governor john lynch agreed to help lead mr biden s campaign i think he s right that we need to restore the soul of america mr lynch said adding i think somebody in the middle has a better chance of beating donald trump at the same time a number of vocal liberal activists and advocacy groups offered blunt criticism of mr biden one of the more influential groups on the insurgent left justice democrats issued a scathing statement rejecting mr biden as an option in the race and describing him as a symbol of the democratic establishment that was unable to stop mr trump in 2016 the old guard of the democratic party failed to stop trump and they can t be counted on to lead the fight against his divide and conquer politics today said alexandra rojas the group s executive director biden on the issues where he stands and how he s changed mr biden is poised to embark on an ambitious and highly visible campaign schedule starting with a friday appearance on abc s the view in his first television interview as a candidate he plans to visit a pittsburgh union hall on monday to make remarks on the economy before embarking on a multiweek tour of the early primary states and california culminating in a may 18 speech in philadelphia about unifying america his campaign said facing intensifying scrutiny of his long record mr biden has yet to allay concerns about the most contentious aspects of his career in recent months he expressed remorse without quite apologizing for having supported draconian tough on crime measures in the 1980s and 1990s and said he wished the hill thomas hearings before the senate judiciary committee had gone differently kate bedingfield a spokeswoman for mr biden said on thursday that mr biden had gone somewhat further in a personal conversation with ms hill voicing his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country but ms hill told the times on thursday that she could not support mr biden and told a reporter that he should give an apology to the other women and to the american public because of the wide reaching social impact of the hearings mr biden is certain to have to address the issue again marc morial the president of the national urban league said mr biden would bring a unique set of political strengths to the race but would also need to address aspects of his record that make progressives uneasy i think it s important that biden perhaps help people understand that as a 40 year member of congress his views have evolved said mr morial who suggested mr biden might be well equipped to make an explanation he is one of the few guys who is probably as comfortable talking to a group of truck drivers as he is in an african american church make sense of the people issues and ideas shaping american politics with our newsletter mr biden s competitors have already had months to find their footing in the race the field includes muscular fund raisers like mr sanders senator kamala harris of california and former representative beto o rourke of texas intriguing underdogs like mayor pete buttigieg of south bend ind and policy minded liberals like ms warren and senator cory booker of new jersey who have helped frame the race as a contest of ideas mr biden s rivals largely avoided criticizing him on thursday but ms warren and mr sanders the two most aggressive populists in the race were exceptions in an email to supporters mr sanders s campaign manager faiz shakir chided mr biden for ending the day in the home of a corporate lobbyist an allusion to mr biden s fund raiser in philadelphia with a comcast executive and addressing reporters in cedar rapids iowa ms warren described mr biden as having been on the side of credit card companies during a landmark battle over bankruptcy legislation last decade in which ms warren was on the opposing side that line of attack is likely to be a dangerous one for mr biden as the race proceeds and his private endeavors could also become political targets mr biden has earned millions of dollars through paid speeches and book deals since leaving office and has created a network of nonprofits and academic centers that employ many of his trusted aides he intends to shut down the most prominent of those groups the biden foundation rival democrats have taken encouragement from several unsteady moments in the biden camp including his halting response this month to a wave of stories about his physical behavior with women and his advisers repeatedly explored and then disavowed some offbeat or daring plans including announcing a running mate early in his campaign mr biden s candidacy is a bet above all that none of that will matter in comparison to voters alarm at the possibility of mr trump s re election there are few modern examples of a man of mr biden s age assuming the leadership of a western democratic power the precedents that exist have tended to arise from moments of military conflict or social turbulence georges clemenceau becoming france s premier during world war i at the age of 76 or winston churchill returning as prime minister in the 1950s also at 76 mr biden would be 78 on inauguration day in 2021 and it remains to be seen whether voters will view him as a similar kind of political savior or the times as equally dire updated may 25 2020 advertisement
