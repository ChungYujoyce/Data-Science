millions of users are signing up for free courses taught by professors from harvard and other top universities david robson sun 19 apr 2020 09 00bst for many of us in self isolation it can feel like the coronavirus has put the world on hold as we wait for release from our temporary imprisonment but increasing numbers of people are using the time to build their skillset with an upsurge in enrolments on online learning platforms such as edx futurelearn and coursera which offer massive open online courses or moocs coursera for instance has seen an eightfold increase in enrolments for social science personal development arts and humanities courses since the start of the coronavirus outbreak it s unprecedented says the company s chief product officer shravan goli in late march its science of well being course saw 500 000 new enrolments in a single weekend devoting some of our quarantine time to self education makes sense besides helping to bolster your career during this economic uncertainty learning a new skill can give you a sense of control that will help cope with anxiety engendered by the epidemic as james wallman says in his book time and how to spend it personal growth is central to many psychological theories of long term happiness so although an hour listening to a lecture may not be as enticing as the instant gratification of reality tv or social media it will lead to greater life satisfaction in the long term you could say that humans are like bicycles if you re not heading towards something you fall over wallman says and when we are social distancing online courses are one of the best ways to do that the specifics vary from platform to platform though many follow the same basic model with the larger platforms such as edx coursera and futurelearn you can choose university affiliated courses so you know you are being taught by experts in the field the courses are of varying lengths from a few hours to a regular weekly commitment over several months and typically involve video lectures reading texts and regular tests to check your memory and understanding of the syllabus in many cases enrolment is free but may have to pay to get a certificate verifying that you have completed the course you might be tempted to sign up to the courses with the most prestigious instructors but that would be a mistake says james murphy who used moocs to prepare a master s degree while he was housebound with an illness institutional affiliations aren t always a good guide to quality he says many of the platforms offer user reviews where you can gauge other learners enjoyment and satisfaction with the course but nothing beats trying it for yourself says murphy who is now an associate lecturer at the open university i think the best advice is to sign up and see if you like it there s no reason to stick with one you dislike if the delivery isn t engaging you can usually tell in the first hour if you ll enjoy the course or not if you are hoping for professional development and considering the cost of the certificate you might want to check whether employers recognise the qualification coursera s goli points out that about 30 companies now accept the google affiliated course on it management for instance the reviews can guide you on this as can the course descriptions which sometimes include statistics from student surveys about the professional benefits that came from the experience it s also important to pick a course of the right difficulty something just beyond your comfort zone engaging enough to occupy your mind but not so ambitious that it s frustrating that way you ll achieve the flow state you ll lose track of time says wallman and the deep concentration will feel much more rewarding than simply scrolling through social media even if you have chosen a course that is perfectly suited to your goals you may find your initial enthusiasm evaporates and your discipline trails off lack of routine and time is often the biggest hurdle says writer and regular mooc user bianca barratt her advice is to try to set up a schedule and treat it like a physical class you ve signed up for show up when you say you will make an effort with the class exercises and homework and complete the course in full another good strategy according to anant agarwal the founder and ceo of edx is to find a study buddy or form a bigger learning group so that they can motivate each other and enjoy the course together you might make a pact with people you already know or you could connect with people from the discussion forums that accompany the course like your classmates at a traditional school or university you can help each other to understand the difficult material and the feeling of accountability might spur you on when you find distractions drawing you away from your goal for some this may be just the start of the journey furnishing you with a greater confidence to learn and the motivation to take it further if you find that you re hooked many of the platforms also provide accredited bachelors and master s degrees from selected universities though this will be more expensive for others the completion of a single course will be enough but whatever your goals the quest to learn a new skill or discipline may be the perfect distraction from the frustrations of self isolation allowing you to connect with
