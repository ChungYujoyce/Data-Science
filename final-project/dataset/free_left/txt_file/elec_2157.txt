advertisement supported by transcript reno nevada 25 august 2016 soundbite english hillary clinton d presidential nominee everywhere i go people tell me how concerned they are by the divisive rhetoric coming from my opponent in this election and i understand that concern because it s like nothing we ve heard before from a nominee for president of the united states from one of our two major parties from the start donald trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia he is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the republican party now trump s lack of knowledge or experience or solutions would be bad enough but what he s doing here is more sinister trump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters it s a distributing preview of what kind of president he d be this is not conservatism as we have known it this is not republicanism as we have known it these are racist ideas race bating ideas anti muslim anti immigrant anti women all key tenants making up the emerging racist ideology known as that alt right the names may have changed racists now call themselves racialists white supremacists now call themselves white nationalists the paranoid fringe now calls itself alt right but the hate burns just as bright and now trump is trying to re brand himself as well but don t be fooled there s an old mexican proverb that says tell me with whom you walk and i will tell you who you are well we know who trump is a few words on a teleprompter won t change that he says he wants to make america great again but more and more it seems as though his real message seems to be make america hate again by alan rappeport as hillary clinton assailed donald j trump on thursday for fanning the flames of racism embraced by the alt right the community of activists that tends to lurk anonymously in the internet s dark corners could hardly contain its glee mrs clinton s speech was intended to link mr trump to a fringe ideology of conspiracies and hate but for the leaders of the alt right the attention from the democratic presidential nominee was a moment in the political spotlight that offered a new level of credibility it also provided a valuable opportunity for fund raising and recruiting jared taylor editor of the white nationalist publication american renaissance live tweeted mrs clinton s remarks questioning her praise of establishment republicans and eagerly anticipating her discussion of his community come on hillary he wrote talk about alt right in an ode to mr trump s characterization of jeb bush mr taylor described her speech as low energy other white nationalists mocked mrs clinton saying she sounded like a neoconservative and a grandma while welcoming the publicity mr trump has publicly kept his distance from the alt right but his critics have accused him of offering subtle cues to invite its support his appointment of stephen k bannon the head of breitbart news to be chief executive of his campaign was cheered by alt right members who are avid readers of the breitbart website the alt right claims to support the preservation of white culture in the united states and many of its members want to see an overhaul of the entire political system however its views are widely seen as white supremacist and anti semitic many who align themselves with alt right philosophies say that they do not subscribe to all of mr trump s policies but that electing him would be a step in the right direction because of his america first worldview and his hard line on immigration this week some expressed disappointment that mr trump appeared to be softening his tone on deporting people who are in the country illegally richard b spencer the president of the white nationalist national policy institute who is credited with coming up with the name alt right pushed back against claims that the group promotes violence and said in a statement that there was a double standard at play while hillary co condemn the alt right nonviolent activists seeking social change largely through a vibrant internet presence she allows noted supporters of terror to attend her rallies and has never once disavowed the actions of domestic terrorists associated with black lives matter mr spencer said mrs clinton s public criticism of the alt right could turn out to be a boon for the movement and its members did their best to capitalize on the moment some in an effort to show a lighthearted side circulated footage of mr taylor playing the saxophone at the group s most recent conference the white nationalist website vdare published a what is the alt right video and blasted out a fund raising pitch warning hillary wants to ignite a witch hunt against the alt right because she knows we are finally starting to make an impact on the public s thinking about immigration and the stormfront forum set up an online thread for potential new members after mrs clinton s speech one group of white nationalists convened a 90 minute videoconference that was broadcast on youtube the consensus was that mrs clinton was toothless and lackluster and they expressed disappointment that she had not mentioned alt right leaders by name she made reference only to david duke the former klansman whose support mr trump was slow to disavow although the alt right tried to put its best foot forward there was plenty of venom directed at mrs clinton and the conspiracy theories ran wild a popular attack was the continuing effort to raise questions about her health by addressing the alt right in such a prominent setting mrs clinton ran the risk of helping its cause but richard cohen the president of the southern poverty law center which tracks hate groups dismissed the idea that mrs clinton was doing the public a disservice by drawing attention to the alt right i think every public official ought to denounce racism and that is what secretary clinton did mr cohen said noting that the alt right ideology opposes the notion that all people are equal referring to the term alt right which was trending on twitter he added it is a fancy almost antiseptic term for white supremacy in the digital world advertisement
