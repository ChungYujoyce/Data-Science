 jennifer palmieri was communications director for hillary clinton s presidential campaign i know how to be a gracious loser i could have let it go last week when kellyanne conway donald trump s campaign manager challenged me to look her in the eye and say she ran a campaign that gave white supremacists a platform i considered for a split second i knew you were supposed to be gracious when you come for the post election forum at harvard s kennedy school of government but i decided this was a year where normal rules don t apply speaking the truth was more important it did kellyanne it did i told her it s just a fact trump winning the election doesn t change that to my mind his win makes it all the more important that the truth be acknowledged my colleagues and i from the hillary clinton campaign knew what we were likely to face from the trump side at the harvard university event and thought hard about our obligations as representatives of the losing side in this most unconventional of years particularly when our candidate actually won the popular vote by a large margin as i like to note clinton received more votes for president than any white man in u s history our candidate gave us a good model to follow she had the grace to call trump on election night to congratulate him and concede but in her concession speech she also challenged all of us to defend our rights and principles under the constitution rights and principles that she and many of the people who voted for her feared could be under threat in a trump presidency the campaign has ended and we accept that trump won but we are not laying down our principles or abandoning our supporters that s the frame of mind i brought to harvard yes kellyanne conway you did provide a platform for white supremacy a good bit of the post election analysis has centered on what our campaign should have done differently that s appropriate we should think long and hard about why we lost trust me we have but it s also important for the winners of this campaign to think long and hard about the voters who rejected them i haven t seen much evidence of such introspection from the trump side that s concerning i don t know whether the trump campaign needed to give a platform to white supremacists to win but the campaign clearly did and it had the effect of empowering the white nationalist movement trump provided a platform by retweeting white nationalists giving their views an audience of millions views previously relegated to the darkest corners of the internet also had a platform on breitbart the website of trump campaign chief executive stephen k bannon before trump our identity ideas national ideas they had no place to go said richard spencer president of a white nationalist think tank that held a post election conference in washington former ku klux klan leader david duke said this fall the fact that donald trump s doing so well it proves that i m winning at harvard some on the trump team crowed that we in the clinton campaign and those in the press were foolish because we took trump s words literally that s right we did you should take a candidate for president s words literally you know who else took his words literally white supremacists the white supremacists who lauded trump with cries of hail trump duke who expressed confidence that trump s decision to make bannon his chief strategist meant duke s ideology would have a prominent place in the west wing the students who mocked hispanic athletes with chants of build that wall the man in new york city who threatened the off duty female muslim police officer last weekend it s also true that many of the more than 65 million people who voted for clinton took trump s words literally many of our supporters were sincerely frightened by his campaign s embrace of the alt right hispanic families who voted for clinton believe trump will deport their parents or siblings because he said he would muslim supporters fear they will not be welcome in their own country because of trump s proposed muslim ban mothers and fathers of both parties supported clinton because they didn t want their children growing up in an america where women and girls don t feel respected by their own president whether trump intended for any of these people both those who were energized and those who were repelled to take his words literally or not they did that has already had real life consequences that our new president must own up to that s why what he said during the campaign matters that s why everything he says matters if we are not to take trump s words literally he needs to explain what he does mean the trump team likes to tell clinton supporters hashtag he s your president but this isn t a one way street if trump expects the americans who did not vote for him to accept him as president he needs to show that he accepts all of them as americans he needs to show that he understands their concerns and hears their fears i suggest he and his team try hashtag we are all americans we all have a role to play here but it s the winner who carries the burden of taking the lead in uniting the country it s the burden of leadership it s the burden of being the president of the united states read more here the post s view president trump the post s view in one tweet trump trashes two
