leana s wen is an emergency physician and visiting professor at george washington university milken institute school of public health previously she served as baltimore s health commissioner my husband and i arrived at the hospital last friday for my labor induction just two years ago i gave birth in the same facility but this time everything was different as an emergency physician i m trained to think in terms of worst case scenarios as an expectant mother i had nightmares about all the things that can go wrong in pregnancy but there was one thing about giving birth during the covid 19 pandemic that i didn t anticipate how i would become scared of and also scared for my health care providers full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic the obvious differences i was prepared for of course and they were apparent in an instant everyone wore masks the halls were empty except for essential staff our temperatures were taken in the lobby where a large sign explained a new no visitor policy fortunately there was an exception for laboring women who could have one person with them the nurse doing my intake looked exhausted it had been a busy night she told me the ward was filled with women seeking to deliver before the hospital went over capacity with covid 19 cases and they were short staffed another nurse and a doctor had just tested positive for the virus at least six people were out and under quarantine as she took notes the nurse rubbed her face through her mask the staff had been issued just one mask to last them a week it was only day three and her mask was already damp and fraying i felt for her i knew she was making do with the limited gear she had but also wondered could the mask worn so long harbor viruses a resident physician came to do an ultrasound she sat down just inches away on my bed exactly how i was taught to do a bedside ultrasound but i felt an instinct to move away from her what if she had last been in the er doing a consult what if the white coat she wore had recently brushed against someone with covid 19 the hospital had clearly been proactive about infection control protocols even as the staff was making do with insufficient personal protective equipment the nurse explained that the ipad used for consents had gone through uv sterilization when a tech came in to place my iv she took great pains to avoid cross contamination wiping down her gown as she entered and then wiping down her pen before handing it to me and when it came time to push the doctor nurse and tech all put on n95 respirator masks and full face shields my doctor explained that this was new hospital policy too laboring women focus intently on their breathing and the ppe served to protect the staff from respiratory droplets but a terrible thought crossed my mind as my contractions built i was aware that i was breathing right into my nurse s face as she coached me i had no symptoms and no known exposure but as we all know that s no guarantee with this virus how awful would it be if i infected my providers moments later isabelle was delivered a healthy 7 pounds 2 ounces as i held her in my arms i felt great relief and overwhelming instant love but also i felt anxious for the providers who took care of me some i knew had young children of their own at home others were older and many likely had underlying medical conditions they all must have seen reports of pregnant patients who had covid 19 they all must have known about the father who sneaked into a labor ward in new york despite having symptoms my providers never wavered in taking exceptional care of me just as they did two years ago but just as i saw them as potential asymptomatic carriers they saw me as one too someone who could make them ill and endanger their loved ones and that sadly is the deeper shift at work in our health care system covid 19 is forcing a change in the provider patient relationship and creating a tension that must be navigated with empathy by caregivers and patients alike the opinions section is looking for more stories like this one write to us with how the virus has affected you perhaps this will ease once there is finally adequate ppe and widespread testing perhaps what is needed are wards or entire hospitals that can be reliably separated to care for patients with covid 19 and those without but for now both sides must struggle to reconcile our desire for closeness with the fear of what that closeness brings patients and providers inhabit a new normal in which we worry about and for each other read more
