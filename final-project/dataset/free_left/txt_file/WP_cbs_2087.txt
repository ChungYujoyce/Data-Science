watch cbsn live updated on april 24 2020 1 12 pm cbs ap during a briefing in which the white house pitched emerging research on the benefits of sunlight and humidity in diminishing the threat of the coronavirus president trump wondered aloud about the possibility of injecting disinfectants into patients mr trump remarked at thursday s white house briefing that he s seen that disinfectant knocks it covid 19 out in a minute and is there a way you can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning as you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs so it ll be interesting to check that it sounds interesting to me but william bryan head of science and technology at the department of homeland security seemed to shoot the idea down as quickly as it was mentioned saying it wasn t being considered when a reporter asked bryan there s no scenario that could be injected into a person is there bryan replied no asked about his comment again on friday mr trump said i was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen the idea of using disinfectant products in that way met with quick rebuke from the medical community just because something works outside of the body doesn t mean you should bring it inside the body where it could potentially cause severe damage cbs news chief medical correspondent dr jon lapook explained on cbs this morning friday he added the last thing you want is somebody hearing this hearing this kind of a statement and then being very ill themselves and saying you know what i m gonna just give it a try dr robert glatter an emergency physician at lenox hill hospital in new york city said in an emailed statement it would be incredibly dangerous to inject any chemicals or sanitizers to treat coronavirus there is absolutely no merit or any medical evidence to suggest this in any way john balmes a pulmonologist at zuckerberg san francisco general hospital stressed to bloomberg news that inhaling chlorine bleach would be absolutely the worst thing for the lungs the airway and lungs are not made to be exposed to even an aerosol of disinfectant kashif mahmood a doctor in charleston west virginia said on twitter as a physician i can t recommend injecting disinfectant into the lungs or using uv radiation inside the body to treat covid 19 don t take medical advice from trump rb the manufacturer of lysol issued astatementstressing that injecting disinfectants would be unsafe saying due to recent speculation and social media activity rb the makers of lysol and dettol has been asked whether internal administration of disinfectants may be appropriate for investigation or use as a treatment for coronavirus sars cov 2 we must be clear thatunder no circumstanceshould our disinfectant products be administered into the human body through injection ingestion or any other route the epa also stressed that disinfectant products should be used for cleaning household surfaces not the human body when using an epa registered disinfectant follow the label directionsfor safe effective use the agency says it released an updated statement thursday that included this advice never apply the product to yourself or others do not ingest disinfectant products this includes never applying any product on list n the agency s list of disinfectants to use against sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 directly to food as for heat and humidity past studies haven t found good evidence that the warmer temperatures and higher humidity of spring and summer will help tamp down the spread of the virus but bryan said there are emerging results from new research that suggest solar light has a powerful effect in killing the virus on surfaces and in the air he said scientists have seen a similar effect from higher temperatures and humidity a biocontainment lab in maryland has been conducting testing on the virus since february bryan said the virus is dying at a much more rapid pace just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity bryan said he said knowing more about it could help governors when making decisions about how and when to open their state economies however he emphasized that the emerging results of the light and heat studies don t replace social distancing recommendations mr trump who has consistently looked for hopeful news about containing the virus was asked if it was dangerous to make people think they would be safe by going outside in the heat considering that so many people have died in florida i hope people enjoy the sun and if it has an impact that s great mr trump replied adding it s just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very very smart perhaps brilliant man i m here to present ideas because we want ideas to get rid of this thing and if heat is good and if sunlight is good that s a great thing as far as i m concerned the president said mr trump has often talked up prospects for new therapies and offered rosy timelines for the development of a vaccine earlier in the month scientific advisers told the white house there s no good evidence yet that the heat and humidity of summer will rein in the virus without continued public health measures first published on april 24 2020 5 45 am 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved this material may not
