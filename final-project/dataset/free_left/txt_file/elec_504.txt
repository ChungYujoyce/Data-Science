there s something odd about marco rubio s presidential campaign he hasn t been doing all that much er campaigning in the early states unlike most recent presidential nomination winners who have invested serious time and effort into campaigning and building organizations in at least one of either iowa or new hampshire rubio has taken a positively relaxed approach to both he doesn t show up very often doesn t do much campaigning when he is around and doesn t seem to be building very impressive field operations and it s raising eyebrows james pindell of the boston globe wrote last week that rubio s new hampshire surge was riddled with doubts and that gop insiders are bemoaning his lack of staff and activity national review s tim alberta and eliana johnson reported wednesday that rubio s weak ground game was angering iowa republicans and the new hampshire union leader wrote an editorial headlined marco marco where s rubio for a candidate who s so often deemed the republican barack obama it sure seems like rubio has missed some key lessons from the president s historic 2008 campaign and this isn t good optics for a candidate who s already been criticized somewhat unfairly for missing lots of senate votes either the conventional wisdom is that a candidate needs to win either iowa or new hampshire to win the nomination in fact every nominee for decades has done that except for bill clinton in 1992 an odd year in which the iowa caucuses effectively didn t count because iowan tom harkin was running candidates who ve tried to skip both early states in hopes that a later win will propel then to prominence have failed miserably furthermore said conventional wisdom continues the way to win in both iowa and new hampshire is to work hard on the ground the candidate should spend a lot of time there the campaign should build up a network of local relationships winning over supporters one by one and the campaign should focus on organizing to identify committed voters and make sure they actually turn out to the polls organizing like this helped power barack obama to victory in iowa in 2008 yet rubio doesn t appear to be focusing on any of this now it s not that rubio is ignoring iowa and new hampshire indeed his operation has spent millions on ads in each state his team just doesn t appear to be spending time on this nuts and bolts campaign activity that so many political professionals think is crucial to actually winning if we believe what rubio s advisers are saying they aren t using these tactics too much because they genuinely believe their effectiveness is overrated they re saying that they think ads and media coverage not field or campaign events are the keys to victory more people in iowa see marco on fox and friends than see marco when he is in iowa rubio s campaign manager terry sullivan told the new york times and alberta and johnson report that rubio s team believes a sprawling operation weighs down a campaign and wastes precious resources that could be spent on tv ads that reach more voters presumably rubio isn t making more campaign trips to the early states so he can spend more time raising money that can fund these crucial ads perhaps rubio s team is right and most other campaigns are just wasting their resources by spending big on organizing but it s a questionable hypothesis so far this year ad spending appears to have had little relation to candidates poll standing it has definitely enriched many political consultants though ad spending from candidates campaigns and outside operations as of this week javier zarracina vox another possible explanation is that rubio s campaign is trying to savvily lower expectations for his performance in both states because neither is a particularly good fit for him iowa has lately tended to elevate evangelical favorites and new hampshire has sometimes opted for flinty independent thinking outsiders perhaps rubio hopes he ll get a pass for doing poorly in both states because he didn t really try but that may be too clever by half the evidence seems to indicate that if you want to win the nomination you need to do really well in either iowa or new hampshire otherwise you quickly vanish from the media spotlight and from voters thoughts much like rudy giuliani did in 2008 if rubio hopes to avoid this fate he should probably get to work get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
