download the today app for the a daily dose of good news andy cohen is speaking out about what he says is a discriminatory practice happening at the federal level when it comes to lgbtq people being able to donate blood and convalescent plasma the 51 year old talk show host tested positive for the coronavirus in march and recovered from covid 19 by the end of that month since then he said he s been trying help those still suffering from the disease but due to laws against men who have sex with men he can t i signed up for a program for covid 19 survivors where you could donate plasma which is rich in antibodies to those still battling the virus he said on thursday s episode of watch what happens live i was told that due to antiquated and discriminatory guidelines by the fda to prevent hiv i am ineligible to donate blood because i m a gay man cohen later explained that since the coronavirus is ravaging our planet the u s food and drug administration is saying there is an urgent need for plasma from survivors this site is protected by recaptchaprivacy policy terms of service convalescent plasma is the liquid portion of blood taken from survivors of a disease that is rich in antibodies precious for people sick with covid 19 doctors hope using it can speed up recovery for the sickest patients plasma donors have to confirm they had covid 19 and have fully recovered that means having documentation of a positive test which can be difficult since there is limited access to testing across the country they also need to either be 14 days from their last symptoms and have a negative covid 19 test or 28 days from their last symptoms no negative test required as of this week the american red cross has produced 200 units of convalescent plasma donated by almost 150 eligible donors the goal is to send out more than 1 000 units to hospitals which would require 500 to 600 donors unfortunately the demand is far exceeding the supply even though many people in our organization are working around the clock on this endeavor dr pampee young chief medical officer of the organization told today earlier this month due to an urgent need for blood the fda revised its blood donor guidelines easing the restrictions on men who have sex with men the new guidelines reduce the donation deferral period for sexually active gay and bisexual men from 12 months to three these healthy men will now have to abstain from same sex sexual activity for 90 days before they are eligible to donate blood the same restrictions apply to recovered covid 19 patients who wish to donate plasma that 90 day period is significantly less than the restrictions that existed before the pandemic but cohen argues any restriction based on sexual orientation is inherently homophobic in its practice even the new relaxed rules require gay men to abstain from sex for three months whether they re in a monogamous relationship or not before giving blood though no such blanket restrictions exist for people of other sexual orientations he said cohen points out that all donated blood no matter the person s sexual orientation is screened for hiv he suggested a rapid hiv test could be given before a person donates to ensure they are negative so why the three month rule cohen questions why are members from my community being excluded from helping out when so many people are sick and dying maybe because we re valuing stigma over science i don t know my blood could save a life but instead it s over here boiling cohen also noted that since the coronavirus pandemic began people have adapted in many ways including the wearing of masks and social distancing so why can t the fda adapt as well it is bad enough that quarantine has us wondering what day it is i m sitting here wondering what year it is cohen said we need to think about this and do better 2020 nbc universal
