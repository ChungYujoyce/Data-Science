advertisement supported by after pressure from the president senator lindsey graham agreed to hold a hearing but he rebuffed mr trump s suggestion that his predecessor be called to testify by peter baker washington president trump has embarked on an aggressive new drive to rewrite the narrative of the russia investigation by making dark and unsubstantiated accusations that former president barack obama masterminded a sinister plot to bring him down on twitter on television in the rose garden and even on an official white house social media page mr trump in recent days has taken aim at his most recent predecessor in a way that no sitting president has in modern times accusing mr obama of undefined and unspecified crimes under the vague but politically charged catchphrase obamagate the president went even further on thursday by demanding that mr obama be hauled before the senate to testify about the biggest political crime and scandal in the history of the usa a scenario that itself has no precise precedent in american history within hours mr trump s most faithful republican ally in the senate promptly announced that he would indeed investigate although he would probably not summon mr obama in flinging incendiary charges at his predecessor mr trump has offered no evidence and has not even specified what crime he was accusing the former president of committing instead mr trump seemed to be tying the investigation by the special counsel robert s mueller iii which has enraged him for years back to mr obama while hinting ominously at forthcoming revelations that will bolster his claims the new focus on the former president comes as mr trump appeared eager to change the subject amid the deadliest public health crisis to confront the united states in a half century on a day when the death toll in the united states topped 85 000 and the government reported nearly three million more people filing for unemployment mr trump spent part of his morning attacking mr obama in addition to diverting attention from the coronavirus pandemic mr trump s focus on mr obama allows him to try to turn the tables on his accusers by making them out to be the ones who are corrupt while simultaneously putting his democratic challenger former vice president joseph r biden jr on the defensive this was all obama this was all biden mr trump said in an interview on fox business network that aired on thursday these people were corrupt the whole thing was corrupt and we caught them we caught them when the host maria bartiromo asked if he believed that mr obama directed american intelligence agencies to spy on him mr trump agreed without evidence yes he probably directed them mr trump said but if he didn t direct them he knew everything and you ll see that he went on adding that documents would be released soon to bolster his charges mr obama whose advisers have dismissed mr trump s comments as the ludicrous ranting of a president in trouble issued what amounted to his own one word rejoinder hours later on twitter vote he wrote no evidence has emerged that before the november 2016 election mr obama was involved in the f b i investigation into mr trump s advisers and any ties to russian campaign interference much less that he directed it although its existence had been reported in the news media mr obama was told in january 2017 about telephone calls between mr trump s incoming national security adviser michael t flynn and russia s ambassador discussing sanctions that the outgoing president had just imposed on moscow in response to its attempted election sabotage documents released by mr trump s allies this week show that several obama administration officials including mr biden requested the identity of the american who was originally unnamed in intelligence reports about contacts with russia an american who turned out to be mr flynn such unmasking requests are made thousands of times a year and according to the documents these were approved under normal procedures and the recipients were authorized to receive the information but mr trump s allies suggest the requests indicated that mr obama s aides must have been involved in trying to set up mr flynn who was interviewed by f b i agents after mr obama left office and eventually pleaded guilty to lying to them attorney general william p barr last week moved to throw the case out concluding that the f b i had no basis to interview mr flynn a decision that mr obama later said undermined the rule of law mr trump s attacks have been amplified by fox news other conservative media and his re election apparatus he has even used his government platform to advance the charges posting a campaign style obamagate video on the official white house facebook page an overtly partisan message that would have been seen as crossing a line in past administrations mr trump has often aired grievances against political opponents with sensational but unspecific accusations leaving advisers to follow and try to fill in the lines in this case mr trump hopes enough information will be released by his intelligence appointees to muddy the waters and lend a patina of confusion about what mr obama may have done according to people familiar with his thinking other presidents have feuded with predecessors over policy or politics even publicly quarreling at times but putting aside richard m nixon and watergate no sitting president in modern times has explicitly and aggressively accused a former president of criminality what makes trump s attacks so egregious in contrast to his predecessors is how he simply concocts scandals out of thin air cooking up conspiracies that have no relation to historical fact said matthew dallek a presidential historian at george washington university mr trump has long harbored a personal animus toward mr obama mr trump spent much of mr obama s presidency championing the racist and false birther conspiracy theory that mr obama was born in africa mr obama reciprocated by mocking mr trump at the white house correspondents association dinner in 2011 as the reality show host sat nearby seething mr trump turned back to mr obama in march 2017 two days after jeff sessions then the attorney general recused himself from the investigation into russian election interference a move that infuriated the president and led to the appointment of mr mueller as mr trump stewed at mar a lago his florida club an aide showed him a story from the conservative website breitbart quoting the radio host mark levin accusing mr obama of police state tactics the president took to twitter to assert that mr obama had my wires tapped a claim that mr trump s own justice department later debunked the president lashed out again last weekend after news reports about mr obama s criticism of mr barr s decision to negate mr flynn s guilty plea mr trump began using the term obamagate on sunday but refused to explain what specific crime he was alleging when asked the next day by a washington post reporter you know what the crime is the president said testily the crime is very obvious to everybody all you have to do is read the newspapers except yours he still has not explained but on thursday morning he prodded senator lindsey graham republican of south carolina and the chairman of the senate judiciary committee into opening an investigation if i were a senator or congressman the first person i would call to testify about the biggest political crime and scandal in the history of the usa by far is former president obama mr trump wrote on twitter he knew everything do it lindseygrahamsc just do it no more mr nice guy no more talk less than two hours later mr graham announced hearings into the flynn case and other matters including whether mr mueller should have been appointed in the first place mr mueller s investigation concluded that russia mounted a major operation to tilt the 2016 election to mr trump and that there were multiple contacts with mr trump s associates but it did not find enough evidence to charge a criminal conspiracy to say we are living in unusual times is an understatement mr graham said in a statement we have the sitting president trump accusing the former president obama of being part of a treasonous conspiracy to undermine his presidency we have the former president suggesting the current president is destroying the rule of law by dismissing the general flynn case still mr graham threw cold water on the idea of calling mr obama both presidents he added are welcome to come before the committee and share their concerns about each other if nothing else it would make for great television however i have great doubts about whether it would be wise for the country the f b i opened its investigation into ties between russia and the trump campaign in july 2016 not long after wikileaks released thousands of internal democratic party emails that intelligence officials believed had been hacked by russian intelligence operatives the investigation code named crossfire hurricane was handled by a small group of law enforcement and intelligence officials who did not brief white house officials about the inquiry according to accounts that have emerged since when mr obama and mr trump met in person two days after the november election mr obama warned him about mr flynn who had served as the defense intelligence agency director during the obama administration former officials said that the warning concerned mr flynn s job performance and penchant for conspiracy theories not any government investigation mr obama learned about communications between mr flynn and russian officials in january 2017 after pressing intelligence and law enforcement officials to review and sum up information about russia s election interference during a search intelligence officials came across records of the phone calls between mr flynn and the ambassador sergey i kislyak that had been intercepted as part of the intelligence agencies regular surveillance of russian officials in one of the calls mr flynn had urged russia not to retaliate for the sanctions as a new outwardly friendlier administration prepared to assume office during a jan 5 conversation in the oval office that included mr biden james b comey the f b i director sally yates the deputy attorney general and susan rice the national security adviser mr obama said any law enforcement issues should be handled by the book but he wanted to know as a matter of counterintelligence policy whether he should share sensitive information on russia with the incoming trump team according to a memo by ms rice during the meeting he told ms yates that he did not want any additional information on the matter regarding law enforcement according to a recently disclosed f b i summary of an interview with ms yates four days after mr obama left office mr comey sent f b i agents to interview mr flynn about the calls with mr kislyak mr flynn s answers led to him being charged with lying to investigators which he pleaded guilty to he later tried to change his plea and mr barr concurred an apparently skeptical judge will decide whether to allow it maggie haberman contributed reporting from new york and mark mazzetti and adam goldman from washington advertisement
