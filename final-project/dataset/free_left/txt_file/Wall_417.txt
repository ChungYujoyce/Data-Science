advertisement supported by as the nation unifies divisiveness falls flat by david brooks opinion columnist even in a pandemic there are weavers and rippers the weavers try to spiritually hold each other so we can get through this together the rippers from donald trump on down see everything through the prism of politics and still emphasize division for the rippers on left and right politics is a war that gives life meaning fortunately the rippers are not winning america is pretty united right now in an abc news ipsos poll last week 98 percent of democrats and 82 percent of republicans supported social distancing rules according to a yahoo news yougov survey nearly 90 percent of americans think a second wave of the virus would be at least somewhat likely if we ended the lockdowns today a pew survey found 89 percent of republicans and 89 percent of democrats support the bipartisan federal aid packages seventy seven percent of american adults think more aid will be necessary according to a usa today ipsos poll most of the policies on offer enjoyed tremendous bipartisan support increasing testing nearly 90 percent temporarily halting immigration 79 percent and continuing the lockdown until the end of april 69 percent a kff poll shows that people who have lost their jobs are just as supportive of the lockdowns as people who haven t the polarization industry is loath to admit this but once you set aside the trump circus we are now more united than at any time since 9 11 the pandemic has reminded us of our interdependence and the need for a strong and effective government it s also taken us to a deeper level the polarization over the past decades has not been about us disagreeing more it s been about us hating each other more this has required constant volleys of dehumanization this dehumanization has always been a bit of a mirage a new study from the group beyond conflict shows that republicans and democrats substantially exaggerate how much the other side dislikes and disagrees with them the pandemic has been a massive humanizing force allowing us to see each other on a level much deeper than politics see the fragility the fear and the courage on may 8 i recommend you watch in this together a pbs american portrait story airing and streaming on pbs it is just regular americans talking into their cellphones and showing what they are going through there s a mom giving birth to twins while in the hospital with the coronavirus she can t see her babies for weeks there are a couple of married nurses who have to send their 6 year old to live with grandma while they shuttle to the hospital the boy can t understand what s happening and the hurt and missing manifest as tantrums there s an older woman sitting in a dark living room i never expected to be alone my husband tested positive for covid he lasted over a week he didn t die until st patrick s day we re 78 and i know it sounds funny but i thought we were going to grow old together and now i m alone we re also being united by those who are sacrificing for the common good the nurse who came from north carolina to serve new york even though she has an 8 month old baby at home the e m t s who are living through death after death the workers who lived in their factory for 28 days to make masks in normal times the rippers hog the media spotlight but now you see regular americans hurt in their deepest places and being their best selves everywhere i hear the same refrain we re standing at a portal to the future we re not going back to how it used to be if you want to be there at one harbinger of the new world i suggest you tune in to the call to unite a 24 hour global streamathon which starts friday at 8 p m on unite us and various digital platforms it was created by tim shriver and the organization unite there will be appearances by world leaders musicians religious leaders actors and philosophers everybody from oprah and george w bush to yo yo ma and the emotion scholar marc brackett when the streamathon was first being organized i played an extremely minor role the idea was to let the world give itself a group hug but as the thing evolved it became clear that people are not only reflecting on the current pain they are also eager to build a different future if you tune in you ll see a surprising layers of depth and vulnerability you ll see people hungering for the great reset the idea that we have to identify 10 unifying ideas like national service and focus energy around them americans have responded to this with more generosity and solidarity than we had any right to expect i ve been on the phone all week with people launching projects to feed the hungry comfort the grieving perform little acts of fun with the young you talk
