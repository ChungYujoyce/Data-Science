decades hillary clinton has largely focused her efforts elsewhere as polls consistently put the buckeye state in donald trump s column still the g o p nominee s lead is narrow and now a huge new endorsement could put ohio back in play thanks to one of the state s biggest stars lebron james when i think about the kinds of policies and ideas the kids in my foundation need from our government the choice is clear that candidate is hillary clinton the cleveland cavaliers star wrote in an op ed sunday published by business insider james drew on his experiences working with kids in akron ohio through his charity the lebron james family foundation as motivation for his support of clinton who he argues will also build on the legacy of president barack obama only one person running truly understands the struggles of an akron child born into poverty he wrote james s endorsement of clinton comes at a crucial time in the presidential race unlike clinton who has multiple potential paths to the white house a victory for trump in less than six weeks hinges on winning ohio and its 18 electoral votes right now the new york billionaire is enjoying a 3 8 point edge on average in the polls in the battleground state thanks in part to the state growing older whiter and less educated than the nation at large as the new york times reports but to triumph over clinton trump needs more than

experiencing in our street and seeing on our tvs he wrote we need a president who brings us together and keeps us unified policies and ideas that divide us are not the solution we must all stand together no matter where we are from or the color of our skin and hillary is running on the message of hope and unity that we need with enthusiasm for her candidacy flagging clinton needs celebrity endorsements like james to help get out the vote especially among black voters who are a critical democratic constituency but like other voting blocs are less excited about clinton than obama james is
