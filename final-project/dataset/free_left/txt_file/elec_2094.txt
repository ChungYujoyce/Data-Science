advertisement supported by morning memo by jonathan martin washington eight years after hillary rodham clinton was haunted by her senate vote to authorize the use of force in iraq another leading white house hopeful is struggling with questions about the war and just as mrs clinton seemed torn then between mollifying democratic primary voters who were against the war and positioning herself to run in the general election jeb bush a republican appears deeply conflicted he is grappling with how to remain loyal to his older brother george w bush while acknowledging what has become a mainstream view in both parties that there would not have been an invasion if policy makers had known in 2003 that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction in arizona on thursday with his fourth different answer of the week mr bush the former florida governor finally conceded that if he had had such knowledge he would not have gone into iraq for mrs clinton in 2008 mishandling what her opponent barack obama called the biggest foreign policy disaster of a generation created an opening for him and ultimately helped undermine her campaign there is no strong antiwar current in today s republican electorate as there was during the 2008 democratic contest but iraq could prove just as thorny for mr bush now because of what it represents the if you knew then questions and gibes from his rivals about the 2003 invasion of iraq are a stand in for a larger challenge confronting mr bush demonstrating that he is not merely another would be heir to a political dynasty transcript na that s the issue here are you actually a unique different person or are you a third bush said former house speaker newt gingrich to the degree that he s defined as a third bush he has a bigger mountain to climb though i think he certainly has the potential to carve out a path because he has an extraordinary record as governor in his opening months as an all but declared candidate mr bush has seemed unsurprised if irritated by questions about how he is different from the previous presidents named bush he has explained that he loves his father and brother but recognizes that he will have to make his own case to win the nomination unmentioned is that much of his strength as a candidate owes to the fund raising network he largely inherited from his family yet while he has been willing to address the issue of his family ties generally the past week shows he is either unprepared or deeply reluctant to discuss specific policy issues stemming from his brother s presidency mr bush s resistance to engage on iraq also underlines the degree to which he is determined to run his campaign on his terms but he may be too sure of himself and his approach his dayslong bobble became the talk of republican politics from the campaign trail in nevada to washington a group of republican senators meeting this week on capitol hill were nearly incredulous that mr bush did not have a better answer and joked about how many press aides he needed to respond to such a basic matter according to a party strategist who heard the conversation jeb s curb appeal was supposed to be experience pedigree and smarts and therefore ready to lead said one republican senator who insisted on anonymity to speak candidly about a presidential hopeful these kinds of statements plant him squarely in the middle of the primary pack with g o p voters unsure of exactly what political lessons he truly has learned donald j trump officially accepted the republican party s nomination on july 22 hillary clinton was officially nominated on july 26 at the democratic convention sensing vulnerability and eyeing an opportunity to bring the closest thing there is to a republican front runner down a peg mr bush s primary opponents have pounced nearly all of them immediately and succinctly answered the question he dodged for days i don t know how that was a hard question rick santorum the former senator from pennsylvania said thursday at the republican national committee spring meeting in arizona some took advantage of the opening to attack mr bush for what they say is the baggage he would bear as the party s nominee senator rand paul republican of kentucky said that the country should be wary of having a nominee who is stuck in relitigating the iraq war we need to know what we re getting ourselves in for mr paul said in an interview on thursday the difficulty that jeb is going to have is on two fronts one he s got conservative mistrust in the primary that s going to be difficult to overcome but should he become the nominee he s going to have difficulty with independents who were opposed to the iraq war i see it as a very difficult place for him to be in mr paul has his own difficulties the republican primary voters he must court on the whole are considerably more hawkish on national security than he is but his remarks bluntly raised what has loomed over mr bush s likely candidacy just as much as his positions on immigration or the common core education standards the perception that he embodies the restoration of a dynasty many do not want to see restored mr paul may overstate the extent of mr bush s legacy problems with republicans a new york times cbs poll this month showed 7 in 10 republicans viewed george w bush favorably and there is little doubt that the party members are far more animated about what they see as president obama s foreign policy blunders than about the mistakes of the last bush administration but mr bush s difficulties discussing his brother and iraq hand his opponents the same cudgel that mr obama so effectively used against mrs clinton in 2008 it is about the past versus the future mr obama said then and when i am the nominee the republicans won t be able to make this election about the past or as the conservative writer david frum a former speechwriter for george w bush put it on twitter this week jeb bush has just converted an election that should be about the past eight years into an election about the eight years before that mr bush s aides say he is anxious to move past his schedule focused on fund raising to a more intensive campaign that will allow him to discuss his own vision but it is unclear he will ever be able to shed himself of forced exercises in retrospection danielle pletka a scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute noted that when senator marco rubio of florida began his presidential campaign last month he chose to do so with this explicit break with the past which of course means the bushes and the clintons that s going to be more resonant for republicans than he s going to get us into another iraq war ms pletka said mr bush s overarching problem is this eternal relitigation of every decision of george w bush she added as much as he s saying i m my own man every time he says that we re reminded he s not advertisement
