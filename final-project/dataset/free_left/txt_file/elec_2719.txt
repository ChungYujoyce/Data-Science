advertisement supported by by trip gabriel psst there is another debate on tuesday no not between donald j trump and hillary clinton they do not suit back up in their gladiatorial armor until next sunday this one is between their running mates gov mike pence of indiana and senator tim kaine of virginia voters may be forgiven for barely knowing of it or allotting it little space on their mental hard drives because of the incendiary flashes tossed into the race daily from the top of the tickets especially by mr trump the meeting of mr pence a republican and mr kaine a democrat two pensive and little known nominees might be the least anticipated vice presidential debate in 40 years you re essentially following ali frazier a few days later with a nationally televised book club said tucker martin a republican strategist in richmond va about an hour from the campus of longwood university where the vice presidential debate will take place there are several reasons for the lack of excitement which could rival previous low interest debates like al gore versus jack kemp in 1996 that one drew the fewest television viewers 26 6 million of any matchup since the first vice presidential debate in 1976 neither of this year s vice presidential candidates was a national figure at the time he was selected unlike many past nominees neither has set off a media feeding frenzy like previous nominees such as geraldine a ferraro the first woman on a major party ticket in 1984 or sarah palin who became a lightning rod for critics in 2008 mr pence and mr kaine are both white men in their late 50s with solid governing r sum s but little reputation beyond their home states they were safe choices picked in part because they would not detract from the top of the ticket i am boring mr kaine said shortly before being selected mr pence introduced himself at the republican national convention to those of you who don t know me which is most of you mr trump represents a merger of presidential politics and reality show trump has so elevated the interest in any kind of political theater that a debate that doesn t have a trump like figure by comparison becomes incredibly less entertaining sadly said dan senor a senior adviser to representative paul d ryan of wisconsin in 2012 when mr ryan was mitt romney s running mate on social media voters have compared the looming debate to watching paint dry and 90 minutes of kaine and pence quizzing each other on dad rock trivia some strategists have said the debate should draw much more attention because mr pence and mr kaine are the understudies for candidates who if elected would be the oldest president ever to take office mr trump or the second oldest mrs clinton since the conventions in late july neither mr pence nor mr kaine has returned to the headlines they received when they were selected google trends shows that interest in the two vice presidential candidates has flatlined at close to zero they re relatively unknown because they re more policy wonks said kyle c kopko a co author of the vp advantage a book published this year on the electoral influence of running mates the epic clash between mrs clinton and mr trump whom voters on both sides view in near millenarian terms has diverted attention from the vice presidential candidates trump and clinton are both polarizing figures said joel k goldstein a scholar of the vice presidency at st louis university school of law the feeling that this debate may not be viewed as the return of elvis isn t necessarily a reflection on the vice presidential candidates or the office 20 photos view slide show since the first presidential debate last monday which drew record tv viewership mr trump has returned to daily criticism of a former miss universe alicia machado for her appearance keeping alive an issue many republicans believe is costing him support among hispanics and women questions about mr trump s temperament have again upstaged any discussion of policy differences between republicans and democrats it is in that circuslike atmosphere that the vice presidential candidates will compete for voters attention kaine pence will most likely produce a very substantive and policy driven debate so it s a real shame there isn t more interest mr martin the republican strategist said but hey once you ve reduced a presidential campaign to just another reality tv show you reap what you sow mr pence who is likely to find himself defending mr trump s derogatory comments about women would be assuming the role of previous nominees who had to make up for stumbles by their running mates in an earlier debate in 2012 vice president joseph r biden jr launched a fierce attack on the republican candidate mr ryan to calm democrats who were in near panic mode over president obama s poor performance in an earlier debate with mr romney that was also the job of vice president george bush in 1984 after president reagan had a bad first debate against walter f mondale mr pence will be called on to have a calming presence on the panic many people have about the idea of trump as president mr senor said neither vice presidential nominee each of whom has governed a large state should have to spend much time assuring viewers of his executive qualifications as senator dan quayle of indiana had to do on the republican ticket in 1988 polling before and after vice presidential debates has shown that they do not have much effect on the overall race a gallup analysis before the 2012 face off found that the median change in polling after the vice presidential debates in 1992 1996 2000 and 2008 was one percentage point the 2008 debate between ms palin and mr biden was the most watched ever seen by nearly 70 million viewers more than for any of the presidential debates that year still in the immediate aftermath the democratic ticket gained only two percentage points and the republicans lost one
