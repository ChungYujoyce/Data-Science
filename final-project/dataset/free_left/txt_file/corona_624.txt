filed under at a time when media malfeasance across politics during a pandemic is having dangerous consequences these doltish thought experiments are the last thing we need the so called newsy bit read and while i am generally loathe sic to wish physical harm on those i disagree with and while i do wish katie a speedy recovery i m comfortable shedding whatever objectivity i have here to say i desperately hope stephen miller contracts covid 19 it was a piece entitled just to hammer the bluntness i will personally be thrilled if stephen miller dies of covid 19 it was written by molly osberg and published online at the feminist website jezebel no need to read much more to get the gist the writer who is correctly critical of president trump s senior policy adviser s racist and nationalist ideas welcomes the news that his wife an aide to vice president mike pence has contracted coronavirus in hopes that her husband catches it and dies at a time when the president s frenemy news outlet fox news is spreading baseless conspiracy theories about barack obama and china and media malfeasance across politics during a pandemic is having very dangerous consequences these doltish thought experiments are the last thing we need in depth political coverage sports analysis entertainment reviews and cultural commentary they are none of the things that make journalism even opinion journalism particularly courageous or thought provoking it is neither brave nor controversial to merely blurt out a revenge fantasy against a much maligned public figure from the comfort of your column it is in fact the exact opposite it s lazy and banal not to mention childish and if we re really reaching for something of slightly more heft distasteful and downright ghoulish why are we in the media so interested in self sabotaging like this predictably the jezebel piece gave trump and his supporters an orgy of outrage and proof or so they will claim that the whole of media is sick and twisted and out to get them does that help the left does that help media is that good for america the very people asking if there is an adult in the white house might want to ask if there is an adult in the newsroom willing to say not every idea is a good one of course over on the far right there are the same problems a recent piece produced for fox nation the streaming service for fox news super fans featured tomi lahren interviewing comedian theo von referring to jeffrey epstein the convicted sex offender who died in prison she asks the epstein did he kill himself to which he responds while she giggles i wouldn t be shocked if hillary clinton went in there with a sharp spoon and got him i wouldn t be shocked if bernie sanders killed him and cut his body up and gave a little bit to every single person that he knew i simply cannot put myself in the mindset of a producer who says this is fine put it up over at the right wing washington times a columnist offers up a paean to freedom by declaring forced face masking is a civil rights offense yes she evokes civil rights also impressively nazis in this incoherent upchuck of patriot porn because this seems a blatant violation of an individual s right to choose of an individual s right to self govern i guess no one was there to tell her that the right to choose refers to a very specific thing and not like all the things or that none of this makes any damn sense no matter your politics these stories aren t provocative they re pablum and they re antithetical to the cause of journalism and at a time when the president is doing his best to undermine it every day one presumes liberals would care deeply about this and take extra care not to needlessly feed into trump s narrative but so too should conservatives even and especially those of us who are critical of liberal media bias when conservative content is just hair brained schlock to own the libs it s hard to argue the stereotypes are just fake news the media is far from perfect we make mistakes every day that erode america s trust all the more reason we could sure live without unforced errors s e cupp is the host of s e cupp unfiltered on hln send letters to
