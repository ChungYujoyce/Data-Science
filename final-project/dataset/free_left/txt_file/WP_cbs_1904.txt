getting food to people in the u s has become an enormous challenge since the country has been gripped by covid 19 anderson cooper reports on the charge being led in part by world renowned chefjos andr s to make sure americans have something to eat not since the great depression have so many in this country faced the prospect of being unable to put food on their table and it s not just families trying to feed themselves farmers processing plants and supermarkets have all experienced disruptions late friday president trump directed 19 billion in relief for farmers and ranchers to maintain the integrity of our food supply chain and to aid local food banks to understand the challenges of feeding a nation in the midst of a pandemic we turned to chef jos andr s whose disaster relief organization world central kitchen has in the past month helped make and serve more than 2 million free meals in at least 100 american cities anderson cooper do we have enough food in the u s jos andr s we have enough food we need to be thinking about how are we feeding ourselves and don t take it ever for granted jos andr s has been thinking about innovative ways to feed people for decades first as a world famous chef and now also as head of world central kitchen a non profit he founded ten years ago earlier this month we were with him in new york city as he handed out food in harlem then checked on one of his kitchens preparing meals for first responders jos andr s a few weeks ago this place would be full this is what s left of mercado little spain a food hall andr s opened in new york just last year it s one of 27 restaurants andr s owns in the u s nearly half of which are now closed the rest are open for takeout or are being used to help feed the growing number of americans who are struggling jos andr s we are using a lot of the ingredients we still have here and we had a lot of lentils and we had a lot of chorizo before coronavirus andr s had 1 600 employees most have now been furloughed he s only been able to keep 250 working these free meals are delivered to military personnel working in a makeshift hospital nearby after standing in line six feet apart they get boxes of fresh cooked penne bolognese anderson cooper do you know how many people you feed here every day jos andr s out of this one around 2 000 anderson cooper 2 000 people jos andr s yeah but but the number is gonna keep increasing the good thing for us anderson is that if all of the sudden we need to go up to 10 000 or 20 000 people we are ready part of emergencies is to adapt and to adapt by the day when you talk about food and water people don t want a solution one week from now one month from now the solution has to be now the urgency of now is yesterday the urgency of now andr s speaks of is visible all across the country food banks are overwhelmed when this one in san antonio announced an emergency food distribution earlier this month more than 10 000 people showed up their cars filled an enormous parking lot each family was given 200 pounds of food gallons of milk chicken fruit and dry goods enough to last two weeks the nation s largest hunger relief organization a nonprofit called feeding america supports a network of 200 food banks and 60 000 local food pantries but even with hundreds of millions of dollars in donations and federal aid they are struggling to meet demand anderson cooper in a situation like this people suddenly see how vulnerable we are or how thin the safety net is for everyone jos andr s we have food banks under the feeding america umbrella that they ve been doing an amazing job but some of the smaller food banks they ve been running out of budget they don t have more money to buy or they are overwhelmed because they don t have enough volunteers andr s world central kitchen tries to fill what he calls the blindspots health care providers in new york in washington d c the elderly and homeless who might not be able to get to a food bank jos andr s we need to make sure that we keep showing up every day sending a very clear message we are here for you and we are gonna take care of you world central kitchen has been taking care of those infected by coronavirus since february they brought fresh meals to cruise ship passengers quarantined on board the diamond princess in yokohama japan using strict health protocols they d developed while doing emergency relief operations in mozambique during a cholera outbreak andr s is vigilant about health precautions constantly monitoring social distancing and disinfecting everything along the way andr s goal is far more ambitious than just handing out free meals he wants the federal government to pay restaurants across america to hire back employees and feed the hungry to prove it can work world central kitchen is already doing it they re spending millions of dollars raised through donations to partner with more than 400 restaurants anderson cooper it keeps people employed in the restaurant delivery people cooks and it also serves vulnerable populations jos andr s what we ve been doing is use the systems that are already in place you don t have to reinvent the wheel you only have to change the way you think world central kitchen has given money to restaurants in los angeles new orleans chicago and dozens of other cities in washington d c they are paying this michelin star restaurant maydan 10 a meal to feed people in need andr s insists the food be nutritious and tasty today it s grilled chicken kebobs carrots and lentils that will be delivered to 80 senior citizens jos andr s we partner with them we tell them listen we need you to help us feed this police station this fire station this hospital this elderly home and we need you to be doing so many meals per day during so many weeks this is the way for us to be responding so quickly in so many cities at once it s a model we first saw him develop in puerto rico in 2017 after hurricane maria fema the federal emergency management agency was unable to provide meals for all those in need so andr s began mobilizing existing kitchens food distributors and an army of volunteers to prepare and serve meals around the island they did it so well fema awarded world central kitchen two contracts in puerto rico worth 11 5 million now in the midst of this pandemic andr s is lobbying republican and democratic lawmakers to prioritize food as a national security issue and get restaurants back to work by feeding the hungry jos andr s i do believe that the federal government has to be playing a bigger role not throwing money at the problem but investing into the solutions jos andr s government has to protect the restaurants because every dollar goes into a restaurant when you dine out trickles down across the economy in a way no other business does we are able to pay the farmers pay the fishermen and pay the people that do the delivery and we are able to pay obviously our cooks and our waiters and bartenders anderson cooper it s a bigger industry than the airline industry jos andr s restaurants in america are the dna of a functioning america we ll not be an america as we know it if those restaurants don t come back to be part of the american way of life anderson cooper you think that s a model that could actually work craig fugate yeah i think it s the model that will have to work craig fugate was head of fema for eight years under president obama he likes the idea of government funding restaurants to help the hungry we spoke with him via remote interview from florida anderson cooper what would it take to have that system be in place craig fugate well it d be pretty straightforward local governments would issue the contracts to local vendors to produce meals under their authority to feed people in a disaster and they would send that to the state and the state would ultimately send it to fema for reimbursement the sudden closing of restaurants did more than cost workers their jobs it created widespread disruption throughout the nation s food supply chain before the pandemic by one estimate 24 million cases of food were delivered every day to restaurants schools and large venues that serve meals it was usually sent in bulk and to repackage it for sale in grocery stores takes time and money with restaurants closed demand for butter and cheese has dropped significantly one reason dairy farmers are dumping as much as three and a half million gallons of milk everyday and farmers who can no longer get their products to restaurants and other customers are discarding millions of pounds of fresh fruit and vegetables this newly harvested zucchini and squash has been left to rot in a florida field anderson cooper there s harvests from now through august around the country these next couple months are crucial for the food supply jos andr s i don t believe the food supply is gonna be an issue if we prepare for it but if the small farmers don t have anybody to sell and all of a sudden they start planting less because seeds cost money and all of a sudden a few months from now that output of food that we took for granted disappears there is a little issue we face craig fugate shares jos andr s concerns craig fugate i don t think we run out of food per se but i think being able to get fresh produce get meats of variety will go away we may see a lotta grain and cereal based products filling in as a primary nutrients in the short run but definitely if we see big disruptions to the production particularly the consumables of fresh produce dairies and milk poultry operation eggs and meat those are what i see as the most vulnerable cause they re the most people intensive this past week a meatpacking facility in colorado where four workers died from the virus was closed down and in south dakota a smithfield foods pork plant which produces 18 million servings of pork a day was also closed more than 600 employees have tested positive there and at least one worker has died anderson cooper what do you want to make sure that people in government are thinking about now with this crisis when it comes to food supply craig fugate think big think worst case scenario you plan for that you don t wait for it to happen or you don t hope it won t happen mike pence at press conference let me just say to all of you that are working in the food industry at every level across the country just understand that you are vital vice president pence recently tried to reassure food industry workers in farms and factories that efforts were being made to keep their workplaces safe mike pence at press conference and we need you to continue as a part of what we call our critical infrastructure to show up and do your job but by the department of agriculture s own statistics roughly half of hired crop farmworkers are undocumented immigrants as are many who work in food processing plants that means despite being an essential part of our critical infrastructure they are still vulnerable to arrest and deportation craig fugate part of the problem is cause they re undocumented and the fear of being deported they may not be reporting in sick or getting treatment or being isolated and therefore causing more spread because they re not given the same protection as other workers anderson cooper they re also in some cases working shoulder to shoulder in fields or on meat processing plants craig fugate yeah doing social distancing in a lot of the agriculture operations will be almost impossible anderson cooper it s sort of ironic that all of the sudden undocumented immigrants are now considered essential in the united states to feed the rest of us craig fugate yeah it finally took a pandemic to make people realize without foreign born workers much of our economy doesn t work anderson cooper a situation like this it highlights problems that already exist in society that people haven t noticed suddenly you see things it s like an x ray machine jos andr s in moments like this inequalities manifest themselves exponentially jos andr s is an immigrant from spain he became an american citizen in 2013 he hopes that when this virus is finally under control we don t forget all those who kept working to feed the rest of us anderson cooper when this is done do you think it changes the way we ll see people jos andr s if we don t have a big explosion of empathy in this country or around the world i don t know when we will jos andr s from now on we gonna be giving the respect they deserve to the delivery pizza guys to the women sitting on the supermarket feeding entire families in the neighborhood only by being there and putting her life at risk all of the sudden that immigrant that you thought that maybe you didn t like is the one that has been helping feed your community all of a sudden we are gonna be more respectful to everyday americans because now those everyday americans in my eyes they are the heroes that kept america going that kept america fed produced by denise schrier cetta associate producers katie brennan and kate morris broadcast associate annabelle hanflig edited by michael
