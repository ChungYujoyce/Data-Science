advertisement supported by how can trump opponents take on people who will stop at nothing by roger cohen opinion columnist back in the other world before all was stilled a neighbor in colorado would tell me it was time for liberals to gun up the other side was armed he argued and would stop at nothing what would we tell our grandchildren when ivanka trump took office as the 46th president of the united states in 2025 and term limits were abolished that we tried words all manner of them he scoffed but they had the rifles i waved him away american democracy was not hungarian democracy now dead its checks and balances were resilient too many guns are an american scourge no he insisted you will see by june 2020 civil war or something like it is coming gun up dude before it s too late my neighbor did not predict the uniforms of america s warring factions how masks would become normative in democratic strongholds like telluride or ridgway but be scorned in colorado trump country as the giveaway dress of the liberal egghead terrorized by the virus the responsible crowd with face half hidden confronting the unmasked live free or die crowd across the vastness and fracture of an unled country once again in this frayed republic there is scant middle ground the virus is godzilla destroying all before it the virus is a myth get over it biking onto the manhattan bridge i pass a new piece of graffiti bezos made the virus nobody foresaw what a pathogen about one thousandth the width of an eyelash could trigger in a society where truth itself has been obliterated by president trump day after lying day if he could deny the visible like the number of people at his inauguration imagine what he could do with the invisible or don t imagine it just look around trump in a tweet last month urges his tens of millions of followers to liberate virginia from the lockdown and save your great 2nd amendment which is under siege or roughly translated grab your guns while you can to fight the liberal virus conspiracy just the latest attempt after climate change and all the rest to emasculate america his languidness jared kushner the president s son in law and go to person for every known problem on the planet is asked by time magazine whether he is willing to commit to the holding of the nov 3 election i m not sure i can commit one way or the other but right now that s the plan he says good to know right now there s a plan to hold an election gun up dude before it s too late for trump this disaster is no more than a deep state conspiracy like the mueller investigation or the impeachment proceedings all of it the virus death toll surely inflated by officials as a means to defeat him the dented dow the highest unemployment numbers since the great depression the collapse of his spectacular economy the dire scientific predictions of the consequences of premature economic reopening it s all about him because everything is followers of qanon a far right conspiracy movement provide fodder for the president s paranoia as reported by my colleagues matthew rosenberg and jim rutenberg i hear that the letter q now appears on t shirts at far right protests in germany signs at a recent demonstration in stuttgart listed the worst dictators in history bill gates followed by angela merkel and down the list hitler some german protesters wear yellow stars they claim that anne frank would have been among them protesting the corona dictatorship that unnecessarily shut down europe s largest economy christian drosten a top german virologist with a popular podcast receives death threats like anthony fauci america s top infectious disease expert history science truth the enlightenment are under siege anything could happen in america between now and november i mean anything this month trump s department of justice dropped charges against former national security adviser michael flynn who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators in the russia inquiry a more flagrant demonstration of trump s political cronies at the department of justice led by attorney general william barr bending to the president s diktat rather than fulfilling their oath to the constitution is hard to imagine no wonder more than 2 000 former department of justice officials have called in a letter for barr s resignation he is a disgrace so much for those resilient checks and balances i lauded to my colorado neighbor back then in the bygone era he wrote to me no wonder republicans are laughing at us the billionaire politicians have complete control besides the military at this point no oversight and most of their constituents are armed some heavily and ready to defend them roll over and die what the hell time to even things up to save this country hopefully guns will always be a deterrent but they may be our last hope to save this country time to gun up liberals if you prefer think of gun up as get real get tough get registered get mobilized get
