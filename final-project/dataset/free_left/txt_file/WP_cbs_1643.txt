experts say nationwide restrictions may need to be in place until there is a vaccine to thwart the novel coronavirus when might that be americans wondering when their lives will return to something resembling normal after the coronavirus outbreak may be hunkering down for a while epidemiologists at imperial college london published a new report last week on the potential number of deaths in the u s from covid 19 and the measures necessary to prevent them the report indicates nationwide restrictions including social distancing home isolation and school closures would need to be maintained at least intermittently until the virus subsides or a working vaccine is developed scientists tell 60 minutes it will likely be more than a year before a vaccine to prevent covid 19 is rolled out to the public and there is no way to speed up the process scientists around the world launched an urgent quest to develop a vaccine against the novel coronavirus on january 10 the day scientists in china posted the genetic sequence of the virus online at inovio pharmaceuticals in san diego publication of the virus s genetic blueprint was like the starting gun company scientists plugged the viral sequence into their computer algorithm which spit out a fully designed vaccine on paper in just three hours how remarkable is that turnaround kate broderick inovio s senior vice president of research and development told 60 minutes it is unusually fast compared to traditional vaccine development if you re thinking of traditional vaccines you re talking in the months to years type timeframe she said broderick said her company has already started testing its vaccine on animals and expects to start human trials next month once those begin the company will then need to go through the rigorous process laid out by government regulators to ensure the vaccine is safe and effective as much as i would love to be able to tell you that a vaccine s around the corner next month or the month after as you can imagine these things do take time she said there is an epidemiological reason not to rush trials for a covid 19 vaccine scientists don t want to make the disease stronger those who are racing to create the covid 19 vaccine are working to ensure it is safe effective and won t trigger a complication called enhanced disease enhanced disease is absolutely something that you always have to rule out with any vaccine particularly a respiratory vaccine said stephen hoge president of moderna a boston area biotech company that is collaborating with the national institutes of health to create a vaccine and coronavirus is no exception enhanced disease is a complication scientists have seen with early generations of other vaccines after scientists inject a laboratory animal its immune system becomes too challenged by the virus and triggers a stronger reaction the animal then ends up with a worse case of the disease than the one the vaccine was intended to protect it against hoge said previous research in animals has shown enhanced disease is a theoretical concern with coronaviruses t he burden of proof will be on us to show that the vaccine doesn t actually result in any enhancement of disease in fact is protective hoge said and that s one of the key things our clinical trials are going to be designed to evaluate this is not the first time the world has seen an outbreak of illness linked to a coronavirus in 2003 the sars coronavirus sickened more than 8 000 and killed more than 700 worldwide nine years later the mers coronavirus killed more than 800 so why then are scientists just now racing to create a vaccine against the coronavirus that causes covid 19 dr angela hewlett the medical director of the biocontainment unit at the university of nebraska medical center said vaccine trials were underway for sars and mers which might have helped researchers be better prepared for this outbreak but there were too few patients for the studies to be completed it s difficult to do vaccine trials when there aren t a lot of cases hewlett said when these vaccine trials are coming up there may be an outbreak going on but by the time they really get geared up there may not be a lot of cases of those illnesses anymore hewlett says once outbreaks subside so does the interest in funding vaccine research we really need to make sure that when we re funding research that we think in the long term and not necessarily just fund in the short term while that outbreak is going on hewlett said but also continue that work even after the outbreak is over with the videos above were edited by will croxton copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
