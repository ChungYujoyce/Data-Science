obama for the 2008 nomination mrs clinton s aides could barely believe their good fortune mr trump had just given them new fodder to galvanize women behind her candidacy and they used it we are not responding to trump mrs clinton s communications director jennifer palmieri responded to mr trump almost gleefully on twitter but everyone who understands the humiliation this degrading language inflicts on all women should she added tacking on the campaign s girl power hashtag imwithher behind the scenes the clinton campaign mobilized a wide network of female supporters to denounce mr trump as sexist as a practitioner of pathetic frat boy politics and as more suited to running for president of the fourth grade football team for months mrs clinton s strategy was to hang mr trump s more outrageous pronouncements around the necks of other republican contenders seeking to portray the party s entire field as extreme but by going after mr trump more assertively now than most of his republican rivals have dared mrs clinton is projecting strength and she is calculating that women especially young voters will reward her in an interview with the des moines register late tuesday mrs clinton said of mr trump it s not the first time he s demonstrated a penchant for sexism combativeness after all plays into mrs clinton s campaign theme the blue hillary signs that blanket her rallies carry the slogan fighting for us in big block letters but poking at mr trump is not risk free he is unlike any rival mrs clinton has confronted before and has proved willing to say almost anything on wednesdaynight mr trump posted a cryptic warning shot at mrs clinton on twitter hillary when you complain about a penchant for sexism who are you referring to he wrote be careful on tuesday mrs clinton s allies continued to join the fray emily s list which raises money for female candidates who support abortion rights released an open letter calling on other republican candidates to denounce

t go standing up polite society suggests we don t talk about these things history suggests that each party s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions as measured by endorsements fund raising and polling the clinton campaign s emboldened new posture toward mr trump grew from months of watching how his republican rivals struggled to challenge him while the other candidates for the republican presidential nomination tread carefully to avoid antagonizing mr trump s supporters for mrs clinton hitting hard offers immediate benefits it shows that she is unafraid of him democratic strategists said and by focusing on mr trump s more extreme comments mrs clinton could excite the growing list of constituencies he has directly offended as well as a broad range of voters who see mr trump as a corrosive presence in the presidential campaign the contrast between her and donald trump could not be clearer mrs clinton s campaign manager robby mook said after saturday s debate the more trump is out there he added the more these differences are clear and what s at stake for the middle class both in the economy and in defeating isis mrs clinton s assertion in the debate that the islamic state was showing videos of donald trump insulting islam and muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists amounted to something of a turning point though

appeases female voters could prove problematic senator rand paul of kentucky even joined in the mockery carly fiorina has zero trouble making it back from commercial breaks he wrote in a twitter post that mrs fiorina who has had her own run ins with mr trump s gendered attacks promptly retweeted even some democrats cautioned that mrs clinton should not get carried away with combativeness toward mr
