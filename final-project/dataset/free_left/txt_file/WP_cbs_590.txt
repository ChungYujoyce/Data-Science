watch cbsn live by rachel layne updated on may 24 2019 6 17 pm moneywatch many economists and stock market strategists are starting to bet that trade wars aren t easy to win as president donald trump famously declared in a tweet more than a year ago as april 2019 turned to may most economists and other trade and investment experts were optimistic a trade deal could be reached between the u s and china as the calendar approaches june many now say their main working premise is that the world s two biggest economies are instead heading down a path to an economic cold war that could last years we now take it as our base case that the deal to end the trade war which many market participants were sure was forthcoming just a few weeks ago is now the tail risk an improbable event that suddenly seems probable wrote carl b weinberg the chief economist at high frequency economics in a note friday why the change of heart some shifts can be traced to developments this past week tied to technology chinese state media on friday accused the u s of seeking to colonize global business with moves this week that effectively cripple china stelecom giant huawei and potentially other chinese tech companies by mandating u s government approval for all corporate transactions in this country u s investors are already worried beijing will eventually try to limit or even choke off american companies that both sell into its markets and manufacture products there such as apple and its iphone apple stock like the s p 500 index is down for the month of may the escalation in the tech realm comesafter trade talks fell apart in early may mr trump accused china ofreneging on some parts of a dealand unexpectedly raised to 25 percent from 10 percent tariffs on chinese goods and threatened tariffs on 300 billion more worth of good annually effectively taxing every good imported from china this is a close call and without additional signs of progress over the next few weeks implementation of the next round of tariffs on 300 billion of imports from china could easily become the base case wrote jan hatzius the chief economist at goldman sachs in a note to clients this week u s companies pay those higher taxes often passing them on to consumers if mr trump s full tariff intentions are realized it could cost a typical three person family in the u s 2 200 annually in higher prices for goods according to an estimate from the peterson institute of international economics gary hufbauer that could be just the beginning china is already using weapons beyond tariffs aimed at u s companies that want to sell into the fast growing chinese market and manufacture goods there those companies include apple boeing caterpillar deere and other stalwarts the american chamber of commerce in china said friday its members operations are facing growing pressure the negative impact of tariffs is clear and hurting the competitiveness of american companies in china the group and amcham shanghai said in announcing the results of a mid may survey of nearly 250 companies according to the associated press the escalations come ahead of a long scheduled g 20 meeting of developed economies in japan in june more tit for tat the white house threatened to slap tariffs on countries that devalue their currency and china signaled it may restrict exports of rare earth metals that are used in a wide variety of common electronics these push up the odds of a protracted standoff raymond james analyst ed mills said in a note friday such moves give no indication that g 20 meeting preparations are moving forward mills wrote as u s markets sink rhetoric is escalating each side says the other has more to lose mark haefele the chief investment officer for ubs wrote in a note to clients when it serves his interest president trump takes tariffs off as quickly as he puts them on so things can change quickly haefele wrote but we don t see the u s or china hurrying to reach a deal and the risk of miscalculation is growing another sign a long fight is likelier than a swift agreement mr trump this week also pledged andther 16 billion in federal aid to farmers they are suffering from china s shutdown of its agriculture markets to u s exports like soybeans and corn itself a response to mr trump s first rounds of tariffs on imported chinese goods last year mr trump this month may have shifted strategy to downplay the appearance of economic risk and instead lean on a tough on china message wrote height securities analyst clayton allen in a note this week more farm aid adds to this narrative and may suggest a shift in trump s political calculus allen wrote the move to counter the impacts of a trade war are a clear attempt to shield trump s political base from pain and blunt the negative political impacts the white house also postponed a decision to impose tariffs on the auto industry a move that economists have warned could cost tens of thousands of u s jobs steel and aluminum tariffs imposed last year recently were lifted for mexico and canada clearing the way for congress to vote on a new trade agreement for north america s three largest economies both moves set aside other skirmishes so trump can focus on china some analysts suggested increased activity to resolve pressing domestic issues by the white house and lawmakers potentially preview preparations for an extended u s china trade rift raymond james mills noted china may prefer no deal rather than a bad deal and is prepared to wait hfe s weinberg predicted beijing is prepared to accept the consequences of that for the economy weinberg wrote we expect the government to remain hunkered down at least until the 2020 election with the specific goal of denying president trump a
