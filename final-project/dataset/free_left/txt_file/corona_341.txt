 congress hard liners are embracing the protests against stay at home orders with some hoping to spark a sequel to the tea party activists hold signs and protest the california lockdown due to the coronavirus in san diego sean m haffey getty images by melanie zanona 05 11 2020 04 30 am edt link copied rep andy harris is fed up with being locked down they promised 2 million dead at the beginning of this harris fumed to constituents during a recent teletown hall later adding the media has a vested interest in making things sound worse so that you tune in the next day advertisement the conservative maryland republican also joined a reopen america protest where he delivered a fiery speech to a crowd of demonstrators without wearing a mask and ripped into the restrictions at a congressional hearing last week during which he lamented that we re safer from death if we re not born and harris an anesthesiologist who served as a medical officer in the naval reserve is not alone a growing list of house hard liners say they have reached their breaking point with the stay at home orders which flipped a switch on the once booming economy in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus in recent weeks republicans have been angrily lashing out at the media local and state officials and house democratic leadership over the continued shutdown and are now actively encouraging the fired up protesters swarming state capitols across the country it s ludicrous it s arbitrary and it s absolutely unnecessary said rep jody hice r ga whose state has been one of the earliest to lift coronavirus restrictions in some cases there s no evidence whatsoever that they eliminate the spread of covid 19 it s just abusive dictatorial tyrannical type leadership rep andy biggs r ariz chairman of the conservative house freedom caucus is also cheering on the protests it s organic it s nonpartisan and it s basically an effort to send a message to government he said it s clear people across all spectrums are feeling the pain of these government actions the push among gop lawmakers to end isolation orders comes as activist groups look to mobilize the conservative grassroots just as they fueled the tea party movement a decade ago the move is intended not only to give the economy a boost but also potentially build momentum on the right ahead of the november elections rep andy biggs pablo martinez monsivais ap photo time will tell if this will turn into a tea party type movement hice said of the growing social unrest part of me is hopeful this will begin a movement of americans taking a stand for constitutional liberties that have been eroding for quite some time but rapidly eroding through this pandemic yet for all the heated protests taking place and as several states begin to wind down restrictions the desire to immediately end the lockdowns remains a minority opinion according to new polling most americans do not feel comfortable with their states reopening salons gyms movie theaters and other businesses that might explain why some republicans have taken a more measured approach to the debate acknowledging it s difficult to strike a balance between public health concerns and the need to get the economy humming again and even if the economy is technically reopened it s not clear there will be many customers if fear of the virus is widespread no matter what decision you make there s going to be people second guessing it said sen john cornyn r texas who is up for reelection this fall you need to do it gradually and you need to be careful we all know how to manage risks in our own life that s if we have good information and know how to do that but right now people are being inundated president donald trump who has also encouraged protesters with tweets to liberate democratic run states recently tapped a bipartisan congressional task force to explore ways to get the nation back to work it s a sign the white house wants some bipartisan buy in for reopening the economy one of the most consequential decisions that will be made during the pandemic coronavirus casualties are still climbing with over 80 000 americans dead from the virus thus far republicans who have been clamoring to reopen the country have faced accusations from democrats that they care more about the economy than people s lives many gop lawmakers however counter that continuing the lockdown carries its own set of health risks pointing to the increase in suicides and routine health exams getting pushed to the back burner we need to get back to our way of life because there are serious mental health issues said house gop whip steve scalise r la you re seeing suicides on the rise others have given more blunt assessments rep trey hollingsworth r ind told a local radio station last month that the health risks are the lesser of two evils compared with the economic damage from the virus republicans have also begun to decry the stay at home orders as a violation of constitutional rights a call to arms that plays directly to the right s fears about government overreach power has gone to their heads and they believe government is the answer to everything said gop rep debbie lesko of arizona who accused democratic chicago mayor lori lightfoot of going ballistic with her threats to jail people who violate social distancing orders meanwhile hice and biggs wrote a letter to trump over easter weekend voicing concern that virus related restrictions on public gatherings are infringing on americans religious freedoms they ve complained that in some places you can buy alcohol and a lottery ticket but can t attend your place of worship just because we have a pandemic does not mean our constitutional rights evaporate or disappear hice said i believe there s a tremendous abuse of civil liberties in certain cases across the country and i m hopeful some of these people will be held accountable the president s amped up rhetoric surrounding the integrity of the 2020 election has many wondering how he might respond to a defeat attorney general william barr has said the department of justice is monitoring the stay at home orders to ensure they don t violate civil liberties and he didn t rule out stepping in if states go too far republicans have also slammed various reports of law enforcement aggressively going after people and businesses who violate the rules i don t think the police should be going after them at all it s overkill biggs said that s where you begin saying have we crossed the line in some states have we become martial law the debate over reopening the country is also playing out in the capitol the senate returned to d c last week but speaker nancy pelosi d calif has delayed the house s return citing recommendations from the capitol physician republicans hammered pelosi for keeping lawmakers away from washington in the middle of a crisis that requires congressional action rep louie gohmert r texas is seeking signatures for a letter calling on the gop to come back to d c no matter what this week and blaming the high infection and death rates in new york on poor leadership at the state level this is why we as republicans must demonstrate leadership for the country by safely and responsibly coming back to work in washington in order to minimize an impending economic calamity which could ultimately cost lives and dramatically increase misery across the united states the letter states according to a draft copy obtained by politico some lawmakers have defiantly chosen not to wear masks in the capitol sen rand paul r ky however vigorously defended his decision not to wear a facial covering maintaining that he is immune to the virus because he already contracted it in march while also denouncing the nanny state modern medicine shows us that immunity is based on having antibodies paul tweeted why are fake news media and petty tyrants denying medical science they so want to have everyone submit to busybody rules and regulations that they can t stand it that someone might be immune and therefore immune to their people controls still even republicans who strongly oppose the stay at home restrictions said the public should keep in mind the dangers of the virus when resisting we have to be careful as elected officials said rep jim banks r ind it s an american thing to protest while at the same time we should encourage responsibility and health precautions as part of the protests burgess everett contributed to this report link copied
