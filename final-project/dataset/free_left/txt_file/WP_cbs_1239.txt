julie beitman has been correspondent david pogue s friend and neighbor for over 15 years but he s never seen her like this repeatedly washing her hands or wiping down her counter i m very upset about this beitman said i m upset i watch the news around the clock and that s all i think about has it brought you to tears pogue asked it has she laughed like everybody else she s doing everything in her power to avoid getting infected by the 2020 coronavirus i ve never touched a doorknob or a handle she said my boots are all worn out on the toe you re flushing toilets with your foot always always and so like many other americans she s stocked up on supplies she s even made her own stylish face masks that ll protect me it ll cover from the top of my nose to the bottom of my face she said even before the coronavirus was considered a pandemic beitman was taking all the rational recommended steps like washing your hands a lot coughing into your elbow and avoiding crowds doorknobs and touching your face but fear is also making people doirrational things sometimes dangerous things panic buying toilet paper attacking people just for looking asian buying unproven home remedies or gargling with bleach no don t do this david desteno is a psychology professor at northeastern university who s studied how fear can drive us batty we re supposed to be the rational animal he said but there s a lot going on in your head that s kind of under your conscious radar pogue asked under what circumstances do our brains run away with the fear they run away with the fear if we don t have accurate information he said like that guy over there on the subway he looks like he s gonna sneeze and like he s sweaty does he have the coronavirus or not i don t know when you don t know the information it gives a lot more range for your emotions to fill in the blanks so would mr spock from star trek be able to avoid having his emotions fill in those blanks yes said destano he would have an accurate assessment of the virus risk rajita sinha a yale psychiatry professor and director of the yale interdisciplinary stress center said the stress circuit is really there to biologically and mentally physically help us respond to stress and to help us adapt and survive in the world she said that three factors can make fear spiral out of control the first if it is unpredictable and the second if it s uncontrollable and the third is if it s sustained and chronic pogue asked so how then does this virus fit into these three categories unfortunately we have all three classes of problematic stress sinha replied you mentioned this issue of control so is there a sense that some of the wilder things that people are doing gargling with bleach spraying chinese looking people in the subway are people trying to get control pogue asked absolutely sinha replied we go to the extreme sometimes to gain control to have a sense that we can do something about it mark jurgenson was a passenger on the diamond princess the cruise ship that quarantined its passengers for two weeks in japan at some point jurgenson and his wife got the virus he s now quarantined at his home in st george utah pogue asked so how was your cruise yeah other than that mrs lincoln how was the play he laughed i have never had and continue to not have any symptoms not even slight cold symptom nothing but jurgenson and his wife have experienced irrational fear in another form hostile comments online from other people among the comments about them he heard were let s find out where he is and go get him don t you dare come back to st george and you ll regret it if you come to st george they were threatening you guys pogue asked with the amount of fear this has generated i should have known that some people would be fearful and often the way people react to fear is to get angry now we can t help what we feel our brains evolved to respond to dangers that we sense around us but desteno says that we re now sensing danger around the clock on our screens i m not saying that s a bad thing we want to be informed he said but we kind of need a software update right our brain hasn t evolved to be able to adjust to what we re seeing in the media versus what s really in our local environment of course it doesn t help that virus movies like contagion and outbreak have painted a horrific picture in our minds and social media like facebook and twitter only make matters worse the other thing we know about emotions is they re contagious destano said on social media everybody s talking about the threat of coronavirus not only am i gonna think that that s more frequent but i m gonna see that fear as a rational signal from them and it s going to make me wanna respond accordingly pogue asked albert ko the department chair of epidemiology at the yale school of public health to help us distinguish rational responses from the irrational ones about coronavirus so can you get it from a package sent from china no can you get it from sweat no and about the ways to kill the virus soap and water s the best ko said hand sanitizer it has to have more than 60 alcohol antibiotics no certainly not said ko so this is a virus antibiotics work against fungi and bacteria so antibiotics won t work remember stress anxiety and fear can be useful they can drive us to taking healthy actions the trick is to recognize when our fear has gone off the rails and become dangerous because as professor desteno said right now we re in the perfect storm because we all feel anxious because of what we re seeing but most of us can t think like epidemiologists most of us can t think statistically and so that fear is filling in the blanks and making us think everything is more dangerous for more info story produced
