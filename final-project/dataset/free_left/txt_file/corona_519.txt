not who we are it is not what we believe he said we are going to fight every way we can to save every life that we can because that s what i think it means to be an american i know that s what it means to be a new yorker trump later hit back at cuomo for complaining he claimed that cuomo passed up the chance to buy 16 000 ventilators in 2015 for the state at a very good price without elaborating cuomo said it s good that new york city residents are starting to heed warnings to limit social interaction and to stay off the streets but he conceded that the measures are still not working and the worst is still at least two or three weeks away new york will now need an estimated 140 000 hospital beds up from 110 000 estimated before there are only about 50 000 hospital beds in

desperate need for 30 000 more new york will experiment with splitting a ventilator between two patients a difficult to perform procedure cuomo says adding necessity is the mother of invention the

production act to compel manufacturers to produce ventilators and to send ventilators from the federal stockpile of 20 000 to new york i do not for the life of me understand the reluctance to use the defense production act he said the governor suggested new york is being hit with the top of the disease curve first but other states are likely to see the same problem soon i m asking you to help new york to help yourself the governor said addressing the nation deal with the apex here don t leave them sitting on a stockpile cuomo said let s help each other alluding to president trump s comments on
