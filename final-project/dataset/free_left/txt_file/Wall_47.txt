advertisement supported by on politics with lisa lerer here s what life is like for a teacher who s making her first run for office amid the pandemic by lisa lerer hi welcome to on politics your guide to the day in national politics i m lisa lerer your host sign up here to get on politics in your inbox every weekday the days have settled into a strange sort of routine here at on politics world headquarters otherwise known as my house the kids zoom and scream and run through the living room brandishing pretend lightsabers there are noise canceling headphones and a card table turned desk crammed into a corner of a bedroom i have a newfound appreciation for the little things like just how many hours of star wars related programming exists on disney plus it s not much like our life in the beforetimes i don t know when or even if that life will return but we re managing balancing not quite but managing of course compared to so many we have it easy i m not a front line worker or furloughed or running for office but maggie nurrenbern is trying to do more than just manage the 35 year old teacher is running her first political race while also contending with the complexities of how we live now she s teaching her high school courses virtually parenting three boys 6 and under dealing with the risks that come from having a husband who works in health care and on top of all that she s campaigning as a democrat for a seat in the missouri house of representatives from her suburban kansas city district this is hardly the situation ms nurrenbern pictured when she began her campaign months ago i talked to her about distance learning scheduled chaos and politicking in a pandemic as always our conversation has been edited and condensed tell me about what your life looks like now how is everything going scheduled chaos let me say is what we re managing my husband and i we have three boys the youngest just turned 1 then we have a 4 year old and a 6 year old when i decided to run for office everybody was gosh you can t do this your kids are too young you ve got to be there for your kids and over and over again i was saying this is being there for my kids running for office and caring about their futures is being there for them but it certainly has been the toughest thing i ve ever done and you re still working right i m still teaching full time even though it is through online learning my kids make frequent appearances during my zoom classes there s times where i have to say ok hey you guys keep talking right here i m going to go run the baby back downstairs or something like that and i do my best with the campaign to do scheduled calls but you never know what s going on at a certain time i just had to step away to fix a marble run and tape a part back together there s always something my husband is a nurse practitioner sometimes he s in the clinic which has been nerve racking to say the least his patients test positive for covid 19 and i think about him coming home and it s been tough when i started the campaign last year i knew that it was going to be can i finish this phone call and then i ll help you it s an ox like a horse you know but an ox sorry we re having a distance learning issue here i get it the other day i was on a call and my son was trying to spell soup versus soap and it was three minutes of trying to be like no that s soup this is soap what kind of stuff can you even do for the campaign right now everything is virtual i would represent 36 000 people and so canvassing is just a huge part of that meeting voters face to face now we re shifting to doing that through phone banking right now it s reaching out and doing wellness checks how are you doing right now and if there is any way to connect them with resources can i count on your vote in november feels a little ludicrous right now are you fund raising that s been the toughest part it s really hard to fund raise for a political office when people have lost their jobs when they re worried about being able to pay the rent but at the same time we see how imperative it is that we have elected officials that understand the realities of working families that s what this has shown us when we have people who are completely separated from the lives of working people they re not making decisions that are in our best interest we have seen that from the president on down and certainly even in missouri it s kind of a necessary evil that we do have to raise money and change who is in office but you re trying to do it it sounds like to some extent it s not maybe the hard ask that i would do before like can i count on a donation today of 200 but more you know hey if you re able i would really appreciate this when you can so it s coming from a place of understanding walk me through like what your day is like honestly i feel like i m pretty fortunate because we went from a hundred miles an hour to a screeching halt before i would be out of the house by 7 at the latest and come back from the school day and be gone again for events in the evening there s some days i feel like are a complete blessing to have all this time to spend with my family but then at the same time i m constantly thinking of those who every day is just pure agony not knowing how they re going to make it to the end of the month and pay those bills or have enough food to eat the school that i teach at it s our most diverse high school in the state we have a huge population that s free and reduced lunch we have a homelessness population and it s so hard to be able to connect with those kids and you really don t know what they re living right now so many of them would tell me school was the brightest part of their day do you think you would have still decided to run had you known this was going to happen yeah without a doubt i would have i m even more certain that we have to change the people we elect we have to have people who are in office that truly represent working families as a mom with young children i feel like i have that kind of mama bear mentality so what s next after we hang up the phone right now it s nap time for the kiddos we switch off who is with the kids so nobody goes too crazy during the day it s one day at a time and we do the best we can as a mom you learn early and often to have a tremendous sense of humility that s how i approach everything we do what we can each and every day but at the end of it if everybody s alive and happy and well then i ve done the best that i could a sewing army is sending masks across america at the same time mask mandates are leading to threats verbal abuse and even a shooting we want to know how your community is responding to this stressful moment in american life is it a time of unity or even deeper political divisions email us at onpolitics nytimes com and don t forget to include your name and location we might feature you in a future edition of on politics we re sharing some of your dispatches from around the globe about life in the time of coronavirus today we have a letter from parker gertz 12 from havertown pa i have seen a lot of times readers saying different things about when the country should reopen from our lockdown although i can t say i have read the news for decades or say i ve been into national and international happenings for 50 years i do feel dumbfounded at some of the reasoning i have seen for reopening the country i thought we as a country at least decided that people are worth more than money perhaps you who say we should open the country have not felt the effects of the virus maybe you have not feared a loved one s death i was just thinking you can always get another haircut another manicure but can you get another mother or grandparent are short term pleasures worth the waste of life people say experience is everything but if you have the experienced trying to end lives as though they re just numbers then i prefer a teenager in office you may never want to eat from a buffet again after seeing this video thanks for reading on politics is your guide to the political news cycle delivering clarity
