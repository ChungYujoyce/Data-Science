advertisement july 26 2016 arguments provocations and observations from times opinion writers related article times columnists editorial writers and contributors bring their insights to bear on hillary clinton and the democrats in philadelphia here are their notes and observations from yesterday philadelphia his life took off he said when he fell in love with that girl he told a familiar love story recounted in his memoir about springtime at yale law school in 1971 and a magnetic girl with thick blond hair and big glasses and no makeup and a long white flowery skirt he said when he first saw her in a political and civil rights class that he wanted to tap her on the shoulder but he knew if he did he would be starting something beyond his control with a sky blue tie and silvery hair and an easy smile the 69 year old looked healthier than he has on the trail and he was sharp the big dog basked in the unique historic moment a former president and a husband and a wannabe first lad making the case for a former first lady a wife and a wannabe first woman president in an act of amazing self restraint the man who relishes the word i managed to make the talk as he prefers to call his folksy speeches all about her he was positively uxorious she calls you when you re sick when your kid s in trouble or when there s a death in the family bill said of his partner of 40 years it has been said that the essence of the clinton marriage is coming to each other s rescue in critical moments or maybe more precisely their byzantine conjugal dynamic works like this one of them creates chaos usually bill and then they get out of it together or as a former aide described the clinton pattern hubris funk reintroduction you could drop her in any trouble spot pick one come back in a month and somehow some way she will have made it better he said in a line that could have applied to global crises or marital an earlier celebrity speaker tonight was tony goldwyn who plays the philandering president in a series inspired by bill and monica after the email shaming and a bloodless campaign tonight it was bill s turn to rescue hillary from being the most unknown known person in history one of the most liked presidents was charged with humanizing one of the least liked presidential candidates one of the most seductive characters we ve seen in american politics in our lifetime as david axelrod calls bill clinton had to melt the sphinx like aura of his guarded wife the uncontrollable clinton had to make the tightly controlled clinton seem less coiled and more endearing the protean pol had to take his wife s ever shifting personas and policies and paint a cohesive portrait he rivaled ivanka in his talent for airbrushing but he probably won t be offering his convention outfit for sale tonight hill and bill both have 100 percent name id but bill s task was to reintroduce her as the best darn change maker i have ever met in my entire life a quarter century after clinton aides wrote memos about how to warm up and round out hillary by raising her profile as a mother bill was still trying to drive that point home my daughter had the best mother in the whole world he said tonight adding that hillary was first and foremost a mother our family s designated worrier who only worried about bill s parenting when he took a couple days off with chelsea to watch all six police academy movies back to back he described hillary on her knees lining chelsea s stanford dorm room drawers with paper when their daughter moved to college until chelsea told them it was time to leave it is another example of the overcorrecting that marks hillary s career in trying to feminize and maternalize hillary bill almost went overboard about that girl as he called her three times he poured on the estrogen presaging his role as helpmeet in the east wing he never mentioned donald trump the man he used to be friendly with and play golf with he simply alluded to the way the republican convention had tried to turn hillary into a cartoon villainess life in the real world is complicated and hard he said and a lot of people think it s boring one is real the other is made up he said of the caricature of hillary you nominated the real one he implicitly compared his wife to her gilded rival limning her as someone genuinely seeking a life of service he talked about her summer sliming fish in alaska and all her work for poor children hillary has said that she never realized how hard it was to be as great a persuader and performer as bill until she tried to do it herself bill has now given 10 convention speeches and he has had awful moments and great ones i was there in 1988 when he talked for 33 minutes and the dukakis delegates began cheering when he finally said in closing and i was there in 2012 when he won raves for selling barack obama s agenda after the articulate but aloof president somehow wasn t able to and had to appoint bill as secretary of explaining stuff this speech was slightly over 40 minutes donald trump had a soap opera actress speak at his convention but the clintons easily topped that their lives have been an astonishing soap opera in which bill has played many starring roles the loyal spouse the betraying spouse and the subconscious saboteur this was a night a long time coming for the former moot court partners a night celebrating the promise that animates the clinton partnership she helped him she moved to arkansas for him i really hoped that her choosing me and rejecting my advice to pursue her own career was a decision she would never regret bill said tonight she added the clinton name to rodham to please old fashioned southerners when bill lost the governor s mansion to help him win it back bill told the story tonight about how she engineered his comeback noting my experience is it s a pretty good thing to follow her advice hillary chafed at eight years of the anachronistic role of first lady even through slights like getting stationery with the restored middle name of rodham missing as her husband campaigned for the white house she sent it back that girl put up with the humiliations of bill s hound dog ways with that woman and others and let him hide behind her skirt and tonight bill paid her back and tried to extend his own legacy even as trump gets ready to exert more effort dragging the former president through the mud jeb bush had faltered partly on dynasty fatigue but bill does not intend to let that happen to hillary starting tonight and through the fall as he tries to woo back white voters and older voters in the rust belt and the south he is trying to conjure the halcyon days of clinton peace and prosperity he does not want to remind people of the shady days of clinton avarice and deceit or the parts of his presidency or post presidency that haven t aged well like nafta the crime bill deregulation of wall street and the defense of marriage act the marc rich pardon or the unseemly braiding of the clinton foundation with hillary s state department bill tried to augment hillary s sparse vision talking about how she would be the right pilot for the ride to america s future in the greatest country on earth we have always been about tomorrow 42 said urging america to choose hillary as 45 in other words as donald trump tries to drag us back to the past and to the clintons past don t stop thinking about tomorrow maureen dowd is an op ed columnist for the times fox news host bill o reilly on tuesday responded to michelle obama s speech at the democratic national convention where she said i wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves philadelphia if the media won t come to you you go to them supporters of senator bernie sanders marched out of the wells fargo center on tuesday evening after a roll call vote among delegates officially awarded hillary clinton the democratic party s nomination vermont cast its votes last and mr sanders smiled tearfully as the room applauded his effort in the democratic primary it was mr sanders s latest show of graciousness in conceding the nomination to mrs clinton but for his most die hard supporters in the audience that was not an acceptable end to his time as a presidential candidate walk out on the dnc and corporate politics a neon green flyer distributed to the delegates read all participating delegates to walk out as one group mr sanders s supporters marched to the huge media tents most of the protesters were silent and some wore duct tape over their mouths as a sign of them being silenced by the democratic national committee they walked into the media filing tent and were immediately mobbed by reporters they held up handmade signs dnc you re fired this is what a stolen election looks like the democratic party just elected donald trump some used the hashtag demexit a reference to brexit kimberly tucker a virginia delegate for mr sanders said she can t support mrs clinton because i m not sure that she actually won she said that while other die hard supporters of mr sanders s had been talking about leaving the democratic party she intended to stay i know a lot of people took their things and they re leaving and i stand in solidarity with them she said we also need to have democrats that stay and force change from within and that s what i m doing rashane hamby a young sanders delegate from kansas said she hopes mr sanders s supporters will keep working on the movement at a local level after the cameras are gone the thing is with hillary clinton i don t know who she is donald trump shows me who he is each and every day hillary clinton switches her position depending on who she s talking to she said i m not with black lives matter but i know that my son s life matters and if hillary is in office she needs to know that she will be held accountable and that s why i m here ms hamby who is black said she is frustrated with both mrs clinton and president bill clinton s response to black lives matter protesters and said she wished other people in the black community demanded more from them we give our vote away each and every presidential election hoping that the person that spoke to the most churches will do something for us senator sanders was the only person who handed his microphone over and allowed black lives matter to use his platform she said that really changed me chris pumpelly another young sanders delegate from kansas took a more pragmatic approach bernie sanders didn t win the nomination and he just told us that we need to be supporting the democratic party and the most progressive platform that this party has ever seen that s what i m doing he said some of my friends disagree with supporting the party up and down the ticket i understand that but i see donald trump as an existential threat to the world susan eacker an ohio delegate for mr sanders said she didn t know about the walkout until just before it took place tell bernie we said sorry we rained on his parade but he taught us too well she said if he was younger he d be doing the same thing emma roller emmaroller a former reporter for national journal is a contributing opinion writer philadelphia oh remember those simple days when bizarre utterances disqualified a candidate in his convention speech howard dean the former presidential candidate and governor of vermont just reminded us of those times when he reprised the dean scream the call to arms he yelped after the iowa caucuses in 2004 it effectively halted his presidential run that year and all but ended his electoral career closing out his speech tonight mr dean threw back his head and yelled in colorado and iowa and north carolina and michigan and florida and ohio and pennsylvania and then we re going all the way to washington d c yargh then walked off the stage laughing probably to tweet something elizabeth williamson is an editorial board member of the new york times if you judge by america s ugly raucous invigorating and inspiring political history it s clear that the chairwoman of the democratic national committee debbie wasserman schultz just lost her job for doing it politicians are not popes the leader of the d n c must be a tough pol more rahm emanuel than barack obama good leaders protect their party s interest fiercely as wasserman schultz did in opposing a candidate who spent decades boasting of his disdain for her party the first formidable d n c chairman august belmont raised the job s profile after the civil war by actively soliciting presidential nominees including chief justice salmon p chase in 1868 that effort failed because chase supported giving black men the vote when most of the party remained racist belmont understood that despite the impressive title american party leaders often play politics without power nationally presidential and congressional sensibilities dominated locally party bosses like william m tweed in the 19th century and mayor richard daley in the 20th wielded far more power than any party chairman ever did today with primaries empowering party members not bosses d n c chairs are supposed to be neutral but few pull it off in 1976 robert strauss managed it staying neutral and focusing on unifying democrats once the surprise nominee jimmy carter emerged four years later strauss s successor john c white was part of the awkward democratic convention finale when he failed to get the insurgent ted kennedy to give jimmy carter the unity photo he sought in 1984 charles manatt was so evenhanded as chairman that the nominee walter mondale tried to dump him right before the convention more typical was the bias of d n c chairman paul kirk jr who supported michael dukakis in 1988 the insurgent back then jesse jackson wanted the superdelegates votes distributed based on the percentage of primary votes each candidate won jackson s idea undermined the superdelegate s role as a party oriented ballast kirk defended the superdelegates autonomy while professing neutrality in the contest kirk s masquerade was so feeble that after dukakis won the wisconsin primary one reporter wrote that kirk was careful to say that relief was not how he would characterize his own feelings but he praised mr dukakis s effort the most successful recent d n c chairmen have been passionate partisans like ronald brown and terry mcauliffe both big bill clinton fans in 2008 howard dean trying to preserve his grass roots 50 state strategy was better at balancing between hillary clinton and barack obama the 19th century humorist finley peter dunne famously insisted that politics ain t beanbag no matter how cynical americans appear to be about politicians their continuing immature illusion politics should be lofty and pure triggers outrage whenever we or wikileaks peek behind the curtain and uncover its essential ugliness and roughness let s stop pretending and welcome the mess even the emails speculating about trying to exploit bernie sanders s supposed atheism make sense politicians drill down on these perceived weaknesses because many voters care about them both parties need leaders who will defend partisan interests vigorously and assess the political environment honestly as debbie wasserman schultz did repeatedly her successor will make similar moves or she will fail her party philadelphia the slow motion withdrawal of bernie sanders and his increasingly obnoxious bernie or busters was not actually the first clenched teeth confrontation between a losing leftie and a winning clinton in 1992 jerry brown refused to withdraw from contention despite the fact that bill clinton had beaten him by a huge margin governor clinton retaliated by denying brown a speaking slot on the podium that year and brown had to resort to seconding his own nomination in order to speak at the convention in new york twenty four years later brown enthusiastically cast the majority of his state s 551 votes for hillary clinton today while sanders grimaced from his perch in the v i p section of the wells fargo arena in philadelphia sanders went into the convention with more than three times as many delegates as brown won in 1992 1 831 for sanders 596 for brown and he earned his prime time speaking slot on monday but he seems to have lost control of his own cult of personality his own followers booed him in philadelphia on monday when he suggested that they might actually want to support clinton to avoid having donald trump in the white house it may be too late for sanders to tame his following now but that problem is largely of his own making sanders took far too long to concede that he lost the nomination race and his endorsement speech for clinton was a case study in churlishness he talked mostly about himself and encouraged his supporters to go on fighting when he took the stage at the convention on monday night he didn t do much better sanders belted out something like his usual stump speech taking about 14 minutes to even mention the words hillary clinton he did praise clinton s position on big issues but gave the impression that he mostly wanted to take credit for getting her to agree with him it is no secret that hillary clinton and i disagree on a number of issues he said and added but i am happy to tell you that at the democratic platform committee there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns the platform seriously the last time any candidate mentions the platform is on the day it is adopted the job sanders had to do was to get his followers to realize that if they stay home on election day they will be helping trump especially the young ones who tend not to vote in large numbers anyway he said it sort of in the middle of his long speech if you don t believe this election is important if you think you can sit it out take a moment to think about the supreme court justices that donald trump would nominate and what that would mean to civil liberties equal rights and the future of our country he said then he skated on to talk about all the people he met during the primary campaign who really loved him then sanders forced the convention to go through a long tedious roll call vote on the convention floor today eight years after clinton interrupted the 2008 roll call and moved to nominate barack obama by acclamation perhaps sanders was too worried that his supporters would riot if he did something like that or maybe he s just too cranky in any case sanders waited until the very end of the long roll call when even his own state had voted to move that the official record show that clinton won by acclamation exit bernie sanders stage left andrew rosenthal is an op ed columnist for the times philadelphia i talked to john hickenlooper colorado governor recent veep contender and new memoirist the opposite of woe monday night on his way to a midnight visit at a music venue in philadelphia called the electric factory he had quite a yarn to offer about a prior visit there when he was a shy teenager it was 1969 i lived in philly i was going to haverford high school and my 24 year old brother sydney was alarmed at my lack of dating he was the one who introduced me to things that were temptations he went to wesleyan same school i went to he got a master s in urban planning but he never used it he became an automobile mechanic in berkeley in 1973 my dad died when i was a kid i had just turned 8 but he d been sick for two and a half years he had intestinal cancer anyway my brother raised me to a large extent he was seven years older and he knew what was hip he decided he was going to set up a double date so he asked which girls i knew and he stood beside me while i made the phone call and then i had a list of like six conversation topics so i wouldn t run out of things to talk about with this girl i hardly knew sherry lefevre and he said you gotta come see this band they re really good so he got the tickets and we went down to the electric factory flea market to see a band called big brother and the holding company with janis joplin well i didn t know who she was but i immediately went and bought the record so we did double date and the four of us went down together and in those days south street was pretty funky they didn t have a green room so the musicians all the instruments were on the stage but they stepped through the crowd and we were all sitting cross legged on the floor of this big concrete warehouse and janis joplin steps right over me and she pauses to say something to someone and she had a paisley skirt on a full length paisley skirt and she was just stopped there and i wanted to see if it was silk or cotton and i just touched it and she looked at me and went down boy i was 17 i didn t know what to do so then they played an amazing set it was just when the record cheap thrills came out and it had that song down on me that was their closer it was just a kick ass maureen dowd is an op ed columnist for the times philadelphia elizabeth warren the liberal massachusetts senator gave an impassioned speech on monday night making the progressive case to vote for hillary clinton on tuesday in a convention center ballroom the senator made a pitch to fundamentally shake up american politics and she did it in a powerpoint presentation once a teacher always a teacher said ms warren a former harvard law professor the event did feel like a lecture at a liberal arts college though students don t usually applaud their professors at the end the crowd of about 300 was united in its knowledge of government issued abbreviations people applauded ms warren s mentions of the f d i c the c f p b n d e a loans and darpa the slide show featured vintage photos of ms warren mixed in with sleek graphics about the shrinking of the middle class in the last 50 years things were not perfect she said citing the racism sexism and homophobia of past eras but over time we were bending in the right direction and these government investments in education in infrastructure in research let us turn our hard work into real success she then launched into a point by point indictment of trickle down economics offshore tax havens predatory lending corporate loopholes and the corrupting influence of money in politics this was far from a political attack on donald j trump though she has proven adept at going after the republican nominee instead she gave the warren wing of the party a mini dissertation on the roots of economic inequality and what she thinks the government should do to fix it after a night of political theatrics she seemed eager to get and get back to the wonky discussions she made a name for herself with as ms warren said that spending on direct lobbying has increased sevenfold since 1983 a slide showed the capitol getting showered in gold coins another graphic demonstrating income inequality showed a scale with a boston red sox baseball cap representing the bottom 90 percent of earners on the lower end and a top hat representing the top 10 percent at the higher end per professor warren in 1980 90 percent of americans got 70 percent of all new wealth generated in 2016 the same share of americans received less than 1 percent of the new wealth generated the points ms warren was making on tuesday were not exactly chant worthy close corporate tax loopholes to strengthen the social safety net doesn t quite work in a megaphone but it was clear that she was testing a message on her devoted following like a standup comedian trying out new material in a friendly room she ended her speech by telling attendees to demand four things of the people they vote for that they work to overturn the supreme court s citizens united decision increase wall street regulation raise taxes on the top 10 percent of earners and increase funding for welfare programs in the middle of her presentation ms warren argued for closing a tax loophole related to executive bonuses saying it would bring in 55 billion in 10 years but she could barely get the word loophole out of her mouth before a man in the audience started clapping in agreement all i can say is you re my kind of guy she said philadelphia in presidential election after presidential election republicans have presented themselves as the champions of family values which is their synonym for a certain kind of traditionalism and religiosity and they often chose a nominee who wore that label well that was certainly the case in 2012 with mitt romney it s not with donald trump he has been married three times he made much of his money from casinos his lifestyle connotes showy materialism and hedonism and he has a history of inflammatory remarks including sexually blunt ones that objectify women his perch is not exactly the peak of walton s mountain and that may allow for some new positioning by democrats as michelle obama s speech to the democratic national convention made clear her message was squarely directed at american parents it specifically concerned their kids while it never mentioned trump by name it definitely asked what kind of example he d set unmistakably advancing the idea that he d be a threat to any family trying to instill certain values decency empathy politeness in children watch and listen for other democrats and for the clinton campaign to continue taking this tack right near the start of her speech the first lady described the challenges of getting her own children to ignore those who question their father s citizenship to hold on to their dignity when someone is cruel or acts like a bully and to disregard the hateful language they hear from public figures on tv is it possible that she had trump in mind with every word we utter with every action we take we know our kids are watching us she said of herself and the president we as parents are their most important role models and let me tell you barack and i take that same approach to our jobs as president and first lady because we know that our words and actions matter not just to our girls but the children across this country kids who tell us i saw you on tv i wrote a report on you for school she added that the americans who go to the polls on nov 8 aren t just choosing a democrat or a republican but the person with the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives her approach echoed the one taken in a television commercial released about two weeks ago by the clinton campaign it shows children watching some of trump s lewdest and crudest public remarks including his boast that he could shoot someone on a busy manhattan thoroughfare and his supporters wouldn t care and poses the question what example will we set for them it s aimed at a group of voters who have favored republican presidential candidates but in the eyes of many democrats could be pried away from trump the crassness of some of his commentary has potentially opened up an opportunity for democrats to be the family friendly party for a specific cohort of voters in particular suburban mothers with kids said chris lehane a prominent democratic strategist he noted that in 2012 romney won among married women in general and among women in the suburbs in particular kathleen rice a democratic congresswoman from the long island suburbs of new york city framed trump s liability and democrats opportunity this way you can t be the party of family values if the values you re teaching your kids are hate and bigotry i don t think that s lost on any parents in this country she told me democrats have the opportunity to regain the ground on the long told political falsehood that republicans are the party of family values the complaint about trump as an awful role model extends beyond the political arena to children s welfare organizations jim steyer the founder and chief executive of common sense media a children s advocacy group that monitors the media that kids are exposed to has spoken out about the bad language they re hearing and the terrible behavior they re seeing in the 2016 campaign trump hasn t exactly surrendered the mantle of dutiful loyal family man four of his five children spoke at the republican national convention praising him as a terrific father and demonstrating obvious affection and respect for him and he has drawn fresh attention to bill clinton s infidelities reminding americans that the clintons as a family have known plenty of mess themselves but democrats remain confident that if the election is about which politician children can and should look up to hillary clinton has the edge in a june poll by bloomberg politics 54 percent of respondents said that she d be a good role model for children only 25 percent said that about trump frank bruni is an op ed columnist for the times connie schultz in a room for debate forum on whether the role of first spouse should change why are politicians families so much more appealing than politicians especially at party conventions the trump children shone last week like beams in a storm tiffany adorable donald trump jr enthusiastic and ivanka trump as polished and upbeat as a corporate recruiter if about as credible melania trump added elegance to the proceedings until she disgraced herself and then there was michelle obama who soothed the agitated uplifted the fearful and gently pointed out our duty to unite in the face of the enemy all with the steady warmth expected of a mom in chief when you compare the united states with constitutional monarchies you see that the president combines the roles of prime minister and king this is a political theory clich not an original observation presidents rule executively through the formal channels of power and they rule symbolically embodying the human qualities we hope to perceive in our bureaucratic state strength fatherliness charisma but americans don t want their presidents to be too monarchical and besides kings are foolish things in fairy tales they re background figures if not comic foils clumsy gullible misled by self serving advisers it s the quick witted family members we care about the princesses princes and queens and so the nominees families make for great tv and telling tv maybe the trump clan moved center stage at the convention because the republican party elders bowed out but the delegates loved it enthusing to reporters about ivanka and donald jr as if they were kardashians and what a kardashian move for ivanka to flog her convention dress and shoes on her website the next day the trumps prominence also communicated an important message that donald j trump runs his business tribally nepotistically allocating power according to kinship rather than merit also that he s not just a man he s a corporate entity rule by mr trump will be rule by the trump organization whose day to day responsibilities fall more on the children than on the chief i don t think ivanka trump was lying when she attributed family friendly policies to her father that he has never endorsed himself i think she believes she can talk him into them because she s always been his brain trust and he s never been a detail man and she s daddy s girl none of this is unique to mr trump the clintons are also a family business also a reality show also a fairy tale a deconstructed feminist fairy tale the queen stands poised to take the reins of power the once great king verges on buffoonery the princess s role is uncertain but her young motherhood will surely be put to good political use it s a great story i can t wait to see what happens tonight judith shulevitz judithshulevitz is the author of the sabbath world glimpses of a different order of time and a contributing opinion writer at various boo spattered moments throughout yesterday s proceedings both puckish conservatives and fretful liberals began wondering if the democratic party could end up having a more chaotic convention than the party of trump did in cleveland more disrupted more divided with more overt hostility to the nominee but even amid the heckling from bernie sanders s die hards what s striking about the democratic party s problems is how normal they seem compared with what s happened to the republicans yes the sanders insurgency may betoken future divisions that ultimately split the democratic coalition but for today in this election cycle it has reached a very typical sort of endgame characteristic of right wing and left wing primary challenges alike his campaign clearly shifted the party and its nominee leftward albeit not as far as his more zealous partisans had hoped now he has endorsed the nominee and called for unity like bill bradley in 2000 or jesse jackson in 1988 or pat buchanan in 1992 the only question is whether a minority of a minority of his supporters might vote for jill stein or gary johnson or just stay home of course the democrats would rather that minority of a minority were firmly in their tent but having a loosely attached fringe is a very normal political situation see for instance the ron paulistas in the g o p in 2008 and 2012 and so is the democratic national committee s collusive response to this fringe s champion which our dear friends in russia may have oh so helpfully exposed there was schadenfreude from the beleaguered folks in the republican national committee as they watched debbie wasserman schultz twist in the wind this week but schultz went down in part for doing the kind of very normal thing that they so egregiously failed to do steering the party s nomination away from the candidate of a passionate plurality and toward the candidate who for all her many flaws is closer to the party s center its consensus and mainstream in other words schultz lost her job but kept her party reince priebus kept his job but let a hostile takeover happen on his watch and because the democrats didn t endure such a takeover the major evening speeches which is all that most nonpolitical junkies see should be unifying events in a way that nothing at the g o p s trump week could match instead of melania trump s plagiarism michelle obama s eloquence instead of ted cruz s defiance bill clinton s honeyed sales pitch instead of the party s past presidents and nominees as no shows a president with 50 plus approval ratings blessing his would be successor if there is a peril for democrats here then it probably lies not in any possible disruptions but in this week s very normalcy the expectedness of what s unfolding in prime time these four nights because trump s whole appeal is premised on the idea that our elites think things are under control when they actually are not and his only path to victory is as a coalition scrambling both parties upending force and what this convention is showcasing is a democratic party that s fully prepared to beat him under the normal rules of politics but is not necessarily ready to adapt if events go wildly off that script philadelphia michelle obama s speech here on monday night was so powerful because she spoke as a symbol of the progress that america has made because she spoke as a mother because she spoke from the heart and because she spoke gorgeously her rhythm flawless her passion unmistakable but there s yet another reason she was so raptly heard and rapturously received she didn t speak as a politician she wasn t advancing a personal agenda or at least didn t seem to be more on that in a bit she wasn t teeing herself up for some conquest of her own there was no clear cut ambition in the equation as there was for almost every other speaker on monday night and as there is for most of the people who take the stage at a convention that s why it s so funny that some people immediately and inevitably responded to her remarks by saying that she should run for office the utter absence of signs that she plans to is precisely what gives her much of her power and the day after she announced any such candidacy she d almost definitely see her popularity start to decline and the good will that currently greets her begin to ebb just ask hillary clinton as she stepped down from her position as the secretary of state and in the year afterward a significant majority of americans liked and respected her as easy as that is to forget now according to the pew research center 65 percent of americans viewed her favorably in december 2012 56 percent in october 2013 and 58 percent in august 2014 that was down to 43 percent by last august which was about four months after she declared her presidential bid yes her rosy period of above 50 ratings came before the revelation of her use of a private email server and her initial clumsy attempts to shrug the whole thing off yes it was before republicans intensified their chant of benghazi benghazi benghazi and refocused their fire on her in other ways yes it was before a bruising democratic primary battle in which bernie sanders painted her as a compromised tool of corporate interests but her popularity during that period had as much to do with the fact that she wasn t in the news every day being forced to render opinions and stake out positions and she wasn t making any self serving requests of americans a campaign may be framed and pitched in terms of public service and patriotism but it also comes across as precisely such a self serving request clinton s path from first lady to senator secretary of state and now democratic presidential nominee guaranteed that there d be speculation about michelle obama s political future but obama s own actions have done nothing to encourage that guessing she has consistently signaled profound reservations verging on regret about life in the fishbowl of political office and that came through anew in her remarks on monday night when she described her daughters transition eight years ago to a new life with a secret service detail in washington when they set off for their first day at their new school i will never forget that winter morning as i watched our girls just 7 and 10 years old pile into those black s u v s with all those big men with guns she said and i saw their little faces pressed up against the window and the only thing i could think was what have we done she cited concern for her children when she addressed her future plans in a speech at the south by southwest festival in austin tex in march i will not run for president she said no nope not going to do it she added that while she intended to use her stature to effect change she ideally wanted to do that in a nonpartisan fashion and impact as many people as possible in an unbiased way that s not to say that she herself is unbiased or that the sentiments she expressed in her convention remarks were she has skin in this game clinton s election would reflect well on the obama years and burnish her husband s legacy while the opposite outcome would tell a story about our country that she cannot want to believe but on monday night with personal ambition out of the equation she was able to speak and be heard principally as a concerned american not a self concerned pol she had a special kind of megaphone and she took full captivating advantage of it kate andersen brower in an op ed article bill clinton a perfectly imperfect first gentleman i remember the summer of 2012 during a family barbecue i watched as my two nieces one black one white played in our yard they were kindergartners then and had just learned how to high five with each successful slap of their palms one would yell out we re superheroes and the other would respond just like michelle obama just like the president s wife i am sure i m not the only person who has a sappy story like this about children s love for the first lady indeed last night when she took the stage at the democratic national convention in philadelphia she was preceded by a video montage intercut with children explaining what she means to them my cynical heart wanted to dismiss this as political theater but i still cried a bit when a boy looked into the camera and said that he grew up without his mom and the first lady is someone we could look up to and then there she was the actual first lady not a montage as she spoke the auditorium fell silent for the first time that night with every word we utter with every action we take we know our kids are watching us she said and let me tell you barack and i take that same approach to our jobs as president and first lady because we know that our words and actions matter not just to our girls but the children across this country kids who tell us i saw you on tv i wrote a report on you for school like many women i imagine sometimes when i m online i will find myself looking at pictures of michelle obama and her family i admire their clothes and their poise and their effortlessness when i m depressed or stressed about something i rewatch her billy on the street appearance to make me laugh i reread an interview with toni morrison in which she says michelle is the biggest brain in the country i imagine what that must be like to be that smart to be that emotionally attuned and always aware of our gaze i watch her with avid eyes and even as i do i am afraid of my own avidity of all of ours these past eight years has been a time of watching her with my heart in my throat i read the news and i am afraid of how quickly in this country admiration especially for women especially for women with big brains and hearts especially for black women who have both how quickly admiration can curdle into ridicule it is a fine fine line to walk i watched hillary clinton walk a version of it when i was young i thought a first lady who quotes african proverbs who says it takes a village has to understand me and the struggles of my family and then i became as the years went by disillusioned twenty four years ago i was so unabashedly excited for mrs clinton to be first lady that my sisters and i stayed up late to watch her at the convention we made a hillary clinton button for our cat i don t know that as an adult i will recapture that kind of blind devotion to a public figure and i would argue that s what growing older and asking questions is all about but mrs obama somehow is different i watched her stand on stage i think she s in body armor a friend posted to facebook and saw how underneath the glare of the lights she didn t blink that is the story of this country she said the story that has brought me to this stage tonight the story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage the shame of servitude the sting of segregation but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today i wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves she said this line knowing it would be dissected and pilloried by many the next morning but she said it calmly knowing it was the truth i think that s why some of us watch her so closely we want to figure out how to get to where she stands kaitlyn greenidge is the author of the novel we love you charlie freeman for at least a decade the democrats have been acting like the more mature reality based political party they have avoided damaging congressional primaries that give away winnable seats and tear down their own stars they have not engaged in big silly conspiracy theories about say skewed polls or global warming they have been willing to compromise to advance their cause the party has much to show for it a health care expansion that had eluded the country for decades l g b t rights victories that came faster than once seemed fathomable the first serious attacks against climate change a slew of new taxes on the top 1 percent and the prospect of the most liberal supreme court in a generation the start of the democratic convention offers reason to wonder whether the party is in the early stages of a new phase a self defeating phase in which a large segment of liberals would rather lose than compromise let s be clear the hecklers in philadelphia are doing donald j trump s work they are his allies no matter how much they may believe otherwise and no matter how honest their passion their attempts to inject chaos into the convention will undermine the single best opportunity that hillary clinton has to make her case to voters whatever their motives the bernie or busters are actually working to keep citizens united as the law of the land they are working to cut taxes on the rich they are working to take health insurance away from families that have only recently received it they are working for big coal and against the climate they are doing the bidding of a candidate who has demeaned prisoners of war and the disabled described mexicans as rapists referred to women as barnyard animals called for banning muslims from entering the country and cozied up to russia s authoritarian president no doubt many of the protesters come to their anger in good faith and are expressing it productively and no doubt others are mostly interested in calling attention to themselves or in fact support mr trump maybe he wouldn t be so bad one small business owner at a pro sanders rally on monday said they are angry about inequality and about a nominating process in which the democratic establishment sided with clinton but there is nothing new about a party establishment backing the favorite john mccain gary hart jerry brown and even barack obama all had occasions to resent their party s establishment this year the race was simply not close enough to be decided by party maneuvering mrs clinton beat bernie sanders by 3 8 million votes a whopping 57 percent to 43 percent margin let me be clear symone d sanders a top campaign aide but no relation to mr sanders tweeted yesterday no one stole this election team sanders we did amazing work but we lost it s a hard reality for some in other ways of course team sanders won it moved mrs clinton s position to the left on trade the minimum wage and college financing the sanders campaign transformed the political landscape ms sanders proudly noted in another tweet yesterday when bill clinton speaks tonight i expect he ll present an especially striking embodiment of the party s leftward shift there is still plenty of work for sanders supporters to do they can pressure mrs clinton to hold fast to her campaign positions they can identify and campaign for candidates who believe in a more radical liberalism than the clintons or the obamas and they can do everything within their power to prevent a trump presidency a presidency with the potential to be more damaging to the country than any in our lifetimes if democrats need a reminder of the importance of principled compromise they need look back only 16 years then a few million voters decided that al gore was no different from george w bush and voted for ralph nader instead those votes made it possible for mr bush to win the white house how d that work out for the liberal cause david leonhardt who will begin an op ed column later this year is writing a daily opinion post during the conventions philadelphia having served as australia s first female prime minister i often get asked for advice by bright young women interested in politics what sustains someone through the rigors of modern politics i tell them are passion and purpose knowing what you want to achieve for your nation and the world then i tell them to build a sense of self that can survive all the ugly sniping this week at the democratic national convention where i participated in a forum on women and leadership i ve been asked what advice i d have for hillary clinton as she seeks to become her nation s first female leader i m not egotistical enough to think that the most qualified and prepared presidential candidate the united states has ever seen needs my advice on policy and she needs no lectures on sustaining a sense of self when under news media scrutiny or attack by her rivals few politicians have shown more resilience than mrs clinton but even someone of her vast experience has been buffeted by what i call the curious question of gender she knows what it s like to be the subject of the stereotype that a powerful woman cannot be likable that if she is commanding then she must be incapable of empathy if a female candidate notes the sexism of all this she is told as mrs clinton has that she s playing the woman card or is fragile or a whiner mrs clinton should not have to deal with this alone every democrat every republican every person who believes that women and men are equal should call out any sexism when i was prime minister i created a carbon emissions trading program the debate grew vicious with the leader of the opposition attending a protest next to signs that described me as a witch and a bitch no one called for my execution by firing squad as a supporter of donald trump did for mrs clinton but a radio talk show host did say i should be put in a bag and dropped in the sea witches can t be drowned i cynically joked i have often reflected how powerful it would have been if at that moment a male business leader especially one who opposed my policies said i may not support the prime minister politically but australia must not conduct its democratic debates this way unfortunately that never happened to my dismay some of the young women who chat with me are not asking for political insights instead they tell me that having seen how i was treated they have decided politics is too punishing for them i always try to talk them out of this position sometimes i succeed in 2016 i hope there are many brave voices naming and shaming any sexism in the presidential contest the next generation of potential female leaders is watching julia gillard was the prime minister of australia from 2010 to 2013 columnist david brooks and editorial board writer elizabeth williamson discussed bernie sanders michelle obama and what s to come advertisement
