advertisement supported by progressive and conservative lawmakers are increasingly pushing for the government to guarantee workers incomes signaling how profoundly the economic debate has shifted during the pandemic by catie edmondson washington one of the most progressive lawmakers in the house and one of the most conservative in the senate staring down a pandemic driven unemployment rate at its highest level since the great depression have come to the same conclusion it s time for the federal government to cover workers salaries as congress prepares to wage a new battle over how to best aid workers and businesses devastated by the coronavirus crisis representative pramila jayapal democrat of washington and a leader of the congressional progressive caucus and senator josh hawley republican of missouri and a rising conservative star are both making the case to their parties leaders that guaranteed income programs should be part of the federal relief effort we have a situation where people and families in every part of the country are facing this unprecedented crisis and they are looking for relief ms jayapal said in an interview they are looking for certainty and they are looking for a policy response that matches the scale of the crisis this is a proposal with broad support that should be taken seriously she added what are we waiting for are we waiting for unemployment to reach 50 percent ms jayapal s paycheck guarantee program was spotlighted this week after progressive leaders angry that the plan was omitted from house democrats sprawling 3 trillion pandemic relief proposal urged their members to officially inform party leaders that they were undecided on the bill effectively threatening to block it by wednesday progressive groups including indivisible and moveon signaled their support for the legislation even without the paycheck measure it was on track to pass the house on friday but the revolt reflected the divide among democrats over how far to go during an extraordinary economic crisis in building a government backstop for workers livelihoods and support for such ideas on both ends of the ideological spectrum signals how far the political debate has shifted in just a few months the former presidential candidate andrew yang raised eyebrows last year on the campaign trail with what at the time seemed like an unconventional proposal to give every american adult a 1 000 a month universal basic income but by march when congress approved the last major round of coronavirus relief republicans and democrats had come around to the idea of direct payments embracing 1 200 checks for individuals that president trump insisted be emblazoned with his signature house democratic leaders have included a second round of those checks in the relief bill they plan to push through on friday but many of their rank and file members want to go much further ms jayapal s bill would cover salaries and benefits for workers making up to 90 000 for as long as six months allowing businesses to rehire furloughed and laid off employees and distribute grants to businesses to cover operating costs it would cost 654 billion over six months and benefit more than 36 million workers according to an analysis by moody s prepared for her office a similar measure was introduced in the senate by senator bernie sanders the vermont independent and one of the most progressive members of congress along with senators doug jones of alabama and mark warner of virginia both centrist democrats supporters of the plan which include labor leaders like richard trumka the afl cio president and janet yellen the former chairwoman of the federal reserve argue that it would allow businesses to rehire workers to keep them on their employer based insurance plans amid unemployment insurance backlogs they argue that the second round of 1 200 checks is insufficient to address the seriousness of the crisis and that the cost would be less than the 669 billion that has already been allocated in grants to businesses the effort comes at a time when the idea of creating a temporary government backstop to help workers weather the pandemic has gained traction among lawmakers and economists around the world the british government announced in march that it would pay up to 80 percent of wages for workers furloughed as a result of the pandemic and the spanish government unveiled a plan to permanently provide low income citizens with cash payments we re all overwhelmed by the current crisis said matt zwolinski the director of the university of san diego s center for ethics economics and public policy part of what it means to be overwhelmed is that a lot of the standard objections that people have had to large government transfer programs have been swamped by considerations of the great need that has to be met quite urgently representative steny h hoyer democrat of maryland and the majority leader told reporters on tuesday that both he and ms pelosi believe the proposal has great merit to it this is not going to be the last word nor the final word as we move forward mr hoyer told reporters on tuesday of the 3 trillion relief package unveiled this week ms jayapal s proposal he added is certainly under great discussion speaker nancy pelosi has been publicly lukewarm on the idea while acknowledging last month in an interview with msnbc that we may have to think in terms of some different ways to put money in people s pockets let s see what works what is operational and what needs other attention she said others have suggested a minimum income a guaranteed income for people is that worthy of attention now perhaps so the measure has received an even chillier reception from republican leaders representative steve scalise of louisiana the minority whip called guaranteed income a radical socialist idea and said congress should focus on carrying out the relief packages that already passed echoing an argument that senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader has taken up in recent days but the idea has gained currency with some in mr mcconnell s fold mr hawley the missouri republican has introduced a similar proposal mirroring the british government s plan that would cover 80 percent of employers payroll costs up to the median wage about 49 000 a year that proposal appeared to gain traction on thursday when senator cory gardner republican of colorado one of the most politically endangered in the conference threw his support behind the measure another bill that mr hawley introduced in march goes further providing families and single parents making less than 100 000 with a monthly check for the duration of the crisis let s not overthink this mr hawley said in unveiling his bill these families need relief now to pay bills that are coming due make those emergency grocery runs and get ready for potential medical bills let s get it to them other conservative lawmakers including representative justin amash independent of michigan and a libertarian has also backed direct payments to americans the best thing we could have done is get universal monthly cash relief to the people he wrote on twitter mr amash voted against the 2 2 trillion stimulus package enacted in march which included hundreds of billions of dollars worth of business relief programs and an enormous expansion of jobless aid the package was inefficient and fundamentally flawed he wrote on twitter this direct aid to their employees would have more quickly and effectively supported those small businesses that need the most help and are being left behind by the convoluted relief package nicholas fandos contributed reporting advertisement
