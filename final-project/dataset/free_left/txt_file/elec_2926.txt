meaning come in third in iowa second in new hampshire and first in south carolina now rubio seems to have tweaked the formula to something more like 3 5 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 for some reason this still makes rubio the prohibitive favorite according to some of our prognosticators the florida senator has recently picked up establishment backers including bob dole and tim pawlenty and important new donors several of them availed from the wreckage of the jeb bush campaign many forecasters now speak of a two man race between him and donald trump don t you see why nationally rubio polls at 16 percent so all he now has to do is knock out ted cruz and win texas and all of its 155 delegates and then crush john kasich to make room for ohio 66 delegates all for the glory of going head to head with trump the candidate of 10 000 flame throwers at which point primary voters across the nation would throw over trump vaulting rubio from third place to first erasing the huge delegate deficit rubio will face after super tuesday it s that simple maybe you re skeptical maybe i m skeptical maybe marco rubio is skeptical hypothetically though we can flesh out a case for how rubio wins how he converts a strategy of second third fourth and fifth place finishes into political triumph here are three main factors to consider from the ephemeral to the arithmetic no one should deny that rubio is a skilled politician who delivers good stump speeches and speaks clearly there s also a sweetness to him that seems hard to fake hard i say but not impossible when rubio refers to commercials making fun of his boots or admits he did not do well in the debate or contrasts himself to a petulant trump and cruz by saying don t worry i m not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me he s hard to hate his kids are adorable best of all rubio seems sincere even when telling a lie while cruz seems mendacious even when telling the truth i ll note in passing that it s an unfair world to ted cruz and yet cruz deserves it mull that paradox if you like rubio s appealing manner has earned him the label of moderate which is mostly a benefit because even primary voters who are tepid toward rubio might be persuaded to vote for him so the theory goes if they think you might vote for him too for what it s worth the same great thinking went into nominating john kerry to be sure however rubio isn t what most of us democrat or republican would call moderate his core portfolio of policies more force abroad more immigration at home bigger tax cuts less government subsidized health care lower social security payments has the support of oh maybe eight or nine ordinary voters but g o p washington and k street love it rubio is a fine new wrapping in which to present the same old butter cookies if anyone can prevent the g o p from having to offer anything other than a new face it s him rubio s greatest strength may be a steady detachment from consistency or words as most of us understand them he s not wedded to what most would call truth or even to what he said yesterday let us continue to be cynical albeit not wrong for a moment candidates take in donations by signaling that they re partially just partially for sale they usually have some core convictions maybe on the place of faith in public life or the importance of free enterprise or universal health care and put the rest up for auction views on ethanol subsidies hedge fund taxation tort reform etc this isn t purely sleazy everyone has to raise money in order to run a campaign and most of us have issues we care about and others we don t but rubio stands out for having even fewer if any convictions that appear to be above monetary influence which makes him like a rare earth magnet for donor class bidders want him to change position on amnesty he ll say he never said he opposed amnesty merely blanket amnesty he ll publish an op ed in breitbart on wednesday and dismiss the site on saturday as not a credible source that we don t even credential with bush out of the way the candidate dubbed the malleable man of maneuver by pat buchanan even buchanan detractors must give him points for that phrase promises to attract torrents of money let s go to the map the next big day of voting is on march 1 also known as super tuesday when 12 states go to the polls presently trump leads in nine of those states cruz leads in two texas and arkansas and colorado last polled in november ben carson led is a mystery odds are good then that trump will take at least a third of the 595 delegates at stake and maybe closer to half if we project that rubio doubles his national average and takes a third of the vote and we must project such things to get him anywhere then he will be running a close second to trump with about 200 delegates to trump s 300 or so in the following week or two come another bunch of states including michigan where trump leads and kentucky kansas and louisiana where the polling is old and unreliable adding up to about 350 more delegates assuming trump stays in first place and rubio stays in second place perhaps the score would narrow to trump at 400 and rubio at 300 the big day is march 15 of course when some huge winner take all states come into play including florida missouri and ohio trump leads in ohio and john kasich the governor comes second trump also leads in florida with cruz coming in second rubio is polling at about 14 percent in his home state rubio s most realistic hope to win those contests assumes that trump sabotages himself kasich fades to nothing and cruz drops out otherwise trump handily grabs over 150 delegates from the winner take all contests and maybe a 100 more when the rest are split proportionally if rubio loses florida though and that looks entirely probable it s hard to see him soldiering on but wait the establishment really wants to crush trump and cruz too if possible that leaves one more option for a rubio victory and make no mistake it is the nuclear option if trump fails to secure 1 237 delegates then the nomination process goes into a brokered convention under this scenario the establishment would close ranks and shut down the rebellion once and for all insisting we ll all learn to love rubio rubio rejects this option i most certainly don t want party insiders deciding this he recently told jake tapper they didn t want me in the senate but one suspects that republican insiders would find a way to patch things up with the candidate and help him change his mind will any of these things happen let s just say and here i also disclose my conflict of interest that i stand to win 20 if rubio loses the nomination and lose 100 if rubio wins and that s from a 5 1 bet i made with my brother in law back in november so you can see how much faith i have in the man what s more i ve already spent that 20 in my mind you may say i m a dreamer but to judge by the g o p establishment s love of the candidate i m not the
