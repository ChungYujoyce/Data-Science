socially conservative former alabama chief justice one of the most controversial us politicians was removed from state supreme court post twice ben jacobs in montgomery wed 27 sep 2017 14 28bst first published on wed 27 sep 2017 02 30bst the former alabama judge roy moore one of the most controversial figures in republican politics is on course to become a us senator in spite of opposition from donald trump with 95 of the vote in on tuesday night moore the former chief justice of the alabama supreme court was ahead of appointed incumbent luther strange by 55 to 45 in the republican senate runoff moore s victory comes despite being outspent by a margin of 10 to 1 by strange who had been appointed in january to the seat vacated by jeff sessions after his confirmation as us attorney general in 2005 moore said homosexual conduct should be illegal inan interview televised on c span moore added it is immoral it is defined by the law as detestable during a debate in september 2017 he went out of his way to bemoan the fact that sodomy and sexual perversion sweep the land in a speech in february moore appeared tosuggest that the terrorist attacks of september 11were the result of divine retribution against the united states and prophesized in the book of isaiah in comments first reported by cnn moore quoted isaiah 30 12 13 saying because you have despised his word and trust in perverseness and oppression and say thereon therefore this iniquity will be to you as a breach ready to fall swell out in a high wall whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instance moore then noted sounds a little bit like the pentagon whose breaking came suddenly at an instance doesn t it he added if you think that s coincidence if you go to verse 25 there should be up on every high mountain and upon every hill rivers and streams of water in the day of the great slaughter when the towers will fall inan interview with the guardianin august moore praised putin for his views on gay rights maybe putin is right maybe he s more akin to me than i know the comments came after moore suggested the united states could be described as the focus of evil in the world because we promote a lot of bad things moore specifically named gay marriage as one of those bad things at a rally earlier in september moore talked about reds and yellows fighting while discussing racial division in the united states moore justified thison twitterby citing lyrics from the song jesus loves the little children he wrote red yellow black and white they are precious in his sight jesus loves the little children of the world this is the gospel in 2006 moore condemned a proposal for a national id system for animals as more identifiable with communism than free enterprise the proposal received attention after a cow in alabama had been diagnosed with mad cow disease moore who was then running for governor was skeptical that the outbreak was real instead moore suggested it was a ruse intended to promote the tracking system moore was previously twice removed as alabama s chief justice first for refusing to remove a monument to the ten commandments that he installed in the state courthouse and more recently for refusing to implement the us supreme court ruling legalizing gay marriage the result comes as a major blow to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell who had strongly backed strange a super pac closely linked to mcconnell spent over 9m on behalf of the incumbent who was considered a loyal supporter of the senate gop leadership however moore was able to turn mcconnell s opposition into an asset in his election eve rally in a barn in fairhope alabama the loudest applause came when moore declared mitch mcconnell needs to be replaced mcconnell said in a statement after the result senate republicans will be as committed to keeping alabama s seat in republican hands with roy moore as we were with luther strange he also noted that moore ran a spirited campaign centered a dissatisfaction with the progress made in washington moore s win will be embarrassing for trump who had endorsed strange and appeared with him in a huntsville rally on friday there trump expressed ardent support for the man he called big luther but left plenty of wiggle room as he mused on stage that perhaps he had made a mistake by endorsing strange trump also called moore a good man and pledged to campaign for him if he won the primary despite trump s opposition a number of fervent trump supporters and former white house staffers had backed moore these include former chief strategist steve bannon who told voters at a rally for moore that a vote for judge roy moore is a vote for donald j trump and housing and urban development secretary ben carson who issued a statement of praise for moore on friday the consequences are likely to be harder for mcconnell than for trump one bannon ally told the guardian on tuesday night that mitch mcconnell in a republican primary is now what nancy pelosi is in general elections for democrats after moore successfully used strange s support from the senate majority leader as an attack strange s defeat comes only hours after tennessee republican bob corker announced his retirement corker a relative moderate within the republican caucus had long been considered a target by bannon s populist wing of the gop bannon himself appeared on stage before moore in montgomery and celebrated corker s retirement so you all remembered we talked last night about starting a revolution with judge moore s victory well senator corker stepped down today and he s not going to run for re election announced bannon to loud applause he went on to say that this set the stage for more candidates who follow the model of judge moore and do not need to raise money from elites fat cats crony capitalists in washington dc and new york city to win in the future moore agreed with bannon that his victory presaged more primary challenges for republicans in 2018 i think it does he told the guardian i agree with that comment and i think mr bannon knows that that s coming and i think he has a good vision of it andy surabian the senior advisor to the great america alliance a pro trump superpac that backed moore saw the results as a precursor to further challenges to the republican establishment in the midterms the operative who helped orchestrate sarah palin s appearance on behalf of moore last week told the guardian that moore s win was the result of tea party type conservatives making further gains within the republican party this is the continuation of what we saw in 2010 said surabian in 2010 we saw rand paul and mike lee get elected in 2012 we saw ted cruz get elected in 2014 we saw dave brat get elected in 2016 we saw donald trump get elected now in 2017 we re seeing the rise of judge roy moore there s only going to be more donald trumps and roy moores coming in 2018 rand lee and cruz all spoke with moore on the phone on tuesday night with cruz the first of the three to talk to the newly minted republican nominee republicans quickly embraced moore a mcconnell allied superpac put out a concession statement before the associated press had called the race while we were honored to have fought hard for big luther judge roy moore won this nomination fair and square and he has our support as it is vital that we keep this seat in republican hands said the statement from the senate leadership fund trump himself tweeted congratulations to roy moore on his republican primary win in alabama luther strange started way back ran a good race roy win in nov the election however is in december as trump noted in a corrected tweet he added on wednesday morning spoke to roy moore of alabama last night for the first time sounds like a really great guy who ran a fantastic race he will help to maga make america great again his tweets supporting strange from the last two days disappeared from his account moore has a long history of controversial remarks most recently in march he praised the russian president to a guardian reporter saying maybe putin is right on gay marriage he went on to add of the russian autocrat maybe he s more akin to me than i know moore also warned in a televised debate on thursday that sodomy and sexual perversion sweep the land he also brandished a revolver on stage at a campaign rally on monday night to rebut charges that he was soft on gun rights strange was impeded by scandals of his own he was appointed by then governor robert bentley to the seat despite the fact that strange then alabama s attorney general was investigating him bentley has since resigned and pled guilty to two misdemeanors related to his cover up of an extramarital affair the result is that strange has been left under an ethical cloud that his campaign was unable to shake moore is considered an overwhelming favorite in the deep red state in december s general election against democrat doug jones however democrats do sense some opportunity because of moore s history of controversy in a statement jones took the first shot after years of embarrassing headlines about top public officials in this state this race is about the people of alabama and about choosing a candidate with character and integrity they can be proud of said jones i will never embarrass the people of alabama i am running so the people of alabama can be proud of their next senator trump s one criticism of moore in his appearance in alabama on friday was that moore had a very good chance of not winning a general election the former judge pushed back on this to the guardian on tuesday night i think he was misinformed about my chances the poll numbers show that i m far ahead right now
