had after conversations with government officials legislators and business executives during his time in moscow according to one person familiar with the contents of the message the email was read aloud during the closed door testimony the new details of the trip present a different picture than the account mr page has given during numerous appearances in the news media in recent months and are yet another example of a trump adviser meeting with russians officials during the 2016 campaign in multiple interviews with the new york times he had either denied meeting with any russian government officials during the july 2016 visit or sidestepped the question saying he met with mostly scholars mr page confirmed the meetings in an interview on friday evening but played down their significance i had a very brief hello to a couple of people that was it he said he said one of the people he met was a senior person but would not confirm the person s identity he confirmed that an email he had written to the campaign after that trip to moscow was presented to him during thursday s appearance before the house intelligence committee mr page acknowledged his meeting with russian government officials during sharp questioning by representative adam b schiff of california the top democrat on the committee according to a congressional official familiar with the exchange during another part of the testimony mr page was questioned about a trip to budapest although it was not immediately clear why mr page told the times earlier this year that he had taken that trip around labor day weekend last year but he said he had not met with any russians it was a short four day trip over a long holiday weekend at the end of the summer mr page said at the time i had a nice trip up the danube to the visegrad castle did a lot of sightseeing and went to a jazz club not much to report court records unsealed on monday revealed that another campaign adviser george papadopoulos met in 2016 with russians who said they had connections to the government and was told about dirt regarding hillary clinton in the form of thousands of emails the court records were released by robert s mueller iii

b i earlier this year and has also appeared before the grand jury as part of the special counsel s inquiry the house intelligence committee is one of three congressional investigations that are also examining these issues mr page s trip to moscow in july 2016 was never a secret and during the trip he gave a speech at a graduation ceremony at the new economic school a university there but the trip was one of the triggers of a counterintelligence investigation begun by the f b i later that month in his talk at the university mr page criticized american policy toward russia in terms that echoed the position of president vladimir v putin of russia washington and other western capitals have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization inequality corruption and regime change mr page said his remarks accorded with mr trump s positive view of the russian president which had prompted speculation about what mr trump saw in mr putin more commonly denounced in the united states as a ruthless anti western autocrat mr page left the trump campaign not long after the trip and since then mr trump s advisers tried to distance the campaign from mr page during another trip to moscow in december 2016 after mr page had left the trump campaign he said he planned to meet with business leaders and thought leaders at the time a kremlin spokesman said that no government officials planned to meet mr page and that the kremlin had never had any contact with him we have learned about this from the press the spokesman dmitri s peskov told the news agency interfax a former navy officer and annapolis graduate mr page was unknown in washington foreign policy circles when mr trump announced him as a member of his team of advisers in march 2016 mr page lived in moscow from 2004 to 2007 while working as a junior investment banker for merrill lynch mr page subsequently started his own investment firm global energy capital and teamed up on some deals with a russian businessman sergey yatsenko mr yatsenko had been deputy chief financial officer for the russian energy giant gazprom which is majority owned by the government and has close ties to mr putin mr page was wrapped up but not charged in an f b i investigation in 2013 that targeted people suspected of being russian intelligence officers in new york one of the of three men who was later charged with being an unregistered agent of a foreign power had met mr page at an energy symposium and was recorded describing him as having dreams of lucrative deals mr page had said he did not know the man was an intelligence officer in a video of a december 2016 speech he gave in moscow mr page told the audience that he had met with an executive of rosneft another major russian energy company he said that person was a friend his time on the trump campaign was short but he has described the experience as particularly meaningful the half year i spent on the trump campaign meant more to me than the five years i spent in the navy he said in an interview earlier this year advertisement
