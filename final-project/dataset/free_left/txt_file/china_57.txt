accusing it of raping the us economy and being the country s enemy but on the second day of his visit to beijing as part of his 12 day tour of east asia the president struck a far softer tone trade between china and the united states has not been over the last many many years a very fair one for us trump told an audience of business leaders and journalists describing the relationship as shockingly unbalanced and costing the us 300bn 229bn a year however to an audible gasp from the audience the us president went on to suggest that it was not china to blame but the us itself right now unfortunately it is a very one sided and unfair relationship but but i don t blame china after all who can blame a country for taking advantage of another country for the benefit of its own citizens i give china great credit but in actuality i do blame past us administrations for allowing this out of control trade deficit to take place and to grow we have to fix this because it just doesn t work it is just not sustainable the us secretary of state rex tillerson later tried to clarify trump s comments well as i was sitting there listening to that there was a little bit of tongue in cheek in that characterisation but there was also a lot of truth to it he told reporters in his eight minute address trump also urged xi to act faster and more effectively to extinguish north korea s nuclear menace

into the future your ancient values bring past and future together into the present so beautiful ely ratner a senior fellow for china studies at the council on foreign relations described the us president s comments on trade as by far trump s biggest mistake so far on asia trip shameful terrible message to american workers and the region should be red meat for democrats he wrote on twitter ratner said trump s vip treatment was a chinese attempt to flatter and impress the volatile us leader it s clearly an effort to try to get him to back off on some of the more punitive actions that the administration is considering on north korea and trade and investment xi s attempts to massage trump s ego appear to have worked speaking at the great hall trump thanked xi for his absolutely terrific welcome to china and said he harboured incredibly warm feelings towards a man now seen as china s most powerful leader since mao zedong you are a very special man trump told xi xi was more restrained in his choice of words although he hailed trump s successful and historic visit and said he hoped the us and china could write more and more great stories together in the future the chinese president did not directly respond to trump s call for faster action on north korea but told reporters beijing was committed to solving the crisis through dialogue and negotiation we are ready to discuss with relevant parties the pathway leading to enduring peace and stability on the peninsula and in north east asia xi also played down tensions between beijing and washington as two distinctive countries our two sides may have different views or differences on some issues this is only natural the key is to properly handle and manage them north korean state media earlier rebuffed trump s diplomatic overtures the official news agency kcna called trump a lunatic old man and said the us should oust him in order to escape the abyss of doom in a statement to journalists in beijing trump said all responsible nations must join together to stop arming and financing and even trading with the murderous north korean regime together we have in our power to finally liberate this region and the world from this very serious nuclear menace but it will require collective action collective strength and collective devotion to winning the peace additional reporting by benjamin haas
