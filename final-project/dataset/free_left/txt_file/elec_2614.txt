campaign put out a terse statement saying that clinton had departed to go to her daughter s apartment and is feeling much better there was no explicit acknowledgment that clinton had left the ceremony earlier than planned nor any mention of what looked to be a fainting spell advertisement clinton herself sought to project that all was well stepping outside of her chelsea s apartment some 45 minutes later i m feeling great it s a beautiful day in new york she said taking a moment to greet a small girl before piling back into the van to head home to westchester county not until 5 15 p m did the

journalists on twitter jonathan martin national correspondent for the new york times tweeted hillary camp now reveals that her doctor diagnosed her pneumonia on friday put her on antibiotics only disclosed after this am s episode i don t understand why clinton aides weren t telling reporters at 10 30am pneumonia cnn media reporter brian stelter wrote of course they should have disclosed this this isn t a cold added chuck todd the host of nbc s meet the press 2016 by steven shepard the campaign ignored requests for explanation but its allies defended its actions online hillary s health is fine the hysteria in the media and the attacks about it from trump supporters are not democratic pr consultant hilary rosen tweeted before clinton s pneumonia was disclosed is there really a tradition of candidates publicly disclosing illnesses like colds flu s etc tweeted former white house communications director dan pfeiffer every candidate i have ever worked for has gotten sick on the trail and worked through it because you can t take days off in a close race s o which illnesses that are treated with antibiotics do you have to disclose all former white house chief speechwriter jon favreau asked from a medical point of view this is not a big deal she needs to cancel some events or do them by skype for a week observed former vermont governor howard dean a trained doctor i think i coughed up a lung somewhere between pennsylvania and kentucky recalled former clinton 08 staffer mo elleithee who also lauded her stamina she kept a campaign schedule with pneumonia when i have a normal cold i curl up in the fetal position want to stay in bed for a week former michigan governor jennifer granholm tweeted to press lamenting hillaryclinton s health transparency powering through illness is what women do stoically every single day clinton s campaign schedule has been vigorous on friday alone she headlined two fundraising events met with a group of national security heavy hitters held a news conference and granted an interview to cnn 2016 by gabriel debenedetti but the former secretary of state who at 68 would be the second oldest president in u s history should she win in november has disclosed fewer details about her health than past presidential nominees though she has divulged more information than her opponent 70 year old donald trump who has released only a cryptic one page letter that his doctor has said was written in just five minutes david scheiner an assistant professor at the university of illinois medical school who was obama s personal physician for 22 years argued in a recent washington post op ed that neither clinton nor trump had disclosed enough information given their advanced ages having been in practice for 50 years serving a predominantly geriatric patient population and now a septuagenarian myself i can attest that the american people need much more medical information from these candidates he wrote the medical reports from clinton s and trump s personal physicians do not suffice and neither candidate has agreed to a protective pool an intensive form of media coverage that allows the press to monitor the candidate s whereabouts at all times as the white house press corps does for the president i m surprised it s mid september just a little more than 8 weeks before election day and neither candidate has a protective pool obama s first white house secretary robert gibbs tweeted sunday protective pool isn t always easy for either candidate or press but there comes a point for each nominee when it must be part of daily life
