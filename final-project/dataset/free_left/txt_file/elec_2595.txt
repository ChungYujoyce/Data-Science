 2016 the republican nominee s attack on an african american pastor shows his discipline is not rock solid by nick gass 09 15 2016 09 53 am edt updated 09 15 2016 04 47 pm edt donald trump s newfound commitment to message discipline and restraint showed some cracks on thursday with the republican presidential nominee attacking an african american pastor who cut off his political speech in a flint michigan church well i was in flint yesterday and it was a very interesting experience and got unbelievably good treatment from people i must say and even in that audience the treatment was great but something was up because i noticed she was so nervous when she introduced me trump said in a telephone interview with fox friends saying that bethel united methodist church pastor faith green timmons was so nervous she was shaking when she introduced him for his speech advertisement i mean everyone plays their games it doesn t bother me he said about her decision to interrupt him when trump started attacking hillary clinton from the front of the church trump complied with the pastor s request wednesday to stop going after clinton replying ok that s good then i m going back onto flint ok trump s slam on timmons was a return to form after the brash billionaire scorched through the republican primary field with a steady delivery of incendiary comments about minorities women and his gop rivals since elevating pollster kellyanne conway to be his campaign manager last month trump has been relatively restrained generally sticking to the teleprompter at his speeches he even initially refrained from delivering an i told you so when clinton nearly collapsed after appearing at a 9 11 memorial service on sunday her campaign initially said she was overheated but later revealed that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia but on wednesday night trump apparently couldn t resist and he again questioned clinton s stamina during a rally in canton ohio you think this is easy in this beautiful room that is 122 degrees trump said although the arena was notably chillier than his usual venues it is hot and it is always hot when i perform because the crowds are so big these rooms were not designed for this kind of crowd i don t know folks do you think hillary could stand up here for an hour he asked on thursday afternoon clinton fired back at trump not for his latest attacks on her but for his attack on the pastor she appeared to relish the opportunity to take the high ground trump afforded her reverend faith green timmons is not a nervous mess she is a rock for her community in trying times clinton said at a press conference that followed a rally in greensboro north carolina she deserves better than that and flint deserves better in fact so does america so i m going to keep working as hard as i can to lift up our country not tear it apart and while clinton has long battled her reputation for secrecy during the press conference she refused to say when she told her running mater tim kaine about her pneumonia diagnosis trump is also on the defensive for his refusal to reveal details about his business dealings and charitable giving by nick gass during the two part interview on fox news on thursday morning trump offered an explanation about his willingness to be more transparent about his medical information to television host and doctor mehmet oz and more broadly why he is talking about it in the first place i did every test i did it last week and the samples all came back and i guess i wouldn t be talking to you right now if they were bad if they were bad i would say let s sort of skip this right trump said the candidate was not asked however whether the same logic applied to the release of his tax returns for which vice news filed a freedom of information act lawsuit against the irs earlier this week demanding to see all documents dating back to 2002 trump has said that he will not release any returns while they are under audit as all documents from 2009 onward are according to the campaign critics have speculated that he doesn t want to reveal his level of charitable giving and how he may have taken advantage of loopholes to pay a low tax rate or no taxes at all even within his familiar confines of fox friends trump faced down questions about what he would do about his businesses ties to foreign countries the entanglements represent a lingering issue raised anew this week by a newsweek report wednesday suggesting that the trump organization s foreign ties could upend u s national security by nick gass well i will sever connections and i ll have my children and my executives run the company trump said and i won t discuss it with them it s just so unimportant compared to what we re doing about making america great again i just wouldn t care i guess you can say there s a conflict because as the company country gets stronger that s good for all companies right but i wouldn t care it s so unimportant compared to what i m doing right now the businessman who has repeatedly said he would place his assets in a blind trust managed by his children and executives also said that if he were president his companies would leave countries where sanctions were imposed i wouldn t be able to be involved and then nobody else is able to but i don t think we have too many of those companies quite frankly trump said it s a very interesting question i would get out i would get out of those countries campaign surrogate and new jersey gov chris christie defended trump s approach the previous night on msnbc i think listen the father and the children have a lot of things to talk about other than the business they have grandchildren many of them christie remarked he s involved in every aspect of their life and they in his and i think that these are professional smart people who will as we can see with his tax returns follow the advice of their lawyers and their accountants when host brian williams remarked that experts would not necessarily characterize the trust as blind christie volunteered that he has had a blind trust in the seven years since he became governor and has no knowledge of how his investments are performing adding that he had absolute faith that trump s children could run the business independently of their father 2016 by louis nelson and eli stokols i know what it was like when i went in seven years ago but lots of things will change and in a dynamic business like the trump organization a lot of those assets will change over the course of the time he s president the new jersey governor said and if that wall is up and the trust is absolutely blind he won t know how it s changed until he leaves the presidency and goes back to ask his kids what s happened over the past number of years trump s slippage in message discipline was not limited to him trump s children who also serve as some of his chief surrogates also offered up some unhelpful headlines donald trump jr responding to a question about the lack of disclosure on tax returns suggested in a meeting of tribune review editors and reporters on wednesday that the release of his father s would be a distraction because he s got a 12 000 page tax return that would create financial auditors out of every person in the country asking questions that would detract from his father s main message trump jr said by nick gass that is a slightly different answer than his father s repeated insistence that he would not release them while some are under audit from the irs specifically those from 2009 forward in a separate interview with a philadelphia radio station wednesday morning trump jr lamented the media s treatment of his father s campaign referencing the gas chamber the media has been clinton s no 1 surrogate in this without the media this wouldn t even be a contest but the media has built her up they ve let her slide on every indiscrepancy on every lie on every dnc game trying to get bernie sanders out of this thing he said if republicans were doing that they d be warming up the gas chamber right now both trump and trump jr have made similar comments in the past with the candidate remarking in may that he would get the electric chair if he had like former mexican president vicente fox used the f word trump spokesman jason miller later said trump jr was clearly referring to capital punishment to make the case that the media continues to take words out of context in order to serve as the propaganda arm of the hillary clinton campaign another trump jr face to face with a pittsburgh tv station aired wednesday evening was cut short after the reporter inquired about a washington post story reporting that his father used foundation money to pay for a portrait of himself at an auction you re a director of the trump foundation charity did you sign off on charity money for a portrait wtae reporter bob mayo asked in a segment with the trump organization executive in town to open the campaign s western pennsylvania headquarters trump jr responded no i don t know anything about that before the reporter could follow up a voice off camera said all right that s it we have to move on to the next next one thank you and speaking to cosmopolitan com to promote the campaign s new family leave plan ivanka trump took issue with questioning about her father s past comments pertaining to women my father obviously has a track record of decades of employing women at every level of his company and supporting women and supporting them in their professional capacity and enabling them to thrive outside of the office and within ivanka trump said to imply otherwise is an unfair characterization of his track record and his support of professional women pressed again on the 2004 comments in which her father called pregnancy an inconvenience for a person that is running a business trump s eldest daughter responded well you said he made those comments i don t know that he said those comments i think what i was there s plenty of time for you to editorialize around this but i think he put forth a really incredible plan that has pushed the boundaries of what anyone else is talking about she remarked according to the transcript answering another question before telling interviewer prachi gupta i m going to jump off i have to run i apologize missing out on the
