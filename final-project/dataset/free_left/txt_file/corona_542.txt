distancing across the united states and across the world prisoners are among the most vulnerable to the coronavirus overcrowded facilities shortages of food and medicine and totally inadequate testing expose prisoners who are disproportionately poor and afflicted with prior conditions that render them vulnerable to the disease prisoners increasingly are protesting their conditions objecting to being sentenced to die in prison experts across the world are urging governments to reduce their prison populations swiftly michelle bachelet the united nations high commissioner for human rights warned that the consequences of neglecting overcrowded conditions are potentially catastrophic many countries have begun to act turkey s parliament authorized the release of 45 000 prisoners indonesia has released at least 30 000 even iran s dictatorial regime has released roughly 85 000 detainees while dealing harshly with those protesting the risks the united states locks up more people than any other country in the world largely because of harsh and wrong headed policies fifty five thousand are detained in jail awaiting trials too poor to pay for their freedom under the current cash bail system that is prevalent in many states the prison policy initiative reports that 48 000 children are incarcerated on any given day many are charged only with status offenses such as truancy or homelessness the health and human services office in charge of the custody of unaccompanied undocumented minors reports that 2 000 are locked up the new york times reports that 59 in custody have already tested positive for covid 19 in california the marshall project notes more than one in seven prisoners are over the age of 55 the percentage of those 55 and older in prison in the country has
