advertisement supported by transcript tk by patrick healy and jonathan martin philadelphia democratic party leaders scrambled on monday night to rescue their convention from political bedlam as supporters of senator bernie sanders erupted in boos jeers and protests against hillary clinton after an email leak showed that party officials had sought to undermine mr sanders in their race for the nomination mr sanders whose speech was shifted to a more prominent time in hopes of soothing delegates struggled to unify the convention his full throated endorsement of mrs clinton drew scattered boos and his valedictory tone left some supporters in tears rather than rallying around the democratic nominee another speaker michelle obama was far more electrifying but while she drew affection from the crowd her remarks did little to heal the lingering primary wounds the venting among sanders supporters reflected months of pent up frustration after he lost the nomination to mrs clinton whom they see as too accommodating to big business and republicans mr sanders tried to intervene by sending a text message asking delegates to not engage in any kind of protest on the floor while clinton and sanders campaign officials worked on the convention floor to mollify delegates who might be disruptive the tension reverberated from the floor of the hall to the stage by 9 30 p m the outbursts were so loud and persistent that the comedian sarah silverman scolded the sanders supporters who were shouting over her remarks can i just say to the bernie or bust people she said adopting their own nickname you are being ridiculous how we analyzed in real time the first night of the democratic national convention featuring michelle obama elizabeth warren and bernie sanders as delegates streamed out a handful of mr sanders s most dedicated supporters held up his signs and chanted hey hey d n c we won t vote for hillary clinton campaign officials in another bid to placate the party s left wing picked senator elizabeth warren to deliver the keynote address on monday night hoping that her searing denunciations of donald j trump the republican nominee would unify the delegates in the hall mrs clinton had privately chosen ms warren days ago campaign officials said but announced her on monday morning to try to set a positive tone for the first day of the convention and start closing ranks against mr trump mr sanders who took the stage here at about 10 50 p m to a thundering three minute ovation and chants of bernie bernie acknowledged the disappointment of his supporters and said it is no secret that hillary clinton and i disagree on a number of issues but he said the choice between his onetime rival and mr trump was not even close hillary clinton will make an outstanding president and i am proud to stand with her here tonight mr sanders said as his supporters waved his blue campaign signs ms warren opened her remarks with a warm nod to mr sanders saying his campaign had advanced liberal causes and helped show that the political and economic systems were rigged in favor of the powerful bernie reminds us what democrats fight for every day ms warren said thank you bernie yet even after ms warren was well into her remarks a handful of determined supporters of mr sanders tried to interrupt her we trusted you they yelled suggesting that she had betrayed them by supporting mrs clinton these catcalls as well as the images of delegates in sanders t shirts waving placards that read hill no were not the sort of messages that the clinton campaign wanted mrs clinton who had a hand in choosing the speakers had hoped that the convention would be the picture of unity in contrast to the republican convention last week instead she was reminded that many americans including some die hard democrats do not like her or believe that she will bring significant change to the government the only speaker who brought the entire hall together in spellbinding fashion was michelle obama who seemed to pour out feelings she had been keeping under wraps she delivered an unusually pointed speech targeting mr trump without mentioning him by name the issues the president faces are not black and white and cannot be boiled down to 140 characters she said taking a crowd pleasing shot at mr trump s penchant for twitter messages she alluded to those who have questioned mr obama s citizenship or faith and scorned mr trump s slogan don t let anyone tell you that this country isn t great she said but she also turned emotional her voice cracking when she spoke of what mrs clinton s election would mean my daughters and all our sons and daughters now take for granted that a woman can be president of the united states she said throughout the day more than 1 000 supporters of mr sanders took to the scalding streets of philadelphia to vent their frustration some targeted mrs clinton with a taunting chant from last week s republican convention lock her up other protesters gathered outside the downtown ritz carlton where many major donors to mrs clinton s campaign were staying and attacked her use of a super pac and her reliance on big fund raising events protesters reporters delegates and security personnel converged this week in philadelphia for the democratic national convention even mr sanders who has vowed to do whatever it takes to stop mr trump from winning had little luck making the case to his followers that they should vote for mrs clinton in a rare display of rebellion at a lunchtime gathering of his delegates he was drowned out by boos when he mentioned mrs clinton and seemed jarred by the response we have got to defeat donald trump and we have got to elect hillary clinton and tim kaine he said to a round of jeers several veterans of democratic conventions said they had not seen anything at recent gatherings like monday s disruptions from the moment the gavel fell to open the convention at the wells fargo center on monday afternoon mr sanders s supporters let out boos and jeers at almost any mention of mrs clinton s name some democratic officials said the fury was an illustration of the work that still needed to be done to unify the party behind mrs clinton as well as a sign of the dedication mr sanders engendered over the last year the sanders supporters scorn was enough to prompt some of the speakers to gently scold them they both deserve our cheers said former mayor wellington e webb of denver repeating the phrase twice more to make his point to the crowd but the liberal anger in the hall was not only due to the belief among mr sanders s supporters that the party establishment had treated him unfairly it was also driven by policy disagreements underscoring the rifts between progressive activists and some democratic leaders when representative elijah e cummings of maryland one of the most prominent black democrats in congress and a close ally of mrs clinton s recounted his father s history as a sharecropper he was nearly drowned out at times sign waving progressives chanted in opposition to the trans pacific partnership the trade accord that president obama supports but mr sanders and mrs clinton oppose sanders supporters directed their fury most intensely at representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida the departing democratic national committee chairwoman as she spoke to florida delegates on monday morning hopes that ms wasserman schultz s decision on sunday afternoon to resign would calm nerves were dashed as she publicly addressed her delegation at breakfast among those who believed for months that she was rigging the nominating fight nothing would be forgiven so quickly they booed and screamed fair elections as ms wasserman schultz took the lectern and said it is so wonderful to be able to be here with my home state all right everybody now settle down everybody settle down please they refused and as the convention was called to order monday afternoon resentments bubbled to the surface some delegates booed every mention of mrs clinton while others waved hillary buttons and chanted hill a ry the number of protesters in philadelphia was strikingly larger than in cleveland where republicans gathered for their convention last week by around 5 p m roughly 30 people had climbed over a barrier outside the wells fargo center and been arrested the protesters reached the arena after marching at least three miles from city hall in temperatures that reached into the mid 90s pressing anti clinton signs up against a temporary fence they shouted at arriving delegates and erupted in cheers when the occasional sanders delegate passed through chants of bernie beats trump and hell no d n c we won t vote for hillary echoed through the surrounding parking lots she s crooked as all get out said brianne colling of canton mich all the proof that s coming out is that she s stolen this election from bernie advertisement
