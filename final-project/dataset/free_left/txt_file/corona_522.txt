advertisement supported by the largest economic stimulus measure in modern history would authorize direct payments to taxpayers and loans to small businesses and create a 500 billion corporate bailout fund by catie edmondson washington trump administration officials and top democrats finalized an agreement early wednesday morning on a roughly 2 trillion rescue package to confront the coronavirus pandemic the largest economic stimulus measure in modern history after days of partisan bickering and closed door haggling negotiators emerged from their final huddle and announced that they had struck a deal to send relief to workers businesses and hospitals devastated by the pandemic and the economic disruption it has caused the senate is expected to pass the mammoth bill later on wednesday and send it over to the house which is also planning to move quickly to send it to president trump for swift enactment the sheer size and scope of the package would have been unthinkable only a couple of weeks ago in a deeply polarized congress that has found it impossible in recent years to agree on major new policy initiatives in effect this is a wartime level of investment into our nation senator mitch mcconnell republican of kentucky and the majority leader said on the senate floor in announcing the deal here s what s in the package lawmakers agreed to provide 1 200 in direct payments to taxpayers with incomes up to 75 000 per year before starting to phase out and ending altogether for those earning more than 99 000 families would receive an additional 500 per child in an attempt to create a safety net for those whose jobs and businesses are affected by the pandemic lawmakers agreed to a significant expansion of unemployment benefits that would extend jobless insurance by 13 weeks and include a four month enhancement of benefits at the insistence of democrats the program was broadened to include freelancers furloughed employees and gig workers such as uber drivers the bill provides federally guaranteed loans available at community banks to small businesses that pledge not to lay off their workers the loans would be available during an emergency period ending june 30 and would be forgiven if the employer continued to pay workers for the duration of the crisis there is broad general agreement that small businesses in this country will not be able to survive unless there is extraordinary assistance said senator marco rubio republican of florida and the chairman of the small business and entrepreneurship committee who worked with democrats to create the program the goal is to keep employees connected to their employers so that people aren t just having to stay home and aren t just feeling the stress of being laid off but the uncertainty of whether they ll even have a job to go back to loans for distressed companies would come from a 425 billion fund controlled by the federal reserve and an additional 75 billion would be available for industry specific loans including to airlines and hotels the creation of the federal reserve fund was one of the chief sticking points in the negotiations as grim memories of the 2008 wall street bailout which activists in both parties came to regard as a flawed program that benefited rich corporations at the expense of american workers hung over the negotiations democrats successfully pressed for immediate disclosure of the recipients and stronger oversight including installing an inspector general and congressionally appointed board to monitor it companies that benefit could not engage in stock buybacks while they received government assistance and for an additional year after that democrats also secured a provision ensuring that trump family businesses or those of any other senior government officials cannot receive loan money through that fund though they could potentially still benefit from other parts of the bill updated may 20 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity
