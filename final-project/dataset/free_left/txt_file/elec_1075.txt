chris christie may have criticized trump during his short lived presidential campaign as make believe but in reality the two are longtime allies not even three weeks ago on february 7 chris christie then a candidate for the republican nomination stood in the center of a middle school cafeteria in hampton new hampshire and told a few hundred people that donald trump is a joke he said his campaign was nothing but make believe just like the apprentice and that his policy proposals to the extent that he has any are stupid bravado by itself is not a plan he said i like him he s a good person he s just not the right person to be president of the united states and not the person that we d want representing our country and then he mocked that bravado in a long involved monologue in which he impersonated trump s voice but on friday afternoon christie standing at trump s side onstage in fort worth texas had a change of heart and a change of brain and a change of soul there is no one who is better prepared to provide america with the strong leadership that it needs both at home and around the world than donald trump christie said he is looking at the five people on that stage last night the clear standout and the person who will do exactly what needs to be done to make america a leader around the world again christie didn t provide an explanation for his decision in his remarks other than to say trump is a loyal friend the rationale is that this is an attempt to mitigate the damage of a trump candidacy or not altogether unrealistically a trump presidency if trump is going to be the de facto leader of the republican party the thinking goes it s best to get on his good side and attempt to influence his policies as much as possible new jersey republicans floated other theories on facebook namely that christie the former united states attorney from new jersey might be positioning himself to be president trump s attorney general presumably in a trump administration the federal investigations into his office wouldn t be disqualifying or that christie loathes marco rubio who he pilloried in his last debate so much that he would endorse satan himself to ensure he never wins the nomination both christie and trump noted on friday that they have a history and it s true trump memorably built casinos in atlantic city in the 1990s and indeed some still bear his name much to his chagrin while christie was getting his start in local politics and somewhat awkwardly christie in his role as u s attorney locked up charles kushner the father of trump s son in law for two years for making illegal campaign contributions evading taxes and tampering with a witness in the past they seemed more like real friends than just acquaintances in 2014 i interviewed trump for a story about the closing of the taj mahal atlantic city had crumbled since the casino opened in 1990 and christie had for the previous four years tried and spectacularly failed to keep it from dying altogether but trump refused to criticize him on the record all he would say publicly was the governor s trying very hard it s a tough situation but he s trying very hard even as late as november the two men were keeping the gloves on after trump repeatedly and incorrectly insisted that he had witnessed muslims cheering in the streets of jersey city on 9 11 christie declined to attack him he tiptoed around trump s lie saying meekly i don t recall that but as the primary dragged on and trump grew more popular christie began to attack him when trump declined to appear at the fox news debate in iowa in january after bickering pettily with the network over its supposedly unfair coverage christie said the american people should wonder you know if you re not willing to show up when everything isn t going your way on february 7th the new hampshire primary just a few days away christie s knocks at trump were growing in tandem with his desperation the core of my criticism of mr trump is this and it was said last night at the debate how how the core of my criticism is how he said first he says he s gonna build a wall across the entire border to the united states and mexico let s stop first at the moment of why why he said the audience laughed but he wasn t done it s not gonna work by the way he said i ve never seen a wall that a determined human being couldn t get over under or around right never christie assumed trump s persona right down to the voice beautiful marvelous wall an incredible wall the wall is gonna be unbelievable the wall is gonna have a door the door is gonna open and close and good people come in the bad people go out it s gonna be an amazing wall it s gonna be a beautiful wall and the mexicans are gonna pay for the wall because trump says they ll pay for the wall he went back to being chris christie how how is he gonna make the mexicans lay for the wall how they are a sovereign nation later in the speech christie impersonated him again when i become president the entire country is gonna get so wealthy so amazingly wealthy and rich that we re not gonna have to worry about social security he said in trump s voice that s what he said he said disbelief in his voice now i m not opposed to that because i m part of the entire country and i m not amazingly wealthy or rich right now and i don t think you are either so if we re not that d be great for us but he said how we re all gonna get so rich that we re not gonna have to worry about social security how do you answer that i m opposed to that like what do you say right i mean i ve known him for 13 years he then added i like donald he s a very good guy he s a very smart guy he has not the first idea of how to run a government not the first idea telling it like it is was the slogan for christie s campaign it was meant to neatly sum up his ethos he spent his political career talking tough and talking straight in a way that most other politicians are too afraid to in this respect he was the donald trump of his time his time being around 2012 when conservatives most wanted him to run for president in reality christie is not a truth teller he s not even a republican he s an opportunist donald trump is someone who keeps his word and that means america will keep its word again christie said friday he s providing strong leadership that s not dependent upon the status quo christie joins the ranks of other trump endorsers like white supremacist david duke failed reality television star sarah palin celebrity apprentice contestant gary busey conspiracy monger alex jones
