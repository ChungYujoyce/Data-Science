lincoln would probably not be electable today because of television he was not a handsome man and he did not smile at all trump said he knew people who would be excellent presidents because they were extraordinarily brilliant very very confident and have the respect of everybody none of them would seek the office because of the media scrutiny which he called a tragedy one man could turn this country around the one proper president could turn this country around he said trump would spend decades waiting for him since his rise as a businessman in the 1980s trump showed few constants when it came to politics with one exception he tried to align himself with winners people who could raise his profile and further his business goals he teetered back and forth between political parties and

backbone can t cure he wrote in the ads which cost a combined 95 000 he questioned why the united states continued to provide military funds to japan and saudi arabia and implored let s not let our great country be laughed at anymore the image of the rest of the world laughing at u s leaders would become an enduring theme in trump s political rhetoric this time it came in the seventh year of ronald reagan s presidency just weeks before the publication of trump s book the art of the deal in which trump called reagan a smooth performer but questioned whether there s anything beneath that smile donald trump announced his campaign for president on june 16 2015 and he s come a long way in the year since peter stevenson the washington post on the day trump s foreign policy ads appeared he

a copy of trump s book inscribed to michael i really appreciate your friendship you ve created a very exciting part of my life on to the future dunbar hoped he had planted a seed trump s brief flirtation with a run for office was over but he reveled in the curiosity about his emerging political ambitions promoting his book he would continually repeat his stances on issues such as trade this sounds like political presidential talk to me oprah winfrey told trump when he appeared on her popular talk show in the spring of 1988 i just probably wouldn t do it trump said but i do get tired of seeing what s happening with this country and if it got so bad i would never want to rule it out totally a few months later trump attended his first republican convention as george h w bush accepted the party s nomination for the presidency during an interview on cnn talk show host larry king asked trump why he was there trump said he wanted to see how the system works king wanted to know if trump classified himself as an eastern republican or a rockefeller chase manhattan republican shorthand for the liberal wing of the gop i never thought about it in those terms trump replied how about a bush republican king asked trump who boasted of his great wealth decided to cast himself as a man of the people you know wealthy people don t like me because i m competing against them all the time and i like to win the fact is i go down the streets of new york and the people that really like me are the taxi drivers and the workers then why are you a republican king asked i have no idea trump said i m a republican because i just believe in certain principles of the republican party trump bill clinton and actor billy crystal second from right participate in a charity golf tournament in 2008

sexual relationship with an intern named monica lewinsky beginning when she was 22 years old in 1995 and lasting more than two years trump was unperturbed the best thing he has going is the fact that the economy s doing great trump said in august 1998 days after clinton finally admitted a relationship with lewinsky i ve never seen anything like it you know they talked about the 80s were good the 90s are better trump suggested that if he were a candidate he would face similar controversy can you imagine how controversial that d be you think about him with the women how about me with the women as a new election approached roger stone trump s longtime lobbyist examined the potential field led by republican george w bush and democrat al gore stone said that this could be trump s moment and that the path forward might be within a third party ross perot a texas billionaire with no political experience had won nearly 19 percent of the vote in 1992 and jesse ventura a professional wrestler trump knew from his involvement with wrestlemania had improbably won the governorship of minnesota in 1998 on the reform party ticket ventura had made his name parading in a feather boa and mocking hulk hogan as a world wrestling federation commentator if ventura could go from being known as the body to being called the governing body maybe trump could become president donald trump chats with

clinton trump now proclaimed that ronald reagan was his political role model reuters on oct 8 1999 trump announced on larry king live that he was leaving the republican party to join the reform party and was forming an exploratory committee to run for president he made a u turn on clinton calling the previous four years disgusting and professing reagan as his role model because he had helped to regenerate the spirit of the country trump said his main competitor for the reform party nomination pat buchanan was too divisive trump insisted that he on the other hand was all about inclusiveness who king asked would trump pick as his vice presidential candidate trump named oprah winfrey although he called himself conservative trump was floating many liberal ideas in the advocate a gay oriented news magazine he took issue with how buchanan talked about jews blacks gays and mexicans trump called himself a conciliator saying he would extend the civil rights act to include protections for gay people and would allow them to serve openly in the military repealing don t ask don t tell the clinton era policy that had lifted a ban on gays in the military but forbade them from talking about their orientation while in the service trump also called for universal health care and the protection of social security through a one time tax on the super wealthy and new money generated by renegotiating trade agreements two weeks after trump announced his exploratory committee he appeared on meet the press where the moderator tim russert pressed him on a range of issues at one point

interview when the two left the studio stone said trump admitted that he didn t know what partial birth abortion was in another book published in january 2000 trump clarified that he supported a ban on partial birth abortion after learning more about it and he said that while he was uncomfortable with abortion i support a woman s right to choose in weighing a presidential bid in 2000 trump sought advice from jesse ventura right who had won minnesota s gubernatorial election as a reform party candidate about a month after their meeting trump announced he would not run associated press trump s quasi campaign traveled to minnesota for a january 2000 meeting with his role model ventura and his campaign staffers trump told them he wanted to learn how a man who started at the bottom of the polls who was deemed by some to be a joke ended up as governor dean barkley who had chaired ventura s campaign advised trump just be honest it s not what you say but how you say it and talk to the public not at them later that afternoon trump and ventura appeared at a lunch for the local chamber of commerce trump the listener was gone the showbiz trump had returned he mocked the republican candidates winning laughs are these people stiffs or what but trump eventually chose not to run on feb 19 2000 he wrote an op ed in the new york times in which he said that his exploratory campaign was the greatest civics lesson that a private citizen can have but he was not sure a third party candidate could win although he had already pulled out of the race trump s name remained on the reform party ballot in michigan and california he won both primaries during the 1988 campaign trump hosted a fundraiser for vice president george h w bush boxing promoter don king center was a guest at the event at new york s plaza hotel david bookstaver associated press before he decided to run for office trump s political donations were a cost of doing business suggesting that his practice of politics was transactional not ideological he hosted fundraisers and invited politicians to weddings i give to everybody when they call i give trump said and you know what when i need something from them two years later three years later i call them they are there for me trump and his major companies gave at least 3 1 million to local state and federal candidates from both parties between 1995 and 2016 not including donations that may have flowed through the scores of limited liability corporations that trump controlled he donated to hillary clinton when she was running to be a u s senator from new york asked if he voted for her trump said i never say who i m going to vote for he did say in a separate interview however that his votes for president were consistently republican although he said he lost respect for the younger president bush because of his handling of the war in iraq which he later called a disaster he said he voted for bush again in 2004 because he felt it was important to carry the republican line recalling the 2004 vote trump said he showed his distance from bush by not throwing fundraisers for him trump s public statements sent mixed signals about his political leanings in 2006 he told the new york times that sen john mccain who would become the 2008 republican presidential nominee could not win because he advocated sending more troops to iraq trump praised the future democratic nominee then sen barack obama for his wonderful qualities nonetheless trump contributed 3 600 to mccain during the 2008 campaign and said he voted for him trump changed parties seven times between 1999 and 2012 starting when he left the gop to consider a run under the reform party banner after registering as a democrat in 2001 he switched back to the republicans in 2003 he became a democrat again in 2005 and a republican in 2009 he chose not to be affiliated with any party in 2011 asked what he would say to critics who saw the constant party switching as proof that he had no core beliefs trump responded i think it had to do more with practicality because if you re going to run for office you would have had to make friends then he returned to the gop in 2012 once again stoking speculation that he had his sights on the presidency his wife ann by his side republican presidential candidate mitt romney listens as trump endorses him in the 2012 gop primary race speculation had swirled around a bid by trump himself that year especially as he became outspoken in the birther movement which questioned president obama s hawaiian birthplace steve marcus reuters trump s celebrity status promptly put him among the 2012 front runners an nbc news wall street journal survey of early primary state republican voters released in april 2011 showed him tied for second place behind mitt romney among tea party supporters trump led the field and his positions became more aligned with conservatives now he was against abortion and no longer advocated making gays a protected class he bashed obama with an intensity he had never displayed for his predecessors he called the president s signature health care law a job killer he drew wide attention for focusing on the long discredited assertion that the president had been born not in hawaii but in kenya his father s native country i have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they re finding i would like to have him show his birth certificate trump said on nbc cementing his role as a leader in what became known as the birther movement obama put the document on public display and ridiculed the real estate mogul days later at the annual black tie white house correspondents association dinner joking that trump could now turn his attention to whether the united states

younger i was doing numerous jobs many jobs and i really wanted to wrap them up on feb 2 2012 he endorsed romney and became an outspoken surrogate on election day trump went to boston to attend what he expected to be a romney victory party romney s loss made him livid if only the candidate had used him more trump said romney would have been a winner trump took to his increasingly favored medium twitter to vent his frustration this election is a total sham and a travesty we can t let this happen the world is laughing at us the world is laughing at us it was the same concern trump had from his first interview with rona barrett when he said one proper president could turn the country around now a full fledged celebrity trump was certain who that man might be after romney s loss republican elders huddled to create ways to transform the gop into a younger more inclusive party with new ideas trump was forming a different plan twelve days after the 2012 election he filed an application
