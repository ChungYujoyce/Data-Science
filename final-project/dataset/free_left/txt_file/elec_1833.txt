advertisement supported by by charlie savage washington the trump administration disclosed on saturday a previously top secret set of documents related to the wiretapping of carter page the onetime trump campaign adviser who was at the center of highly contentious accusations by republicans on the house intelligence committee that the f b i had abused its surveillance powers read the documents here democrats in february rejected the republican claims that law enforcement officials had improperly obtained a warrant to monitor mr page accusing them of putting out misinformation to defend president trump and sow doubts about the origin of the russia investigation but even as republicans and democrats issued dueling memos characterizing the materials underlying the surveillance of mr page the public had no access to the records on saturday evening those materials an october 2016 application to the foreign intelligence surveillance court to wiretap mr page along with several renewal applications were released to the new york times and other news organizations that had filed freedom of information act lawsuits to obtain them mr trump had declassified their existence earlier this year this application targets carter page the document said the f b i believes page has been the subject of targeted recruitment by the russian government a line was then redacted and then it picked up with undermine and influence the outcome of the 2016 u s presidential election in violation of u s criminal law mr page is a former foreign policy adviser to a candidate for u s president mr page has denied being a russian agent and has not been charged with a crime in the nearly two years since the initial wiretap application was filed he did not immediately respond to a request for comment on saturday the spectacle of the release was itself noteworthy given that wiretapping under the foreign intelligence surveillance act or fisa is normally one of the government s closest guarded secrets no such application materials had apparently become public in the 40 years since congress enacted that law to regulate the interception of phone calls and other communications on domestic soil in search of spies and terrorists as opposed to wiretapping for ordinary criminal investigations the documents made public on saturday were heavily redacted in places and some of the substance of the applications had already become public in february via the republican and democratic intelligence committee memos visible portions showed that the f b i in stark terms had told the intelligence court that mr page has established relationships with russian government officials including russian intelligence officers that the bureau believed the russian government s efforts are being coordinated with page and perhaps other individuals associated with mr trump s campaign and that mr page has been collaborating and conspiring with the russian government the fight over the surveillance of mr page centered on the fact that the f b i in making the case to judges that he might be a russian agent had used some claims drawn from a notorious democratic funded dossier compiled by christopher steele a former british intelligence agent the application cited claims from the dossier that mr page while on a trip to moscow in july 2016 had met with two senior russian representatives and discussed matters like lifting sanctions imposed on russia for its intervention in ukraine and a purported file of compromising information about mr trump that the russian government had mr page has denied those allegations although he later contradicted his claims that he had not met any russian government officials on that trip republicans portrayed the steele dossier which also contained salacious claims about mr trump apparently not included in the wiretap application as dubious and blasted the f b i for using material from it while not telling the court that the democratic national committee and the hillary clinton campaign had funded the research but democrats noted that the application also contained evidence against mr page unrelated to the dossier and an unredacted portion of the application discussed efforts by russian agents in 2013 to recruit americans as assets it has previously been reported that mr page was one of their targets although any discussion of mr page s interactions with them in the application is still censored democrats argued in february that the f b i had told the court that the research s sponsor had the political motive of wanting to discredit mr trump s campaign they argued that it was normal not to specifically name americans and american organizations in such materials the released documents show that portion of the filings which the previously released democratic memo had quoted the application shows that the f b i told the court it believed that the person who hired mr steele was looking for dirt to discredit mr trump but it added that based on mr steele s previous reporting history with the f b i in which he had provided reliable information the bureau believed his information cited in the application to be credible the applications largely avoided using names renewal materials noted that they would continue to refer to candidate 1 by that description for example even though he is now the president the renewal applications from 2017 told the court in boldface print that the f b i had severed its relationship with mr steele because he had shared some of his claims with a news organization in october 2016 contrary to the f b i s admonishment to speak only to law enforcement officials about the matter but they said the bureau continued to assess his prior reporting as reliable the final two renewal applications also contained two additional pages describing a letter mr page sent to the justice department in february 2017 accusing the clinton campaign of spreading false information about him the unredacted portions of the original application and the three renewal applications are otherwise largely identical so it is not visible whether the f b i told the court that it was gaining useful intelligence from the wiretap of mr page as it asked for extensions but the length of the applications grew significantly each time indicating that new information was being added they were 66 pages 79 pages 91 pages and 101 pages respectively the materials also revealed which federal district court judges signed off on the wiretapping of mr page judges rosemary collyer michael mosman anne c conway and raymond j dearie all were appointed by republican presidents as has been publicly known from the february congressional fight the application also contained a description of a yahoo news article from september 2016 that discussed the investigation into mr page s russia ties it is now known that mr steele was a source for that article but the application and renewals state that the f b i did not believe he directly provided information to yahoo news republicans at the time claimed that the f b i had misleadingly used the article as corroboration for mr steele s claims while democrats said that was false and that it was instead included to inform the court that mr page had denied the allegations the section of the application that describes the yahoo news article is titled page s denial of cooperation with the russian government to influence the 2016 u s presidential election since february even as mr trump and his allies have continued to portray the russia investigation as a witch hunt it has produced indictments of two dozen russians and russian government officials for efforts to covertly manipulate american social media and for hacking and releasing democratic emails during the campaign noting that the original application and its three renewals were approved by senior law enforcement officials in two administrations and by federal judges for example representative jerrold nadler the top democrat on the house judiciary committee portrayed the threat from russia that the f b i was investigating as real and severe anyone aware of these facts would recognize that these applications were necessary and appropriate mr nadler said those who say otherwise are trying desperately to protect president trump from a broader investigation that must be allowed to take its course without interference while applications for criminal wiretap orders often become public showing what the government s basis was for seeking it the government until now has refused to disclose fisa materials even when using evidence gathered through such wiretaps to prosecute people but in february mr trump over the objections of law enforcement professionals took the unprecedented step of lowering the walls of secrecy around such materials to enable house intelligence committee republicans led by representative devin nunes of california to disclose their three and a half page memo which sought to portray the surveillance of mr page as scandalous in addition to invoking mr trump s declassification to seek disclosure of the underlying materials by filing a freedom of information act lawsuit against the justice department the times also petitioned the foreign intelligence surveillance court to unseal the materials itself the court has not responded to that request advertisement
