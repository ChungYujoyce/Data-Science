philadelphia charging that donald trump wants us to fear the future and fear each other hillary clinton took him on with the most powerful line in her party s tradition well a great democratic president franklin delano roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to trump more than eighty years ago during a much more perilous time the only thing we have to fear is fear itself clad in white the color of the women s suffrage movement she noted her special role that this convention marked the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president it was she said happy news for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between but she spoke first of her hopes for the country and how her vision and approach to governing contrasted so sharply with her opponent s divisive angry and self centered campaign don tbelieve anyone who says ialonecan fix it those were actually donald trump s words in cleveland and they should set off alarm bells for all of us she made clear that she had no intention of ceding economically discontented voters to trump democrats she declared are the party of working people my primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the united states she said from my first day in office to my last especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind this was a convention in which the word we was invoked by speaker after speaker from president obama to the rev william barber as a talisman and a commitment in the hour before clinton spoke barber gave a stirring stem winder of a sermon that ended with the whole convention shouting alleluia clinton embraced the communitarian theme signaling that her stronger together slogan would remain at the heart of her campaign every generation of americans has come together to make our country freer fairer and stronger she declared none of us can do it alone that s why we are stronger together and she underscored the other side of that catchphrase by warning that trump would divide the nation powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart she said bonds of trust and respect are fraying and just as with our founders there are no guarantees it s truly is up to us we have to decide whether we re going to work together so we can all rise together as she often has in the past clinton cited as her guiding principle a favorite teaching from her methodist faith do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can she included a lengthy tribute to bernie sanders whom she praised for having put economic and social justice issues front and center where they belong and she pledged to live up to the hopes that inspired their engagement your cause she said is our cause she struck populist themes that should resonate with sanders s backers wall street can never ever be allowed to wreck main street again clinton said sheattacked big money in politics and promised fairer trade deals a higher minimum wage and an expansion of social security benefits it was a speech that ratified the progressive thrust of the party s platform and its move in a more progressive direction her speech capped a star studded thematically coherent and methodically organized convention that contrasted sharply with a shambolic trump gathering in cleveland that most leading republicans shunned she faced the challenge of following a passionately persuasive address on her behalf by obama much as obama had to follow a similarly successful speech by bill clinton four years ago her style was very different from obama s she spoke quietly deliberately and often affectingly particularly when discussing her mother who was abandoned by her parents and wassaved by the kindness of others it was a powerful speech in which she combined the personal with policy a vigorous defense of the obama record with an insistence that she would tackle the problems left unsolved and the injustices that still needed righting again and again she came back to trump s shortcomings and hypocrisies she charged he was in the pocket of the gun lobby and displayedthat her party is no longer fearful of the gun issue sounding a theme her campaign has signaled it will drive home she highlighted trump s failure to pay many who hadworked for him people who did the workand needed the money and didn t get it not because he couldn t pay them but because he wouldn tpay them and she notedtrump s statement i know more about isis than the generals do she clearly enjoyed reciting the next line no donald you don t in the primaries trump s opponents were fearful of attacking him until it was too late clinton showed she would be a happy warrior with no compunction about taking him on democrats have often criticized themselves as putting too much faith in policy she embraced her persona as someone who proudly sweated policy details and she promised a campaign rooted in a moral challenge to her opponent yes the world is watching what we do receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to
