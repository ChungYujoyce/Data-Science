advertisement supported by the economy can t fully reopen until schools do by spencer bokat lindell mr bokat lindell is a writer in the new york times opinion section this article is part of the debatable newsletter you can sign up here to receive it tuesdays and thursdays if you re a parent stuck at home with young children or hypothetically speaking if you re a childless millennial stuck in a dictionary size brooklyn apartment below another dictionary size brooklyn apartment in which said parent is having trouble keeping said young children quiet you are probably wondering when they can go back to school as my colleague katrin bennhold reports restarting classes is essential not only to parents mental health and children s development but also to reviving the economy which is why several countries have already done so when will the united states since the severity of the outbreak varies so widely across the country there isn t likely to be one answer said dr anthony s fauci the federal government s top infectious disease expert in testimony before congress on tuesday but here are some of the core questions that could affect the timeline no matter where you live absent a vaccine experts say mass testing is the only surefire way to keep the reopening of schools from becoming a disaster according to ms bennhold but mass testing remains the exception instead some countries such as japan and australia are opening in phases by staggering classes on different days in china students temperatures are checked before they can enter schools and cafeteria tables are outfitted with plastic dividers in germany class sizes have been halved hallways have one way traffic and teachers wear masks in taiwan so do students related 9 ways schools will look different when and if they reopen but whether these measures will be enough to prevent cases from surging remains to be seen even if they are applying them in the united states is going to be a scheduling nightmare a logistical nightmare randi weingarten the president of the american federation of teachers told npr after all how do you socially distance on a school bus ms weingarten heads one of the nation s two biggest teachers unions both of which have said they will consider strikes or major protests if schools reopen without proper safety measures in place or against the advice of medical experts and as kalyn belsha reports for chalkbeat some older or medically vulnerable teachers may not return at all unless there is a vaccine another obstacle to reopening is that the coronavirus may be more harmful to children than initially believed pam belluck reports for the times until recently there was a tentative consensus among public health experts that the coronavirus largely spared children its worst effects but last week gov andrew cuomo announced an alarming rise in a mysterious coronavirus related inflammatory syndrome that has sickened at least 100 children in new york and killed three the disease is serious but appears to be rare and treatable it s not like the fear of covid 19 where we know there are no treatments and it s a matter of luck according to dr charles schleien the chair of pediatrics at northwell health in new york who said he has seen about 40 cases of the illness since mid april it is highly likely that with treatment they re going to be fine and more generally it continues to be true that children are hit far less hard by the coronavirus than adults scientists still haven t reached a consensus about what role children play in spreading the coronavirus dr fauci has confirmed that very few children have become sick with covid 19 compared to adults but is that because children are resistant to infection or because they are infected but don t develop symptoms we still don t know some evidence does suggest that children may not pose a large transmission risk as david zweig writes for wired a study of a cluster of cases in the french alps for example found that a 9 year old with mild symptoms failed to infect anyone else despite visiting three schools while sick similarly a co author of one icelandic study of children under 10 said that his team didn t find a single instance of a child infecting parents but there have also been two studies that point the other way my colleague apoorva mandavilli reports while neither was dispositive assumptions that children won t spread the virus because they are less prone to severe illness are exactly the kind of assumption that you really really need to question in the face of a pandemic said dr bill hanage an epidemiologist at the harvard t h chan school of public health because if it s wrong it has really pretty disastrous consequences hopefully scientists will have more clarity on the matter by the fall last week the national institutes of health announced a study that will follow 6 000 people from 2 000 families over the next six months collecting information on which children get infected with the virus and whether they pass it on to other family members as long as schools remain closed the economy will continue to sputter kerry cavanaugh writes for the los angeles times unsurprisingly she says the political push in the united states to reopen the economy has almost completely overlooked the plight of working parents with nowhere to put their kids if the political leaders of the country are serious about rebooting businesses they have to recognize that child care is an essential piece of the country s economic infrastructure related the men pushing to open the economy clearly don t need child care school closures are also taking a toll on children s development the learning setbacks that occur over a summer vacation can easily wipe out one or two months of academic growth the times s editorial board writes so those caused by the pandemic could be generationally catastrophic by comparison the shift to online learning is almost certainly worsening educational inequality as anna north writes in vox about a fifth of students nationwide disproportionately those in low income families and families of color lack a computer and broadband internet access at home many also work in small shared spaces all while having to deal with the trauma of living in a pandemic without the protections wealth affords there are serious health consequences to keeping schools closed too as dr nina agrawal a pediatrician writes in the times when there is household dysfunction domestic violence parental substance abuse or a mental disorder the risk of child abuse goes up and there s reason to believe all of these things will increase during this pandemic she says and as the times columnist charles blow notes millions of children have lost the lifeline of school meals one of the country s most important defenses against hunger all of these considerations complicate the calculus of reopening how do you weigh the broad public health benefits of keeping schools closed against the acute harms it does to children who needless to say are also part of the public i don t have an easy answer to that dr fauci told congress on tuesday i just don t do you have a point of view we missed email
