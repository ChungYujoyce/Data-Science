minutes spoken in the second debate the candidates in the middle of the stage spoke for significantly longer than those on night one related the issues democrats are running on according to their social media biden a former vice president and senator from delaware has held a wide lead in the polls since entering the race faced with an increasingly young and liberal party base he has battled questions about his record on civil rights as well as a 1994 crime bill he wrote but has been buoyed by near universal name recognition on thursday he cast himself as the candidate able to win over working class americans and repeatedly attacked president trump he also said he has accomplished many things other candidates have only theorized about donald trump has put us in a horrible situation by awarding tax breaks to the wealthiest he said biden scuffled with sen kamala d harris over his comments about his civil relationship with segregationist senators and about his record on busing

from california and the only woman of black and indian descent onstage thursday has struggled to improve on the strong start to her campaign she has called for the impeachment of trump in the wake of the mueller report but has been criticized for not answering difficult questions about controversial elements of her record as a prosecutor and california attorney general on thursday she challenged biden on his statements about his past working with segregationist senators i do not believe you are a racist she said adding that as a second grader she helped integrate a school in berkeley calif but it was personal and actually very hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two senators who built their careers on segregation of race she was applauded for talking about how she would use the presidential bully pulpit i will ensure that this microphone that the president of the united states holds in her hand is used in a way that is about reflecting the values of our country sanders an independent senator from vermont has told supporters that the same too radical ideas he has been trumpeting for years have been co opted by his competitors he has been drawing a distinct line between himself and biden who knocked sanders from the top of early polls onstage with several candidates who are decades younger than him he also is trying to make the argument that a septuagenarian should be the face of revolutionary change in washington he talked about that revolution when asked how he would get his health care plan passed we ll do it the way real change has

save the life of eric logan and when i look into his mother s eyes i have to face the fact he also attacked trump s policy of separating parents and children detained at the u s mexico border saying
