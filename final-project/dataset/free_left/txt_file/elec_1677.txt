advertisement supported by by michael d shear washington president obama on sunday called hillary rodham clinton s use of a private email server a mistake but said it had not endangered national security and had been ginned up into a political attack by republicans eager to keep her from being president mr obama made the comments during an interview on cbs s 60 minutes program in which he also defended his policy in syria during a lengthy contentious exchange with steve kroft a veteran correspondent mrs clinton s use of the email server during her tenure as secretary of state has become the centerpiece of republican led investigations into the 2012 attacks in benghazi libya that killed four americans she is certain to face questions about the emails during tuesday s democratic presidential debate and later this month when she is set to appear before a house committee in the interview which was taped tuesday and broadcast sunday evening mr obama called those questions legitimate and said without directing the comments specifically at mrs clinton that public officials in high office should know better as a general proposition when we re in these offices we have to be more sensitive and stay as far away from the line as possible when it comes to how we handle information how we handle our own personal data mr obama said and you know she made a mistake she has acknowledged it the president said mrs clinton could have handled the original decision better and might have been quicker to disclose work related emails that had been kept on a private server outside government control mr obama said her possession of the email server is not a situation in which america s national security was endangered he declined to say whether the email controversy was not that big a deal but he chided mrs clinton s critics for their single minded focus on the issue the fact that for the last three months this is all that s been spoken about is an indication that we re in presidential political season he said on syria mr obama acknowledged the failure of his 500 million mission to train and equip as many as 5 000 fighters in the battle against the islamic state the president said he had long been skeptical that the program could create an effective proxy army but tried it anyway in an effort to confront what he called a difficult problem for the entire world community mr kroft repeatedly challenged the president on his policy in syria and at one point complained that mr obama was filibustering with long answers mr obama at times appeared exasperated by mr kroft s questions once responding if you ask me big open ended questions expect big open ended answers the president accused critics of expecting better results in syria after just a year of american intervention noting that afghanistan still needs attention over 13 years after the united states sent its military there he said the situation in syria would not be resolved by american troops resolving the underlying crisis is going to be something that requires ultimately the key players there to recognize that there has to be a transition to new government he said and in the absence of that it s not going to work mr obama angrily rejected the idea that president vladimir v putin of russia is challenging american leadership by using fighter jets and missiles in syria if you think that running your economy into the ground and having to send troops in in order to prop up your only ally is leadership then we ve got a different definition of leadership mr obama said he added later the fact that they had to do this is not an indication of strength mr putin s aggressive moves into syria in particular strikes by warplanes and missiles in the last several weeks appeared to take the united states government by surprise but mr obama suggested in the interview that officials had some warning of the russian plans we had pretty good intelligence he said in response to a question about whether mr putin told the president about the military moves when the two met at the united nations last month we knew that he was planning to provide the military assistance that assad was needing mr obama continued referring to the syrian president bashar al assad because they were nervous about a potential imminent collapse of the regime advertisement
