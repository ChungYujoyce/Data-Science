matters it is great to have you on the show anna fifield thank you i m so happy to be here michael morell so your book the great successor was published last week it s fascinating it s a must read i think for anyone interested in north korea and it has one of the best subtitles that i ve ever seen the divinely perfect destiny of brilliant comrade kim jong un it sounds like they actually wrote that anna fifield yeah well those are all words that the north koreans have said at one stage and we just took a little liberty in arranging them in that order michael morell it s wonderful i d love to start with something that struck me right off the bat which is the cover of the book it s bright red with a caricature of kim jong un why that design anna fifield yeah so this was the publisher s design and their decision based on what they know about the book world and i don t i mean the whole thesis of the book is that he s not a cartoon character that he is somebody that we ought to be taking seriously but having said that there is something of the wacky about him i think this taps into the bizarre side of it michael morell so you reconstruct his past all the way up to the present and i want to get into all of that in detail but before doing that i want to ask you a couple questions about the book and i think the first one is what drew you to writing about him anna fifield i had been covering north korea for some years and i did not think that kim jong un could do it that he would be able to perpetuate the system which should by rights have collapsed many years before i mean partly because it was such an anachronistic system but also because he was so young and inexperienced and i couldn t imagine how he would have the wherewithal to do it and how the old guard who d served his grandfather and his father and is still very much there in pyongyang how they would tolerate it so partly it was just this fascination of how had he managed to do it the first time i went back to pyongyang under his reign i was astonished to see this showcase capital and it is a showcase capital but it was looking so much better he had managed to give the showcase a makeover so i wanted to go and report out and show how he had actually managed to defy all these expectations michael morell so how did you go about writing the book where did you go who did you talk to to the extent that you can share that with us how long did it take how did you go about this anna fifield yeah it took about two years i set out to find every person who had ever met kim jong un so i was living in japan i went and met several times with the japanese sushi chef who had worked in the royal household while kim jong un was a boy i found his aunt and uncle who had been his guardians in switzerland while he was at school there and who had defected to the united states and i convinced them to talk to me it s the only time that they ve ever talked on the record about kim jong un and what he was like as a child there are some people in switzerland still who have met him the teachers the school classmates but after that after he returns to north korea when he s 16 years old the trail really goes cold he went into the north korean equivalent of west point and then seemed to be on this kind of dictatorial apprenticeship for ten years while he was training to be his father s successor so after that it became more difficult but i did try to find anybody who had met him after he took over you know diplomats who had shaken his hand one time and things no encounter was too trivial as i looked for clues into this man but then in 2018 it suddenly became a whole lot easier because it seemed like everybody had met him michael morell so did you travel to north korea to research the book anna fifield i was traveling to north korea in the course of my job anyway but the whole time i had it in the back of my mind that i wanted to write this and i was looking for insights into not so much him because obviously access is very limited to say the least but into how the city pyongyang the home of the regime had changed the kinds of changes he had made with the economy to show how he had retained control so there were a lot of clues to be gleaned from pyongyang michael morell and when you went to north korea while writing a book did they know you were writing a book anna fifield they did not know i was writing a book but they knew that i was the washington post correspondent and i was there to report for the washington post i ve always been upfront about what i m doing and who i am michael morell so what is it like to travel there as a reporter anna fifield it is so frustrating because we re so excited it s difficult to get into north korea so when you get there you re very pleased to be able to go in and very hopeful that you ll be able to get some insight into the system operates and then once you re there you re frustrated at every turn because i have been to kim il sung s fake birthplace seven times i have never gotten any news out of it it s very difficult to find new things or to find out really what the truth is they just want you to see the myths michael morell you mentioned that you usually have two minders a good minder and a bad minder what do you mean by that anna fifield yeah i mean north koreans always travel everywhere in pairs because they need to keep an eye on each other as well as to keep an eye on me so there is always two minders sometimes it s a driver and a minder whatever but yeah i had a good cop and a bad cop and one of them his job was to say no to every request and i tried to make my requests reasonable it was like can i interview an economics professor at a university and it was always no no no and then there was one guy who was more jovial michael morell do you have the same minders each time so it s possible to build rapport or no anna fifield no i would never have the same minders for that exact reason they don t want us to build a rapport with them michael morell interesting so you ve traveled there many times i think a dozen times anna fifield uh huh affirm michael morell what s the most striking thing that you ve ever seen anna fifield the most striking thing michael morell memorable most striking what are the things that really stand out to you about your travels there anna fifield i think we see so much about north korea and so many pictures and things and we know that the country is very poor but there are many places that are very poor the thing that surprises me and that feels palpable when you re there is kind of how afraid people are if they see a foreigner outside walking towards them they ll cross the street or look down they don t want anything to do with you because it s just so dangerous so as a reporter my job is to go out and talk to people i never tried to talk to people in north korea because i am simply endangering those people michael morell because of the risk you put them under anna fifield yeah the risk i put them under i won t get anything from them i will jeopardize them the minders and everybody else around will report it so i get my real reporting from north korea from outside the country from people who ve just escaped you know a week before and are living and hiding in china or somewhere michael morell so anna i want to jump into the book itself and i want to start with its protagonist kim jong un broadly speaking how would you describe him as a person anna fifield he is a very ruthless and shrewd person when he came in there was this tendency to view him like a joke like a cartoon character everybody from john mccain to president trump calling him some version of crazy but he is not crazy he has acted in a way that is very calculated and rational to be able to hold on to power there and many of the things he has done have been very brutal like having people executed but that kind of behavior makes sense if you re a totalitarian autocrat trying to keep ahold of power one of the things i looked at you know i looked a lot at his childhood and the kind of upbringing he had and he had such a dysfunctional abnormal childhood he was cloistered onto this compound in pyongyang or other royal residences around the country he didn t have any relationship with his other half siblings he only knew his older brother and younger sister so he didn t have a chance to act normally with other children to play he didn t go to school he had tutors at home so he didn t socialize really in a way or didn t learn to play nice in a way that other normal children did so looking at it i think it would ve been very difficult for him to grow up kind of any other way than he did michael morell so how did those early parts of his childhood end up shaping him do you think anna fifield he has been used to being treated like a little demigod from the earliest age on his eighth birthday he was presented with a general s uniform complete with gold buttons and epaulets and things and he was announced as his father s successor then and there were real generals at that birthday party who were saluting him and bowing to him and deferring to him from that age so as his aunt told me from that day on it was impossible for anybody to treat him normally because he had the sense of entitlement and everybody else around him had been told that he would be inheriting this family dynasty michael morell you tell an interesting story about the japanese sushi chef and that moment right can you talk about that anna fifield yeah that s right when the sushi chef met kim jong un for the first time they were lined up in a receiving line to greet the two little generals kim jong un and his older brother and he said that kim jong chul the oldest son of that side of the family was relatively forthcoming and shook his hand and acted normally but kim jong un stared into his eyes and tried to stare down this 40 year old man and assert himself over him which he said was very odd at the time michael morell and then he spends this time in switzerland about five years right what is that like for him and how did that shape him anna fifield yeah i mean in some ways he was living a great lifestyle there and that he was any kind of like spoiled ex pat kid he was going off to paris to disneyland he was swimming in the french mediterranean and going to italy and eating pizza and enjoying all of these benefits of living in europe and they clearly had money to fund the children s lifestyle there but at the same time he was living a very normal existence compared to what he was living in pyongyang where he did live in a palace and was treated in this very deferential way once he got to switzerland he was posing as the son of north korean diplomats he was going to an ordinary school he struggled in school partly because of the language difficulties and he stuck together with other immigrant kids there they were his main friends so it was not a particularly fun experience for him i think so many people thought when he came to power that he would be a different kind of north korean leader because of this formative experience in a liberal democracy i concluded the exact opposite was the case in that his experiences in switzerland would have reinforced to him that if it wasn t for this system that he grew up in north korea if he was out in the real world he wouldn t be special at all he d be normal he d be nobody you know he would not be feted as this little demigod like he was used to michael morell so you dedicate a lot of research in the book to kim jong un but you also take a look at his family and ancestors and i m going to ask you a couple of questions about them maybe starting with his grandfather kim il sung talk about him a little bit and the impact that he may have had on kim jong un anna fifield yeah so kim il sung was the founding president of north korea installed by the soviets after the end of world war ii and he is very much associated even today with good times in north korea that north korea was relatively prosperous back then the economy was bigger than south korea it had strong benefactors in the soviet union and china so even now you ll find escapees from north korea who will think fondly or remember fondly kim il sung but he started this personality cult this propaganda that went way beyond anything that the soviets or mao zedong in china ever did and created this myth around the family that they had this divine provenance coming from a mythical mountain in north korea called mount paektu and so he started the symptom and very much wanted it to pass down the family line it went to his son kim jong il who was a very different kind of person he was quite introverted and did not seem to enjoy his lot in life there michael morell he didn t have the charisma of his father anna fifield he did not have the charisma then along comes kim jong un number three he s very much a carbon copy of kim il sung part of that is by design like the weight gain and the haircut and the outfits and even his glasses and things it s all very much vintage kim il sung because he wants to remind people of the good times in north korea and remind them of this provenance which gives him his legitimacy but it s striking how similar he is in personality to his grandfather he s very extroverted and gregarious charismatic and how different he is from kim number two kim jong il he spoke in public only one time in 17 years and that was one single sentence michael morell so that s pretty savvy for a young man to think about playing to his people that way anna fifield yeah it is i mean part of the thing i wanted to try to figure out is how does he know how to do this stuff is it innate did he just absorb it growing up in the system did he have advisors to tell him this and it s still not clear but what is clear is that he has proven much more canny than anybody ever expected michael morell do we know anything about the kind of relationship he had with his grandfather i guess kim jong un was about ten when kim il sung died anna fifield yeah that s right he probably met him he was not a secret like kim jong nam was but there is no photograph of kim il sung and kim jong un together or no photograph that s ever been made public and we would expect it to be made public because of the strong family relationship and through the course of my reporting i discovered that this is one of the reasons why kim jong un disliked his uncle jang song thaek so much this is the uncle he had executed at the end of 2013 he thought this uncle had been an impediment to him having that photo with his grandfather having proper access to his grandfather and had kind of delegitimized him in a way michael morell and this was the execution that surprised everybody because the uncle was the one who was supposed to guide him in his leadership of the country anna fifield that s right the uncle was supposed to be the regent keeping tabs and helping him through michael morell and then what about his relationship with his father kim jong il what do we know about that anna fifield he did spend quite a lot of time with his father growing up kim jong nam and his cousin who lived with him kind of as his sister they were complaining a lot that kim jong il was never there in their royal household because he was off with this next family they were quite jealous of that so yeah kim jong un did have a relationship with his father growing up and seems to have been taken under his wing as the inheritor michael morell so anna a couple more questions about his relatives so his siblings two in particular that i d like to ask you about one is his sister kim yo jong and the other is kim jong nam could you talk about both of those and the way he interacted with them the way he saw them and particularly with regard to kim jong nam what led to his death ultimately anna fifield kim jong nam was the firstborn son of kim jong il which according to the confucian hierarchies of korean culture he should have been the successor he should have taken over but he did not partly i think because of his mother and kim jong un s mother they had very strong influences but kim jong nam s mother went to moscow when he was only three years old and was kind of out of the picture for the rest of kim jong nam s life there whereas kim jong un s mother was very active there in pyongyang where she was like de facto first lady was really agitating for her sons one of them to be the successor to this regime so kim jong un and kim jong nam had no relationship at all as far as i can tell it s not certain that they ever even met each other but still kim jong nam as the firstborn son of this bloodline which is very important in korean culture could claim the right to be the leader of north korea so i think kim jong un viewed him as a real rival as somebody who could pose a threat to his role even though kim jong nam showed no interest whatsoever in becoming the leader of north korea and that may have been one of the reasons why kim jong un decided to have his brother assassinated in very gruesome fashion in kuala lumpur airport but also during the course of my reporting i was told that kim jong nam had been an informant for the cia and had been providing information to american intelligence operatives in southeast asia he d been meeting them in malaysia and singapore to provide information on what he knew about the regime and he did even though he had fallen out with his younger brother he still did have good contacts in the regime he still met people at a high level so could be thought to have reasonable intelligence michael morell and if kim jong un found out about that that would be another reason to move against him anna fifield it sure would yeah so he is very much at a distance from kim jong un as opposed to his sister kim yo jong who s younger than him and she is very much playing a supportive role to her brother making sure that his leadership everything runs smoothly she is like his executive assistant and choreographer and publicist all in one so we ve seen her at all of the summits clearly working like she is the one who brings the pen out of her bag so he can sign the agreements and she s the one making sure everything runs smoothly so her job is to make sure that her brother looks as good as possible michael morell so kim jong un comes back from switzerland and he begins the grooming process in a number of different ways and then his father dies and he becomes the leader and as you said you thought he might not be able to sustain this there were many many people who thought that way i can tell you why was he able to do that what did you conclude at the end of the day anna fifield i concluded he was able to do it by being very strategic and having a game plan i think from the get go he laid out very early on this two track strategy byungjin policy that he wanted to follow also something that his grandfather had started but had fallen by the wayside so he very deliberately focused first of all on the nuclear program as a way to show a sign of strength perhaps as a way to placate the military hardliners who may have had misgivings about this person who was supposedly a marshal yet had not spent any time at all in the military and as a way to fend off any threat from the united states and so he made astonishing progress in his nuclear program you know there was a lot of laughing at the idea when they were announcing that they would develop a hydrogen bomb and they were building an intercontinental ballistic missile but they did it there s credible proof that they did it and so i think that was very definitely by design and then now he is turning to the second part of that two track project which is economic development that he is trying to grow the economy around the country a little bit so that he can say to the people of north korea who he does not care about whatsoever none of this is designed to raise the living standards for any good reasons of the people of north korea it s all about him staying in power but he wants to be able to say to them look your life is getting better under my great leadership michael morell so how has he changed as a ruler during his time in power anna fifield i think he s become much more confident i was in pyongyang in 2016 for the workers party congress which is the first time in a generation one of these communist party meetings had been called and i just watched him standing there on a stage in front of three and a half thousand top brass and top party officials holding forth for well over an hour talking about his plans for north korea and he laid out a five year economic plan which had not been done in north korea for a long time but i also thought was very bold because he was really staking his reputation on this he was owning this policy and so if it didn t work he could be held accountable for it so i think he is really growing into this role and is able to portray strength and confidence and also able to turn on the charm after all of these years of threats and saber rattling and things we saw him trying to appear as this benevolent dictator you know coming out into the outside world in 2018 and trying to present himself as a totally reasonable responsible leader of a nuclear armed state and somebody who should be viewed as an equivalent a peer of the president of the united states and china and south korea michael morell is the focus on the economy paying off are living standards getting better anna fifield they are in general a tiny tiny bit for the majority of north koreans life is still extremely hard many people do not have electricity they do not have running water they may not be starving but they are malnourished it s unusual for people outside the big cities to get meat or other forms of protein so life is still very difficult for many people but because he has tolerated the growth of private markets and private enterprise in north korea people are now much more than ever allowed to be entrepreneurial allowed to make their own money and to be independent of the state so thanks to kim jong un simply tolerating this not actually doing anything to encourage it people are able to earn their own money and earn their own way to a better standard of living slightly michael morell so you actually talk about the class system in north korea and i found that interesting can you talk about that a little bit anna fifield yeah north korea has this very highly structured class system called songbun where the society is broken up into three main categories the people who are loyal to the regime the people who are wavering in the middle and then the people considered hostile and they are people who may come from christian backgrounds or have links to japan or have collaborated with japanese you know many generations ago during the colonial period michael morell so they may not actually be hostile but they re part of a group that is considered a risk anna fifield yes and they are consigned that for life and in north korea it s very easy to move down the classes to run afoul of the system it s very difficult to work your way up the system in terms of like political standing and everything is really decided according to the system the people who are considered loyal they go to kim il sung university the harvard of north korea they get the best jobs they live well they re the ones who get the food if there is food to go around so everything is dependent on your political loyalty to this regime michael morell and you re born into this class system anna fifield you are born into this class system michael morell so anna as the leader of north korea what are kim jong un s goals what are his objectives what does he want anna fifield he wants one thing he wants to stay in power that is his number one goal when he wakes up every morning that s it how does he maintain his grip on this regime and his family s position at the top of the society these autocrats dictators by nature are a paranoid bunch he s constantly thinking about how he keeps his position so i think everything that he does the nuclear program the executions the lavishing riches on the elite who keep him in power now the economic improvements north korea doesn t like to call them reforms because that implies there s something wrong with the system all of that is designed about maintaining his leadership of north korea and his family s plum position there michael morell why is the nuclear program so important to that anna fifield because he came in he was so unqualified he didn t seem to have any qualification for the job apart from being the scion of this family but having this nuclear program is the ultimate weapon for the military the military who may have had misgivings about him must have been thrilled to suddenly have the bomb and he s feted them a lot the lavish banquets and concerts where they are treated like rock stars in north korea but also and this is something i think is often really missed about north korea the nuclear program is a source of immense national pride for ordinary north koreans even amongst those who detest the regime and there s one person who really sticks in my mind he was a science student at a university in north korea and he absolutely hated this regime when kim jong un took over he knew he had to escape because he just couldn t tolerate a third generation but he described to me learning about the nuclear program in his physics class at university and feeling so proud that north korea had been able to develop this program that south korea and japan had not been able to michael morell interesting why do you think kim jong un came to the negotiating table when he did why do you think he reached out when he did anna fifield i think it s a combination of two things partly it s because as the north koreans announced at the end of 2017 they had completed their missile program he felt that he had gone as far as he needed to in terms of demonstrating this nuclear missile capability but also i think the maximum pressure campaign really did have an impact on him because the chinese who share this long border with north korea you know 90 of north korea s trade goes to or through china the chinese really started implementing sanctions like they had never done before because they were so worried that president trump was serious about raining down fire and fury on north korea the chinese wanted to show that sanctions could work so they enforced the sanctions very strictly at the border and that began to hurt north korea michael morell yeah really for the first time anna fifield for the first time yeah and i think the combination of those two things is what brought kim jong un michael morell so one is coming to the table from a position of strength having the deterrence of a nuclear program and the other is from weakness right from the sanctions biting anna fifield exactly yeah michael morell interesting so here s the ultimate question which is can you envision a set of circumstances by which he is willing to give up his nuclear program or not anna fifield i cannot i mean i can t imagine him feeling secure enough to give them up you know he s invested so much in this program and so much of his legitimacy rests on these weapons and also remember when he was taking over the arab spring was happening he saw muammar gaddafi who struck a deal with the united states to give up his nuclear weapons dragged from a ditch and killed so i think this really has been seared in his mind and that s why to this day the north koreans really object very strongly when john bolton talks about the libya model because that doesn t hold any attraction for them so i can t see a situation where he would be willing to give everything up i can see him trading away some of his capability in the course of this process if things go well but also you know it s very early days you know maybe down the line you know anything is possible but right now i can t see it michael morell so how do you think he thinks about u s policy and where the u s is coming from and how do you think he thinks about president trump anna fifield yeah the north koreans like pretty much everybody else was very puzzled by president trump and his way of doing business when he came in you know they didn t understand what the tweets mean what s twitter policy and things so that s no different from china or south korea or japan or any other of these countries but the north koreans have really studied donald trump a lot and there s a lot out there for them to crib from they ve read the art of the deal i know that people in north korea have read fire and fury this expose about inside trump s white house michael morell we know they listen to intelligence matters anna fifield you do michael morell yeah anna fifield that s fascinating you know i ve heard about north koreans have attended talks with americans and have demonstrated this encyclopedic knowledge of president trump s tweets they pay attention to everything and you can see that they ve kind of figured out what pushes his buttons it s no coincidence that kim jong chol the emissary arrived in the white house oval office with this huge envelope because he knew that trump would love that and he did so they have really studied him and tried to figure out how to interact with him in a way that gives them an advantage because they know far more about donald trump than the americans know about kim jong un michael morell so anna you ve been terrific with your time just a couple more questions one is are you optimistic pessimistic about u s north korean relations anna fifield you know after all these years covering north korea i should know better than to be optimistic you re usually right if you re pessimistic about north korea before the singapore summit i did feel quite optimistic and i retain a little bit of that to this day because i think kim jong un is a very unconventional north korean leader in that he has been very bold and audacious and being willing to advertise that he s traveling outside the country and meeting donald trump in hanoi before it even happened you know that was very risky especially since hanoi was a disaster but also the united states has a very unconventional leader in somebody who s been willing to do things differently from before as unlikely as it seems maybe they can figure out some way to break this deadlock because what i do know is that the traditional way of dealing with north korea 30 years of doing the same thing has not worked michael morell right anna fifield so let s try something different michael morell so the second question is what do you think he would think of your book anna fifield kim jong un michael morell yeah anna fifield i think he would not like it i did not write it for him to like it but even though i have given him a lot of credit for his savvy and the way that he has managed to hold on to power seven and a half years on but i also have outlined the way he s done it the brutality the ruthlessness and i expect that they will not like it michael morell and then the last question i find it interesting that your book has 16 chapters but you break it into three sections so you break it into the apprenticeship the consolidation and the confidence which we ve talked about all three of those right and i m wondering if you wrote this book ten to 15 years from now would there be another section and what might it be i know that s a tough question anna fifield that is a tough question wow you know it s so hard to predict anything about north korea and you know i start the book by saying i m writing this because my predictions were wrong michael morell well i used to work on it a long long time ago and i thought it wasn t going to last another five years anna fifield yes i mean there are declassified cia cables from the 60s giving it five years right michael morell yes anna fifield you know anything is possible but i can see a situation where kim jong un has managed to hold on he does not seem to be anything but in control of the regime right now but who knows what could happen you know look at him i think the biggest risk to north korea is his health he is very unhealthy for a 35 year old and if he s really worried about staying in power he should quit smoking and start exercising michael morell anna thank you so much for your time anna fifield thank you michael morell the book is the great successor and the author is anna fifield anna fifield great thank you for having me end of transcript first published on june
