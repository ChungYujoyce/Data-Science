how to access the direct payments unemployment insurance and small business loans in the cares act the early numbers from the coronavirus economic crisis are grim millions of americans are waiting for federal help in the form of direct payments unemployment insurance benefits or food assistance in march congress officially passed a 2 trillion stimulus package called the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act aimed at helping workers businesses and states deal with the economic fallout from efforts to curb the coronavirus outbreak though relief is on the way there may be frustrating delays in getting assistance due to the overwhelming demand and unprecedented nature of some of these programs for instance there are reports of unemployment websites crashing and jammed phone lines in new york and florida as state agencies struggle to keep up with so many new people needing services the channels for obtaining this stimulus also vary for some aspects of it like the 1 200 direct payments that will go out to most workers the distribution of these funds will largely be automatic if individuals have filed a tax return in the past two years more on that below for others including unemployment insurance and small business loans people will have to apply with their individual state agencies and banks while the stimulus aims to infuse the economy with support for workers and businesses there s still a lot of confusion about how to get that help vox has answered nine of your key questions about the stimulus bill below each state has its own unemployment office if you have been laid off or furloughed from your job you can file there either online or by calling each state has its own guidance but due to high demand some states are advising people to call on certain days or at certain times depending on the alphabetical order of their last names or order of their social security numbers many states are also recommending filing online over calling due to busy phone lines vox has put together a chart of each state s base weekly unemployment insurance benefits and links to each state s unemployment website where you can get the process started the new stimulus will add 600 per week to that base amount for four months until the end of july the delays to sign up will be frustrating some are much better prepared than others or just have a different timetable so one of the things we may have to do is get more resources to the state agencies that do this house speaker nancy pelosi told vox on a recent press call part of the reason there s such a high demand is more people are now eligible for benefits the cares act opened up unemployment benefits to a range of people who weren t eligible before including gig economy workers like drivers for uber or lyft freelancers and independent contractors part time employees who lost their jobs due to the coronavirus will also be covered as will people who had to stop working to take care of a sick member of their family or homeschool their children bottom line if the coronavirus is responsible for your layoff furlough or drastic reduction of your hours or is preventing you from finding work because fewer employers are hiring you have a good chance of getting these expanded benefits it s worth applying as soon as possible through your state s website or phone lines even if you are unsure whether you ll be covered laid off or furloughed americans who file for unemployment through their states will see an extra 600 per week added to that existing state benefit through the end of july the average benefit in the us is about 385 per week but some states are more generous than others for instance the maximum weekly benefit in arizona is 240 per week while the maximum weekly benefit in washington state is 790 just the increased 600 per week benefit alone adds up to about 10 000 over four months said andy stettner a senior fellow at the century foundation it s an attempt to ease the financial burden of laid off workers struggling to make ends meet that is a way to get a lot more money to people who really need it he said it has the ability to prevent some of the real damaging parts of unemployment reducing your savings food security having trouble maintaining your housing many states are cautioning they don t yet know when the additional federal money will show up but are still telling newly laid off people to file a claim and get the process started the process could be a bit more complex for contract or self employed workers who need to file for a newly created program called pandemic unemployment assistance and are waiting for states to set up these programs experts said these people should still file claims as soon as possible rather than waiting people who were already on unemployment and in the system before the coronavirus hit could see the changes happen the fastest it could take a bit longer for millions of folks who are filing for unemployment all at once because states are still processing their claims the system s a little clogged up right now said michele evermore a senior policy analyst at the national employment law project people should keep trying evermore noted that even if some workers are being told they re not eligible this week that could change in the coming weeks as states start receiving the federal money for more information check out this guide on how to receive unemployment benefits direct payments will be distributed based on the adjusted gross income that s reported on an individual s or couple s 2018 and 2019 tax returns broken down as follows there are also some key nuances to keep in mind if you have not filed a tax return for either of those years because your gross income is below the 12 200 threshold or for other reasons that mean you aren t required to file taxes the irs now provides an online form for people to submit their information so they can receive these payments that form can be accessed here information required for this form includes social security number name address and details about dependents completing this form does not put people on the hook for any taxes but it is required to obtain the direct payment and including bank account deposit information can expedite the processing of that payment for more information check out this explainer from vox s dylan matthews the answer to this question depends on if you have filed taxes in 2018 or 2019 the get my payment tool is now live though it s faced some glitches in case you receive an error while trying to use this tool check back in the coming days the irs has said it s still updating the information for the portal and working on fixing problems that have come up the timing of payments will likely depend on how quickly this direct deposit information is processed people will also be able to check the status of their payment via this tool the irs is also able to mail checks directly to the address listed on the tax return but mailed checks are expected to take up to 20 weeks or five months the post indicates that individuals receiving checks by mail may not get up them until as late as september according to usa today the earliest round of checks will be sent either later this month or in early may there are two main loan programs that include stimulus funds for small businesses and nonprofits the economic injury disaster loan program and the paycheck protection program the two offer slightly different options aimed at helping both small businesses and private nonprofits deal with temporary closures and losses that are a result of the coronavirus outbreak here s what both include applications for the eidl are handled directly by the small business administration so organizations can apply directly on the agency s website the application is for the broader loan but businesses can indicate that they want the 10 000 grant as part of it any business that feels it has incurred damages since a public health emergency was declared on january 31 2020 is eligible to apply businesses are able to apply for 2 5 times their monthly payroll costs up to 10 million and they can use any funds they receive to cover worker salaries rent and utilities businesses and nonprofits can apply for the ppp directly with their banks or lenders it s worth noting that businesses and nonprofits can apply to both loan programs and ultimately receive both if they do not use the money for the same purpose a business could not use an eidl loan to pay april payroll and then use ppp to do the same for example organizations could also refinance an eidl loan they ve received since january 31 2020 into a ppp loan for both businesses and nonprofits are encouraged to apply as quickly as possible given the expectation that there will be high demand for the programs since both also have a limited amount of funding applying sooner is also important in case their allocated funding is fully used because the eidl is already set up experts tell vox that the 10 000 grant it provides could be the fastest way for businesses and nonprofits trying to get money more quickly once the ppp is fully established treasury secretary steven mnuchin has said that he expects loans will be turned around on the same day as the application since ppp is a new program however it could take a few days or weeks before it s fully functional the federal government is automatically suspending direct government student loan payments from mid march until september 30 2020 which will impact the vast majority of student loan borrowers loans that are eligible for suspension include direct loans from the federal government received anytime in the past 10 years interest payments on these loans will also be suspended automatically students don t need to take any action for this to go into effect but they should check their individual loan provider for more information loans that are not eligible to be suspended include those from private lenders like sallie mae or wells fargo federal family educational loans ffel not owned by the us department of education perkins loans or loans from states however borrowers could consolidate their perkins loans and ffel loans into a direct consolidation loan in order to qualify for relief or a zero percent interest rate if you re not sure what type of loan you have you should contact your loan servicer if you are still employed and have a stable income right now you can still keep making payments on your loans which will go to paying off your accumulated interest and principal but not every federal loan qualifies this may only be a good idea if you re on a standard 10 year loan not on income based repayment wage garnishing for those who were previously behind on their federal student loan payments will also be suspended for six months recent college graduates or those who are about to enter the workforce at this time are at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for unemployment benefits because of their limited work history there s a provision in a bill from house democrats that would allow recent college graduates to qualify for something called a job seekers allowance which is about half of the benefits available for the rest of workers but that didn t make it into the final cares act and unless congress includes this in a future relief bill recent college graduates are in a tough spot to get federal unemployment assistance so far there is no national rent or mortgage freeze but certain states and cities are passing laws or putting in temporary measures to keep people in their homes so far 34 states and washington dc have passed measures to temporarily bar evictions according to usa today maine new hampshire new york massachusetts pennsylvania new jersey connecticut rhode island virginia maryland delaware kentucky west virginia tennessee north carolina south carolina louisiana oklahoma texas nebraska kansas wisconsin north dakota minnesota illinois michigan indiana iowa arizona nevada california oregon washington and hawaii some municipalities want to go further the boston city council recently passed a nonbinding resolution calling for an end to rent and mortgage collection during the coronavirus outbreak but it s not legally binding unless boston mayor marty walsh or massachusetts gov charlie baker agrees to it expanded unemployment insurance will theoretically help people pay their rent but that program only runs until july and we still don t know how long the coronavirus will keep all of us social distancing vox recently asked pelosi whether congress should pass a rent moratorium while pelosi didn t endorse that idea specifically she said future bills need to contain stronger provision for renters it s a very big challenge and it s frightening to people because they re shelter ing in place and then they re evicted pelosi told vox what how do we deal with that there are some provisions in the cares act we certainly must do more recent bills have added more funding to the snap program also known as food stamps as well as wic a nutrition program focused on providing food for women and children additionally the department of agriculture has relaxed requirements for some of the aid it oversees including coverage of school lunches for children who are now staying at home because of the coronavirus the cares act contains 15 billion for food stamps 450 million for food banks and 8 8 billion for childhood nutrition programs these funds are in addition to money passed in the families first act the second coronavirus relief bill congress took up that contained 500 million for wic and 400 million for the emergency food assistance program which helps local food banks procure supplies pelosi has made it clear she plans to ask for more money in future bills applications for both snap and wic are handled individually by different states links to each state s website can be found here for snap and here for wic depending on the state people are able to apply via phone online or in person recipients for both programs need to meet eligibility criteria based on income and resources limits like household assets etc importantly you can receive snap if you are don t have a fixed address or a place to stay here s more information on snap eligibility requirements and wic eligibility requirements snap applications are typically processed within 30 days though applications can be expedited so benefits start coming in as quickly as within seven days additionally existing snap recipients could see more money directly deposited into their ebt accounts if they aren t already receiving the maximum amount that each state allocates for their family size the additional funding in recent stimulus bills is being used to make sure that states could distribute the maximum amount of money every family can receive in both march and april families that have students who were previously receiving reduced or free lunches in school will also receive additional funds to cover these costs those that are already on snap will see this money added automatically while those who are not on snap will have to fill out an application this program is being implemented state by state so applications will be handled directly on state websites more information is expected as it s implemented this month if you are able to help small businesses struggling with coronavirus closures and workers who are dealing with layoffs there are several ways you can contribute additionally if there are other businesses you work with on a regular basis like hairstylists or child care workers who are currently unable to do their jobs prepay for future sessions now or keep paying the regular amount you would if there were no coronavirus crisis journalist yashar ali for example has a crowdfunding campaign he started to send money to hourly workers who ve been laid off or negatively affected by business closures related to the coronavirus many businesses have also used their social media platforms to let their customers know about other funding campaigns they may be doing as well other organizations working to address the effects of the coronavirus include the national domestic workers alliance which is raising funds to give out 400 in emergency assistance to home care workers nannies and house cleaners or no kid hungry which is focused on providing food for children who are currently sheltering in place support vox s explanatory journalism
