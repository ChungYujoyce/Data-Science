advertisement supported by a sinking feeling reminiscent of the global financial crisis when all kinds of obscure markets went haywire by neil irwin it has been an unsettling week on global financial markets and not just because the stock market has fallen sharply enough to bring a decade plus bull market to an end underneath the headline numbers were a series of movements that don t really make sense when lined up against one another they amount to signs not definitive but worrying that something is breaking down in the workings of the financial system even if it s not totally clear what that is just yet bond prices and stock prices have moved together not in opposite directions as they usually do on a day when major economic disruptions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic appeared to become likelier which might be expected to make typical market safe havens more popular many of them fell instead wednesday that included bonds of all sorts and gold and there were reports from trading desks that many assets that are normally liquid easy to buy and sell were freezing up with securities not trading widely this was true of the bonds issued by municipalities and major corporations but more curiously also of treasury bonds normally the bedrock of the global financial system people it is fair to say are worried about bond market liquidity any one of these moves on its own wouldn t really matter markets can move for all kinds of reasons most of which affect only the investors and traders involved but these types of swings give experienced financial market watchers a sinking feeling the kind last felt widely during the global financial crisis when all kinds of obscure financial markets went haywire suppose you looked at the score of a football game and it was a 31 3 blowout you would have a pretty good guess about what had happened the winning team s offense must have gained huge amounts of yardage enabling it to score all those points while its defense was tough and prevented the opposing team from gaining much yardage that guess would usually be correct but once in a while when you look deeper into the statistics you might see that the opposite happened for example a winning team that scored lots of points despite not gaining much yardage with an opponent that did the reverse it would tell you that a deeply strange game had been played the global financial markets this week and especially wednesday have been that very weird game of football at some point the weirdness can be as important as the final score in terms of understanding what is likely to happen in the future consider the most basic two types of assets stocks and bonds normally especially in times of financial stress these move in opposite directions when there is good news and the outlook is bright it is known as a risk on day meaning people are comfortable buying risky assets like stocks driving up their price while driving down the price of safer assets like bonds a risk off day is the reverse a day that investors plow money into safe assets out of fear of what will happen next it reflects a flight to safety and a reasonable expectation that if conditions worsen the federal reserve is more likely to lower interest rates which as a matter of arithmetic justifies higher bond prices that has been an extremely powerful relationship through most of this year and indeed most of the 12 years since the global financial crisis that s why it was odd that on wednesday and thursday as the s p 500 was down an astonishing 14 percent the benchmark 10 year treasury bond yield rose by about 0 10 percentage points there has also been a wide gap between the prices of certain exchange traded funds which are easily traded and the securities on which those funds are based this is irrational in theory the equivalent of a 12 pack of soda selling for more than the price of 12 individual sodas it suggests two things sellers desperate to raise cash and an absence of big banks or hedge funds in position to exploit the mispricing gold futures have been falling despite gold s historical role as a place for safety during tumultuous economic times its price has fallen to 1 610 on thursday from 1 675 an ounce at monday s close all this suggests that major financial players are experiencing a cash crunch and are selling whatever they can as a result that would help explain the seeming contradiction of assets that should go up in value in a time of economic peril instead falling in value updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities as the 2008 experience shows it s also a type of problem that the federal reserve is relatively well positioned to understand and respond to in its role as lender of last resort the central bank s job is to try to prevent a cash crunch in the economy even if it has to take unusual means to do that an announcement by the fed on thursday afternoon it plans to inject up to 1 5 trillion in the financial system by the end of the week and begin buying a wide range of treasury bonds was meant to ease the strained liquidity but in the hours after the announcement there was precious little evidence it had succeeded in the global financial crisis 12 years ago the fed s response included an alphabet soup of complex programs with names like term securities lending facility and primary dealer credit facility the programs were meant to pump liquidity into various corners of the financial system fed officials are probably spending their days and nights trying to sort out exactly what is going wrong in the current episode and what approach is best for bringing markets toward normal the volatility in markets in the last few weeks reflects the deep uncertainty about the near future of the world economy but for now it is being compounded by something strange happening just beneath the surface creating ripples like the ones that are evident in this tumultuous week advertisement
