advertisement supported by news analysis by michael barbaro and ashley parker in his emotional seven minute farewell to a republican party that elevated his father and brother to the white house there were two words that a choked up jeb bush could not bring himself to utter donald trump mr bush the former governor of florida had been soundly rejected by an electorate he no longer recognized hobbling his campaign and leaving him little choice but to withdraw from the presidential race the people of iowa and new hampshire and south carolina have spoken mr bush said holding back tears and i really respect their decision it was a stunning turn for the man who a year ago embodied all the qualities that his party s elders imagined republican voters wanted in a president civility experience pedigree and tolerance they were wrong the party of prescott bush george bush and george w bush is for the moment the party of donald j trump transcript ff for the past year party leaders who had pleaded with mr bush to run and armed his campaign with a record shattering war chest of 100 million had consoled themselves with assurances that mr trump s popularity in the polls would never translate into victory at the ballot box mr trump it turned out knew their voters better than they did mr trump s commanding back to back primary wins in two disparate regions of the country have forcefully shaken the republican firmament out of a prolonged state of self denial it s an enormous moment said steve schmidt a top republican strategist on john mccain s presidential campaign in 2008 and george w bush s in 2004 unless further rivals immediately quit the race it s very difficult to see how he is stopped on his way to the nomination with mr bush s exit mainstream republicans did not just lose a beloved would be standard bearer they are now bereft of the single most forceful and outspoken detractor of mr trump in the presidential campaign in debate after debate and rally after rally mr bush questioned mr trump s tactics his qualifications his judgment his worldview and his very decency on his way out of the campaign mr bush in a line that seemed squarely directed at mr trump s divisive brand of politics declared that a president must tend for all corners of the country and all kinds of people i have put forth a vision for america that includes all mr bush said because our country deserves a president for everyone jeb bush is out leaving everyone wondering who his supporters might vote for instead now with mr bush s exit the republican establishment confronts an urgent decision either destroy mr trump or embrace him there are plenty of vulnerabilities to exploit if his opponents can summon the will and the muscle even as he won in south carolina mr trump seemed to overstay his welcome revealing a tendency to test voters patience in south carolina late deciding voters made up 45 percent of the republican electorate and they uniformly scorned mr trump and surveys suggest that even some republicans find him unlikable and lacking in compassion what s more so much of mr trump s campaign and his conduct remain startlingly unpredictable from his spats with the pope to his shifting memories of his previous positions on momentous issues such as his opposition then later support then opposition again for the american led invasion of iraq and mr trump will soon lose a feature of the 2016 race that has disproportionately benefited his candidacy a large and unwieldy field of rivals that carved up much of the republican electorate into small slivers in the coming weeks rivals beyond mr bush are expected to quit the race winnowing the contest down to three or four figures who will finally have a megaphone that begins to rival his own yet mr trump keeps winning within the past 12 days he has captured the hearts of moderates in new hampshire and born again christians in south carolina in both states he won decisively among both men and women independents voters without college degrees and those age 45 and over in south carolina he prevailed even after a brutal and deflating week in which he was loudly and repeatedly booed on stage during a republican debate was denounced by the global head of the catholic church praised saddam hussein as an effective fighter of terrorism and declared that torture works disconsolate republican operatives spent much of saturday night in dismay over the death of the bush dynasty and the success of mr trump even in the face of polling that documented mr trump s appeal and even after his win in new hampshire they privately doubted that he could sustain his momentum it s bad for the party and bad for the country said stuart stevens the chief strategist for mitt romney s presidential campaign four years ago i don t think there is anything good about it party leaders are now openly questioning how mr trump s remaining republicans rivals have approached his unusual candidacy and demanding that they have to let go of their restraint and take him on it s crazy that nobody else is trying to win except trump said mr stevens who took direct aim at senator marco rubio of florida long viewed by many within the party s leadership as their best chance to overtake mr trump rubio is not going after the person who is winning he said i ve never seen a campaign that seems as satisfied to not go after the leader the party s collective shrug over mr trump since he entered the presidential race last summer and its stubborn unwillingness to treat him as a serious threat is reflected by the paltry sum that both campaigns and outside groups have devoting to undermining him in a presidential campaign during which super pacs spent 215 million just 9 2 million or around 4 percent was dedicated to attacking mr trump even as he dominated the polls for months it now seems inevitable that mr rubio and mr cruz will direct their fire and their campaign dollars against mr trump as never before as they desperately try to halt his momentum by march 1 when 12 states and territories hold primaries at stake for the republican party is whether it embraces a new generation of conservatism as embodied by mr rubio and mr cruz the children of cuban immigrants or hitches its wagon to a deeply unorthodox anti immigrant and politically promiscuous figure like mr trump in the fast fading world of bush era figures who are mystified that even the appearance of a once adored former president and two former first ladies failed to sway voters last week some are quietly saying it is time to accept a new reality that mr trump is the face of the republican party we re just going to have to come to terms with it trent lott the former republican senate majority leader under george w bush told lawmakers on a recent visit to capitol hill he might just be the nominee advertisement
