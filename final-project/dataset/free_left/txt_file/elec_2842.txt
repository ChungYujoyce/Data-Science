advertisement supported by transcript n a by jonathan martin and amy chozick hillary clinton largely looked past her democratic rivals in saturday night s debate instead repeatedly assailing the republican field led by donald j trump she called mr trump a threat to the nation s safety saying he was fast becoming isis best recruiter deflecting persistent attacks from senator bernie sanders of vermont and former gov martin o malley of maryland over gun control wall street and foreign military entanglements she accused mr trump of undermining the fight against terrorism mrs clinton the former secretary of state sought to frame next year s election as a choice between her cleareyed approach to national security and the recklessness of republicans who have demonized muslims since the recent attacks on paris and san bernardino calif i worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the republicans particularly donald trump is sending a message to muslims here in the united states and literally around the world that there is a clash of civilizations she said that there is some kind of western plot or even war against islam which then i believe fans the flames of radicalization mrs clinton defended herself forcefully when she came under assault from mr sanders and mr o malley but from her opening statement on she took every opportunity and even created some to ignore her adversaries onstage and go after what she suggested was the true opposition her above the fray posture in the debate held at st anselm college in goffstown n h signaled mrs clinton s confidence just weeks before the first votes in iowa that neither of her democratic rivals would prove a significant obstacle on her march to the nomination bringing donald trump back into it she said at one point you don t want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition referring to the muslim nations that would be sought as military allies in fighting the islamic state also known as isis or isil mr sanders and mr o malley both did their best to anger mrs clinton mr o malley claimed that she changed her views on guns every election year and mr sanders reminded viewers of her 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in iraq our differences are fairly deep on this issue we disagreed on the war in iraq mr sanders said accusing mrs clinton of being overly hawkish in embroiling the united states in overseas conflicts secretary clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be mrs clinton criticized mr sanders for his previous opposition to bills backed by supporters of gun control but was at her fiercest after he challenged her on national security the new york times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign with all due respect senator you voted for regime change with respect to libya she said before mentioning the former libyan dictator col muammar el qaddafi you joined the senate in voting to get rid of qaddafi and you asked that there be a security council validation of that with a resolution both her rivals argued that the united states needed to fight the islamic state but not necessarily to depose president bashar al assad of syria it is not assad who is attacking the united states mr sanders said mr o malley agreed we shouldn t be the ones declaring assad must go he said we have a role to play but it is not the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy mrs clinton all but accused her rivals of na vet i think it s fair to say assad has killed by last count about 250 000 syrians she said adding that she had wanted to arm the moderate syrian opposition years ago to avoid the creation of a dangerous power vacuum i wish it could be either or she said mr o malley who has been lagging badly behind both of his rivals proved an irritant to mr sanders and mrs clinton he faulted them both for being insufficiently courageous on gun control and made a point of noting his relative youth next to mr sanders 74 and mrs clinton 68 may i offer a different generation s perspective on this mr o malley 52 interjected at one point later in an exchange about assault weapons he said isil training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in america is at a gun show and it s because of the flip flopping political approach of washington that both of my two colleagues on the stage have represented there for the last 40 years mrs clinton has spent much of this year repositioning herself to appeal to her party s progressive base but she bypassed the best chance she had saturday to embrace the sort of populism that is mr sanders s calling card when she was asked should corporate america love hillary clinton a reference to a magazine article during her 2008 presidential campaign she spread her arms everybody should she said grinning i have said i want to be the president for the struggling the striving and the successful she spoke at length about wanting to strengthen the economy and offered praise for responsible employers noting that her father had been a small business man mr sanders finally stepping in after mrs clinton was finished was blunt about his views but only glancingly criticized her ties to corporate interests they ain t going to like me mr sanders said of the business community and wall street is going to like me even less mr o malley did criticize mrs clinton for her wall street connections recalling that at the democratic debate last month in iowa she defended her fund raising from the financial industry by suggesting those donors supported her efforts to rebuild manhattan after the sept 11 2001 attacks mrs clinton said again on saturday that donations from wall street made up a small percentage of her contributions then turned the question around by noting that mr o malley had gladly raised money from wall street as head of the democratic governors association there were a few such tense moments but the disputes were tamer than those that have become routine on the republican debate stage and were entirely on policy grounds mrs clinton criticized mr sanders for proposing expensive government programs without providing details of how to fund them she estimated that his proposals to make health care and college free would require a 40 percent increase in federal spending or 18 trillion to 20 trillion i think we ve got to be really thoughtful about how we re going to afford what we propose she said which is why everything i propose i explain exactly how i m going to pay for it mr sanders said his plans would help middle and working class families and likened them to social security and the new deal pressed repeatedly on how he would pay for them mr sanders cracked a wry smile and said now this is getting to be fun mr sanders said his plans would require an increase in taxes but would ultimately save working americans money he said a three month family leave for working families would amount to only 1 61 a week in higher taxes mr o malley also would not rule out potentially raising taxes mrs clinton casting an eye toward tax averse general election voters made a firm pledge not to raise taxes on families making less than 250 000 a year at another point mr sanders attacked mrs clinton s ties to wall street but he also pointed to the policies of the presidential administration of her husband bill clinton including the dismantling of part of the 1933 glass steagall act leading to the commingling of commercial and investment banks i led the effort mr sanders said against alan greenspan against a guy named bill clinton maybe you know him maybe you don t but mrs clinton scarcely wanted to engage her rivals except when sharply attacked and the three democrats found much to agree on mr sanders and mrs clinton both for example proposed building a coalition of muslim countries to help fight the islamic state tell yemen go to war against isis mr sanders said i would tell qatar instead of paying 200 billion on the world cup spend it on fighting isis which is at your doorstep see what the candidates are saying about gun control immigration and more and how their positions align with the american people there were even moments when undiluted comity broke out asked whether it was time for the role of the presidential spouse to be redefined mrs clinton said that her husband would not as first gentleman pick out the china or flowers for state dinners but would offer advice on policy issues particularly how we re going to get the economy working for everybody which he knows a little bit about mr sanders used the question to heap praise on mrs clinton saying she not only did an outstanding job as our first lady but redefined what that role could be at the outset mr sanders was asked about the revelation that at least one of his aides had gained access to and copied information about mrs clinton s supporters from the democratic party s voter database but neither he nor mrs clinton showed any appetite to relitigate it asked by the abc news moderators whether mrs clinton who looked on icily as mr sanders explained the data breach deserved an apology mr sanders said yes i apologize i very much appreciate that comment bernie mrs clinton said it really is important that we go forward on this mr sanders called for an independent investigation of the breach which prompted the democratic national committee to bar his campaign temporarily from the party s voter file he noted that one campaign worker had already been fired and said he would fire any other aide found to have acted improperly after the debate his spokesman michael briggs said two other aides had been suspended saturday in connection with the data breach but mr sanders said that his aides might not have been the only ones viewing information they should not have seen i am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign mr sanders added yet even the unsubstantiated suggestion of impropriety by mrs clinton s campaign was not enough to lure her into a back and forth on the subject as in the first two debates mrs clinton was the focal point throughout even when she was not actually on stage as the moderators resumed after a long commercial break both her opponents returned to their places to answer questions about the economy but mrs clinton s podium stood empty sorry she said with a grin as she returned both mr sanders and mr o malley used their closing statements to compare the democratic trio favorably with the republican field i think we have a lot more to offer the american people than the right wing extremists mr sanders said but mrs clinton emerging from another debate unscathed seemed to acknowledge that much of the american public was probably more absorbed on the saturday night before christmas by the return of the star wars franchise thank you good night and may the force be with you she said beaming advertisement
