 2016 fiorina is a crowd favorite at the heritage action forum her first stop since the gop debate by shane goldmacher 09 18 2015 10 32 pm edt getty greenville s c carly fiorina didn t need to say a word to get her first standing ovation the former ceo of hewlett packard arrived to an arena full of conservative activists and thunderous applause in her first public appearance since a breakout debate performance this week as she did at wednesday s republican debate fiorina cast herself as a political outsider with the chops to actually change washington advertisement president fiorina will call on you citizens of this great nation to take our government back she declared at the heritage action presidential forum friday for the first time in her campaign fiorina was the headliner even more so after donald trump abruptly cancelled his appearance at the event everyone rushed to their seats to hear her the corridors outside the arena were nearly empty as she spoke and when she finished many got up to leave by david perera fiorina knows she is riding high she skipped the post debate spin room on wednesday night she d made all the points she wanted to make on stage instead she and top advisors decamped to their hotel the courtyard marriott in simi valley where they popped a late night bottle of champagne in a third floor room to celebrate it didn t matter that the candidate would have to be awake in just a few hours to tape six morning shows the next day she paused for what could charitably be called a brief nap more television is in fiorina s future the tonight show with jimmy fallon has booked as a guest for monday night it feels different because the phone s ringing off the hook said donna hicks a state legislator and co chair of fiorina s south carolina campaign said of the post debate energy everybody wants to talk with her ask her a question know where she is already can she come here fiorina events already on the calendar are bursting at the seams a town hall in rock hill south carolina next wednesday was slated to be held in a space for 350 people rsvps have surged past 700 in the last 48 hours we ve exploded since wednesday hicks said we re scrambling to find venues a town hall with sen tim scott scheduled for early october was just moved from a 700 person space to a 2 000 person convocation hall at the heritage forum pro fiorina swag were among the day s hottest items allen cushman a 77 year old who made a 2 5 hour drive from blairsville georgia whistled to grab a fiorina volunteer s attention he wanted to make sure he snagged a sticker and a pamphlet if i had a vote today i would vote for her cushman said he had been a longtime florida resident and supporter of jeb bush and marco rubio but fiorina won him over at the debates i think she s brilliant he said by eliza collins jake binnall a 17 year student came clutching a copy of fiorina s latest book he was hoping for the author s signature she s continually impressed me binnall said fiorina hit many of the same key points as her debate performance some of the loudest cheers came when she repeated her denunciations of planned parenthood we cannot be a nation that funds this kind of barbarity she said and that is what this is the crowd grew quiet and fiorina grew emotional as she spoke about the ravages of addiction when someone is addicted you watch them disappear before your eyes she said as many in the arena seemed to know her daughter had died of an overdose i am running for president because i don t want to see hope fading from anyone s eyes as it has throughout her campaign the fiorina super pac carly for america served as her de facto field operation fifteen staffers and volunteers fanned out to pass out stickers fliers and t shirts as as attendees lined up in the afternoon heat everyone wants my button said carly for america spokeswoman leslie shedd buttons weren t among the giveaway items on friday i m not giving it away after missing the main debate stage in august fiorina has clawed her way into the second one this week and then had a dominant performance still she is running a relatively shoestring operation that the newfound attention is likely to strain shedd made the 500 mile drive from washington d c to greenville on friday but had so many incoming messages she pulled off the highway three times just to triage some of her work once as she sat just off an exit a cop tapped on her window to make sure that her car hadn t broken down meanwhile her campaign manager frank sadler and deputy campaign manager sarah isgur flores both spent most of the day after the debate on a long trek from california to south carolina that included a layover in houston on one leg of the journey the pair huddled over a laptop on a united flight that lacked wireless internet but there were no signs of strain on friday where voters signaled fiorina was moving up their republican rankings if not all the way to the top by shane goldmacher ewald merchant of clinton south carolina flipped through a fiorina pamphlet as he waited to enter the arena he d been a trump supporter until the debate and trump s putdown of fiorina i don t like how he downgrades woman he said southern gentlemen don t do that she seems to have a lot of his ideas merchant added she just seems more informed than he does elizabeth mccarthy who arrived with her daughter said she was holding her own non politician primary between trump fiorina and ben carson fiorina she said was surging i m tired of the rhetoric we ve seen coming out of washington for so many years mccarthy said from the stage fiorina tried to tap into that frustration it s actually about changing the system and challenging the status quo and that is why i m running for president of the united states she said besides fiorina carson and ted cruz got among the most raucous receptions in an event that spanned five hours of almost continuous speeches from gop presidential candidates it s not clear whether the fact that trump bowed out at the last minute citing a pending significant business transaction helped or hurt fiorina s cause it robbed her of another chance to contrast herself with the billionaire real estate mogul but it also meant she was the star of the show ladies and gentlemen this is what a smart intelligent face looks like south carolina gov nikki haley said of fiorina a swipe at trump s recent insult as the two women embraced on stage afterward fiorina waved to the crowd and lingered for just an extra moment taking in the
