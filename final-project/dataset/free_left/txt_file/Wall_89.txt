advertisement supported by the moves prompted accusations that president trump s allies were disclosing the information for his political benefit by julian e barnes and charlie savage washington republican senators on wednesday released the names of some obama administration officials who made requests during the presidential transition to see fuller versions of classified intelligence reports immediately prompting accusations that president trump s allies were wielding the information for his political benefit the list compiles the names of officials who had inquired about the identity of an american in national security agency intelligence reports that initially concealed it on those occasions when the masked name turned out to be that of michael t flynn then mr trump s incoming national security adviser the list did not say what the intelligence reports were about they could have included surveillance of foreign officials who were talking about mr flynn as well as surveillance of intelligence targets who were picked up talking to him the list recently declassified by the acting director of national intelligence richard grenell reads as who s who of the top officials working at the time on russia policy sanctions and intelligence collection among them are john o brennan the c i a director samantha power the ambassador to the united nations james r clapper jr the director of national intelligence james b comey the f b i director and douglas e lute the american ambassador to nato former vice president joseph r biden jr mr trump s likely opponent in november s election was also on the list he asked for the identity of someone who turned out to be mr flynn on jan 12 2017 the day the washington post had published a column about mr flynn s calls with the russian ambassador that were at the heart of the false statements criminal case against him that attorney general william p barr abruptly moved to drop last week despite his guilty plea it s not at all surprising that individuals in official positions related to u s russia relations would want to know what was behind intelligence reports said mr lute who declined to discuss the classified intelligence he saw what is surprising is that our acting director of national intelligence would be moved to compile and release this list of officials most with longstanding distinguished public service careers apparently to fuel a partisan conspiracy theory mr trump and his allies have intensified their assaults on the justice department s russia investigation in the days since mr barr moved to end mr flynn s case some conservatives have sought to paint the inquiry and the so called unmasking requests by obama administration officials as part of an effort to undermine mr trump while trying to ascertain how russia was interfering in american politics government rules intended to minimize invasions of americans privacy in intelligence work generally require masking or obscuring americans identities and information about them in reports based on foreign intelligence surveillance but the rules also permit recipients of such reports to request an unmasking if the identity is necessary to understand the information and that step is routine the national security agency handled about 10 000 unmasking requests in 2019 and nearly 17 000 in 2018 republicans immediately sought to use the list as political ammunition the trump campaign accused mr biden of being part of the setup of general flynn to further the russia collusion hoax senator rand paul republican of kentucky said he would call mr grenell to testify about what mr biden and former president barack obama would have known about the unmaskings which he portrayed as obama officials receiving the power to unmask flynn his formulation elided that officials requesting an unmasking in an intelligence report generally cannot know who it will turn out to be at the time they make the request they would have been asking to learn more about an intelligence report with a generic reference to an unnamed american if you want to carry out a political hit job this would not be the way to do it said april falcon doss a former lawyer with the national security agency when the officials are sending requests in by definition they don t know whose identity is going to be unmasked the time frame included requests both before and after mr flynn s late december 2016 phone calls with the russian ambassador to the united states at the time sergey i kislyak the list also includes the ambassador to turkey mr flynn was separately of interest to turkish officials as he was being paid to lobby for the extradition of a cleric in pennsylvania whom the turkish government blamed for a coup as part of mr flynn s now scuttled plea deal he also admitted lying in belatedly filed forms registering as a foreign agent for turkey under the rules the national security agency had to agree that an american s identity was necessary for understanding information before the agency would provide it the unmasking requests that landed former officials on the list also may not all have turned out to be about mr flynn specifically one former intelligence official familiar with unmaskings said often requests come asking to be told all the identities in a particular report which could reveal more than one american as part of their own look into russian interference senate investigators reviewed the list and did not find that anyone had improperly sought access to the information according to other officials this isn t done lightly ms doss said but this is a routine process most of the requests that resulted in the revelation about mr flynn s identity came in early to mid december before his calls later in the month with mr kislyak unmasking is acceptable as long as it is used for national security purposes said michael morell a former acting c i a director who now hosts a podcast not all the officials on the list may have made the request directly according to mr morell sometimes an intelligence officer briefing a senior official makes the request but those are logged as coming from the senior official the list could be incomplete because it appears to contain only requests to the national security agency some of mr flynn s conversations with mr kislyak could have been intercepted by the f
