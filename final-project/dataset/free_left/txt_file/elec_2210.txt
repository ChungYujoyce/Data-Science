advertisement supported by transcript na by michael d shear and nick corasaniti cleveland donald j trump s acceptance speech here was filled with trump like hyperbole and the kind of vague political rhetoric that is hard to pin down but there were also facts in describing the problems that he would seek to fix from the oval office mr trump offered a series of grim facts about crime the economy and foreign policy here at our convention there will be no lies mr trump said many of mr trump s facts appear to be true though the republican presidential nominee sometimes failed to offer the entire story or provide all of the context that might help to explain his numbers and in some cases the facts seemed inflated or misleading part of a broader ideological message that mr trump was hoping to convey our fact checks of some of his claims homicides last year increased by 17 percent in america s fifty largest cities that s the largest increase in 25 years fact check those statistics are based on one analysis of preliminary crime data released by the justice department and they accurately reflect what officials say is a spike in murders in some big cities it leaves out the drop in others like new york city which saw a 25 percent drop in homicides in the first three months of 2016 in our nation s capital killings have risen by 50 percent they are up nearly 60 percent in nearby baltimore fact check those statistics are based on an analysis performed by the washington post which found no clear pattern in which cities saw increases in homicides in the president s hometown of chicago more than 2 000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone and almost 4 000 have been killed in the chicago area since he took office fact check this is largely true the chicago police department reports 2 242 shootings so far in 2016 and while it is unclear exactly what mr trump means by the chicago area that figure appears to track with reported murders since the start of 2009 get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between hillary clinton and donald j trump the number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year fact check in fact the officer down memorial page which tracks officer deaths reports that 68 police officers have been killed so far this year almost exactly the same as the 69 who were killed in the same period last year nearly 180 000 illegal immigrants with criminal records ordered deported from our country are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens fact check those numbers come from a report by the department of homeland security which told congress late last year that nearly 1 million undocumented immigrants have been ordered deported but remain in the country mr trump did not mention that most of those 180 000 are likely people charged with nonviolent crimes transcript na the number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015 fact check this is true according to reports from the border patrol which said that more than 51 000 families have been apprehended on the border in the first nine months of the fiscal year compared to about 40 000 last fiscal year but that is still less than 2014 when a surge of families across the border caused a political stir how we analyzed the last night of the republican national convention which featured ivanka trump peter thiel donald j trump and more nearly four in 10 african american children are living in poverty while 58 percent of african american youth are not employed fact check according to the bureau of labor statistics the unemployment rate of african americans ages 16 19 in june was 31 2 percent among whites of the same age it was 14 1 percent household incomes are down more than 4 000 since the year 2000 fact check this is mostly true median household income in 2000 was 57 724 in 2014 which has the most recent available data it was 53 657 our manufacturing trade deficit has reached an all time high nearly 800 billion in a single year fact check the goods deficit more imported goods less exported goods was 763 billion last year but that includes agricultural products and raw materials like coal moreover the total trade deficit last year was only 500 billion because the u s runs a trade surplus in services president obama has doubled our national debt to more than 19 trillion and growing fact check the national debt was 10 6 trillion on the day obama took office it was 19 2 trillion in april so not quite double but close forty three million americans are on food stamps fact check as of october this figure was largely accurate according to the united states department of agriculture in 2009 pre hillary isis was not even on the map libya was cooperating egypt was peaceful iraq was seeing and really a big big reduction in violence iran was being choked by sanctions syria was under control fact check mr trump is mostly right but libya syria and egypt were swept up in the arab spring an uprising out of mrs clinton s and mr obama s control and the sanctions on iran were just getting ramped up at that time they became far tougher under the obama administration than they were during the bush administration that helped force tehran to the negotiating table for last year s deal this was just prior to the signing of the iran deal which gave back to iran 150 billion and gave us nothing it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated fact check the deal does not directly give iran money but by easing or terminating sanctions it would allow iran to have access to many billions of dollars of its own money that has been frozen in overseas accounts and the exact value of those sanctions is debatable my opponent has called for a radical 550 percent increase in syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under the leadership of president obama fact check this is true as mrs clinton said in september she wanted to move from what is a good start with 10 000 to 65 000 but she also said she would improve the already extensive vetting process especially from syria advertisement
