advertisement supported by by farah stockman and keith bradsher donald j trump who has made reversing america s trade imbalance a pillar of his campaign often portrays himself as uniquely capable of wringing concessions out of china through hard nosed business tactics he has honed over the years in fact he says he has a personal track record to back up his boasts i beat china all the time mr trump declared in a speech the day he announced his candidacy i own a big chunk of the bank of america building at 1290 avenue of the americas that i got from china in a war very valuable mr trump does have an investment in the building an office tower near rockefeller center but court documents and interviews with people involved in the deal tell a very different story of how he ended up with it it began when a group of hong kong billionaires including one who has been called the donald trump of china helped rescue mr trump from the verge of bankruptcy by investing in one of his properties in manhattan for years the carefully cultivated relationship between mr trump and his hong kong partners proved lucrative for both sides and stands out as perhaps the closest that mr trump has come to international diplomacy to strike the deal mr trump had to attend elaborate dinner parties featuring foreign foods he did not want to eat he delayed the closing because of chinese spiritual beliefs and hunted around new york for a feng shui master to help with the building d cor instead of indulging his tastes for marble and gold according to former associates of mr trump who were involved in the deal but when his hong kong partners sold the property without his support mr trump waged a bitter long shot legal battle against them and far from winning his share of the bank of america building according to court documents he had to settle for it after losing in court in the end mr trump s alliance and eventual rivalry with some of hong kong s richest men proved to be a tale of mr trump at the extremes it showcased his unflagging confidence in his ability to turn a bad financial situation around but it also underscored his willingness to destroy a fruitful relationship with aggressive litigation their partnership began in 1994 after the collapse of the real estate market left mr trump deeply in debt he could not afford to make the bank payments on a 77 acre swath of land near lincoln center known as riverside south let alone to develop the property in need of cash he agreed to meet with intermediaries from a consortium of hong kong billionaires who were willing to buy the land assume mr trump s debts and pay him 30 percent of the profits as well as fees for helping to manage the development of the site which they agreed to finance it was by far the best offer he received the group included henry cheng kar shun one of the world s richest developers and vincent lo who is mr trump s chinese counterpart in more ways than one like mr trump mr lo comes from a wealthy family he is well known for creating a hip restaurant area in shanghai called xintiandi or new heaven on earth an upscale brand he has replicated across china his life has been chronicled by tabloids and society pages especially his divorce from his first wife and his marriage to a beauty pageant winner miss hong kong of 1977 despite their similarities mr trump hesitated when he received an invitation to travel to hong kong to negotiate the deal he does not like to travel and he feared that negotiating on the hong kong developers turf would put him at a disadvantage and make him appear weak said abe wallach mr trump s executive vice president of acquisitions and finance at the time but face to face meetings are crucial in chinese business culture where personal bonds and political connections collectively known as guanxi are relied upon to avoid and resolve business disputes sometimes more than the legal system eventually mr trump s aides convinced him that he had to make the trip in hong kong the golf games dinner parties and intensive talks featured the awkwardness and cultural miscues that can crop up in any high stakes international negotiation mr lo and mr cheng invited mr trump to play golf but mr trump was appalled when they told him they usually bet more than 1 000 on each hole they ended up betting 100 per hole and mr trump wound up losing more than he won mr lo recalled in an interview this month he s a good golfer but we had the local knowledge he probably was jet lagged mr lo said mr lo and mr cheng invited mr trump to dinner at the home of mr cheng s father an uncommon honor in chinese culture but the evening was a trying experience for mr trump he didn t like the food and couldn t use chopsticks recalled mr wallach who was there the first course was a whole fish with the head still on you could see the face of the fish and the teeth which really looked grotesque the servant put the fish in front of donald donald said the honor belongs to abe i took my chopsticks and began to pick at it mr cheng and mr lo also half jokingly proposed an informal drinking contest which mr trump a teetotaler declined the hong kong partners were wary of mr trump s well earned reputation for litigiousness but for more than a decade mr trump avoided conflict with them indeed he often deferred to them chase manhattan bank which held mr trump s mortgage initially scheduled the closing of the deal during china s ghost month during which some believe the spirits of the dead roam the earth the chinese told me that we would have to wait until after the fifteenth of september to close the deal mr wallach wrote in a chapter of an unpublished book he is writing about his years with mr trump trump went apoplectic but he said that mr trump went along mr lo said that any delay had been caused by a need to complete paperwork and that he and his business partners were not superstitious the project proved extremely profitable as the new york real estate market rebounded in 2005 the hong kong partners sold the development for 1 76 billion although it was believed to be the largest residential real estate transaction in the city s history mr trump was furious and contends to this day that his partners did not consult him first i said why didn t you come talk to me whatever price you got i could have gotten more money mr trump recalled in an interview this month mr lo said that mr trump had been informed of the decision and that in any case it would have been very hard to shop such a large property around without mr trump s becoming aware of it instead of accepting his share of the proceeds mr trump sued his partners for staggering breach of fiduciary duty in a lawsuit that demanded 1 billion in damages mr lo who felt that mr trump should have been appreciative of the deal he had received called the lawsuit a shock and when the hong kong partners sought to invest the proceeds from the sale in bank of america buildings in san francisco and new york mr trump sought an injunction to scuttle the deal the judge ruled against him instead of receiving the cash he wanted mr trump had to accept a 30 percent share in the profits from the two bank of america buildings tied up in a partnership that is slated to last until 2044 but today mr trump counts that legal defeat as a victory through more luck than talent i ended up much better because the buildings have increased in value he said in the end it was fine nonetheless mr trump s litigation over riverside south dragged on for at least four years he forced his partners to produce more than 166 000 pages of documents in court and accused them of various transgressions including fraud and tax evasion during the litigation mr lo was forced to keep his trips to the united states secret out of concern that mr trump s lawyers would serve him with court papers that would force him to remain in the united states outside court mr trump s battle seemed to take the shape of a personal rivalry with mr lo who had just bankrolled a chinese reality television show called wise man takes all it loosely resembled mr trump s show the apprentice although mr lo appeared just once on the show and handed out start up capital to the winners instead of jobs mr trump announced that he was going to take a version of the apprentice to china to compete with mr lo s show although mr trump s show there does not appear to have gotten off the ground in an interview mr trump asked a reporter how mr lo s show had turned out then answered his question let s put it this way it wasn t the apprentice which was a big success mr lo said his show had met his real goal of promoting entrepreneurship in china after the lawsuit the hong kong partners moved swiftly to cut all ties to mr trump mr lo sold his shares in the partnership to the cheng family which sold to vornado realty trust now the owner of a 70 percent interest in the bank of america buildings but in the interview mr trump sounded almost wistful about his former partners marveling at the money they had made together and at the fact that they no longer spoke he acknowledged that his former partners might have gotten the best deal possible on riverside south after all it s too bad that this happened mr trump told a reporter if you speak to vincent and henry tell them i think they are fantastic people he said you let them know that donald trump has great respect for them o k eight thousand miles away in his penthouse office in hong kong mr lo laughed when told of mr trump s comment he made clear that he had not forgotten being sued for 1 billion well that s him mr lo said to file a lawsuit is nothing it s just like having lunch advertisement
