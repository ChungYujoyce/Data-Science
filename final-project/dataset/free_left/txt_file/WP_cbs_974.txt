community whistleblower who has filed a complaint involving mr trump as head of counterintelligence i want to advocate for the whistleblower protection act bill evanina who has served as director of the national counterintelligence and security center ncsc since 2014 said this week we do believe this is a viable productive legislative act that we encourage employees in the intelligence community to utilize to be able to facilitate their frustration or identification of waste fraud and abuse the intelligence community whistleblower protection act passed in 1998 established a process for intelligence officers to relay matters of urgent concern to the intelligence community s inspector general who after a review may ask the director of national intelligence dni to pass them to congress i would much rather have a whistleblower give that information to the dni than give it to the russians or chinese or iranians evanina said he declined to address previousremarksmade by president trump that a whistleblower complaint now fueling an impeachment inquiry in the house was informed by spying in the white house i would refer you to what s already been said out in the public about the

revolution spies among us have caused lasting damage to our national security evanina said and just as our adversaries and the threats we face continue to evolve counterintelligence and security professionals must evolve as well the museum s main display stretches chronologically beginning in the late 18th century down a hallway in one of the buildings making up ncsc s recently renovated campus it covers the stories of well known figures like aldrich ames robert hanssen and edward snowden as well as lesser known and more recent incidents the last spy profiled is kevin mallory a former cia officer sentenced in may of 2018 to 20 years in prison for passing national defense secrets to chinese intelligence services this museum is designed to serve as a daily reminder for all of our employees in our workforce and the broader intelligence community about the persistent threats we face from espionage and the need to remain ever vigilant evanina said artifacts on loan from other intelligence agencies museums including the cia fbi and national security agency are on rotating display among the items revealed tuesday are the colored chalk and thumbtacks used by hanssen a former fbi agent to pass information to his soviet and russian handlers as well as the handcuffs used to arrest him the museum s precursor was a series of roughly 70 headshots of american spies displayed in a gloomier installation formerly known as the wall of shame whose content was donated over a decade ago by espionage artifact collector and historian h keith melton they lined a side entrance and didn t tell a story according to ncsc executive director patricia larson who helped lead the more than two year effort to research and organize the updated material the new museum instead includes a soviet wall of shame that depicts six former high ranking soviet officials who spied for the united states during the cold war it s been said that those who don t learn from the past are condemned to repeat it evanina said it s imperative that we understand our past and continuously learn from it the museum s unveiling comes amid a number of recent prosecutions involving espionage or foreign agent
