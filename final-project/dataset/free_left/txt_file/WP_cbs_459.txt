read it s not a surprise that something like chinese corona was let loose in a place like china was let loose within a society where there isn t a lot of truth telling conservative activist matt schlapp said in a catholics for trump livestream event down ballot republicans are matching the tone which democrats and asian american and pacific islander aapi community leaders are calling xenophobic and characterizing as an attempt to find a scapegoat for trump s pandemic response both the house and senate republican campaign arms have taken the cues in their releases in a release this

virus and let it spread all over the world the ad praises mr trump for his references to the chinese virus and having the courage to call it what it is though the president has said he d stop using this term democrats including her potential democratic opponent sri preston kulkarni condemned the ad as irresponsible race baiting that s dangerous to the diverse district the problems with china come from their oppressive communist party running the country not from the people of china the people from china are just like us this is all about freedom it s not about race politics wall said in an interview with cbs news texas state representative gene wu s district is near with the houston suburban district wall is running in he called the ad asinine but to him it s in line with mr trump s previous rhetoric and contributes to an atmosphere of fear in the asian american community for them it s politics he told cbs news for us it s physical safety and life or death in march the fbi s houston office warned of a potential surge in coronavirus related hate crimes due to an assumption that a portion of the u s public will associate covid 19 with china and asian american populations abc newsfirst reported in the last three weeks there have been about 1 500 incidents of verbal harassment or physical assault against asian americans according to a tracker by the asian pacific policy planning council and the chinese for affirmative action caa organization one such incident occurred in midland texas where an asian american family was stabbed inside a sam s club because the assailant thought the family was chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus the fbi report said trump has called himself the war president and any war president needs a foreign enemy for him

chu the chair of the congressional asian pacific american caucus said she s seen anti china rhetoric in previous elections but this situation is very volatile because people are so frightened and emotional it is clear that the chinese government did not reveal the extent of the disease early on but on the other hand there were things that the american government did not do well either she said aapi voters tend to lean democratic in california but nationwide 38 didn t identify with any party according to a aapi data survey the data also shows that of the 44 congressional seats that flipped in 2018 the aapi share of the electorate exceeded the margin of victory in 18 races asian and pacific islander american vote executive director christine chen cautioned campaigns not to rely on a blame game framework scapegoating asian americans or asian immigrants for foreign issues could make an impact at the polls we have seen that in the past she said one example she pointed to was a 2012 michigan senate ad in which the republican candidate implied his democrat opponent s spending record resulted in china taking american jobs it s one thing to criticize policy or a particular president or elected official in a different country but we have to be careful in terms of how we frame it and not imply that this is actually attached to a whole generation of people chen said nicole sganga eleanor watson and bo erickson contributed reporting correction an earlier version of this piece said state representative wu s district overlaps with texas 22nd congressional district it is just
