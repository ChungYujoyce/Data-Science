 2016 jeb bush has considered declaring he would not support donald trump as the gop nominee by alex isenstadt and shane goldmacher 12 16 2015 05 05 am est donald trump and jeb bush are shown on monitors in the media workroom during the dec 15 republican debate at the venetian hotel casino in las vegas ap photo las vegas jeb bush came at donald trump with everything he had turning in his strongest debate performance to date just as much of the party was threatening to tune out his flagging candidacy entirely he dismissed trump as a chaos candidate who would amount to a chaos president said the billionaire had crazy ideas about foreign policy and suggested trump learned about foreign affairs from the saturday morning cartoons advertisement and two campaign sources say bush may be willing to go even further than he did on stage prior to the debate senior bush aides began looking into the possibility of making a clear break with trump potentially with the candidate stating that if trump were the nominee bush would not support him the former florida governor didn t go that far but the option may still be on the table the bush campaign has already examined whether such a statement would disqualify him from certain state primary ballots some of which demand that candidates sign a loyalty pledge declaring that they will support the eventual republican party nominee 2016 by mike allen despite the las vegas fireworks the bout came months too late to be the night s marquee matchup marco rubio and ted cruz proved to be the headliner with bush and trump relegated to second act status a sign of the extent to which the race has passed by the son and brother of the past two republican presidents still if the republican party is searching for an anti trump bush volunteered for duty others on the stage kind of walked away from that said trent wisecup bush s director of strategy he walked into it those who ve been with bush over the past week say he s been raring to go at a republican party of florida event at the intercontinental hotel in tampa last week bush went on such an anti trump tear that bush advisers were shocked it didn t leak from then on tackling trump head on was the debate game plan and became a central part of the former florida governor s preparations bush has ramped up his rhetoric in private and public since calling trump unhinged after his plan to bar muslims from entering the country at a fundraiser in las vegas the day before the debate bush previewed for donors his planned aggressive posture according to one attendee talking points circulated to surrogates indicated his plans to take on trump and emphasize the need for a commander in chief on stage bush appeared to relish his aggressive new posture as he talked over trump a little of your own medicine there donald he said bush brought up more than once trump s old comment that he got his information on key issues from the shows i won t get my information from the shows i don t know if that s saturday morning or sunday morning bush mocked i don t know which one the renewed aggressiveness helped bush break into the conversation online twitter data showed that bush accounted for the second biggest share of the debate conversation 13 percent after trump 35 percent bush spokesman tim miller tweeted that the debate was the best for website traffic email sign ups donations of any debate and the most talked about moment on facebook was the exchange when bush confronted trump you can t insult your way to the presidency by eli stokols it was a telling moment as trump responded with a dismissive insult i m at 42 percent and you re at 3 percent so so far i m doing better trump said doesn t matter bush insisted doesn t matter the question of course is whether it does jeb showed a few signs of life said curt anderson who had served as chief strategist for bobby jindal s campaign i actually think that trump had a good debate marred by his few interactions with jeb how odd is that the very few times trump stumbled tonight was when jeb got the best of him never could have predicted that if bush s interactions with trump were his strongest moments his stilted opening and stumbling closing statements served as a reminder for many republicans of why he had fallen so far and so fast he knocked trump on his heels a bit which i give him credit for but i just think gop voters aren t buying bush this year said katie packer a rubio supporter who served as a top official on mitt romney s campaign trump has built such deep goodwill among so many conservative voters it s not clear how bush s attacks will resonate focus group maestro frank luntz suggested bush fell flat the crowd may be applauding but my focus group is laughing at jeb 22 of 26 members said donald trump won that exchange he tweeted at one point adding that they used the words weak desperate and whiny to describe bush it s over for him sorry luntz wrote even bush said he didn t know what was next look i don t know the politics of all this i m not an expert he said on cnn shortly after the debate ended i just know sometimes you have to take a
