once again a hot topic don t worry their latest star turn doesn t involve some new culture war clash over how much protection masks provide when they should be worn or whether as some of the more excitable social distancing opponents charge they are a form of government tyranny rather it seems masks are finally getting some respect at the white house on monday the white house management office issued a memo requiring all of the staff to wear masks while inside the west wing except when working at their own desks visitors will need to cover their faces as well the increased precautions came after two white house aides tested positive for the coronavirus last week one of president trump s personal valets and vice president mike pence s press secretary katie miller both had spent significant time inside the cramped crowded west wing both are now in quarantine as is ms miller s husband stephen miller who is one of the president s closest advisers also over the weekend three key members of the coronavirus task force including pandemic heartthrob dr anthony fauci went into self isolation after having been as mr trump breezily put it in the general proximity of an infected staff member separately two members of the military joint chiefs of staff decided to self quarantine after possible exposure one gen joseph lengyel the head of the national guard bureau initially had tested positive for the coronavirus on his way to a meeting with the president on saturday general lengyel s second and third tests came back negative mr pence perversely is not quarantining though mr trump has said he ll be keeping his distance from the vice president further precautions were unnecessary the white house said because mr pence has so far tested negative for the virus no matter the pandemic has breached the white house perimeter and nerves are starting to fray it is scary to go to work kevin hassett a white house economic adviser told face the nation on sunday monday s mask directive of course will not apply to the president or vice president after all the primary purpose of a nonmedical mask isn t to protect the wearer but rather those around him or her not exactly a top priority for mr trump still it was a notable reversal and surely a painful concession by a president who has long made clear his anti mask bias in early april while announcing the recommendation from the centers for disease control and prevention that masks be worn in public spaces mr trump made clear he would not be taking his own administration s advice wearing a face mask as i greet presidents prime ministers dictators kings queens i don t know he said somehow i don t see it for myself aides have said that mr trump s resistance stems in part from not wanting to look ridiculous from a health standpoint this is ridiculous but it comports perfectly with the warped logic of trumpian machismo masks are for the weak read losers and he is all about strength the president s apologists are happy to peddle this line what trump is really doing is projecting american strength and health at a time when strong leadership is needed the federalist proclaimed noting the importance of optics the article contended that a single photo of a mask clad mr trump would signal that the united states is so powerless against this invisible enemy sprung from china that even its president must cower behind a mask but in fact mr trump is increasingly desperate to project strong leadership because he has so utterly failed to provide strong leadership polls show that a majority of americans disapprove of the president s unsteady handling of the pandemic and even as his administration pushes to reopen the economy its internal data indicate that the worst pain is yet to come as social distancing restrictions are lifted the daily death toll in the united states is projected to climb to around 3 000 by june 1 to distract from this grim reality mr trump is going full carnival barker minimizing the public health risks and all but declaring victory in every generation through every challenge and hardship and danger america has risen to the task he proclaimed on monday we have met the moment and we have prevailed not yet we haven t not even close mr trump is peddling a fantasy world where he has wrestled the invisible enemy into submission and america is now poised to transition to greatness a perplexing phrase he promised we are going to hear a lot in the coming weeks in his candy coated dream there is no room for anything so unlovely as masks which serve as a jarring reminder that all is not well and is unlikely to be anytime soon so it was that until this week mr trump s mask aversion extended well beyond his person echoing throughout the white house top aides generally eschewed them as did those who attended meetings with the president or appeared at his daily public briefings certainly mr pence internalized the message doing public appearances barefaced even after causing a minor scandal by declining to mask up during his visit to the mayo clinic last month explicitly violating the hospital s policy mr pence apologized for the infraction before settling back into masklessness now seems a good time to note that the republican governor of iowa is currently in a modified quarantine after doing public appearances with the vice president on friday during his visit to the state at his monday briefing mr trump was asked how can you assure americans that it s safe to go to their workplaces when the most secure workplace in the country the white house cannot contain the spread of the coronavirus that has infected some of your own staff the president rejected the question s premise claiming that the quick response to one person testing positive just shows how well the system is working it was unclear which of the two infected aides he does not consider a person he said of the virus i think it s very well contained actually it isn t actually not inside the white house much less in the country at large mr trump knows this and his growing panic to pretend otherwise cannot mask the truth the times is committed to
