terms of the nuclear deal there was no immediate response from the u s to iran s partial withdrawal announcement but it came three days after the white house dispatched an aircraft carrier and a bomber wing to the persian gulf over what it described as a new threat from iran white house national security adviser john bolton said sunday evening that the decision to move the hardware including four b 52 bombers was in response to a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings he didn t provide details but said the u s wanted to send a clear and unmistakable message to iran that unrelenting force would meet any attack on u s interests or those of its allies the united states is not seeking war with the iranian regime but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack whether by proxy the islamic revolutionary guard corps or regular iranian forces he said a u s official said on tuesday that the trump administration s decision was based in part on intelligence indications that iran had moved short range ballistic missiles by boat off its shores the movement first reported by cnn was among a range of recent indications that iran might be considering or preparing to attack u s forces in the region said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive intelligence the official said it was not clear whether the boats with missiles represented a new military capability that could be used against u s forces or were only being moved to shore locations a defense department official told cbs news senior national defense correspondent david martin earlier this week that the u s had detected a number of preparations for possible attack on u s forces at sea and on land there is more than one avenue of attack or possible attack that we re tracking the official said western governments had long feared iran s atomic program could allow it to build nuclear weapons iran has always maintained its program is for peaceful purposes currently the accord limits iran to enriching uranium to 3 67 percent which can fuel a commercial nuclear power plant weapons grade uranium needs to be enriched to around 90 percent however once a country enriches uranium to around 20 percent scientists say the time needed to reach 90 percent is halved iran has previously enriched to 20 percent under the terms of the deal reached in 2015 iran can keep a stockpile of no more than 300 kilograms 660 pounds of low enriched uranium that s compared to the 22 046 pounds of higher enriched uranium it once had the international atomic energy agency the world s nuclear watchdog agency has repeatedly verified iran s compliance with the nuclear deal since it was adopted but president trump even before he was elected disparaged the hard won agreement as too generous to iran his administration argued from the beginning that while iran wasn t violating the stipulations of the deal it was defying the spirit of the agreement and the white house abandoned it for that reason much to the chagrin of the other parties involved first published on may 8 2019 3 04 am 2019 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved this material may not be
