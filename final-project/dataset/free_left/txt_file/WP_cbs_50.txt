lori vallow daybell s two children are missing and she refuses to tell authorities where they are now for the first time her mother and sister speak out about what they think may have happened produced by liza finley richard fetzer and emily wichick she s become a national obsession lori vallow daybell the rexburg idaho mother who never reported her 7 year old son jj and 17 year old daughter tylee missing no one has seen the children in months and despite her arrest on child abandonment charges she s still not talking but according to her family there is a reason for that now as a nationwide hunt for the missing children continues lori vallow daybell s mother janis cox and her sister summer shiflet reveal theories to 48 hours on what may have happened even whether the children could be hidden in a bunker somewhere out of sight and why she s staying silent she would never harm her children cox tells cbs news correspondent jonathan vigliotti and i know her i don t know all of her reasons for doing what she s doing says shiflet but i know she has has the reasons but first back to the lori vallow daybell the rest of the world knows a woman who has a lot of explaining to do says investigative reporter and 48 hours consultant morgan loew lori daybell has two missing children lori daybell is connected to suspicious deaths lori daybell appears to be somebody that has a black cloud over her unless she s the one that is causing these bad things to happen that s what the fbi and authorities in at least three states are trying to figure out as they sort through a convoluted tale that many believe will lead to murder charges the allegations that still shock friends who knew lori vallow daybell before she became one of the most vilified women in america april raymond you never wanna believe that somebody you cared about or looked up to is capable of something heinous but unfortunately that might not be the reality here this lori is nothing like the friend she used to know says april raymond whom 48 hours spoke to on skype they met in 2015 at the local mormon church when lori and her husband charles vallow moved to kauai from arizona april raymond everyone fell in love with her right away she really did bring a lot of joy to the people that she surrounded herself with everything about lori seemed to sparkle says raymond including her marriage to charles a successful investment advisor april raymond i had never seen two people married that were what i perceived as genuinely happy with one another and i i thought that those two were charles was lori s fourth husband he d been married before too and both had grown children but together they were raising a new family tylee ryan lori s daughter from a former marriage and the recently adopted jj charles s sister s grandson april raymond lori was an exceptional mother she was the mother that you know everyone wanted to be echo itaaehau my daughter loved lori just as much as she loved tylee echo itaaehau s daughter vaisia was best friends with tylee and a constant visitor at the vallow home in both arizona and hawaii echo itaaehau when the girls would go to the mall or to the movies or to the lake in hawaii they would go paddle boarding go to the beach ziplining all those adventures lori was always there and always a part of it and so was lori s son jj who has autism and special needs april robertson i really admired how patient she was with him and how much care she took of him that included a service dog named bailey neal mestas was bailey s trainer neal mestas the dog helped settle him down keep him calm but even bailey could not take the place of his big sister echo itaaehau tylee and jj have an incredible bond and just a beautiful relationship and she took care of him and takes care of him as a second mom would echo itaaehau and she s super sweet she can be sassy she s just a wonderful awesome girl but in 2017 the family dynamic began to shift tylee was missing her friends on the mainland so they moved back to arizona then something in lori began to change morgan loew from what we have heard she started to pay a little less attention to the kids and that s when the rift in the marriage started happening april raymond says lori had begun reading the books of chad daybell a novelist and podcaster from rexburg idaho who told stories about doomsday and people preparing for the end of the world over time some say lori became more and more obsessed with these extreme religious beliefs venturing way beyond traditional mormon doctrine morgan loew in the beginning of 2019 lori disappeared she took off and left charles with the two kids they had no idea where she was and this was for about like two months morgan loew we think that she met up with chad daybell at that point and she starts communicating with charles in some really strange language she was saying that she believes that she s a chosen one and that she can speak to dead people she also spoke to april raymond about it april raymond she felt like she had existed on earth several times she felt like she had supernatural powers jonathan vigliotti the friend you knew before was basically the world s perfect soccer mom and now she s saying she is essentially a reincarnated god april raymond that s correct then raymond says lori said something that would take on an even more sinister cast in the months ahead april raymond she told me that charles was already dead and that there was a demon living inside of him morgan loew according to charles she even said if you get in my way i will murder you i will murder you and at that point charles vallow decided he is going to file for divorce charles was so spooked by his wife of almost 13 years he put his fears in writing morgan loew it s right there in the divorce paperwork charles was worried about his life and he was also worried about the lives of jj and tylee he knew that bad things were on the horizon sadly charles vallow could not have been more right around 7 40 a m on the morning of july 11 2019 charles went to lori s rental home in chandler arizona to take jj to school less than an hour later charles was dead lori s brother alex cox had shot him at 8 36 a m alex cox placed this 911 call 911 dispatcher is he breathing alex cox i can t tell morgan loew he said i need to report a shooting i i shot my brother in law in self defense 911 dispatcher and is he hurt is he alive or alex cox yeah there s blood he s not moving the police arrived and shot bodycam video of alex cox on the curb outside the home he tells them that charles and lori got into a fight chandler police officer bodycam video so you get in an argument what is it over alex cox well it was over my sister he was getting physical with her then he says tylee came out of her room with a bat alex cox bodycam video she came out to defend my sister with her bat cox says charles then grabbed the bat from tylee and came at him hitting him in the back of the head alex cox bodycam video so i went to my room and got my gun cox then tells the officer he came back and shot charles twice in the chest both tylee who had run outside and lori say they heard the shooting but didn t see it lori says she then walked past charles s body and left the house to get jj who d been waiting in the car she and tylee then drove him to school morgan loew and at some point a little later that morning lori and tylee come walking up to the house chandler police officer bodycam video hi who are are you lori speaks ok just stand over there for just a second guys in the bodycam video police blurred tylee s face because she was a minor police officer bodycam video does your husband live here or no lori vallow no police officer ok morgan loew what was striking about the footage was that they were very nonchalant police officer bodycam video how long have you lived here lori vallow like 3 weeks police officer oh geez yeah ok lori vallow that s why the neighbors don t know us very well police officer gotcha lori vallow like hi neighbors sorry laughs police officer are you working at all all three were questioned at the police headquarters and released raymond learned of charles s death on google april raymond it all started to make a lot more sense suddenly raymond remembered that strange thing lori said in the months before the shooting that charles was already dead and had a demon living inside of him jonathan vigliotti what went on in your mind april raymond i felt really sick and i just knew something was very very wrong lori vallow didn t waste any time says reporter morgan loew less than two months after her estranged husband charles vallow was shot dead she packed up her two kids and moved to rexburg idaho home of that author and podcaster chad daybell a known voice among doomsday preppers morgan loew reporter and 48 hours consultant they believe that the end of the world is coming and it is coming soon and that it is incumbent upon them to prepare for it and that means stockpiling food and supplies so that they can survive until they are taken to heaven ad been ordained to lead the chosen ones april raymond in her mind there were 144 000 people that were going to survive armageddon she had been appointed to gather the remaining members of the chosen raymond says lori tried to recruit her as one of the chosen but it would have come at a heavy price her two boys jonathan vigliotti what did being a chosen one entail april raymond basically that i would need to separate myself from my children and join her and find the other chosen ones so that we could all be together i respectfully declined her offer because that was just was going too far in early september lori tylee and jj moved into a townhouse in rexburg her brother alex cox moved into the same complex morgan loew alex and lori had a really close relationship i think it was more than brother who looks after sister i think it was more of brother who was the enforcer who punished people who crossed sister in 2007 long before alex cox shot and killed charles vallow he attacked lori s third husband joe ryan with a taser gun and was sentenced to 90 days in jail morgan loew lori sort of viewed alex as the destroyer of bad things in her eyes he was there to take care of the problems that s what makes a now famous picture of tylee so terrifying to so many it was taken on september 8 about a week after they arrived in idaho says private investigator rich robertson rich robertson there are photographs that show her and jj and alex in yellowstone park morgan loew and that was the last time she was seen and the key there is that alex was there we know jj left the park that day pictures from a neighbor s doorbell camera show him nine days later we also know he attended school until september 23 on september 24 lori told jj s teachers she was going to homeschool him morgan loew that s the last anybody saw him the following week lori bought a 36 ring on amazon the next day she reportedly shopped online for a wedding dress it would soon be clear who the intended groom was chad daybell morgan loew most of the arrows point to them having a relationship while they were still married to other people charles vallow was now gone but when lori bought that ring daybell s wife of 29 years tammy daybell was still very much alive all that changed just 17 days later when the 49 year old died unexpectedly morgan loew tammy s death was odd from the beginning family said she died in her sleep they didn t want an autopsy performed she was buried in utah approximately two weeks later chad daybell married lori vallow in hawaii they did more than just start new lives they reinvented their old ones telling chad s parents that lori was an empty nester but then the fa ade came crashing down when jj s grandparents in louisiana kay and larry woodcock could take it no more morgan loew every time grandma kay woodcock would call there would be a different excuse about where the kids were and finally said something is weird here she had heard enough excuses she finally reached out to the police in late november over two months after the children were last seen rexburg police knocked on lori s door to check on the kids rich robertson lori said they weren t there lori told em that the kids were staying with a friend of hers down in arizona arizona authorities then went to that friend s house who told them jj and tylee were not there rich robertson so at that point somebody was lying and it was most likely lori but she wasn t the only one when questioned by police detectives noted that chad acted as if he didn t know lori very well chad daybell left out one crucial detail that he and lori had been married for three weeks morgan loew these lies were starting to catch up with chad and lori rich robertson at that point rexburg police executed a search warrant rich robertson but they were gone they had left town the police quickly issued a statement that the children s lives were in danger rich robertson at that point everything changed lori was about to become one of the most hated women in america summer shiflet lori s sister i ve heard things said about lori that none of them are true this mob mentality of lori just hung in a public square basically is what it feels like when news hit that the two smiling siblings disappeared and their mother never reported them missing people the world over were transfixed by the bizarre story of the cult mom and her missing kids armies of citizen cyber sleuths came together online rexburg mom dee ann carter is one of them jonathan vigliotti what is it about this story that brings together so many people from so many different backgrounds from all over the world dee ann carter it s these two children people connect you wanna help you wanna do what you can their facebook group christmas misery is 14 000 strong and growing says annie southam annie southam with so many people with so many different areas of expertise putting those pieces together hopefully the whole puzzle can kinda be solved on the home front jj s grandparents larry and kay woodcock launched a public crusade larry woodcock it breaks my heart it s killing my soul i just want those kids back as family friends and strangers were begging for answers lori and chad were in hawaii enjoying an extended honeymoon annie southam there s some stuff that disgusts me like their pictures on the beach where he s playin the ukulele and she s dancing around in her dress morgan loew but as this case started building steam their ability to live a normal life there started to erode they had trouble just going outside their front door because they didn t know if they were gonna run into investigators or journalists east idaho news reporter nate eaton tracked them down at a local resort east idaho reporter lori nate eaton with east idaho news can you tell me where your kids are east idaho reporter where are your kids lori vallow daybell no comment east idaho reporter no comment there s people around the country praying for your children praying for you guys why don t you give us answers lori vallow daybell that s great east idaho reporter that s great that s great that they re praying for you praying for your kids what lori vallow daybell doesn t answer on january 25 2020 lori was ordered to produce the children to idaho authorities in five days she ignored it morgan loew so she s placed under arrest she s taken into custody in kauai lori was charged with three misdemeanors and two felony counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children it was a devastating blow to lori s mother janis cox and sister summer shiflet cox spoke to her daughter after the arrest jonathan vigliotti and when you asked her how are my grandchildren doing what did she say janis cox as far as i can i remember she said you know me mom the kids are fine jonathan vigliotti deep down do you believe that janis cox i did believe it yes summer shiflet she said the same thing to me janis cox we know there s a whole nother side to this story cox and shiflet sat down with 48 hours for their first television interview to try and tell us that story a story they say that began almost a year ago back in arizona summer shiflet after charles had died lori had been continuously threatened and she wanted to go somewhere safe she didn t wanna tell any of us where she was going because she was being followed and threatened jonathan vigliotti threatened by who summer shiflet by people who loved charles and want revenge for his death charles vallow s family say there never were any threats not even close but cox and shiflet say lori was so scared she fled to idaho to protect herself and her children they believe she could be hiding them now to keep them safe summer shiflet i don t know all of her reasons for doing what she s doing but i know she has has the reasons but that still doesn t explain why lori was off in hawaii dancing on the beach with chad daybell while her children were nowhere to be found jonathan vigliotti something s not adding up here where are they where is jj and tylee summer shiflet it s a great question we would love to know the answer to that we don t know but we are very confident that lori would never harm her children summer shiflet she s the best person i know she s just the kindest loving person that there is they say the real lori is nothing like the doomsday zealot charles wrote about in his divorce papers jonathan vigliotti is lori part of some strange cult janis cox no summer shiflet no not that we know of no janis cox no jonathan vigliotti not she s not preparing for the end of the world she doesn t believe that she is leading the 144 000 janis cox no summer shiflet she has never said the end of the world is gonna happen in july that has never come from her mouth or lips ever summer shiflet a lot of the things that have been reported any small truths that are in there have been twisted but most of them are flat out not even true for example the police reported no one saw or heard from jj after september 23 but janis cox says she called lori on october 1 a full week later and could hear jj playing in the background she gave 48 hours her phone records that showed a 97 minute call janis cox he was alive and well jonathan vigliotti how do you know that though janis cox because i know jj no one s gonna pretend to be jj at one point she says jj actually got on the phone and said hi mimi his nickname for her jonathan vigliotti you spoke with him though on the phone janis cox yeah yes and i heard him and he was out playing and he just takes the phone you know and he knows you know he knows who we are janis cox so he still knew i m mimi you know he still knew me mimi the rexburg police aren t commenting on the call but cox and shiflet want to set the record straight on something else or rather someone else their son and brother alex cox lori s so called enforcer the man who shot and killed charles vallow jonathan vigliotti is alex the henchman here summer shiflet no laughs janis cox no he s not summer shiflet alex was the most easygoing relaxed hilarious h type of person there s nothing about him that was a hit man but we may never know the true story on december 12 alex cox suddenly passed out and later died an autopsy determined of natural causes but we re still awaiting the autopsy results in another death tammy daybell s body was exhumed two months after being buried to perform toxicology tests morgan loew and why do you run a toxicology test because you re looking for drugs or you are looking for poison and why would they be looking for poison because they re investigating the possibility that she was murdered what started as a hunt for two missing children expanded into something much bigger and even darker and despite what her family believes it wasn t looking good for the former beauty queen says morgan loew morgan loew looking at these cases separately you begin to see that there is a common denominator and that common denominator is lori vallow she has a dead husband she has two missing children she has a new husband who has a dead wife she is the factor that connects all of these separate cases together on march 5 2020 five months after police say lori vallow daybell s children were last seen she was extradited from hawaii to a tiny airport in rexburg idaho to face child abandonment charges morgan loew was there morgan loew she gets out of the plane and she s wearing a bulletproof vest and surrounded by officers and they whisk her into this vehicle after being one of the first reporters in the country on this story loew had lori within earshot morgan loew the suv stopped right in front of me and i find myself four inches away from lori morgan loew and she looked through the window with this weird sort of blank expression on her face and then turned her head morgan loew the day of lori s initial appearance in rexburg the courtroom was jam packed and lori walks in and she s wearing this orange and white stripped jail outfit and this red lipstick morgan loew it was such an odd sight to see judge ms daybell do you understand what count 1 alleges as well as the maximum penalties lori vallow daybell yes dee ann carter i don t like to hate on people laughs or talk badly but it it did make me mad she had done herself up made herself look good but still nothing about the children kay woodcock is trying to hold onto hope but her mind keeps going back to something charles told her lori said about jj kay woodcock she didn t want jj anymore jj was too much for her to handle adding to kay s concerns police discovered a bottle of prescription medicine for jj s autism with 17 pills remaining the last time it had been filled was months before jj disappeared and remember jj s service dog bailey the one he loved so much lori returned him three weeks before jj disappeared which still baffles the dog s trainer neal mestas at first i said i don t think i heard you right it would take a very cold and callous person which i i think that s who she is lori s sister and mother say that s nonsense they claim lori stockpiled jj s medication so he didn t need that pill bottle found by police and as for bailey janis cox i don t think bailey s an issue as far as jj is concerned jonathan vigliotti there s a lot going on that just doesn t add up janis cox ok i i do know about the dog i was over there a lot charles loved bailey jj was not really attached to it summer shiflet he was fine without him but in the months after jj and tylee went missing lori made several trips to a rexburg idaho storage unit and inside that unit morgan loew things that belonged to the kids bicycles toys things like that it s pretty tough to come to a different conclusion other than the kids were no longer around and no longer needed this stuff even more damning than what lori left behind may be what she took with her to hawaii jj and tylee s birth certificates tylee s bankcard which had been used since her disappearance and tylee s cell phone april raymond i don t know any teenage girl that would be ok with being separated from her phone jonathan vigliotti how about tylee s cell phone janis cox she told me in september that she had confiscated tylee s cell phone janis and summer say lori didn t want tylee to be tracked through her phone she was always fearful of those who she said threatened her and the kids summer shiflet she put her daughter first all the time she loves her daughter and her children and she always was like putting tylee s and jj s needs ahead of her own but by april 2020 the investigation had moved beyond the children s disappearance authorities were looking into lori and chad for murder in tammy daybell s death and they were taking a harder look at the death of charles vallow investigator at the crime scene he shot the f outta him i ll tell you that morgan loew maybe this wasn t self defense maybe this was a setup and i can tell you that people who know charles or knew charles believe that he was lured to that house to be murdered april raymond for one has never believed that story about charles hitting alex in the head with a baseball bat april raymond one because charles wasn t a violent person the second being that charles had been a baseball player and an athlete in college and if he had hit alex with the bat in the way that they claimed that he did alex would have been a lot more injured police officer got a little laceration do you want me to call paramedics alex cox no i d really like some water though charles vallow was afraid of lori according to those divorce documents rich robertson he wrote about what he thought might happen to him and he was rightfully afraid of that summer shiflet he wasn t scared of lori even the whole time he was filing for divorce and all those things he was begging for her to come back today it is jj s grandparents who are doing the begging larry woodcock to reporters i have a tendency to get very emotional when i talk about the children i get extremely emotional when i talk about jj jj is my heart the woodcocks are offering a 20 000 reward for any information leading to the children s return while they wait and hope the fbi has turned its attention to yellowstone the last place tylee was seen aaron teasdale yellowstone is one of the last truly wild places left in this country there are many ways to die in yellowstone park it s still hard for echo itaaehau to believe that life went from forever to gone echo itaaehau it s so sad just this whole thing just all of it is just heartbreaking itaaehau says she and her daughter vaisia tylee s best friend are praying she and jj are still alive and hidden somewhere safe to ride out the apocalypse echo itaaehau the only place they could be is in a compound or a bunker or someplace completely off the grid jonathan vigliotti janis do you think they re in a bunker somewhere janis cox i think that s possible but with all the headlines accusations lori believes in zombies and lori s past talk of demons and possession april raymond is fearing the worst jonathan vigliotti do you think lori vallow is capable of killing her two kids april raymond the lori i knew absolutely not but i don t know what the real lori vallow is capable of lori allegedly asked chad daybell to judge her children in terms of dark and light spirits a recently uncovered email from chad to lori in october 2018 gives tylee a rating of 4 1 d d meaning dark sadly it s not surprising to april april raymond it pains me to say but she would say that tylee had a dark spirit the fbi is reportedly about to launch a dark mission of its own a search in yellowstone national park the last place tylee ryan was seen aaron teasdale is a yellowstone expert and 48 hours consultant aaron teasdale yellowstone park is a very mysterious place you ve got places that are quite remote so if you wanted to get away with something or hide something yellowstone is an excellent place for that a possibility almost too terrible to consider that theory that tylee could have been pushed into one of yellowstone s many boiling pools the so called hot pots annie southam there are cases of people that have fallen into those and their bodies just completely dissolve that s a really terrible thought aaron teasdale is skeptical of this theory aaron teasdale there s different acidities there s different temperatures if you don t pick the right pool it s not necessarily going to work but yellowstone with its rugged terrain and wild ways is good at keeping its secrets says teasdale aaron teasdale if there is a dead thing in yellowstone the living community of the park will find it sometimes the bones will even get eaten in a situation like this it s entirely possible that there will be very little to find lori vallow daybell remains in jail in rexburg idaho in may 2020 she appeared in court to ask a judge to reduce her million dollar bond wearing a mask due to the coronavirus pandemic that request was denied lori s lawyer mark means spoke after the hearing mark means to reporters regardless of how you feel about religious beliefs personal beliefs actions inactions she s entitled to a defense we maintain her innocence chad daybell has not been charged with any crime and appears to stand by lori jj s grandmother kay woodcock is now appealing to chad on facebook writing show us if tylee jj are okay and i am begging you chad end this now in a little over a week it will be jj s 8th birthday jonathan vigliotti every night before you go to bed you know you re waking up to this reality what do you think before you fall asleep kay woodcock i pray we just pray about it that s all we can do tylee and jj s other grandmother says she s doing the same thing janis cox we love tylee and jj with all of our hearts as the search for tylee and jj continues their silent presence hovers over the town of rexburg two children who vanished into thin air with no sign of life no sign of death if you have any information about tylee and jj contact rexburg police at 208 359 3000 watch episodes from past seasons of 48 hours plus
