to get a ballot said heather smith executive director for aclu of wyoming south dakota and north dakota now is the time to be thinking about november and making sure that processes are in place for the least amount of disruption possible to the voting system when it comes to election day western states might be more prepared to face pandemic related election challenges than the rest of the us most of the nation uses traditional in person voting in a poll booth but in 2018 69 percent of votes in the west were cast by mail according to the vote at home institute a nonpartisan vote by mail advocacy nonprofit that compares to just 27 percent in the rest of the nation of the five states that vote entirely by mail pre covid 19 four are in the west oregon has done so since 2000 washington colorado and utah joining in the last decade and western states that don t have statewide vote by mail still have high numbers of residents who use absentee ballots the majority of voters in arizona

that it s popular not only among voters but also among local election officials a sign of its grassroots success this has been one of the keys of its evolution in the west locally elected county clerks some elected on a partisan basis others on a nonpartisan basis have been at the vanguard of this approach to elections locally elected county clerks some elected on a partisan basis others on a nonpartisan basis have been at the vanguard of this approach to elections thehistory of vote by mailhas had its heated partisan moments just as it does today selectively championed by both democrats and republicans in 1981 in oregon linn county clerk del rileywondered if he could improve the county s election process by moving entirely to vote by mail since the county already mailed sample and absentee ballots working withsecretary of state norma paulus a republican and the first woman elected to statewide office they got the republican controlled oregon state legislature to agree to a test of vote by mail after observing a mailed election in san diego in 1981 from there it expanded by 1987 all counties could conduct local elections by mail less than a decade later republican proponents decided to take vote by mail to back to the legislature this time to expand it to statewide elections in 1995 legislation to apply it to primary and general elections statewide passed the republican house and senate but democratic gov john kitzhaber listening to state and national democrats vetoed it there s really no evidence that vote by mail favors one party over the other the partisan views flipped however when oregon held a special election for a us senate seat using vote by mail in 1996 a democrat ron wyden won the race and the next time vote by mail legislation came up the roles had reversed now democrats were the champions and republicans the detractors republican house majority rep lynn snodgrass wrote in a 1997 op ed that voting by mail would destroy the integrity of the principal of why we vote in the first place arguing that coercion and fraud would take place an aide to republican house speaker bev clarno who is currently secretary of state and supports vote by mail said it would help democrats because there are more of them politics stymied the effort in the legislature that year but a volunteer backed ballot initiative brought the question to voters in

forth about which party would get an edge from it said priscilla southwell professor of political science at university of oregon there s really no evidence that vote by mail favors one party over the other today there is bipartisan support in states that use vote by mail andrecent polls show the majority of americans would support vote by mail elections because of the last two decades of successful elections in oregon where voter turnout is among the nation s highest vote at home advocates point to a ready made model that other states can adapt still advocates say transitioning states will need to work with tribal governments latino communities rural areas and other historically disenfranchised voters to make sure there s awareness of the changes and that early voting and vote centers remain an option for those unable to vote by mail with social distancing measures in place the key difference among the western states lies in their use of either vote by mail or absentee
