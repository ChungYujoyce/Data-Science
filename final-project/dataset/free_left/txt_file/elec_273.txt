voters but left ms weiner appalled it s so weird she looks like one of us but she s not said ms weiner who in addition to being a best selling author is an influential feminist with a large social media following you re on the bus with her until she starts talking about planned parenthood as mrs fiorina s presidential campaign gains traction and as the focus on her statements about planned parenthood intensifies liberal women across the web are expressing conflicted feelings about her candidacy at times there is gratification at watching a woman forcefully take on mr trump at other times horror at mrs fiorina s conservative policy positions which these women see as anathema to the feminist cause can you love a campaign but hate a candidate s policies read the subtitle of robin marty s sept 18 essay on cosmopolitan com titled carly fiorina is the candidate i wanted hillary clinton to be mrs fiorina has encouraged feminists to take her seriously after mr trump s remarks about her looks look at that face would anyone vote for that he told rolling stone magazine her super pac carly for america released a video advertisement called faces in which she turned the insult to her advantage in the ad as the faces of women flash across the screen young and old black and white all of them beaming mrs fiorina tells a heavily female audience we are not a special interest group we are the majority of the nation it is a line she repeated in the republican debate this is the face of a 61 year old woman she says later in the ad as the audience whoops and whistles its approval i am proud of every year and every wrinkle such shows of defiance and forcefulness by mrs fiorina have impressed many liberal women tracy clark flory a senior staff writer for vocativ com who has written about sex and relationships for salon and other outlets said mrs fiorina s debate turn was a powerful moment that created some dissonance given her stands on the issues i think even as a lot of feminists cheered her on during that performance we were loathing her actual policies she said there s an excitement and a horror that those two can kind of coexist left leaning feminists have not been so conflicted by other republican candidates for national office in recent years both sarah palin the republican vice presidential nominee in 2008 and michele bachmann a congresswoman who ran for the republican nomination in 2012 went out of their way to attack traditional feminism mrs fiorina has spoken critically of traditional feminism too in june when she still barely registered in national presidential polls she declared in a speech that the liberal version of feminism isn t working and said her definition of a feminist is a woman who lives the life she chooses that differs from the definition that mrs clinton gave in an interview with the actress and writer lena dunham the creator and star of the hbo series girls for a website ms dunham is starting when ms dunham asked mrs clinton if she considered herself a feminist she replied yes absolutely and expressed puzzlement at women who did not a feminist is by definition someone who believes in equal rights she said still mrs fiorina s background as a former chief executive at hewlett packard and her role in calling out mr trump whose remarks have offended women in both parties have captured the attention of many writers activists and other influential figures in the feminist movement as reflected on social media and in news outlets targeted at young women it was an irony first pointed out by the conservative blogger michelle malkin carly fiorina is an ice cold shade queen debate princess and i m in love with and terrified of her erin gloria ryan managing editor of the feminist blog jezebel wrote on twitter on sept 16 in an interview ms ryan said that as a feminist she was of two minds about mrs fiorina s candidacy at times drawn to her and at times repulsed by her positions and what many critics say were her exaggerated statements about a planned parenthood video in addition to opposing abortion mrs fiorina opposes raising the minimum wage federally mandated paid maternity leave and the affordable care act policies that disproportionately affect women i am constantly pivoting mentally with her ms ryan said adding that she had not at all been torn about opposing mrs palin or mrs bachmann mrs fiorina she said is contrary to the conservative female narrative the way she looks the way she presents herself the no nonsense businesswoman thing in an interview ms marty the cosmopolitan writer said she had been disappointed by the caution of mrs clinton s campaign so far and was intrigued by mrs fiorina s brassy candor and fearlessness still she said that under no circumstance could she ever vote for someone who opposed abortion rights ms marty said that for liberal feminists cheering on mrs fiorina was like eating at mcdonald s you know inherently it s not something you should be eating she said but when there s nothing else around it s what you go and take history suggests that each party s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions as measured by endorsements fund raising and polling republican women say the feminist head scratching about mrs fiorina has brought to light a hypocritical aspect of the women s movement they re not really looking for equal representation they re looking for more democratic women representation said katie packer a republican strategist yet the more that liberal feminist writers and activists many of whom view abortion rights as the ultimate litmus test hear from mrs fiorina the less conflicted they may become in particular mrs fiorina is standing by her assertion in the sept 16 debate that she had viewed a video about planned parenthood showing a fully formed fetus on the table its heart beating its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain planned parenthood and other abortion rights advocacy groups have called mrs fiorina s assertion completely false and many news organizations have concluded that she was describing a video that did not exist on thursday mrs fiorina visited an anti abortion pregnancy center in spartanburg s c where she took journalists into an examination room as she observed an expectant mother s ultrasound and remarked upon the fetal heartbeat and developing spine liberals and progressives will spend inordinate amounts of time and money protecting fish frogs and flies mrs fiorina said outside afterward they do not think a 17 week old a 20 week old a 24 week old is worth saving on saturday women wearing pink some of whom were affiliated with planned parenthood protested mrs fiorina at a campaign appearance in iowa throwing condoms and chanting women are watching and we vote on sunday in an interview on nbc s meet the press mrs fiorina insisted that the scene in the video she had described absolutely does exist but offered no evidence to back up her contention anna holmes who founded jezebel and now writes for fusion net said mrs fiorina had lied in her depiction of the video she s tough and she s very well spoken but i just don t think she speaks the truth she said acknowledging the early interest among some feminists in mrs fiorina s candidacy none other than gloria steinem weighed in calling mrs fiorina s claims about planned parenthood a 100 percent lie trump s greatest damage to women ms steinem said in a facebook post was to raise sympathy for carly fiorina by attacking her appearance advertisement
