advertisement supported by the two democrats arrive at thursday s forum with contrasting styles and policies tensions that will be laid bare as they appear onstage together for the first time transcript obamacare is working the way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on obamacare obamacare took care of 20 million people right off the bat 100 million people with pre existing conditions the fact of the matter is that the quickest fastest way to do it is build on obamacare so yes i m with bernie on medicare for all and let me tell you why i spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke and one of the number one reasons is the cost of health care medical bills look at the business model of an insurance company it s to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your health care medicare for all solves that problem we do have enormous income inequality and the one thing i agree on is we can make massive cuts in the 1 6 trillion in tax loopholes out there and i would be going about eliminating donald trump s tax cuts for the wealthy when you ve got a government when you ve got an economy that does great for those with money and isn t doing great for everyone else that is corruption pure and simple we need to call it out we need to attack it head on and we need to make structural change in our government in our economy and in our country the reason we re the country we are is we ve been able to cherry pick from the best of every culture immigrants built this country that s why we re so special it took courage it took resilience it took absolute confidence for them to come if you cross the border illegally you should be able to be sent back it s a crime if we say our law is that we will lock people up who come here seeking refuge who come here seeking asylum that is not a crime we need to continue to have border security and we can do that but what we can t do is not live our values i ve been down to the border i have seen the mothers i have seen the cages of babies we must be a country that every day lives our values by katie glueck and thomas kaplan he tends to meander and misspeak she once won a college debate scholarship he is a relative centrist who is seen by democrats in early polls as the strongest candidate against president trump she is a self styled progressive fighter whose ability to appeal to the broad electorate in a general election still worries some voters and party officials he rarely delves deep into policy on the campaign trail preferring to discuss american values and the dangers of a second trump administration she gleefully ticks through her long list of detailed plans in style substance and strategies for winning the white house former vice president joseph r biden jr and senator elizabeth warren present two starkly different options for democratic voters and in many ways they embody competing theories about what the democratic party should stand for those tensions will be laid bare thursday night in houston when the two candidates meet onstage at a debate for the first time in the presidential race join us for live analysis on debate night subscribe to on politics and we ll send you a link it s a highly anticipated matchup between the early front runner mr biden and a liberal standard bearer ms warren who has steadily climbed in the polls to challenge him mr biden is eager to stress his experience and his advisers and allies suggested in interviews that whether obliquely or overtly he is prepared to seize on one of ms warren s perceived strengths her extensive and boldly progressive policy plans and use that to accentuate his own record of liberal achievements despite the sometimes challenging political realities in washington you have to have plans but you have to be able to execute those plans he said at a fund raiser last week in manhattan a message he is expected to reiterate ms warren is unlikely to pursue the kind of personal premeditated broadside that senator kamala harris launched against mr biden in the first debate but she has emerged onstage as a skilled advocate for her message of big structural change and has shown that she is capable of crisply defending her far reaching proposals we start with a plan and then we get out there and fight for it she told reporters in austin tex on tuesday when she was asked about mr biden s focus on what progressive proposals are achievable to me that s what being president is all about it s about laying those plans out and showing the direction for this country and then getting in the fight leading the fight and bringing people along at thursday s debate ms warren will have another opportunity to stress the urgency of fixing what she views as an economic and political system that caters to the rich and powerful at the expense of working people mr biden a beltway veteran is expected to preach pragmatism with a focus on how to achieve democratic priorities in a divided political moment which democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week one risk for mr biden is that while he connects well with voters in one on one interactions he is prone to uneven and sometimes faltering performances onstage and the debate arrives as he has faced scrutiny for a series of gaffes and misstatements vice president biden has not proven to be really great on his feet said steve drahozal chairman of the dubuque county democratic party in iowa i know he does not think that his gaffes are a big deal but he is going up against a very keen intelligent articulate candidate who is able to frame issues very well a strong night for ms warren could further propel her already accelerating campaign both nationally and especially in iowa the state that begins the presidential primary process where mr biden already faces challenges she s been the one who s been gaining the most mr drahozal said with biden being in the front runner position i don t think he has a lot to gain he has a lot to lose mr biden s team has no illusions about ms warren s skill as a debater and her rise in the polls advisers and others close to the campaign acknowledge though they insist that they are not focusing on her alone mr biden spent the first two debates facing intense criticism from his opponents a reflection in part of his current standing atop the polls and his campaign is bracing for more broadsides from all across the stage allies noted that mr biden has survived rough debate performances before with little lasting impact on his national poll numbers that they argue is evidence of the deep seated good will that mr biden president barack obama s vice president continues to enjoy from the democratic base sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race they also see several opportunities for him to draw contrasts that could work to his benefit that list includes emphasizing his foreign policy credentials as a former vice president and a former chairman of the senate foreign relations committee amid several prominent foreign policy related controversies involving the trump administration his team is convinced that the democratic electorate is far more moderate than some activists suggest and welcomes a debate over issues like health care mr biden supports a public option but opposes eliminating private insurance something ms warren supports under medicare for all and which social programs should be offered for free and allies are eager to deepen an argument mr biden has been previewing that it is not enough to have ambitious plans if those proposals cannot survive the political realities of washington lots of other candidates have great plans they have good policy papers many of them have you know talked about them on college campuses or in the senate said senator chris coons democrat of delaware the difference i think is that joe has decades of actual experience getting things enacted in a bitterly divided and partisan washington and i think he can and should point to that ms warren did not face significant scrutiny from other leading contenders in the first two debates mr biden s allies are privately hopeful that she will be pressed on the details and practicalities of her proposals by several of the candidates onstage as her formidable standing in the race now makes her a bigger target for attacks ms warren and mr biden have clashed before exchanging sharp words during a fight over the nation s bankruptcy laws which culminated in the passage of a bill in 2005 that mr biden supported and ms warren opposed in april in response to a reporter s question on the day mr biden entered the race ms warren took a swipe at him over the bankruptcy legislation they had disagreed about but she has almost always refrained from overtly criticizing her rivals and any kind of premeditated attack on mr biden on the debate stage would be a significant departure from how ms warren has approached the campaign so far different candidates have different imperatives in the debates and there are some candidates that need to throw wild punches in order to get attention said adam green a founder of the progressive change campaign committee which is backing ms warren fortunately elizabeth warren is not in that camp still mr green said just because she doesn t throw a punch doesn t mean that she doesn t strongly show a contrast scott m stringer the new york city comptroller who endorsed ms warren on monday said there was no need for ms warren to confront mr biden on the debate stage i think she has to challenge the democratic party and say we can be incremental or we can be big and bold he said and if she can showcase big and bold i don t think she has to look at joe biden i think she has to look directly into the camera and speak to the american people and democrats speaking to reporters on saturday at the new hampshire democratic party convention ms warren portrayed the debate as an opportunity to share her message with a large audience she received a far more raucous reception at the convention than did mr biden who was the first presidential candidate to speak but asked to compare her welcome to mr biden s she did not engage all i can do is stand up and talk about why i m running she said i m not here to criticize any other democrat or anyone else s campaign still veteran democrats caution that for all of the momentum she has enjoyed lately ms warren still has work to do in assuaging concerns about whether her unapologetically progressive candidacy would resonate in general election battlegrounds elizabeth probably needs to show that she is ready to take on middle america the center of our country said sylvia larsen the former new hampshire senate president who also questioned whether mr biden could excite younger voters our primaries push people into a more left position and so to get back to a center joe already holds the center and so can elizabeth warren move back to the center if she s our nominee ms warren for her part has challenged the idea that a more moderate candidate is best positioned to win at the convention saturday she told the crowd that we can t choose a candidate we don t believe in because we re scared and at a house party in new hampshire on labor day she cautioned against nibbling around the edges without mentioning mr biden by name i think what s going to carry us as democrats is not playing it safe she said updated may 25 2020
