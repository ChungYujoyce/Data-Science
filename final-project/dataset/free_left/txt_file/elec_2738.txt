will texas democrats win by going bold or playing it safe they re about to find out houston texas armed with a package of campaign door hangers and a rudimentary grasp of spanish democratic congressional candidate laura moser spent a recent saturday walking from door to door in the houston suburb of cypress trying to convince voters who rarely come out to the polls in texas s seventh district to support her progressive agenda in the democratic primary runoff tuesday these are the voters texas democrats want to see turn out in droves during the 2018 midterms but in past years they haven t had a lot of success convincing them you re the most powerful voting bloc in the country moser told one skeptical resident if everyone voted you would get people representing you who looked like you houston is moser s hometown and like the rest of the state it has diversified since she grew up here many people working on their lawns or sitting outside in cypress spoke spanish and a group of latino and african american children raced their bikes up and down the cul de sac several neighborhood residents told moser they don t often see candidates for congress knocking on doors as she encouraged them to get out and vote during the may 22 election this lines up with how democrats have historically tried to win races in texas paying more attention to voters they know will turn out reliably the democratic congressional campaign committee dccc typically backs moderate candidates who they believe will appeal to independents and democrats and be more competitive against republican incumbents successful past dccc backed candidates include reps jacky rosen d nv josh gottheimer d nj and brad schneider d il to name a few the dccc is following the same playbook this year favoring moser s opponent in the runoff lizzie pannill fletcher the dccc hoped moser wouldn t make it this far dropping an opposition research file on her ahead of the march primary a decision that backfired and seems to have helped propel moser into this week s runoff this week the organization has stopped short of explicitly backing fletcher ahead of the runoff but she s clearly their preferred candidate tuesday night will test which path appeals to texas democrats are they are still rooted in the center or does their future lie in changing demographics and embracing a progressive ideology more broadly the tx 7 race has become emblematic of the conflict between the democratic establishment and its newly emboldened progressive base who wants to see the party swing left the fact you re out here says bunches a voter named elizabeth said to moser as she walked to her car change is you in these streets and i see that the next day moser s democratic opponent fletcher stood in front of about 15 people gathered at a house party near houston s midtown fletcher is using a different tactic in hopes of beating seventh district s republican incumbent rep john culberson who has been in office since 2001 a big part of her strategy is reaching out to disaffected moderate republicans who don t like president donald trump or congressional gop leaders running in texas fletcher wants to prove she can work across the aisle there s a little bit of a debate on how do you win how do you get the vote fletcher told one house party attendee who asked how she planned to win over republican voters our view and what i ve been saying is this campaign is going to talk to every single vote people who have never voted before people who have voted for culberson before people who have voted democratic completely fletcher insists she won t moderate her positions to try to get republicans on her side she s trying to paint culberson as a far right conservative who is completely disconnected from the district fletcher likes to say he spends more time in virginia than in houston a longtime houston attorney fletcher points to her republican clients who have pledged to support her over culberson if she wins the nomination we need a little more of houston in washington dc she said people are frustrated with culberson s record of inaction and people are ready for someone who s going to be their advocate and i think that we ve seen that this district has thoughtful voters who want to find someone who s really going to represent them the houston suburbs that make up the seventh whose residents have cast ballots for a republican for decades might be more likely to vote for the steady stable representation of fletcher over moser s firebrand candidacy i don t get the feeling that it s a slash and burn district said houston resident norrie leder a fletcher supporter and former texas chapter leader for gun control advocacy group moms demand action i am looking for people who can get things done some longtime democratic strategists in texas believe the stable moderate brand will carry the district in the fall and they think fletcher is emblematic of that she comes across as someone who just wants to go up and do the job well said colin strother a veteran texas democratic strategist i feel like she s prototypical of what voters in the district are looking for they re looking for someone to be an adult someone they know they can leave alone with a box of matches for five minutes and not set their living room on fire tx 7 was an out of reach district for decades but national democrats see a glimmer of hope after hillary clinton won the district in 2016 in the 2018 midterms the democratic congressional campaign committee dccc is eyeing it as one of three flippable districts along with tx 32 outside dallas and tx 23 a huge west texas district encompassing parts of san antonio and most of the southern border moser and fletcher represent the two schools of thought on how to turn ruby red texas texas purple by turning out diverse progressive new voters or appealing to moderate crossover republicans the way i see it is that we ve got one candidate saying what we need to do is play it safe and not make any sudden moves or loud noises and we re going to have a legitimate shot at winning this thing that s fletcher said strother then we have moser who says that s horse shit that doesn t work we ve got to go over to the far left and get people out to vote there isn t a huge amount of daylight between moser and fletcher on the issues the biggest policy disagreement they have is on single payer health care moser supports it fletcher wants to stabilize the affordable care act both advocate for more commonsense gun control measures and improved access to women s health care and both are running on issues local to houston including improving the city s public transportation infrastructure and getting more money for hurricane harvey recovery the two women have very similar backgrounds both are houston natives and come from connected political families both attended st john s the same elite prep school that produced filmmaker wes anderson and political commentator molly ivins but for all their similarities they are clearly walking different paths to a democratic win which is emblematic of a larger identity crisis for texas democrats that is the philosophical quandary we find ourselves in as texas democrats do we go bold or do we go safe strother said national democrats clearly want to play it safe the dccc thinks the moser method will lose a general election race against culberson it already dumped an opposition file on her before the march texas primary highlighting moser s recent move back to houston from washington dc and past statements she made seemingly denigrating parts of texas there s some evidence that the move backfired allowing moser to fundraise tens of thousands off it and earn the backing of the sanders aligned group our revolution strother admits that unabashed progressivism seems to be catching on in the race for us senate where democratic rep beto o rourke is running a competitive race against republican sen ted cruz but whether it will work in this suburban houston district is another question entirely politics is timing and matchups strother said for beto o rourke it s really working for him to be this bold progressive but that s on a larger scale on a much smaller scale neighborhood to neighborhood campaign i don t know that firebrand progressive would work democrats are about to find out the texas seventh is a huge and diverse district its neighborhoods encompass everything from the mega mansions and gleaming land rovers in piney point village to yard sales featuring poofy quincea era dresses in the majority latino and african american middle class neighborhoods like cypress the district s diversity is a snapshot of the rest of the state though texas is thought of as staunchly conservative its demographics are shifting rapidly hispanic residents are moving in quickly since 2010 more than three times as many hispanic residents as whites have come to the state according to the texas tribune texas democrats have historically been lousy at taking advantage of the changing demographics but if they can make enough gains on turning out minority voters in a year when it looks like there might be depressed republican turnout it could be enough to turn the red state purple this has major political implications for the rest of the nation from control of congress to how democrats run future elections moser thinks this is a bet worth taking but fletcher is clear eyed that she needs to win over at least some republicans to beat culberson if you look at the numbers hillary clinton won the district by winning 33 000 crossover votes republicans or independents fletcher told voters at a recent house party it s certainly not the only way to win but those are people who vote regularly and they re people who are willing to look at the candidate and not vote a straight party ticket the conventional wisdom is to play by fletcher s method some political experts say turning out the district s progressive base still won t be enough for a democrat to beat culberson there aren t very many districts in the state where an increase in the progressive base is going to do it for you said texas political consultant keir murray if you re going to pick up seats in this state you ve got to pick up votes in the middle there could be signs that s starting to change with a surge in grassroots energy and organizing in recent years there are a growing number of groups in texas organizing working class often latino residents on ballot initiatives for things like paid sick leave austin just passed a paid sick leave plan and the dallas and san antonio city councils are considering similar proposals progressive groups like the texas organizing project and workers defense fund are making a concerted effort to engage minority voters on issues like labor and criminal justice and encourage them to turn out even if they do not support specific candidates in congressional races we feel like our recipe for texas is rooted in engaging disengaged black and brown voters said crystal zermeno political strategy director at texas organizing project the reason why we re so deeply red is because there were old politics on both sides that really focused on that elusive white swing voter so for way too long there was disengagement for way too long in communities of color jim hightower a longtime progressive texas democrat who is now a board member of our revolution says progressives have been quietly mobilizing support and winning local races since 2016 hightower points to the last blue wave that hit texas in the late 1980s and early 90s and swept in legendary texas gov ann richards it also elected him commissioner of the texas department of agriculture he sees the same kind of wave building this year texas is not a right wing state it s a nonvoting state it s also a populist state that spirit is out there but you ve got to tap into it hightower told me hightower and other progressives say moser is exciting the left with her candidacy promising to be a different kind of texas democrat laura s genuine she s exactly what cd 7 needs said joshua butler a former democratic candidate for the seventh district now supporting moser in the end whichever candidate emerges on tuesday will have to face culberson in november the environment is proving challenging for republicans a recent poll shows trump has a 43 percent approval rating in texas and 52 percent disapprove of the job he s doing even incumbent sen cruz is facing a competitive election this fall against o rourke with that same recent poll showing cruz with a lead within the margin of error still republicans have a lot of structural advantages going into 2018 the incumbency effect is strong and the state has been heavily gerrymandered to work in their favor moser s strategy of turning out minority voters also comes with risks hispanics in texas are very young 33 percent of them are under the age of 18 meaning they can t vote the texas seventh has a strong history of voters turning out who tend to be educated wealthy and moderate and the democratic brand in the state has suffered after decades of unsuccessful elections the candidates the democrats put forth are just uninspiring said gina biondo a moser supporter democrats just don t vote moser thinks this is precisely the risk with going after moderate voters nothing ever changes we elect the same candidates in both parties she said there s a lot of cynicism and indifference that takes a lot of time and money to overcome i think you can get some republicans to stay home and others to be excited that is what i m trying to do the question is whether moser will get a chance
