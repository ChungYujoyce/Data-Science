the following is a transcript of an interview with the cbs news correspondents panel that aired sunday december 29 2019 on face the nation magaret brennan welcome back to face the nation and our annual cbs news correspondents year end roundtable it s now in its sixty ninth year which means it s even older than face the nation itself the tradition started in the very early days of television news joining me today to continue it for 2019 are our beat reporters based here in the washington bureau david martin covers national security you usually see him at the pentagon jan crawford covers the supreme court and keeps us straight on all legal issues jeff pegues covers the justice department and homeland security nancy cordes has been very busy up on capitol hill covering congress paula reid is our go to when it comes to all things particularly legal with the president she s now full time at the white house and major garrett was formerly chief white house correspondent and he now covers just about everything in washington as our chief correspondent in this town thank you all for being here nancy you ve had an incredibly busy end of year and we may start 2020 with a trial or will we will president trump face a trial in the senate and what does it look like nancy cordes act one is over act two is just beginning we will definitely see a trial i think it will happen in january you know nancy pelosi and mitch mcconnell have done this dance so often they could do it with their eyes closed it s just that now they re fighting over impeachment they re staking out their positions early she says she wants to know what this trial is going to look like whether there will be witnesses before she sends the articles of impeachment over he says he doesn t have to listen to what she has to say fine these are their opening salvos and what will happen over the course of this holiday is quiet negotiations will go on the two sides we ll see if they can strike some kind of deal that sets a sets up an overall framework for what this trial will look like how long it will last whether there will be witnesses 00 01 54 and the stakes are incredibly high you can see why the two sides are issuing these ultimatums because at the end of the day what this trial will determine is whether the president stays in office margaret brennan so major we begin and end the year with impeachment what what will the president do here because he chose not to participate in the house case if it goes to a trial what is he going to do major garrett so he s going to take a lot of advice and he has offered conflicting messages about what he wants at times saying i want a full blown trial i want lots of witnesses meanwhile senate republicans are saying look if the senate is prepared to acquit you mr president take the acquittal and go margaret brennan that s basically exactly what lindsey graham was saying major garrett not go but yes not go go but just take it right and move on and i had a long conversation with one of the key negotiators for the president eric ueland who s head of his legislative affairs who said we re still developing our strategy and the president s still going to build his legal team eric ueland left open the very real possibility the president will add lawyers from the outside not rudy giuliani but others constitutional law experts know this to build his team in preparation for a trial the most likely outcome i think is the president will i think move over time toward this something that looked a little bit like the clinton impeachment trial a presentation of the charges questions from the senators and then possibly a motion to dismiss and if 51 republican senators agree to that and talk the president into it that could be the sum total of this process margaret brennan so the president will be the first impeached president to run for re election does this stick does it hurt and does it in any way impact republicans in trying to win the majority in 2020 major garrett i don t want to fall back on to be determined but literally that it s all we can say about this will it stick yes it sticks for history it doesn t unstick you as president of the united states to be impeached ever point one so that much we know for sure point two does this become something that republicans have to continue to explain all year long or something that democrats have to continue to explain because the process was illegitimate or that evidence was weak here s what democrats i know we re banking on something else will happen that the president will do or some other questions related to this or another topic will be raised and they ll say see we were on to something republicans criticized this all the way and we were more right than wrong if there s a concern republicans have about anything unknown in this case or what may come it s that margaret brennan chief justice roberts will be presiding over this trial when and if it begins in the new year so jan what do we need to know about how he s going to try to run this jan crawford well i mean the chief justice i think is going to go in there with one goal and that is to not be the story i think he s going to really take a page from his predecessor and how he ran the trial of president clinton the late chief justice william rehnquist and just not be the story i think what s interesting for the chief and for the court in general is that as he is presiding over that trial across the street at the supreme court the justices are in the middle of what is probably the biggest term in recent memory every contentious issue is on the docket this year from gay rights guns abortion immigration even a battle over whether or not president trump has to release his tax returns and financial records so while he s across the street you know there in the senate he s also got a day job back at the supreme court and this term katy bar the door is going to be a big one and all these decisions coming out right in the middle of the presidential election cycle margaret brennan it s going to be significant i know paula for the state department and for the secretary of state this was an incredible unexpected focus for impeachment that thrust these people who like to be on the sidelines working on policy right into a pretty harsh spotlight secretary pompeo said he would be willing to testify and present evidence as required by law he seems pretty confident he s not actually going to have to do that paula reid his confidence margaret brennan is it a safe bet paula reid it s a pretty safe bet that the white house will not ask him to testify and this question right now of what do you do if you were subpoenaed by congress and the white house tells you you can t cooperate is currently being litigated and different officials have different views on this right now former national security adviser john bolton he and his deputy they re litigating this they ve asked the courts to decide if they have to cooperate but then you have acting chief of staff mick mulvaney who says look it doesn t matter what happens in the bolton litigation i would file my own case if they try to make me testify because they believe that if the white house can protect the president plus one mulvaney is that plus one so i do not anticipate that the white house will allow any of these officials to testify and i would not expect that the litigation would be resolved in time for them to participate in any of the present ongoing litigation margaret brennan what about the possibility major opened up there with something more to come the other legal shoe to drop both you and nancy would you weigh in on what does that actually mean for a trial nancy cordes if more of these witnesses are compelled to testify margaret brennan no if more evidence that we don t know up to this point and you think i think of rudy giuliani and his ongoing legal troubles if there is new evidence information that comes out due to a trial due to some kind of court proceeding on the outside what does it do to what happens inside the capital and the trial to come nancy cordes i suppose it s possible theoretically that minds could be changed but we have a pretty clear idea already of exactly what happened and there were exactly zero republicans who voted to impeach this president so the notion that there s one more piece of information out there or one more witness who might testify who would suddenly lead to the dam bursting open and republican senators voting to remove this president from office you know again theoretically it s possible but realistically i think it s unlikely to happen now giuliani is a wildcard here i mean he is still traveling to ukraine talking to former prosecutors claiming that he s got more evidence about joe biden and the former u s ambassador to ukraine and all the rest that s something that republicans dearly wish he would stop doing so you know and the president continues to praise him paula reid absolutely yeah nancy cordes and egg him on paula reid and he s nancy cordes so you know that that is a problem for the president but at this point we don t see any signs of the republicans wall of support for him crack cracking paula reid because giuliani said he would be willing to participate in the senate trial he wasn t even interested in being a witness so much as he was in cross examining but he is alone in thinking that that is a good idea mostly because he is currently under investigation by the trump justice department and there is no one in the west wing except for the president who has ever suggested to me that they believe he is helping his defense at this time so the president as you noted he believes that he brings gravitas to his case he still sees him as he was in 9 11 it s unclear if the president would support his participation but again he would be the lone voice thinking that bringing giuliani into this trial would help the president s case major garrett and just to be clear i wasn t suggesting that some new evidence might emerge in early 2020 that would change the outcome of the trial but things might come out that would be suggestive that the president was more guilty than the current body of evidence suggests and i think democrats think that is at least possible possibly likely margaret brennan david martin i want to get you in here because this is all the politics of it but this came from the national security world this concern it all comes back to anti tank javelin missiles russia s annexation of crimea an intervention in ukraine all of this is the backdrop to what led to the withholding of military aid and the political standoff what is the bottom line here in terms of if vladimir putin is emboldened does the pentagon have concern that all this public posturing has hurt their position david martin well there s politically emboldened and how can he not be politically emboldened when you have so many elected officials in the united states parroting his talking points but i and the military and the pentagon all look at this through more nuts and bolts eyes and what we see is that ever since the annexation of crimea in 2014 the u s military has doubled down on its plans and its training for reinforcing europe last year i went to an exercise in norway which was the biggest since the end of the cold war next year the army is going to put more troops into germany than it has in this century so the u s military despite all the bad mouthing of nato the u s military is continuing to to concentrate on the defense of europe that doesn t mean that all of this hybrid warfare the cyber attacks and the disinformation that that continues but in terms of somebody coming across the border the u s military has been on top of that since since crimea margaret brennan france s president called this an open wound in the middle of europe and i know end of year we re looking at this potential cease fire vladimir putin and russia constantly come back speaker pelosi said it always comes back to vladimir putin jeff pegues on that the russian interest front tell me about election security going into 2020 will russia try to replicate what they did in 2016 jeff pegues well i think that s what u s officials are anticipating but having covered this issue it s hard to believe that when a criminal breaks into a house he s going to use the same tactic the next time and so that is the the challenge here is trying to harden the systems that were weak in 2016 but then how do you try to anticipate what the russians might try to do next every time we see any type of cyber attack the tactics evolve and so from what i m hearing there is some concern that those tactics might evolve further in 2020 and even though u s officials have made some gains working with state officials across the country and hardening these voter databases and helping with a routine scanning of these voter databases there is still some concern that there remains a vulnerability there margaret brennan the u s intelligence assessment said not just russia but china iran jeff pegues well exactly margaret brennan all things to watch and worry about in terms of election security but i d like for both you and paula to weigh in on the other big probe that we don t yet know the results of and that is what s called the durham investigation this is all about the attorney general and jan you may know a bit about this as well given your past interviews with him what is it that we can expect the attorney general to reveal about the origins of the mueller investigation the probe of the probe is this going to be what president trump is looking for paula reid i think it is even if as my sources tell me it s unlikely that anyone will be criminally charged this is no longer just a review this is a criminal investigation being conducted by the u s attorney in connecticut i don t expect anyone will be charged but the president doesn t necessarily need anyone to be charged because if this is released next year during the 2020 campaign it s an opportunity for the president to revisit everything that we just heard in the inspector general s report about the mistakes that were made so it is a great opportunity for him and the attorney general has recently confirmed that this is a pretty broad investigation this isn t just about the fbi it s not just about fisa this is looking to private people private entities all the intelligence agencies so there s a big opportunity for president trump during the campaign to revisit what he believes is an affirmation of all the allegations he has made about the origins of the russia investigation being politically motivated margaret brennan what is the impact at those agencies jeff pegues well and i was going to say that this upcoming i g report i think sometimes people get confused about the two this will focus as paula noted on the cia s actions because you know margaret brennan are you talking about the durham report jeff pegues the durham report you know even though there s been a lot of focus on the fbi s actions a lot of the russian investigation originated with the cia and specifically john brennan who s been very vocal about his role at the start of this investigation in that they were seeing the contacts and then he went to his counterpart in the russian government told them to stop and also obviously brought this to the attention of james comey at the fbi so as paula noted this is an investigation the i g investigation that durham is running that will look broader scope and we ll probably hear more about the cia in that report jan crawford yeah this is a highly respected prosecutor both sides of the aisle so i think that the report will have quite a bit of currency when he comes out with it the attorney general made clear and has consistently made clear there was spying on the trump campaign he doesn t understand that word to be pejorative it is what it is i mean it it it there was what was the grounds for that was there justification it s as paula indicated it s a very broad charge that he has and clearly the attorney general believes there s good reason for it jeff pegues and of course chris wray keeps pushing back against that term spying he keeps margaret brennan the fbi director jeff pegues that is not something that we would say 00 15 27 and even though there s been all this jan crawford i mean if you think about what what the attorney general means by that that s surveillance there was surveillance spying done it s not so he s saying look it up in the dictionary this is why are we having this debate over semantics and what was the grounds for it was there justification for it that s what he s troubled by jeff pegues yeah and i understand that but i also think that the fbi would say you know that assigns a nefarious motive to what they were trying to do i mean what they were seeing in 2016 with this was this widespread russian operation and they were seeing not only cyber attacks but the contacts with trump campaign officials and so that s why you have fbi officials pushing back against that and what they try to emphasize is this fact that you know the ig report that horowitz conducted found that their that their launch of this investigation was justified and there was no political bias involved even though there were mistakes made in the fisa applications margaret brennan we hear about this on the campaign 2020 trail major garrett sure it is in which vein of grievance for the president and his supporters to be sure and in this season where there is sometimes references to the island of misfit toys president trump s orientation to every behavior is it is the island of perfect activity nothing is wrong nothing could be questioned in the campaign even though these linkages amid this russian activity were suspicious and identified as such legitimate veins of inquiry president says no absolutely not we go back now to ukraine everything is perfect you ask most republicans on the hill they don t believe everything was perfect they will not they will argue that on the president s behalf in a impeachment proceeding but privately they think this is a bit pushing it but for the president everything is always perfect it is that politics of absolutism and until it stops working for him he s going to stay there margaret brennan david martin the trump administration is staring down an end of year deadline of sorts set by kim jong un of north korea saying that diplomacy expires and they are preparing for the test of satellite a long range icbm what this does is it basically throws into question president trump s centerpiece foreign policy issue and thrust us pretty close to crisis not just in an election year but at a pretty critical time for north korea s nuclear program how much stronger are they now how much bigger is the threat david martin well it s been more than two years since they tested a long range missile that could reach the united states but you can be sure kim jong un s rocket scientists haven t been sitting around popping bonbons for the past two years they ve been hard at work trying to develop a better more reliable more accurate missile and we will know how much progress they ve made when we start seeing their tests and if they have developed a missile that doesn t just have a theoretical range of reaching the united states but has a no kidding military capability to drop a nuclear warhead on us then we are in a situation we have never been in before with north korea despite all these decades of crises so it s a big deal 00 18 46 twenty margaret brennan its a it s a huge deal behind this behind the impeachment seas the national security community is very focused on exactly that cbs s robert carlin predicts we are about to see the unraveling of the situation in east asia and the beginning of the most serious most dangerous crisis we have seen at a time we re paralyzed with our domestic political struggles 00 19 08 that s pretty stark david martin and he s not a guy who lets his hair catch on fire major garrett no he s not an alarmist at all quite to the contrary david martin 2019 in north korea is going to be remembered as the year the music died and the music being this fantasia that kim jong un would give up his nuclear weapons and the us and north korea would live happily ever after margaret brennan and it thrust us into 2020 politics and we will take a break here because we have a lot more to talk about on the other side of this break stay with us with our predictions for 2020 part two margaret brennan and we re back now with our cbs news correspondents panel jeff hard to believe that we started in 2019 with the longest government shutdown in history and it was all over immigration and then we end the year and nothing really has changed on immigration on the legislative side but what is actually happening now at the border jeff pegues well we don t see the border in the headlines as much as we used to especially earlier in the year i mean if you re a supporter of this administration they ve made some progress in terms of the apprehensions at the border in fact i think it was in may the number of apprehensions was up to one hundred and thirty something thousand in november of this year it was down to thirty three thousand so they ve they ve made some progress there if you support the administration and i think that shows because it s not in the headlines as much as it was but of course if you re on the other side of this and you are not a fan of the tactics that the administration uses you you still have ammunition to use in your argument that what they re doing along the border is unjustified unfair and every other un you could probably think of you know they ve been limiting the asylum claims and there are still questions of how kids are being separated from their parents and how long they ve been separated from their parents and so there is still a lot to critique there but again if you re a supporter of the president you look at those apprehension numbers and they re down quite a bit which of course means that they aren t seeing as many people trying to cross the border as they ve seen in the past margaret brennan jan you mentioned a really busy year on the court one of the things that will be ruled on is what to do with these so called dreamers the daca program what can we expect when when that when will that happen jan crawford well that s the case about president trump s efforts to rescind that dreamers program that president obama put into place with the sign of a plan by executive action margaret brennan and it effects hundreds of thousands of people jan crawford right and it s obviously one of the more controversial cases the term but i think with that case as with all of the cases on the court s docket this year that we re going to be following very controversial cases it s foolish to try to predict what this court s going to do i would not be surprised if the president loses that case but this is a court in transition in the olden days and i ve covered the court for quite a long time you could get a pretty good feel for the way the court was going to decide a case based on how they ask the questions at argument a lot of the questions were designed to get the vote of justice kennedy so the justices would generally tip their hands because they d be really going after that side that they disagreed with during oral argument now they ask questions of both sides it s it s a very different feel at argument which makes this court very difficult to predict so i think you know anytime that you see someone saying it looks like the court s going to rule this way take that with a grain of salt margaret brennan but we can expect this before the election jan crawford all of these cases will come down most controversial cases come down by the end of the term in june right in the middle of the presidential election so you re gonna get the supreme court weighing in on daca abortion rights gay rights gun rights potentially the president s tax returns i mean these are all any given year one of these cases would be landmark blockbuster term this is a very unusual year for the supreme court in that we ve got all of them and that s partly because the court last year was so quiet they punted on a lot of these issues after the contentious kavanaugh hearings they kind of wanted to cool the temperature so last year was very quiet that s why i said this year it s buckle your seat belts margaret brennan and that red meat lands right in the middle of election season major garrett it will make the future of the court a central issue of the 2020 campaign it was a partial issue in 2016 identified by then candidate and then ultimately nominee donald trump he put out a list for the first time in the history of american presidential politics this is who i would choose from if i become president for the supreme court as jan well knows the president s legacy already on adding to the federal bench both at the district court level and at the circuit court level is ahead of many of his predecessors he is already remaking the federal bench jan crawford that is a that is a story that he people really aren t focused on either i mean he s already put a quarter of the federal appeals court judges on the bench right now about 50 federal appeals court judges he s transforming the federal judiciary 133 district judges major garrett it s long been an issue for republicans it will be a huge issue for democrats and these decisions will come just before the conventions in july margaret brennan and the president has done that with a very strong assist from the republican leader mitch mcconnell nancy nancy cordes exactly and that s why when speaker pelosi started suggesting that she was going to withhold these articles of impeachment he said great i ll just call up a few more judicial nominations and we ve got plenty to fill the time you know hold on to those articles for as long as you want this is without a doubt the top priority for the senate majority leader he has the majority now but several of his members have tough re election fight so he is going to try to get as many judges as possible confirmed there s been all kinds of legislation some of it bipartisan legislation that has come over from the house but he s made no bones about the fact that he wants to spend a lot of his time on these judges jan crawford and if i can say why this is important and as obviously we talk about the supreme court the court only takes up about seventy five cases a year most of the decisions and the policy they re getting made in those appeals courts margaret brennan and david i want to come back to you on another emerging crisis and that is iran president trump campaigned in 2016 on being stronger and deterring iran his policy has not done that yet david martin no it hasn t but we are basically conducting a campaign of economic warfare margaret brennan right david martin against iran margaret brennan through sanctions david martin through sanctions and when a nation is under attack it tends to strike back with the means that it has at its command and lately iranian backed militias in iraq have been shelling bases where u s troops and u s personnel are located those rockets are not precision guided weapons and all it s going to take is one of those weapons to hit an american dormitory and american office building and it is game on and sure you can say both countries don t want war but the margin for for error is very slim iran is a ticking bomb margaret brennan and the president s red line as you just indicated there was a single american casualty david martin a single american casualty and the iranians according to u s intelligence actually devote a considerable amount of time to debating well exactly how many dead americans could we get away with well now he s told them margaret brennan david you re putting chills down our spine with our predictions of the year to come laughter we re all going to need a drink by the end of this major garrett from the holiday from the holiday cheer corner david martin margaret brennan i know david martin thank you nancy cordes it s been nice knowing all of you margaret brennan but it is a sobering and important reality when when we you know we talk just about the politics with the national security community is concerned about in really severe fashion are some of these flashing lights and you don t major hear a lot about them on the campaign trail right now i know it s not supposed to impact democratic primary voters but they may be forced to start talking about what david is describing if these situations flare major garrett if these situations flare if these situations flare and the headlines force a reckoning with these underlying issues that most democrats during the campaign have not talked about it s been primarily focused on domestic policy and if i could say just two things about the democratic nomination two resilient forces you don t get a lot of credit for their resilience one joe biden middling debate performances not big crowds doesn t raise nearly as much money yet he stays near the top both in most of the early states and nationally also bernie sanders thought to be kind of an also ran oh he was there in 2016 he has remained a potent and immovable force and if you ask yourself what democrats position to do well credibly well in all four of the first contests the answer is bernie sanders others have risen and fallen bernie remains resilient those are two fascinating stories to keep track of on the democratic side heading into 2012 00 08 15 margaret brennan i want to go around the table paula can you start us off though undercovered story and your beat and story you wish you could have covered 00 08 22 paula reid oh a story i wish i could have covered jeffrey epstein i mean that case had everything and i d watch our colleagues in new york covering that and i d always say my god this trial has everything this would have been the trial of a lifetime to cover margaret brennan the new york financier paula reid exactly i mean the victims margaret brennan who committed paula reid the people who were working with jeffrey epstein how he got away with this for so long what happened in his previous cases i definitely had a little green eyed monster on not having the time of the bandwidth to cover that and of course he will not go to trial because he he is now deceased but that was definitely a case i wish i had covered and in terms of undercovered story i d say the same thing i said last year which is the opioid epidemic across the country how that continues to impact lives but how continues to morph too and how the trump administration is trying now to focus more on fentanyl what s happening with opioid deaths decreasing in some aspects but now fentanyl and their efforts to try to block that from coming from foreign countries i think that s a story that that doesn t get enough attention but there s only so much so much bandwidth but truly important margaret brennan nancy nancy cordes undercovered story on my beat anything but impeachment i mean congress just passed a one point four trillion dollar spending package all kinds of goodies stuffed in there got very little coverage big trade deal very little coverage compared to impeachment gun policy we thought there was a huge breakthrough after el paso and dayton the president came out said that he was for red flag laws and he was for perhaps strengthening background checks that the white house would be issuing some kind of proposal we haven t seen anything we haven t seen anything from the white house we haven t seen a single hearing in the senate nobody talks about it anymore story i wish i d covered well paula got to interview elmo and big bird at the kennedy center margaret brennan i was jealous it was pretty cool nancy cordes and that was pretty cool i would have gotten a lot of street cred with my kids margaret brennan yeah exactly what about you jeff jeff pegues let s see what were the questions again undercovered margaret brennan your undercovered beat and what you wish you could covered jeff pegues undercovered i think these ransomware attacks on these cities across the country it is costing tens of millions of dollars to these cities and it s still sort of flying under the radar and ultimately that is a cost that will be passed on to taxpayers you know and i think people don t understand the implications of this how it affects these cities the cost implications of course and then story i would like to cover more one that is sort of developing now on this beat is attorney general barr s approach to law enforcement taking a much different approach on the obama administration did it in terms of what he s saying the messages that he s communicating in support of law enforcement and in the eyes of some alienating community because after the obama administration or during the tail end of the administration there was this effort to bring community and police together now there are some who see barr trying to well rolling back some of those developments and some of that progress margaret brennan jan jan crawford so i think the underreported story on my beat is president trump s transformation of the federal judiciary i mean we talk about the two supreme court justices but he s appointed a quarter of the federal appeals court bench now 50 133 or more at this point federal district court judges those judges are appointed for life it s the president s most lasting legacy they will be on the bench deciding issues of enormous importance to everyday life for generations the story i wish that i had covered i would say the women s basketball final four college basketball it s a great event i m a big women s basketball fan incredible athletes and competition and i wish i d cover that because that would suggest that we covered women s sports more margaret brennan good point david david martin well at the risk of boring people it s the withdraw margaret brennan no now you have to be cheery you re scaring us david david martin the withdrawal of the united states from the intermediate range nuclear forces deal with russia margaret brennan the inf treaty david martin the inf treaty it doesn t have much to do with russia it has to do with china because china was not covered by their treaty and so china had been developing these missiles for years and years and now the u s can start developing those missiles and it s already conducted two tests and what s at issue here is the buildup on those islands in the south china sea china has been making these military bases all around the south china sea once the u s has an intermediate range land based missile it will be able to threaten every single one of those buildup islands in the south china sea the arms race with china is on and in in many cases like these missiles we re playing catch up with china margaret brennan and that is i would say on underreported undercovered and also back in your scary bucket david because there is so much particularly on the diplomatic front that is causing concern with china right now the abuse of and mass detention of muslim minorities in china under covered talked about at the state department not talked about president trump but the human rights abuses and the scaling up of surveillance within china seen as a very scary test case for what may happen next in other parts of that country and with the military buildup you re talking about a lot of people talking about it but not on tv so we re doing that today david martin do i get to tell you my margaret brennan sorry yeah yeah david martin the story i wish i margaret brennan what did you wish david martin i wish i had been there when they got baghdadi margaret brennan that s paula reid that s a good one david martin that that man was evil and to have been there when he was brought to justice i think would have would have been a great experience plus i would have been able to report whether or not he screamed and cried in his final moments as the president said he did jeff pegues do we know yet we still don t know do we david martin no i don t think we re ever going to know margaret brennan unless you can interview conan nancy cordes have you gotten to the bottom of whether conan is a boy or a girl david martin the all i can tell you is the latest which is he s a boy margaret brennan but the picture they released was of a girl nancy cordes it was a girl margaret brennan it was a female dog nancy cordes takes one to know margaret brennan anyway major final to you major garrett right margaret brennan undercovered and and wish you d cover it major garrett right so sometimes undercovered stories are complicated and this one i think falls resolutely in that category the president s relationship to people of color in this country his rhetoric is indefensible even by many republicans charlottesville send her back this year is what people hear and think about when they think about the president and people of color and yet it can be fairly said that this administration because of president trump s quiet prodding has done quite a bit for funding of historically black colleges and universities the first step back which was a massive first step toward criminal justice reform just a couple of weeks ago in this newly signed defense bill there is a law that says if you are seeking work for the federal government or any contractor you don t have to be asked and you cannot be asked about your criminal history until right toward the end that s a significant change long sought by criminal justice advocates plus opportunity zones in the tax bill directed at communities of color that is a legacy on the agenda side that almost any president after three years would want to claim particularly president obama many of those things were sought but you know what republicans would not go for it quietly persistently president trump has pushed republicans in this direction and i think that s an under covered story and part of something that neither he nor republicans really talk about it but it doesn t make it any less real margaret brennan it is all tucked inside and it must pass major garrett yes indeed margaret brennan in that piece of legislation major garrett what would i what i would i wish i covered this year anytime i see our brilliant colleague mark phillips in the water covering an environmental story that s why i want to be i m a native of san diego california i love the ocean i care deeply about its future when i see mark in the water talking about its future that s where i want to be margaret brennan all right major garrett on the climate beat what is your prediction for the new year major garrett it s safe but it s important that election turnout in november of 2020 will be the highest it s been in a century it could near or possibly exceed 70 percent and that goes to something that you talked about a little bit earlier which is how safe will the systems be they will be pressed to their absolute limits and one thing we can say whatever we can say about president trump s role in american political life he s made it more participatory we had a record high turnout in the midterm election in 2018 we ll have record high turnout in 2020 margaret brennan david martin you have an incredible track record in your predictions although i do have to say there s kind of a two year delay often you predicted talks directly between president trump and kim jong un two years later it happened you predicted the demise of al baghdadi who you just talked about two years later it happened so what s the prediction for 2021 jeff pegues pressure david martin you know i don t do well under pressure so 2020 is shaping up to be the year of maximum danger we ve got these two ticking bombs out there iran and north korea we ve got a president a commander in chief running for re election under the shadow of impeachment but i m going to draw back from the brink i m going to predict that we have an incident which serves as a wakeup call for our vulnerability in space we are going to lose the services of some vital satellite maybe say the global positioning satellites that runs all our our lives it will just be temporary but the worst part about it will be we won t know whether it was a technical malfunction an accident or an attack by a foreign power margaret brennan because of our cyber vulnerabilities david martin because of the amount of effort that russia and china have been putting into anti satellite weapons ever since they witnessed what we could do with space in the gulf war of 1990 that s how long they ve been working on this and they know that our military and now our our economy just depends on those satellites up in space if you re going to if you re going to strike america in its center of gravity that s where it is margaret brennan jan crawford bring us back from the brink jeff pegues tough tough act to follow jan crawford yeah i mean that s like it s like the today s version of the space race margaret brennan yeah david martin yeah jan crawford but but the stakes are a lot higher than putting somebody on the moon i guess my prediction would be if i go back to my beat my prediction would be that the supreme court s not going to make anybody happy this year i don t think that it s going to be a court that is uniformly conservative with rulings from president trump or one that s going to be uniformly surprisingly positive for liberals i think they ll split the difference and as a result it ll give everybody something to complain about margaret brennan jeff jeff pegues okay so i m going to predict something that has a little bit to do with my beat and the rest is off the beat so i think the baltimore ravens are going to win the super bowl jan crawford oh come on that s really going out on a limb jeff pegues i m sorry i m sorry jan 00 20 07 well i mean listen you re right they have the momentum heading into the playoffs 00 20 14 and you know for a city like baltimore that takes so many hits now the mayor that s going to prison the president of course has called it a rat infested city but i had some an opportunity to sit down with the head coach john harbaugh who you know talked about the team and the city and how lamar jackson this mvp candidate the quarterback is really representative of what baltimore is and that is a town with a lot of grit a town that never gives up and i just think given all that has happened there they have the momentum i think they re to win the super bowl margaret brennan all right we ll let you check that off as the 2020 prediction jeff pegues okay margaret brennan nancy nancy cordes well i m going to go out on a limb predict that democrats will retain control of the house republicans will retain control of the senate though the margins in both will shrink and i think that while the impeachment inquiry in the house is over the investigations of this president are not going to stop they ve won some early court battles they ll win some more i predict in 2020 and so we could get a very fascinating glimpse for the first time at not only possibly the president s tax returns but also his personal and business finances margaret brennan paula paula reid i predict that the president s personal attorney rudy giuliani will be charged by the justice department we know that they are currently reviewing his finances it s not that hard to run afoul of foreign lobbying requirements and giuliani has told me he denies that he s broken any laws but he also tells me that bill barr would never charge me but that completely flies in the face of what bill barr has said publicly bill barr was just asked several days ago what he thinks of giuliani s work these investigations he s carrying out on behalf of the president in ukraine looking into the bidens and the unsubstantiated allegations that ukraine meddled in the 2016 election and bill barr was clear that this kind of work is better left up to the justice department and through sources in the justice department i ve learned that the attorney general is not pleased to be lumped in with the president s personal attorney so if rudy giuliani truly believes as he has told me he believes this is ideologically motivated that he did nothing wrong but bill barr wouldn t charge him i believe he is wrong i don t i cannot speak to whether he would actually be convicted because while it is easy to run afoul of these laws it is tough to get a conviction but there are a lot of questions about where he s getting his money and you have two of his close associates who have been charged who have an incentive to cooperate and we have learned that they have received hundreds of thousands millions in some cases of dollars from folks with ties to oligarchs in ukraine and some russian margaret brennan and the russian mob paula reid exactly and the russian mob doesn t look good margaret brennan major major garrett didn t i start us off margaret brennan oh you did 00 23 01 i m sorry major garrett i m like do i have to have another one i i jeff pegues you had two major garrett the buckets empty i m sorry margaret that s it margaret brennan it s an exam major garrett that s all i got that s all i got margaret brennan you don t have a super bowl pick jeff pegues yeah come on what about the major garrett i could take a shot at alabama but i won t jan crawford well we ve already gone down a dark road margaret brennan yeah jan crawford with the ravens so let s just leave them out of it margaret brennan anyway it was good to have all of you here and we will all be back in a moment
