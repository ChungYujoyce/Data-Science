protests against president trump and his executive actions have been erupting across the country as they began immediately after the jan 22 women s marches trump tweeted watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election why didn t these people vote celebs hurt cause badly the tweet implied that people who protest do not vote research suggests that the opposite is true people who protest are no less likely to vote than non protesters if anything protesters vote at higher rates here s the research on whether protesters vote although we lack information about this year sprotesters the american national election study anes is full of information about whether and how americans got politically involved in previous years here s what they reported yes signing those petitions makes a difference even if they don t change trump s mind among those who said they had been in at least one protest in the previous four years 85 percent said they voted in the 2012 election compared with 78 percent of those who did not go to protests in the 2008 anes 89 percent of protesters reported voting in that year s presidential election compared with 79 percent of non protesters those numbers aren t entirely accurate people who don t vote often say they did because voting is generally considered the right thing to do only 57 percent of americans actually voted in 2008 but 78 percent told the anes that they did in 2012 55 percent of americans voted but 80 percent told anes that they did that makes surveys of voting behavior a bit unreliable why the women s march may be the start of a serious social movement with this problem in mind we analyzed the british election study bes which uses verified turnout it gathers identifying information about thesurvey s respondents andmatches this information against publicelection records in the 2005 and 2010 bes conducted during years that the united kingdom held general elections survey respondents were asked how likely they were to protest during the first decade of this century britainsaw frequent mass protests such as the 2003 anti iraq war mobilizations and in 2010 protests against education spending cuts and university fee increases u k respondents who described themselves as likely to protest were also more likely to vote in 2005 70 percent of the most likely protesters said they voted in the previous election compared with 62 percent of least likely protesters in the 2010 survey most and least likely protesters alike said they voted at a rate of 70 percent what does this mean about whether recent u s protesters are also voters the demographic breakdown of the women s marches assessed from media reports and observations suggests that those crowds were likely voters women outnumbered men at the protests and for the past 30 years women have generally voted at higher rates how much coverage did cnn actually devote to clinton s emails here s the data that s not as true when it comes to age young people everywhere vote at lower rates in elections and are often overrepresented in protests we do not yet have accurate evidence about whether the women s marches and travel ban protesters skewed particularly young however while young people in general are less likely than their elders to vote that s not as true for those who protest young protesters are also often young voters consider the evidence from chile a stable democracy that faced widespread student protests from 2011 to 2013 in two 2014 surveys of chilean citizens people who said they had demonstrated during the previous 12 months were more likely to report that they voted in the 2013 presidential elections in one of the surveys conducted by the latin american public opinion project lapop protest participation alone is not a statistically significant predictor of voting but it has a strong positive effect once we control for age in other words young people who protested voted at higher rates than their peers who did not getting involved politically by voting or by protesting has costs trump s claim that protesters are mainly non voters also runs up against the logic of political participation participation in protests is more costly and onerous than voting protesters who made their way to the mall or other locations on jan 21 or massed at airports on jan 28 had to make travel plans and coordinate schedules with others they might have paused to consider the risk of being roughed up by police or counter demonstrators the costs and inconveniences of voting by contrast are minor therefore we expect those who are willing to get out to march are often quite willing to get out to vote who believes in voter fraud americans who are hostile to immigration of course just as there are costs to participate there are also costs to staying away often people become politically active when friends co workers and family members expect them to when they believe that they have a social responsibility to be civicly engaged and when they care enough about collective outcomes to feel uncomfortable staying at home nearly 140 million americans cared enough to vote on nov 8 between 3 million and 5 million cared enough to protest on jan 21 and tens of thousands were angered enough by the refugee and immigrant bans to gather at airports the following weekend there is little doubt that trump s tweet notwithstanding most of the several million protesters in januaryhad also been voters in november and in fact because these protests so early in trump s administration have been historically large they may portend an uptick in voting in the usually quieter midterm congressional elections in 2018 erdem ayta is assistant professor of political science at ko university in turkey
