watch cbsn live by amy norton march 23 2020 11 16 am healthday as more people recover from covid 19 that means more people should have antibodies against the virus and it s possible that blood donations from those survivors could help protect or treat other people according to some infectious disease experts the general notion is far from new in the first half of the 20th century doctors used convalescent serum in an effort to treat people during outbreaks of viral infections like measles mumps and influenza including during the 1918 spanish flu pandemic the principle is fairly simple when a pathogen invades the body the immune system produces antibodies that latch onto the enemy marking it for destruction after recovery those antibodies remain circulating in a person s blood for anywhere from months to years in theory transferring some of those antibodies to other people with the same virus could help their bodies fight it off or given to healthy people like the health care workerson the front lines the antibodies might offer some temporary protection from infection in the midst of the covid 19 pandemic with no vaccine or antiviral drug coming soon antibodies from recovering patients could provide a stopgap measure according to drs arturo casadevall and liise anne pirofski casadevall of the johns hopkins school of public health in baltimore and pirofski of albert einstein college of medicine in new york city lay out their case in the march 16 online edition of thejournal of clinical investigation for one the authors pointed out convalescent serum is not a thing of the past it has been tried in limited numbers of patients during more recent viral crises including the 2003 sars severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic the 2009 swine flu epidemic and the 2012 outbreak of mers middle east respiratory syndrome reports on those attempts indicate the antibody treatment generally reduced the severity of patients illnesses and improved survival in addition to public health containment and mitigation protocols this may be our only near term option for treating and preventing covid 19 casadevall said in a statement from johns hopkins and it is something we can start putting into place in the next few weeks and months the authors could not be reached for an interview but other specialists in infectious disease and public health agreed the tactic is worth considering it s a good idea it s something that s been used before and we know how to do it said dr gregory poland who heads the vaccine research group at the mayo clinic in rochester minnesota doctors experience with the general approach is not limited to viral pandemics poland pointed out they routinely use injections of immune globulin purified antibody preparations taken from donated human blood to treat certain medical conditions in addition modern blood banking techniques which screen for infectious agents should ensure any such tactic against covid 19 would be as safe as a standard blood transfusion poland said that s not to say doctors can just start doing it you still have to go through the fda poland said referring to the u s food and drug administration it s not clear what such an approval process would look like the traditional clinical trial approach where researchers randomly assign people to a treatment or a placebo inactive substance is too laborious and time consuming to put the brakes on a pandemic but standard protocols will be needed including logistic matters like coordination among local doctors blood banks and hospitals according to casadevall we ll have to put protocols in place to make sure that the use of this sera is safe casadevall said but he added we re not talking about research and development this is something that physicians blood banks and hospitals already know how to do and can do today in fact the commentary noted there are reports that doctors in china have used convalescent serum in at least 245 covid 19 patients the details are sketchy but available information suggests the approach has been safe and reduced the amount of virus in patients blood dr bruce y lee is a professor of health policy management at city university of new york he said the convalescent serum idea is certainly worth exploring we re in a situation where the toolbox is pretty empty lee said both he and poland pointed to some key unknowns including how long do antibodies against this novel virus last what amount of antibody would be necessary to help treat the infection or offer some protection what is clear is that any protection would be temporary this would not replace a vaccine lee stressed vaccines he noted work by training the immune system to launch its own response to an invader which involves more than antibodies and what about people who ve recovered from covid 19 are they immune to it at least for a while there have been reports from china and japan of patients being declared infection free then testing positive again however poland said those cases probably reflect an issue with the testing i don t think they represent re infections he said that would be highly unusual first published on
