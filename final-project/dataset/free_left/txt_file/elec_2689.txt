twenty presidential contenders go head to head in the opening test of 2020 and the president will loom large david smith in washington sun 23 jun 2019 06 00bst last modified on wed 26 feb 2020 17 56gmt as he sensed the crowd flagging donald trump switched gears to the all important question of his re election slogan should the insurgent turned incumbent stick with make america great again maga which he characterised as probably and possibly the greatest theme in the history of politics or should he switch to keep america great it was the latter that that turned the stadium into a cauldron of noise ah i m sorry maga country but that wasn t too close the president said on tuesday night i thought you had it won and then i heard this cheer my eardrums will never been the same keep america great this week it will be the democrats turn to search for a magic sentence twenty candidates each vying to make trump the first one term president since george hw bush will line up over two nights for the party s first primary debates in miami all will be keen to avoid a campaign ending gaffe all will be keen to deliver a zinger that goes viral and can rival the potency of make america great again among the oldest candidates in the field is joe biden 76 whose pitch has been described by sceptics as make america 2016 again a restoration of the obama presidency when biden served as deputy but the youngest contender pete buttigieg the 37 year old mayor of south bend indiana has stressed the need to look forwardly saying pointedly there is no such thing as an honest politics that revolves around the word again with keep america great the important point is silent it means keep america great for straight white men neil sroka a spokesperson for the progressive group democracy for america said make america great again was clear and very much in line with the bigotry that underlay both the trump campaign and administration the slogan did something trump is unable to to do keep the loud part quiet and keep the quiet part loud with keep america great the important point is silent it means keep america great for straight white men the key for democrats is to articulate a bold inclusive people s vision of the country that is easy for people to understand and is as effective as make america great again in that is says something quietly that is it s for all of us we re going to need everyone to beat the kind of hate filled campaign trump is going to run the first democrat to enter the race was former congressman john delaney nearly two years ago other candidates have been campaigning and fundraising for months but for millions of americans this week s debates will fire the starting gun in earnest the line up is historically diverse including six women six people of colour and a gay man democratic voters are wrestling with myriad push and pull factors is trump such a uniquely awful singularity that the party should play safe and stay in the centre can they contemplate nominating yet another ageing white male is this election about turning out the base or reaching out to independents and disaffected republicans or has trump changed everything the candidates podium positions will reflect their standings in polls as of 12 june elizabeth warren and former congressman beto o rourke of texas will be centre stage on the first night giving warren who has been surging a real chance to shine on night two biden and bernie sanders will be in the middle flanked by rivals including buttigieg and kamala harris it will be a particular test for biden whose runs for president in 1988 and 2008 crashed and burned and who has been described as a gaffe machine last week for example he recalled the civility of racial segregationists he worked with in the senate he never called me boy he always called me son he said of one of them citing a racist term and earning a sharp rebuke from other candidates james clyburn who is african american and the majority whip in the house of representatives said on friday it was an unforced error that hopefully he won t make too many of but like in any tennis match one unforced error even two unforced errors would not necessarily lose the match biden was just talking about his ability to go outside of his comfort zone and maybe get a little bit too comfortable saying that clyburn has been described as the kingmaker in south carolina the first southern state to vote just from the reports i m getting people are telling me that biden is performing exceptionally well he said he has a tremendous reservoir of goodwill here in the state but biden has to be at the top of his game in the debates he added indeed biden will be the primary target for his fellow debaters henry olsen a senior fellow at the ethics and public policy center thinktank in washington said he s a 76 year old taking incoming from his left right and centre for two hours under hot television lights he s not had that for 20 years all it takes is one tired moment at 10 35pm and that s the story there a s high possibility of it happening a recent cbs news poll found that the ability to beat trump is the most important consideration for democratic voters 78 ahead of new policy ideas 40 and changing washington 31 during the debates trump will loom large olsen said the ideal democrat will have the personality where trump s attacks would seem crazy or just bounce off biden s isn t that amy klobuchar would be that sort of person cory booker could be the democratic base can only get you so far to win you have to do well among disaffected suburban republicans and blue collar former democrats ideally you would not want a strongly progressive platform because that gives trump something to run against you want something like the 2018 midterms campaign house democrats ran on bland vanilla issues and won but i don t know if the progressive wing is willing to let them do that ever since john f kennedy outshone a clammy and unshaven richard nixon whose pale suit fared poorly on black and white television in 1960 election campaign debates have also been about charisma and dominating the small screen a place where trump feels at home aaron kall director of debate at the university of michigan said viewers do think about that who could hold their own on a debate stage with president trump biden given his stature gravitas and experience as vice president would be able to hold it but he definitely doesn t have the star quality if there s anyone with that it factor quality i would say it s buttigieg trump s not all that comfortable with good news he is much happier on the attack with a clearly identified foe but he added none of them has the star power of trump or is going to get 20 000 people at a rally that is what the president pulled off last week in orlando florida democrats will also struggle to match the sheer razzamatazz of a trump rally a now familiar blend of rock concert sports fixture political pantomime and in the view of critics a bath in in rancid nostalgia just as the make america great again slogan is widely seen as harking back to the 1950s a nation of idyllic suburbia for white people and jim crow laws for african americans so the soundtrack of trump rallies is full of booming golden oldies with resonant lines on tuesday there was the rolling stones luciano pavarotti nessun dorma or none shall sleep frank sinatra my way the musical cats memory and queen whose song we are the champions contains the trumpian lyric no time for losers equally fitting the rally was held in a sports stadium and served up a matchday blend of fun menace and tribalism fans wearing team colours performing the mexican wave cheering their team and booing the opposition when the crowd hollered lock her up about hillary clinton trump s 2016 opponent it was like the muscle memory of football fans chanting about a long retired player build that wall is an evergreen favourite too and trump himself peddled nostalgia not only for an america that never was but for the alleged glories of 2016 his rambling speech of nearly an hour and half recycled the same old populist themes tropes and falsehoods from clinton bashing to fearmongering about immigration and offered few policy proposals when trump stayed on script and touted his accomplishments economic growth low unemployment conservative judges he seemed a little flat and the crowd felt it but when he aired grievances we went through the biggest witch hunt in political history and went on the attack against the media that is a lot of fake news back there he became fired up an ageing rocker playing his greatest hits democrats are a radical leftwing mob trump said a vote for any democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the american dream this election is not merely a verdict on the amazing progress we ve made it s a verdict on the un american conduct of those who try to undermine our great democracy and undermine you his base which was overwhelmingly white lapped it up as they wore t shirts that included the legends make liberals cry again and fuck your feelings bill galston a former adviser to president bill clinton said trump s not all that comfortable with good news he is much happier on the attack with a clearly identified foe at the tip of his spear that is his default mode he defines himself against adversaries and gets strength from an oppositional stance the core of his support are for him because he shares their antipathies he s the only leader in their lifetime who has given full unabashed voice to those antipathies part of the democratic base can only be satisfied by the most radical brand they re all leftwing loonies asked how a democrat can combat the upcoming tidal wave of hate and mendacity galston a senior fellow at the brookings institution think tank in washington said mr trump s principal weakness is himself the issue in 2020 is going to be at least as much his character and conduct as president as it will be about substantive differences democrats central theme he suggested could be an echo of george w bush s pledge to restore honor and dignity after the scandals of the clinton years there is no doubt trump faces an uphill struggle he is the only president in the history of gallup polling never to crack 50 approval yet he made fools of the pundits and pollsters last time in the electoral college at least and last week s rally was a formidable show of strength from his base trump raised 24 8m in less than 24 hours far more than any democrat tom tancredo a former republican congressman from colorado predicted i believe he will win and he will win fairly handily part of the democratic base can only be satisfied by the most radical brand they re all leftwing loonies but some are more loony than others biden is probably the least loony but because of that i think he ll have almost no chance of making it the orlando rally made clear that trump will redouble his efforts to mobilise core support and make little effort to claim to govern for all americans all the signs point to 2020 being a repeat of 2016 but even more nasty brutish and long less keep america great than hello darkness my old friend democrats are anxious to go high and find a candidate who like bill clinton or obama whips up huge enthusiasm the debates will offer a glimpse of alternative futures sroka said you ll see people ask not just for an alternative to trump but what kind of country do we want to live in after trump do we want to live in a country that retains the policies that contributed to the rise of trump or one that deals with the preconditions that allowed it to happen
