heading into the final months of the presidential primaries democratic frontrunner hillary clinton and herteam seem to be increasingly fed up with the sanders campaign which has remained competitive since the first votes were cast in iowa and continues to dogclinton from the left early last week clinton s chief strategist joel benenson remarked that if sanders wanted another debate he would have to tonedown his very negative campaign which as i discussed in aprevious article is anabsurd allegation considering the clinton camp has held a virtual monopoly on negative campaigning true there are some nasty and vulgar sanders supporterson social media who sanders hascondemned but we are talking about the campaigns not random users on the internet and clinton has plenty of unpleasantonline enthusiasts as well on thursday clinton herself vented about the sanders campaign at a rally in new york and whenconfronted by a greenpeace activistabout her financial ties to the fossil fuel industry shereplied testily i am so sick of the sanders campaign lying about me i m sick of it of course no one is lying about clinton who employs a number ofbundlers registered as lobbyistsfor the fossil fuelindustry as greenpeace documents here and in an issued response greenpeace democracy campaign director molly dorozenski said the following secretary clinton is conflating greenpeace with the sanders campaign but we are an independent organization and our research team has assessed the contributions to all presidential candidates we have not and will not endorse candidates earlier this year we asked both secretary clinton and senator sanders to sign our pledge to fixdemocracy and while sanders signed clinton did not we intend to continue to challenge all candidates to listen to the people not their biggest donors while the clinton campaign is obviously sick of dealing with sanders and would love nothing more than to focus on donald trump and fundraising without having to fret over criticisms about where the money is coming from it is not so much sanders but the left that has frustrated clinton and clinton supporters when confronted by the greenpeace activist clinton automatically assumed that she was a sanders supporter with purely partisan intentions not an environmentalist who is genuinely concerned about clinton s big money connections clinton and other democratic centrists seem to have concludedthat anyone who criticizes her from the left must simply be a sanders hack of course the astonishing rise of bernie sanders has represented a revivalfor the american left and the senator is the most prominent democratic socialist in american politics even ifhe is himself a moderate on the political spectrum for left wingers sanders is indisputablypreferable to clinton though he is no purist as some liberals like to claim according to the british website politicalcompass org which measures political ideology on a multi axis model based onsocial and economic beliefs sanders is the true moderate ofthe 2016 primaries whileclinton is a both economically and socially onthe center right andrepublican candidatesareon the farright sanders economics are keynesian or galbraithian explains the website in common with mainstream parties of the left in the rest of the west the labour or social democrat parties sanders is symbolic of a left wing resurgence and he has certainlymade clinton s life harder with his impressive grassroots campaign butthe left has always been repelled by the clintons with or without bernie ever since bill and hillary skyrocketed to political stardom in the early 90sand helped transform american liberalism those on the left have regarded them both as unprincipled careerists who are willing to say just about anything to get elected president clinton s administration frequently proved this to be the case and there is little reason to think hillary clinton who has shifted her rhetoric to the left during the primaries won t revert back to the center right when all is said and done the difference between today and the 90s however is that the left is no longer in its last throes as it was when the clintons emerged as america s most powerful couple with the fall of communism and the global triumph of corporate capitalism along with the reagan thatcher counterrevolutions the left which had become disillusioned and divided i e new left vs old left was in no shape to stand up to the tide of reaction moreover when reagan entered office economic inequality was close to all time lows after decades of new deal liberalism today after nearly 40years of neoliberalism economic inequality has returned to historic levels and american militarism has created a dangerously unstable world politics have changed with the times and the american left politically relevant again is very much determined to prevent another clinton administration of course this may not be possible clinton currently has a solid lead over sanders especiallyif you count her hold on pledged superdelegates but clinton shouldn t assume that those on the left will simplyfall in line if and when she becomes the nomination though most left wingers would probably agree that a neoliberal is better than a proto fascist clinton may be sick of hearing about her goldman sachs speeches but those on theleft weresick of the clintons twenty years ago and will remain critical well beyond election year conor lynch is a writer and journalist living in new york city his work has appeared on salon alternet counterpunch and
