advertisement supported by op ed contributor by james k glassman every day i run into republican friends who can t stomach a vote for donald j trump but don t know what to do vote for hillary clinton who has trouble with the truth wants to raise taxes and opposes free trade with asia vote for the libertarian candidate gary johnson an outlier who once ran a marijuana business and embraces isolationism or not vote at all maintaining a certain purity but allowing others to decide the next president i faced exactly these choices myself i have voted for every republican nominee for president since 1980 but i will not this time mr trump s appalling temperament renders him unfit to be president and his grotesque policy formulations mock the principles of liberty and respect for the individual that have been the foundation of the republican party since abraham lincoln even before mr trump entered the race i saw this coming i worked to open a pathway for an independent a solid third candidate who would attract the votes of the roughly two thirds of americans in the center a serious contender would force the two major party candidates to compete for votes in the middle rather than appealing to the wings i spent a year and a half on the project but a month ago threw in the towel the deck is stacked by the parties against anyone but a republican or democrat an independent has to run an expensive gantlet to gather enough signatures to get on the ballot in all the states suffers a severe disadvantage in fund raising and is effectively barred from the fall presidential debates by a commission loaded with party stalwarts through much trial and error i learned that this is whether we like it or not an election between mr trump and mrs clinton period and that means that if you want to stop mr trump you have no choice but to vote for mrs clinton there s no sitting this one out it s a matter of simple math consider a swing state like ohio assume for argument s sake that there are 3 1 million trump voters 3 million clinton voters and 200 000 voters like me who will never vote for mr trump but have reservations about mrs clinton if this last group doesn t vote or votes for mr johnson or another third party candidate then mr trump wins the state if the group votes for mrs clinton then mr trump loses a vote for mrs clinton neutralizes a vote for mr trump an abstention allows that trump vote to stand for this reason i strongly disagree with my fellow republicans many of whom i served with in the george w bush administration who say that they won t vote for mr trump because he s a threat to the republic but won t vote for mrs clinton either because she ll raise taxes neither is appealing but one is clearly a worse choice than the other last month 50 former officials from g o p administrations issued a scathing indictment of mr trump saying he would be the most reckless president in american history yet only a few of these republicans have so far said they will vote for mrs clinton i have some sympathy with this position but it is a cop out if you think mr trump is so lacking in experience and judgment that he shouldn t have his finger on the nuclear trigger then you are saying he is not just a bad candidate you are saying he is a threat to the nation you have an obligation to defeat him no matter what you think of mrs clinton i m voting for mrs clinton because despite her deficiencies she will make a better president but i have another reason defeating mr trump soundly will help save the republican party if he wins a party built on freedom and internationalism will become entrenched as a party of authoritarianism and isolation which means that within a few years it will atrophy and die this year republican senate candidates who should be winning are instead in deep jeopardy i ll be working to elect these candidates and after mr trump loses i ll work to rebuild the party in hopes of running a strong and sensible nominee against mrs clinton in 2020 unfortunately the trump campaign has already cost the republican party its credibility out of some twisted notion of loyalty party leaders previously seen as devoted to conservative ideals and policy are now viewed widely as unprincipled cynics and they deserve to be how do you recover from that for a republican to vote for a democrat and publicly declare it involves a cost you can lose business or lose friends you won t get a job in a clinton administration and certainly not in a trump administration but if you really think that mr trump is a threat to your country the right thing to do is to take the next step don t just say you won t vote for him vote against him advertisement
