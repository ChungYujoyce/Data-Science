the following is a transcript of an interview with u s traderepresentativerobert lighthizer that aired sunday december 15 2019 on face the nation this interview was taped in studio saturday december 14 2019 margaret brennan this week the u s and china agreed on the first phase of a trade deal that would roll back some american tariffs it s expected to be signed in early january we re joined now by the u s trade representative robert lighthizer the top negotiator in those talks with chinese officials good to have you here u s trade representative robert lighthizer thank you for having me margaret margaret brennan it s huge to have the two largest economies in the world cool off some of these tensions that have been rattling the global economy but i want to get to some of the details here china says still needs to be proofread still needs to be translated is you being here today a sign this is done this deal s not falling apart amb lighthizer so first of all this is done this is something that happens in every agreement there s a translation period there are some scrubs this is totally done absolutely but can i make one point because i think it s really important friday was probably the most momentous day in trade history ever that day we submitted the usmca the mexico canada agreement with bipartisan support and support of business labor agriculture we actually introduced that into the house and the senate on this which is about 1 4 trillion dollars worth of the economy i mean of of trade and then in addition to this which is about 600 billion so that s literally about half of total trade were announced on the same day it was extremely momentous and indicative of where we re going what this president has accomplished margaret brennan well that is significant and i do want to get to the usmca but because the china deal just happened amb lighthizer right margaret brennan and we know so little about it i d like to get some more detail from you you said this is set amb lighthizer yes margaret brennan you expect the signing in early january still amb lighthizer right margaret brennan what gives president trump the confidence to say china s going to go out and buy 50 billion worth of agricultural goods because beijing hasn t said that number amb lighthizer first of all let me say first of all i would say this when we look at this agreement we have to look at where we are we have an american system and we have a chinese system and we re trying to figure out a way to have these two become integrated that s what s in our interest a phase one deal does the following one it keeps in place three hundred and eighty billion dollars worth of tariffs to defend protect u s technology so that s one part of it another part of it is very important structural changes this is not about just agricultural and other purchases although i ll get to that in a second it s very important it has ip it has it has margaret brennan intellectual property amb lighthizer technology it has it has currency it has financial services there s a lot of very the next thing is it s it s enforceable there s an enforcement provision that lasts 90 days it takes 90 days and you get real real enforcement the united states can then take an action if china doesn t keep its commitments margaret brennan put the tariffs back on amb lighthizer well you would take a proportionate reaction like we do in every other trade agreement so that s what we expect and finally we ll we ll find out whether this works or not we have an enforcement mechanism but ultimately whether this whole agreement works is going to be determined by who s making the decisions in china not in the united states if the hardliners are making the decisions we re going to get one outcome if if the reformers are making the decisions which is what we hope then we re going to get another outcome this is a the way to think about this deal is this is a first step in trying to integrate two very different systems to the benefit of both of us margaret brennan but that 50 billion number is that in writing amb lighthizer absolutely so so here s what s in writing we we have a list that will go manufacturing agriculture services energy and the like there ll be a total for each one of those overall it s a minimum of 200 billion dollars keep in mind by the second year we will just about double exports of goods to china if this if this agreement is in place double exports we had about 128 billion dollars in 2017 we re going to go up at least by a hundred probably a little over one hundred and in terms of the agriculture numbers what we have are specific breakdowns by products and we have a commitment for 40 to 50 billion dollars in sales you could think of it as 80 to 100 billion dollars in new sales for agriculture over the course of the next two years just massive numbers margaret brennan and that is important in no small part because also this is a key political constituency for president trump going into the election to take some pain off of american farmers who ve been feeling it pretty strongly i mean the usda projects that the soybean market won t recover i think til 2026 because of the damage that has been done to it amb lighthizer listen margaret brennan is that how much of that that political calculus factored into the agreement to do this in phases because you didn t want to do it in phases amb lighthizer well it was margaret margaret brennan the chinese did amb lighthizer it was always going to be in phases the question was how big was the first phase anyone who thinks you re going to take their system and our system that have that have worked in a very unbalanced way for the united states and in in one stroke of the pen change all of that is foolish the president is not foolish he s very smart the question was how big how big was the first phase going to be this is going to take years we re not going to resolve these differences very quickly on the agriculture point that s a good point let me say this if you look at american agriculture in between usmca which is canada and mexico china japan korea we have rewritten the rules in favor of american agriculture on more than half 56 percent of all of our exports from agriculture this over the course of the last year what this president has accomplished in this area is remarkable and you re already any one of these deals would have been monstrous and the fact that we have all of them together margaret brennan right amb lighthizer is is great for agriculture margaret brennan i just want to button up on china though because the promise here was to do the things that american businesses have been complaining about for years amb lighthizer absolutely margaret brennan not just the intellectual property theft but subsidizing corporations in china in an unfair way for americans cybertheft none of that s here amb lighthizer well margaret brennan that s phase two when do you start negotiating that amb lighthizer so let me say first of all margaret brennan is there a date amb lighthizer let s talk about what s here rather than what s not here margaret brennan but that s huge amb lighthizer absolute rules on margaret brennan that s what president trump said this whole trade war was starting on amb lighthizer look at tech tech transfer is huge that s what s in the 301 report look we had a plan that the president came up with a plan we ve been following it for two and a half years we are right where we hope to be tech transfer real commitments ip real specific commitments i mean this agreement is 86 pages long of detail agricultural barriers removed in many cases financial services opening currency this is a real structural change is it going to solve all the problems no did we expect it to no absolutely not margaret brennan do the president said those talks in to start immediately though do you have a date amb lighthizer we don t have a date no what we have to do is get this we have to get the the final translations worked out the formalities we re going to sign this agreement but i ll tell you this the second phase 2 is going to be determined also by how we implement phase one phase one is going to be implemented right to the right down to every detail margaret brennan i want to amb lighthizer it really is a remarkable agreement but it s not going to solve all the problems margaret brennan well we need to take a short break we ll be back with us trade representative lighthizer in a moment commercial margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation and our conversation with us trade representative robert lighthizer let s talk about the other agreement the house is set democratic controlled house is set to vote on the usmca the free trade deal with mexico and canada that s been rewritten this is a win for the president to get this through but nanc speaker pelosi and her caucus did have some last minute maneuvers here speaker pelosi is quoted as saying we ate their lunch when it comes to the trump administration amb lighthizer so margaret brennan how do you respond to that amb lighthizer we had a great margaret brennan you made some concessions to labor here that was not insignificant and it did irk some republicans amb lighthizer so so so let me let me make a point about that we had an election and the democrats won the house number one number two it was always my plan and i was criticized for this as you know it was always my plan that this should be a trump trade policy and a trump trade policy is going to get a lot of democratic support remember most of these working people voted for the president of the united states these are these are not his enemies so what did we concede on we conceded on biologics yes that was a move away from what i wanted for sure but labor enforcement there s nothing about being against labor enforcement that s republican the president wants mexico to enforce its labor laws he doesn t want american manufacturing workers to have to compete with people who are who are operating in in in very difficult conditions so there s margaret brennan but you don t think there s a political cost because republican senators were annoyed to be cut out of this last phase amb lighthizer look it there are there are always process issues this bill is better now with the exception of biologics which is a big exception with the exception of biologics it s more enforceable and it s better for american workers and american manufacturers and agriculture workers than it was before for sure margaret brennan mr lighthizer thank you very much for joining us amb lighthizer thank you for having me margaret brennan and we ll be right back with a lot more face the
