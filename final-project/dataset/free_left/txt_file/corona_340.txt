advertisement supported by sean hannity rush limbaugh and other right wing commentators turned a pandemic into a battle of us vs them the kind of battle president trump has waged for much of his life by jeremy w peters on feb 27 two days after the first reported case of the coronavirus spreading inside a community in the united states candace owens was underwhelmed now we re all going to die from coronavirus she wrote sarcastically to her two million twitter followers blaming a doomsday cult of liberal paranoia for the growing anxiety over the outbreak one month later on the day the united states reached the grim milestone of having more documented coronavirus cases than anywhere in the world ms owens a conservative commentator whom president trump has called a real star was back at it offering what she said was a little perspective on the 1 000 american deaths so far the 2009 swine flu infected 1 4 billion people around the world and killed 575 000 people she wrote there was no media panic and societies did not shut down in the weeks leading up to the escalation of the coronavirus pandemic in the united states tens of millions of americans who get their information from media personalities like ms owens heard that this once in a lifetime global health crisis was actually downright ordinary the president s backers sometimes seemed to take their cues from him on feb 26 the day before ms owens was a guest at the white house for an african american history month reception mr trump denied it would spread further i don t think it s inevitable he said at other times the president echoed right wing media stars when he declared at a campaign rally two days later that criticism of his halting response was a new hoax commentators like laura ingraham of fox news had already been accusing his opponents of exploiting the crisis a coronavirus she said on feb 25 that s a new pathway for hitting president trump and when he falsely asserted that he had treated the outbreak as a pandemic all along fox hosts like sean hannity backed him up saying that mr trump s decision to restrict travel from china and europe would go down as the single most consequential decision in history a review of hundreds of hours of programming and social media traffic from jan 1 through mid march when the white house started urging people to stay home and limit their exposure to others shows that doubt cynicism and misinformation about the virus took root among many of mr trump s boosters in the right wing media as the number of confirmed cases in the united states grew it was during this lull before the human and economic toll became undeniable when the story of the coronavirus among the president s most stalwart defenders evolved into the kind of us versus them clash that mr trump has waged for much of his life now with the nation s economic and physical health in clear peril mr trump and many of his allies on the airwaves and online are blaming familiar enemies in the democratic party and the news media transcript have you been briefed by the c d c i have are there worries about a pandemic at this point no we re not at all and we have it totally under control it s one person coming in from china and we have it under control it s going to be just fine i ve always known this is a real this is a pandemic i felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic now the democrats are politicizing the coronavirus we did one of the great jobs you say how s president trump doing they go oh not good not good they have no clue they don t have any clue and this is their new hoax i ve always viewed it as very serious there was no difference yesterday from days before i feel the tone is similar but some people said it wasn t we re what do you have a very small number of people in the country right now with it it s like around 12 many of them are getting better some are fully recovered already so we re in very good shape we re going to be pretty soon at only five people and we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time so you re talking about 2 2 million deaths 2 2 million people from this and so if we could hold that down as we re saying to 100 000 it s a horrible number maybe even less but to 100 000 so we have between 100 000 and 200 000 we all together have done a very good job the flu in our country kills from 25 000 people to 69 000 people a year that was shocking to me but that s a little bit like the flu it s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for and we ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner view this the same as the flu this is not the flu it s vicious it is so contagious flu has never been like that and there is flu is contagious but nothing like we ve ever seen here anybody that wants a test can get a test that s what the bottom line anybody right now and yesterday anybody that needs a test gets a test they re there they have the tests and the tests are beautiful and in some cases they re in california where we have too many and then in other cases the distribution could be a little bit better for certain areas but we ve done a good job on testing the pervasiveness of the denial among many of mr trump s followers from early in the outbreak and their sharp pivot to finding fault with an old foe once the crisis deepened is a pattern that one expert in the spread of misinformation said resembled a textbook propaganda campaign yochai benkler a professor at harvard law school and co author of a book on political manipulation called network propaganda said that as the magnitude of the virus s effects grew and the coverage on the right shifted mr trump s loyalists benefited from having told people not to believe what they were hearing the same media that s been producing this intentional ignorance is saying what they ve always been saying we re right they re wrong he said but it also permits them to turn on a dime we can look at that and get whiplashed he added but from the inside it doesn t look like whiplash in january and early february when the virus ravaged china and doubts grew about how forthcoming chinese officials were being some pundits on the right warned that the country couldn t be trusted to contain the outbreak or share accurate information about where it originated starting in late january tucker carlson s prime time fox news show became an early outlier in conservative media sounding the alarm about a mysterious sickness spreading in wuhan china that had killed about two dozen people according to mr carlson speaking on jan 23 it was believed to have jumped from bats and snakes which are commonly eaten in this part of china to people fox news became a launching pad for the idea of halting travel from china which guests like senator tom cotton republican of arkansas urged while also at times suggesting that the virus had been created in a chinese government laboratory not far from the epicenter of the outbreak on jan 31 the trump administration said it would bar entry by most foreign citizens who had recently visited china some of mr carlson s fox colleagues were less convinced of the threat do i look nervous no i m not afraid of this coronavirus at all jesse watters a co host of the five said on jan 30 as he teased another host for shaking in his shoes fox news declined to comment in the weeks that followed thousands would die from the virus around the world thousands more would be sickened across europe and the first cases would emerge in the united states but the tone of the coverage from fox talk radio and the commentators who make up the president s zealous online army remained dismissive talk show hosts and prominent right wing writers criticized other conservatives who took the threat seriously drudge has a screaming headline rush limbaugh announced on feb 26 referring to matt drudge and his website flight attendant working l a x tests positive oh my god 58 cases oh my god oh my god for years mr limbaugh has encouraged his audience to be suspicious of science as one of his so called four corners of deceit which also include government academia and media on feb 27 mr hannity opened his show in a rage the apocalypse is imminent and you re going to all die all of you in the next 48 hours and it s all president trump s fault he said adding or at least that s what the media mob and the democratic extreme radical socialist party would like you to think his program would be one of many platforms with large audiences of conservatives 5 6 million people watched mr hannity interview the president on fox last week to misleadingly highlight statistics on deaths from the seasonal flu as a comparison on feb 28 mr limbaugh read from an article from the western journal a website that was blacklisted by apple news last year for promoting articles apple determined were overwhelmingly rejected by the scientific community the coronavirus mr limbaugh said appears far less deadly than the flu but the government and the media keep promoting panic joel pollak an editor at breitbart news whose work on the virus has been cited by mr hannity published several articles in february and early march that highlighted the least severe symptoms and best possible outcomes on feb 28 he urged people to chill out the first of more than 4 500 american deaths to date would occur the next day two days later mr pollak wrote another article criticizing a doctor from the centers for disease control and prevention who warned that the coronavirus was likely to spread the doctor was the sister of rod rosenstein the former deputy attorney general he noted who was once suspected of trying to help remove the president from office he assured his readers that he saw no conspiracy only the ordinary problem of scientists not being very good at communicating to the public mr pollak whose articles were breezier in tone than much of the coverage elsewhere on breitbart declined to comment faced with the inescapable fact that the virus was killing people many conservatives started sounding fatalistic yes it s deadly they acknowledged but so are a lot of other things how many people have died this year in the united states from snake bites the conservative radio host dennis prager asked in an online fireside chat posted march 12 to his website prageru where it has been viewed more than 600 000 times on march 10 the day that dr anthony s fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases warned every american to adopt an all hands on deck mind set ms owens scoffed at what she called the mass global mental breakdown as financial markets plunged people think it s novel that 80 year olds are dying at a high rate from a flu she wrote adding that when future generations study the world s coronavirus response this tweet will age well ms owens is the kind of influential conservative she has a huge online audience as well as sway with the white house and top cable news and radio producers who has been central to spreading doubt about the seriousness of the virus to mr trump s most loyal supporters in an interview ms owens said she did not believe that her tweets were irresponsible do i think it s irresponsible to say the economic impact will be the legacy she said it s not about being responsible it s about being honest after playing down the risks some broadcasters turned to coronavirus survivor stories on march 13th fox friends ran a segment featuring a 65 year old woman who said she caught the virus and barely had any symptoms during the interview the host steve doocy asked about the absolute panic and noted the concern about older people in particular well look at that he said to the woman but you are over 60 and it doesn t seem to have been a big deal to you right mr doocy said the interview was picked up that afternoon by mr limbaugh where its reach grew considerably given his 15 5 million listeners each week earlier that week when a caller said that he and his wife believed they might have been infected before the virus was known to be widespread mr limbaugh dismissed him let me ask you a question the host said did you two die and you are speaking to me from beyond the grave on social media people often responded with ridicule they called the virus a bad cold and circulated memes of a red t shirt that said i survived coronavirus 2020 by the middle of march the story of the virus on the right was one of how mr trump s enemies had weaponized the flu and preyed on the insecurities of an emasculated america updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities mr limbaugh blamed wimp politics which is liberalism mr pollak whose tone grew more serious said the virus had spread while democrats stretched out the president s impeachment we now know the cost of impeachment he wrote frank luntz the veteran political strategist who advises republican leaders said many on the right were applying the scornful own the libs mentality of social media to a deadly and frightening health crisis mr trump has also cast himself as a victim it s so unfair it s so unfair he said last week to mr hannity on fox news if we could only have a fair media in this country our country mr hannity and his fans may see criticism of the president as a histrionic meltdown of an anti trump mob but the broadcaster has dialed back some denial elsewhere at fox trish regan a fox business host left the network after expressing doubt about the severity of the situation the criticism seemed to catch mr hannity and other pro trump personalities at fox off guard according to people who work at the network if only because they did not believe that their remarks on the coronavirus were any different from how they have defended the president as the victim of an orchestrated smear during other crises mr hannity recently published a timeline of his own comments on the virus which creates a revisionist impression that he was consistently raising concerns the examples mr hannity cites include his praise of the trump administration s response and declarations that the greatest and best scientists are working on the virus and in his interview with the president last week mr hannity cast blame on president barack obama for the deaths during the swine flu outbreak of 2009 saying mr trump had been very gracious by not focusing on his predecessor s failings which he accused the news media of ignoring stoking a sense of victimization according to the president s critics is what has always worked for him it s a hoax it s a democratic plot that s the degree to which trump and trumpism is fueled by grievance and a sense of constantly having to fight for survival said steve schmidt the republican strategist who advised john mccain s 2008 presidential campaign and is now a consultant for an anti trump group and an analyst for nbc news but treating a pandemic as politics as usual mr schmidt added could have an extraordinary cost all the bombast and the delusional statements and the embrace of ignorance he said stand singularly alone at the top of a previously unreachable pyramid there can be little doubt that many of the president s supporters did not consider it bombast or delusion calling into rush limbaugh s program on march 13 the day mr trump declared a national emergency brian from richmond va urged the president to tell the nation to take a deep breath wash your hands take precautions brian said and don t believe the fake news and the media hype it s not that serious advertisement
