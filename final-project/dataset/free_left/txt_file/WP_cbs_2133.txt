thursday outlining ways that states should expand vote by mail options for voters amid the covid 19 public health crisis just seven months out from the general election cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchellsays clc leaders insisted that taking immediate steps like extending early voting and eliminating excuse required absentee voting could be game changing and may help prevent some of the issues that arose during the wisconsin primary earlier this week we will need a dramatic extension of vote by mail options as well as expanded early voting sites to spread out in person voting and drive by voting options said clc president trevor potter during the press call all of these require adequate funding from the federal government to enable states already in budget crisis status because of the economy to pay for these alternative voting methods some of the suggested changes could require changes in state law because state legislatures are having limited meetings because of nationwide stay at home orders in various places the clc insists that the time to raise the alarm about solutions for voter access expansion is now it will be a long time before the nation forgets the harrowing images we saw of determined voters in wisconsin on tuesday wearing masks and braving long lines on a cold wisconsin day at the peak of a global pandemic said clc vice president paul smith in some sense the silver lining of the kind of election catastrophe that we ve seen in wisconsin and in ohio last month is that this issue has become very real and very tangible because we re seeing the long lines and we re seeing the election administrators at the county level crying out for assistance added jonathan diaz who is the voting rights counsel for the clc it s become i think a very concrete issue that state legislatures and congress can really see it s not like a theoretical policy dispute anymore ad wars pac attack the pro trump america first action pac announced it s making a

reclaim the house cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarroreports that clf s and hmp s buys a combined 94 million dollars overlap in at least nine markets and states some notable areas that will see a decent sized combined investment are iowa about 9 million philadelphia more than 12 million and atlanta about 8 million though both groups say their rollouts are just the first wave of more to come there are notable gaps in both initial lists clf has invested about 5 million in new york and 4 6 million in california markets hmp has not invested in yet due to it not being a competitive presidential or senate battleground hmp has more than 5 million slated across texas a battleground being targeted by house democrats while the clf only has a buy slated for houston where it s spending 3 1 million in its efforts to unseat democrat congresswoman lizzie fletcher in texas 7th district house democrats are panicked about losing their majority and this is the first step
