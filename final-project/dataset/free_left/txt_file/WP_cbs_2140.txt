washington dr scott gottlieb former head of the food and drug administration under president trump said sunday that the continued rise in cases of the coronavirusin many states indicates that measures implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus didn t work as well as we expected in an interview with face the nation gottlieb said the direction of the epidemic is a mixed bag with the new york tri state region experiencing a drop in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations but the number of new cases rising daily in about 20 other states including illinois texas maryland indiana virginia north carolina and tennessee while mitigation didn t fail i think it s fair to say that it didn t work as well as we expected gottlieb said sunday we expected that we would start seeing more significant declines in new cases and deaths around the nation at this point and we re just not seeing that there have been more than 1 1 million cases of the coronavirus in the u s and the death toll stands at more than 66 000 still a number of states have begun lifting restrictions on businesses and social distancing guidelines implemented by the white house quietly expired may 1 president trump has also been focused on reopening of the u s economy which was brought to a standstill by the epidemic gottlieb predicted that by the end of june the number of deaths from covid 19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus will surpass 100 000 nationally and warned the country could be facing the prospect of a persistent spread with 20 000 to 30 000 news cases daily and 1 000 deaths per day becoming the new normal the country is currently seeing 30 000 new cases daily and 2 000 deaths gottlieb said but because only one in 10 infections are diagnosed those 30 000 cases are really 300 000 the challenge is that if we see this slow simmer through this summer maybe this summer s a backstop to spread i think it will be but we see this sort of persistent 20 000 cases a day maybe 30 000 but it probably comes down a little we see a persistent 1 000 or more deaths a day that s through this summer he said but what happens when we come back in the fall and schools are back in session colleges are back in session residential college campuses people are letting their guard down a little bit more people are back at work after an august recess and then you can see this slow simmer explode into a new epidemic or large outbreaks that s the concern that if we don t snuff this out more and you have this slow burn of infection it can ignite at any time gottlieb added gottlieb said that until there is a vaccine americans with higher risk factors may need to exercise caution when leaving their homes and as the federal government pushes for an easing of social distancing measures and for shuttered businesses to reopen even as the virus continues to spread officials need to embrace technology and push for the fast development of treatments the more that the government accepts the fact that there s just going to be persistent spread and they want to open the economy against that backdrop the more they better be doubling down on the technology and make sure that we re doing everything we can to get those drugs in time for the fall he said the trump administration has launched operation warp speed to trim the time to develop a coronavirus vaccine and is aiming to have 300 million doses available by january gottlieb said he believes by the fall there will be multiple manufacturers who have completed early stage safety trials and have doses that can be deployed in studies in u s cities so what you would do is deploy the vaccine in the setting of an outbreak in a city to both test whether it s safe and effective so you re continuing to study it but you re also using it potentially therapeutically to ring fence an outbreak he said i think we re going to be in a position to do that and i know companies are working on protocols designing trials to engage in that kind of deployment of vaccines what we need right now is more than one manufacturer to be successful we need multiple manufacturers u s based manufacturers to have vaccines ready to deploy in time for the fall watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
