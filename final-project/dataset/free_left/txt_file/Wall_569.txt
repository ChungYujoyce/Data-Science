saturday urging millions of high school and college graduates to fearlessly carve a path and to seize the initiative at a time when he says the nation s leaders have fumbled the response to the coronavirus pandemic the speeches aired hours apart combined the inspirational advice given to graduates build community do what is right be a leader with pointed criticism of the handling of an outbreak that has killed more than 87 000 americans and crippled much of the economy more than anything this pandemic has fully finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they re doing mr obama said in his first address directed at graduates of historically black colleges and universities a lot of them aren t even pretending to be in charge although mr obama did not mention president trump by name some saw his comments as criticism of his successor president trump s unprecedented coronavirus response has saved lives kayleigh mcenany the white house press secretary said in a statement that cited the administration s travel restrictions small business loan program and use of the private sector to fill the stockpile left depleted by his predecessor in speeches that spoke to social inequities mr obama said the pandemic was a wake up call for young adults showing them the importance of good leadership and that the old ways of doing things just don t work doing what feels good what s convenient what s easy that s how little kids think he said during a prime time special for high school seniors unfortunately a lot of so called grown ups including some with fancy titles and important jobs still think that way which is why things are so screwed up i hope that instead you decide to ground yourself in values that last like honesty hard work responsibility fairness generosity respect for others mr obama s comments were one of his few public addresses to a national audience during the outbreak and he said a leadership void had created a clear mandate for the graduates if the world s going to get better it s going to be up to you he said mr obama s remarks were billed as commencement speeches but they also appeared to be an effort to comfort and assure an american public divided by mr trump s handling of the crisis the former president also used the occasions to attempt to rally the nation in an election year around values historically championed by democrats like universal health care and environmental and economic justice since leaving office three years ago mr obama generally has avoided publicly criticizing mr trump but his jabs at the pandemic response could further inflame tensions between the two most recent occupants of the white house mr obama called the current administration s response to the pandemic anemic and spotty in a private call last week with thousands of supporters who had worked for him and in recent days mr trump has unleashed tirades against mr obama on twitter and on television resurrecting unfounded claims that his predecessor tried to bring him down by manufacturing the russia investigation the prime time event graduate together high school class of 2020 commencement was organized by xq institute a think tank that works with schools in partnership with lebron james s foundation and the entertainment industry foundation a philanthropic organization it aired on major television networks mr obama told the seniors the outbreak had forced them to grow up faster than some generations as they have had to deal with the pressures of social media school shootings climate change and now a pandemic he encouraged the high school graduates to face down those challenges as scary as they might be if we re going to create a world where everybody has the opportunity to find a job and afford college if we re going to save the environment and defeat future pandemics then we re going to have to do it together he said so be alive to one another s struggles hours earlier mr obama addressed more than 27 000 students at 78 participating historically black colleges and universities that two hour event show me your walk h b c u edition was streamed on the social media

the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country the disparities are not just in public health but also just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn t submit to their questioning he said it was a reference to the killing of ahmaud arbery a 25 year old black man who was chased by a white father and son and fatally shot in a coastal georgia community in february as communities across the country emerge from stay at home measures and people clash over how much freedom they should have mr obama suggested that americans needed to be considerate of others he encouraged the graduates to work with other marginalized groups in their efforts to create societal change it doesn t matter how much money you make if everyone around you is hungry and sick he said later adding that our society and democracy only works when we think not just about ourselves but about each other ariel turnley 21 watched her own spelman college virtual graduation with her mother and aunt in the living room of her lauderhill fla home then tuned into mr obama s

but i felt like he offered the words i wanted to hold on to during this crisis mr obama s speech came at a time when new social distancing norms have dashed many graduation traditions from the ritual of walking across the stage to tossing of the graduation cap to family and friends celebrations so popular political leaders and celebrities have stepped in to offer assuring messages as graduates

by youtube while he was president mr obama delivered the commencement addresses at three historically black schools hampton university howard university and morehouse college the former president has had a complicated relationship with the h b c u community while overall funding for the institutions increased during his eight years in office some complained that he did not make them a priority and that cuts and changes made under his watch to pell grants and other loan programs made life difficult for some h b c u students he called h b c u graduates the inheritors of one of america s proudest traditions and they needed to act whether you realize it or not you ve got more road maps more role models and more resources than the civil rights generation did he said you ve got more tools
