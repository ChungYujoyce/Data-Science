st paul the cruz campaign is making a list as attendees packed a reception hall in minnesota on the first night of senator ted cruz s seven day 12 city tour they were greeted by an uncommon supporter a costumed santa claus posing with children and more than a few adults beside a fireplace but the campaign s aim was not exclusively festive to retrieve photos taken with the santa visitors were handed cards directing them to mr cruz s website where they were asked to provide their names email addresses and zip codes the santa s optically good anyway it s a christmas tour it makes total sense said jeff roe mr cruz s campaign manager but you still have to run a campaign when these are over you can t just come out and do rallies and have nothing left when you leave except for a bunch of uneaten cookies now we re going to have living data of people they ll have an experience they ll remember forever mr roe said the campaign known for its sophisticated data operation had been brainstorming ways to connect with supporters since an august swing through several southern states about 19 000 people attended 13 rallies during that trip he said but the campaign was disappointed not to collect more information from them past efforts to amass voter data through photography had been too complicated and time consuming mr roe said a jumble of business card accumulation and handwritten names so on saturday i had the idea let s have a santa mr roe said he instructed a staff member who bore a resemblance that if a proper santa could not be located he would be asked to don the suit the santa market is a little bumpy so we had a lot of vetting to go through to get santas mr roe said adding that he hoped to have a santa for every stop on the tour we got this santa today that santa was red bartholomew a 64 year old supporter with past performances at tea party events fund raisers and church functions mr bartholomew said the campaign had reached him through his work with constitutional minded people noting that he was a member of overpasses for america a group that flies flags and posts signs often sharply critical of barack obama along pedestrian overpasses in mr cruz he seems to have found a kindred spirit in an interview mr bartholomew summarized his worldview i have no fear described an alternative character he has portrayed some people call me liberty claus and lamented the burdensome santa industry regulations that had in the past hamstrung his work you ever heard of santa claus university yes there s a santa claus university mr bartholomew said after seeing regulations i went oh for crying out loud it s just santa claus he added admiringly that part of what ted is about is we ve gotten tied up in regulations he also suggested that his history as a protester had earned him some enemies i ve been dealing with the police for years he said they know who i am and they don t scare me mr bartholomew seemed to betray little of his biography to the well wishers on his knee and supporters of mr cruz appeared broadly grateful to see him though many of them snapped photos on their phones and left before anyone could assign them a photo number and hand them a card that read merry christmas get your photo at tedcruz org christmastphotos mary kay storhaug 45 from andover minn said mr bartholomew had provided a welcome distraction for her children during the rally santa s there there s free candy canes for the kids to keep them from yelling she said ms storhaug was mildly surprised to find a santa claus at a political event she said but added it s a rally not a funeral mr roe said the photos were part of building a lasting relationship with voters particularly in states like minnesota that often receive little attention from candidates until just before voting begins when they do engage with a presidential campaign i want it to be a meaningful engagement that lasts for hopefully their whole life and our whole life mr roe said still at least one attendee seemed wary of letting his information reach the wrong hands mr bartholomew asked to provide a phone number where he could be reached said he would not answer his landline unless a caller left a message i have to screen my calls he said for a lot of different reasons find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today and get politics news updates via facebook twitter and the first draft newsletter first draft provides fast paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by the new york times come back throughout the day for the latest news and analysis and be part of the political conversation like it hate it have a tip for us send any and all feedback to firstdraft nytimes com we send out a newsletter around 7 a m eastern time each weekday that serves as a look ahead to the day aposs political events and expected stories
