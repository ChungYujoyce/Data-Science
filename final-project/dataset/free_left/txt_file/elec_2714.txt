can t toy with me like they toy with everybody else so let them have their debate and let s see how they do with their ratings soundbite english donald trump republican presidential candidate saying this is not a reporter this is just a lightweight megyn kelly shouldn t be in the debate i don t care about megyn when megyn kelly didn t ask me a question she made a statement last time i thought it was inappropriate by maggie haberman and nick corasaniti marshalltown iowa donald j trump and fox news the candidate who has reordered the republican presidential race and the cable network of choice for many of the party s voters stared each other down on tuesday over his demand that the news anchor megyn kelly be dumped from moderating thursday s debate the last before monday s caucuses the network did not blink so mr trump walked mr trump s announcement here that he would probably or would most likely or was pretty close to irrevocably planning to skip the debate an aide put it more directly created a gaping uncertainty at the center of the republican nominating contest just as it was formally about to begin in iowa it was the most intense confrontation yet between two mutually dependent but increasingly antagonistic powerhouses of media and politics mr trump who has made the presidential race into a riveting television spectacle was overtly exploiting the ratings leverage his candidacy has created to try to bend fox news to his will let s see how much money fox is going to make on the debate without me he said at a news conference here fox news said mr trump s refusal to debate his rivals was near unprecedented this is rooted in one thing megyn kelly whom he has viciously attacked since august and has now spent four days demanding be removed from the debate stage the network said in a statement on her program tuesday night ms kelly observed that what s interesting here is trump is not used to not controlling things as the chief executive of a large organization but the truth is he doesn t get to control the media she added mr trump s animus toward ms kelly dates to august in the first presidential primary debate when she questioned him about his past comments denigrating women afterward he suggested that ms kelly had been angry at him so much so that she had blood pouring out of her wherever a remark many saw as a reference to menstruation according to the associated press donald j trump and hillary clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party s nomination for president in the months since mr trump has repeatedly criticized ms kelly as a third rate reporter and as thursday s debate approached mr trump began disparaging ms kelly as if he were a prizefighter promoting a rematch he called her dishonest accused her of bias and a conflict of interest and said flat out that he did not like her on monday fox news responded to mr trump tauntingly saying it was surprised he s willing to show that much fear about being questioned by ms kelly and on tuesday after the network s president roger ailes declared that ms kelly would absolutely be on the debate stage the network issued yet another taunting statement this one mocking two of mr trump s go to rhetorical crutches we learned from a secret back channel the statement said that the ayatollah and putin both intend to treat donald trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president a nefarious source tells us that trump has his own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings at that mr trump told mr ailes and his network effectively to take a flying leap with me they re dealing with somebody that s a little bit different he said of fox they can t toy with me like they toy with everybody else so let them have their debate and let s see how they do with the ratings mr trump made his remarks right after bret baier one of the network s three moderators announced the lineup for the debate on the program special report one of mr trump s rivals senator rand paul of kentucky will rejoin the top tier of candidates on the stage for thursday s event the network said meaning eight candidates qualified to share the stage for the prime time debate mr trump was to remain at center stage by virtue of his lead in the polls his absence from the debate stage could strip the event of much of its appeal for many viewers who have followed the presidential contest as much as a source of entertainment as for its political importance obviously we would love all of the candidates to participate said sean spicer a spokesman for the republican national committee but each campaign ultimately makes their own decision what s in their best interest the tepid response was the latest instance in which the party has tried not to antagonize mr trump even as he engages in behavior that many republican donors and operatives and some committee members consider destructive major presidential candidates have skipped primary debates in the past most notably in 1980 when ronald reagan opted not to debate george bush before the iowa caucuses rankling some in iowa mr reagan eventually lost the caucuses and george w bush passed on the first few debates in 2000 but rebounded to win the nomination after a lopsided defeat in new hampshire it was not the first time that mr trump who holds a wide lead in national polls and a slender one in iowa has threatened to sit out a debate at one point he demanded that cnn donate 5 million to aid wounded veterans in return for his participation his logic then was the same as now the ratings stem from his presence but cnn officials declined essentially calling mr trump s bluff and he participated this time though his campaign manager corey lewandowski said there would be no backing down instead of attending the debate he said mr trump would hold a fund raiser in iowa for wounded war veterans mr lewandowski did not respond to a message asking the chances that his boss would change his mind in his news conference held in a high school weight room before a rally in marshalltown mr trump left open the possibility that he might still attend and allowed that it could fairly be called a flip flop by critics still the controversy ate away yet another news cycle in a dwindling number of them before the iowa caucuses in which mr trump is in a close contest with senator ted cruz of texas mr cruz appearing on the radio show of the conservative host mark levin said mr trump s withdrawal from the debate reflects a lack of respect for the men and women of iowa and challenged mr trump to a one on one debate on mr levin s show he can name his own moderator mr cruz said other rivals pounced too on twitter jeb bush highlighted a response by the conservative writer erick erickson so donald trump can t handle tough questions from megyn kelly but he ll be able to handle hillary clinton hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha exactly mr bush added tersely in his own twitter message advertisement
