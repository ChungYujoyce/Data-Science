advertisement supported by an examination reveals the president was warned about the potential for a pandemic but that internal divisions lack of planning and his faith in his own instincts led to a halting response by eric lipton david e sanger maggie haberman michael d shear mark mazzetti and julian e barnes to hear more audio stories from publishers like the new york times download audm for iphone or android washington any way you cut it this is going to be bad a senior medical adviser at the department of veterans affairs dr carter mecher wrote on the night of jan 28 in an email to a group of public health experts scattered around the government and universities the projected size of the outbreak already seems hard to believe a week after the first coronavirus case had been identified in the united states and six long weeks before president trump finally took aggressive action to confront the danger the nation was facing a pandemic that is now forecast to take tens of thousands of american lives dr mecher was urging the upper ranks of the nation s public health bureaucracy to wake up and prepare for the possibility of far more drastic action you guys made fun of me screaming to close the schools he wrote to the group which called itself red dawn an inside joke based on the 1984 movie about a band of americans trying to save the country after a foreign invasion now i m screaming close the colleges and universities his was hardly a lone voice throughout january as mr trump repeatedly played down the seriousness of the virus and focused on other issues an array of figures inside his government from top white house advisers to experts deep in the cabinet departments and intelligence agencies identified the threat sounded alarms and made clear the need for aggressive action the president though was slow to absorb the scale of the risk and to act accordingly focusing instead on controlling the message protecting gains in the economy and batting away warnings from senior officials it was a problem he said that had come out of nowhere and could not have been foreseen even after mr trump took his first concrete action at the end of january limiting travel from china public health often had to compete with economic and political considerations in internal debates slowing the path toward belated decisions to seek more money from congress obtain necessary supplies address shortfalls in testing and ultimately move to keep much of the nation at home unfolding as it did in the wake of his impeachment by the house and in the midst of his senate trial mr trump s response was colored by his suspicion of and disdain for what he viewed as the deep state the very people in his government whose expertise and long experience might have guided him more quickly toward steps that would slow the virus and likely save lives decision making was also complicated by a long running dispute inside the administration over how to deal with china the virus at first took a back seat to a desire not to upset beijing during trade talks but later the impulse to score points against beijing left the world s two leading powers further divided as they confronted one of the first truly global threats of the 21st century the shortcomings of mr trump s performance have played out with remarkable transparency as part of his daily effort to dominate television screens and the national conversation but dozens of interviews with current and former officials and a review of emails and other records revealed many previously unreported details and a fuller picture of the roots and extent of his halting response as the deadly virus spread the national security council office responsible for tracking pandemics received intelligence reports in early january predicting the spread of the virus to the united states and within weeks was raising options like keeping americans home from work and shutting down cities the size of chicago mr trump would avoid such steps until march despite mr trump s denial weeks later he was told at the time about a jan 29 memo produced by his trade adviser peter navarro laying out in striking detail the potential risks of a coronavirus pandemic as many as half a million deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses the health and human services secretary alex m azar ii directly warned mr trump of the possibility of a pandemic during a call on jan 30 the second warning he delivered to the president about the virus in two weeks the president who was on air force one while traveling for appearances in the midwest responded that mr azar was being alarmist mr azar publicly announced in february that the government was establishing a surveillance system in five american cities to measure the spread of the virus and enable experts to project the next hot spots it was delayed for weeks the slow start of that plan on top of the well documented failures to develop the nation s testing capacity left administration officials with almost no insight into how rapidly the virus was spreading we were flying the plane with no instruments one official said by the third week in february the administration s top public health experts concluded they should recommend to mr trump a new approach that would include warning the american people of the risks and urging steps like social distancing and staying home from work but the white house focused instead on messaging and crucial additional weeks went by before their views were reluctantly accepted by the president time when the virus spread largely unimpeded when mr trump finally agreed in mid march to recommend social distancing across the country effectively bringing much of the economy to a halt he seemed shellshocked and deflated to some of his closest associates one described him as subdued and baffled by how the crisis had played out an economy that he had wagered his re election on was suddenly in shambles he only regained his swagger the associate said from conducting his daily white house briefings at which he often seeks to rewrite the history of the past several months he declared at one point that he felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic and insisted at another that he had to be a cheerleader for the country as if that explained why he failed to prepare the public for what was coming mr trump s allies and some administration officials say the criticism has been unfair the chinese government misled other governments they say and they insist that the president was either not getting proper information or the people around him weren t conveying the urgency of the threat in some cases they argue the specific officials he was hearing from had been discredited in his eyes but once the right information got to him through other channels he made the right calls while the media and democrats refused to seriously acknowledge this virus in january and february president trump took bold action to protect americans and unleash the full power of the federal government to curb the spread of the virus expand testing capacities and expedite vaccine development even when we had no true idea the level of transmission or asymptomatic spread said judd deere a white house spokesman there were key turning points along the way opportunities for mr trump to get ahead of the virus rather than just chase it there were internal debates that presented him with stark choices and moments when he could have chosen to ask deeper questions and learn more how he handled them may shape his re election campaign they will certainly shape his legacy by the last week of february it was clear to the administration s public health team that schools and businesses in hot spots would have to close but in the turbulence of the trump white house it took three more weeks to persuade the president that failure to act quickly to control the spread of the virus would have dire consequences when dr robert kadlec the top disaster response official at the health and human services department convened the white house coronavirus task force on feb 21 his agenda was urgent there were deep cracks in the administration s strategy for keeping the virus out of the united states they were going to have to lock down the country to prevent it from spreading the question was when there had already been an alarming spike in new cases around the world and the virus was spreading across the middle east it was becoming apparent that the administration had botched the rollout of testing to track the virus at home and a smaller scale surveillance program intended to piggyback on a federal flu tracking system had also been stillborn in washington the president was not worried predicting that by april when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away his white house had yet to ask congress for additional funding to prepare for the potential cost of wide scale infection across the country and health care providers were growing increasingly nervous about the availability of masks ventilators and other equipment what mr trump decided to do next could dramatically shape the course of the pandemic and how many people would get sick and die with that in mind the task force had gathered for a tabletop exercise a real time version of a full scale war gaming of a flu pandemic the administration had run the previous year that earlier exercise also conducted by mr kadlec and called crimson contagion predicted 110 million infections 7 7 million hospitalizations and 586 000 deaths following a hypothetical outbreak that started in china facing the likelihood of a real pandemic the group needed to decide when to abandon containment the effort to keep the virus outside the u s and to isolate anyone who gets infected and embrace mitigation to thwart the spread of the virus inside the country until a vaccine becomes available among the questions on the agenda which was reviewed by the new york times was when the department s secretary mr azar should recommend that mr trump take textbook mitigation measures such as school dismissals and cancellations of mass gatherings which had been identified as the next appropriate step in a bush era pandemic plan the exercise was sobering the group including dr anthony s fauci of the national institutes of health dr robert r redfield of the centers for disease control and prevention and mr azar who at that stage was leading the white house task force concluded they would soon need to move toward aggressive social distancing even at the risk of severe disruption to the nation s economy and the daily lives of millions of americans if dr kadlec had any doubts they were erased two days later when he stumbled upon an email from a researcher at the georgia instituteoftechnology who was among the group of academics government physicians and infectious diseases doctors who had spent weeks tracking the outbreak in the red dawn email chain a 20 year old chinese woman had infected five relatives with the virus even though she never displayed any symptoms herself the implication was grave apparently healthy people could be unknowingly spreading the virus and supported the need to move quickly to mitigation is this true dr kadlec wrote back to the researcher if so we have a huge whole on our screening and quarantine effort including a typo where he meant hole her response was blunt people are carrying the virus everywhere the following day dr kadlec and the others decided to present mr trump with a plan titled four steps to mitigation telling the president that they needed to begin preparing americans for a step rarely taken in united states history but over the next several days a presidential blowup and internal turf fights would sidetrack such a move the focus would shift to messaging and confident predictions of success rather than publicly calling for a shift to mitigation these final days of february perhaps more than any other moment during his tenure in the white house illustrated mr trump s inability or unwillingness to absorb warnings coming at him he instead reverted to his traditional political playbook in the midst of a public health calamity squandering vital time as the coronavirus spread silently across the country dr kadlec s group wanted to meet with the president right away but mr trump was on a trip to india so they agreed to make the case to him in person as soon as he returned two days later if they could convince him of the need to shift strategy they could immediately begin a national education campaign aimed at preparing the public for the new reality a memo dated feb 14 prepared in coordination with the national security council and titled u s government response to the 2019 novel coronavirus documented what more drastic measures would look like including significantly limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all sporting events performances and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone consider school closures widespread stay at home directives from public and private organizations with nearly 100 telework for some the memo did not advocate an immediate national shutdown but said the targeted use of quarantine and isolation measures could be used to slow the spread in places where sustained human to human transmission is evident within 24 hours before they got a chance to make their presentation to the president the plan went awry mr trump was walking up the steps of air force one to head home from india on feb 25 when dr nancy messonnier the director of the national center for immunization and respiratory diseases publicly issued the blunt warning they had all agreed was necessary but dr messonnier had jumped the gun they had not told the president yet much less gotten his consent on the 18 hour plane ride home mr trump fumed as he watched the stock market crash after dr messonnier s comments furious he called mr azar when he landed at around 6 a m on feb 26 raging that dr messonnier had scared people unnecessarily already on thin ice with the president over a variety of issues and having overseen the failure to quickly produce an effective and widely available test mr azar would soon find his authority reduced the meeting that evening with mr trump to advocate social distancing was canceled replaced by a news conference in which the president announced that the white house response would be put under the command of vice president mike pence the push to convince mr trump of the need for more assertive action stalled with mr pence and his staff in charge the focus was clear no more alarmist messages statements and media appearances by health officials like dr fauci and dr redfield would be coordinated through mr pence s office it would be more than three weeks before mr trump would announce serious social distancing efforts a lost period during which the spread of the virus accelerated rapidly over nearly three weeks from feb 26 to march 16 the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the united states grew from 15 to 4 226 since then nearly half a million americans have tested positive for the virus and authorities say hundreds of thousands more are likely infected the earliest warnings about coronavirus got caught in the crosscurrents of the administration s internal disputes over china it was the china hawks who pushed earliest for a travel ban but their animosity toward china also undercut hopes for a more cooperative approach by the world s two leading powers to a global crisis it was early january and the call with a hong kong epidemiologist left matthew pottinger rattled mr pottinger the deputy national security adviser and a hawk on china took a blunt warning away from the call with the doctor a longtime friend a ferocious new outbreak that on the surface appeared similar to the sars epidemic of 2003 had emerged in china it had spread far more quickly than the government was admitting to and it wouldn t be long before it reached other parts of the world mr pottinger had worked as a wall street journal correspondent in hong kong during the sars epidemic and was still scarred by his experience documenting the death spread by that highly contagious virus now seventeen years later his friend had a blunt message you need to be ready the virus he warned which originated in the city of wuhan was being transmitted by people who were showing no symptoms an insight that american health officials had not yet accepted mr pottinger declined through a spokesman to comment it was one of the earliest warnings to the white house and it echoed the intelligence reports making their way to the national security council while most of the early assessments from the c i a had little more information than was available publicly some of the more specialized corners of the intelligence world were producing sophisticated and chilling warnings in a report to the director of national intelligence the state department s epidemiologist wrote in early january that the virus was likely to spread across the globe and warned that the coronavirus could develop into a pandemic working independently a small outpost of the defense intelligence agency the national center for medical intelligence came to the same conclusion within weeks after getting initial information about the virus early in the year biodefense experts inside the national security council looking at what was happening in wuhan started urging officials to think about what would be needed to quarantine a city the size of chicago by mid january there was growing evidence of the virus spreading outside china mr pottinger began convening daily meetings about the coronavirus he alerted his boss robert c o brien the national security adviser the early alarms sounded by mr pottinger and other china hawks were freighted with ideology including a push to publicly blame china that critics in the administration say was a distraction as the coronavirus spread to western europe and eventually the united states and they ran into opposition from mr trump s economic advisers who worried a tough approach toward china could scuttle a trade deal that was a pillar of mr trump s re election campaign with his skeptical some might even say conspiratorial view of china s ruling communist party mr pottinger initially suspected that president xi jinping s government was keeping a dark secret that the virus may have originated in one of the laboratories in wuhan studying deadly pathogens in his view it might have even been a deadly accident unleashed on an unsuspecting chinese population during meetings and telephone calls mr pottinger asked intelligence agencies including officers at the c i a working on asia and on weapons of mass destruction to search for evidence that might bolster his theory they didn t have any evidence intelligence agencies did not detect any alarm inside the chinese government that analysts presumed would accompany the accidental leak of a deadly virus from a government laboratory but mr pottinger continued to believe the coronavirus problem was far worse than the chinese were acknowledging inside the west wing the director of the domestic policy council joe grogan also tried to sound alarms that the threat from china was growing mr pottinger backed by mr o brien became one of the driving forces of a campaign in the final weeks of january to convince mr trump to impose limits on travel from china the first substantive step taken to impede the spread of the virus and one that the president has repeatedly cited as evidence that he was on top of the problem in addition to the opposition from the economic team mr pottinger and his allies among the china hawks had to overcome initial skepticism from the administration s public health experts travel restrictions were usually counterproductive to managing biological outbreaks because they prevented doctors and other much needed medical help from easily getting to the affected areas the health officials said and such bans often cause infected people to flee spreading the disease further but on the morning of jan 30 mr azar got a call from dr fauci dr redfield and others saying they had changed their minds the world health organization had declared a global public health emergency and american officials had discovered the first confirmed case of person to person transmission inside the united states the economic team led by treasury secretary steven mnuchin continued to argue that there were big risks in taking a provocative step toward china and moving to curb global travel after a debate mr trump came down on the side of the hawks and the public health team the limits on travel from china were publicly announced on jan 31 still mr trump and other senior officials were wary of further upsetting beijing besides the concerns about the impact on the trade deal they knew that an escalating confrontation was risky because the united states relies heavily on china for pharmaceuticals and the kinds of protective equipment most needed to combat the coronavirus but the hawks kept pushing in february to take a critical stance toward china amid the growing crisis mr pottinger and others including aides to secretary of state mike pompeo pressed for government statements to use the term wuhan virus mr pompeo tried to hammer the anti china message at every turn eventually even urging leaders of the group of 7 industrialized countries to use wuhan virus in a joint statement others including aides to mr pence resisted taking a hard public line believing that angering beijing might lead the chinese government to withhold medical supplies pharmaceuticals and any scientific research that might ultimately lead to a vaccine mr trump took a conciliatory approach through the middle of march praising the job mr xi was doing that changed abruptly when aides informed mr trump that a chinese foreign ministry spokesman had publicly spun a new conspiracy about the origins of covid 19 that it was brought to china by u s army personnel who visited the country last october mr trump was furious and he took to his favorite platform to broadcast a new message on march 16 he wrote on twitter that the united states will be powerfully supporting those industries like airlines and others that are particularly affected by the chinese virus mr trump s decision to escalate the war of words undercut any remaining possibility of broad cooperation between the governments to address a global threat it remains to be seen whether that mutual suspicion will spill over into efforts to develop treatments or vaccines both areas where the two nations are now competing one immediate result was a free for all across the united states with state and local governments and hospitals bidding on the open market for scarce but essential chinese made products when the state of massachusetts managed to procure 1 2 million masks it fell to the owner of the new england patriots robert k kraft a trump ally to cut through extensive red tape on both sides of the pacific to send his own plane to pick them up the chaotic culture of the trump white house contributed to the crisis a lack of planning and a failure to execute combined with the president s focus on the news cycle and his preference for following his gut rather than the data cost time and perhaps lives inside the west wing mr navarro mr trump s trade adviser was widely seen as quick tempered self important and prone to butting in he is among the most outspoken of china hawks and in late january was clashing with the administration s health experts over limiting travel from china so it elicited eye rolls when after initially being prevented from joining the coronavirus task force he circulated a memo on jan 29 urging mr trump to impose the travel limits arguing that failing to confront the outbreak aggressively could be catastrophic leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses the uninvited message could not have conflicted more with the president s approach at the time of playing down the severity of the threat and when aides raised it with mr trump he responded that he was unhappy that mr navarro had put his warning in writing from the time the virus was first identified as a concern the administration s response was plagued by the rivalries and factionalism that routinely swirl around mr trump and along with the president s impulsiveness undercut decision making and policy development faced with the relentless march of a deadly pathogen the disagreements and a lack of long term planning had significant consequences they slowed the president s response and resulted in problems with execution and planning including delays in seeking money from capitol hill and a failure to begin broad surveillance testing the efforts to shape mr trump s view of the virus began early in january when his focus was elsewhere the fallout from his decision to kill maj gen qassim suleimani iran s security mastermind his push for an initial trade deal with china and his senate impeachment trial which was about to begin even after mr azar first briefed him about the potential seriousness of the virus during a phone call on jan 18 while the president was at his mar a lago resort in florida mr trump projected confidence that it would be a passing problem we have it totally under control he told an interviewer a few days later while attending the world economic forum in switzerland it s going to be just fine back in washington voices outside of the white house peppered mr trump with competing assessments about what he should do and how quickly he should act the efforts to sort out policy behind closed doors were contentious and sometimes only loosely organized that was the case when the national security council convened a meeting on short notice on the afternoon of jan 27 the situation room was standing room only packed with top white house advisers low level staffers mr trump s social media guru and several cabinet secretaries there was no checklist about the preparations for a possible pandemic which would require intensive testing rapid acquisition of protective gear and perhaps serious limitations on americans movements instead after a 20 minute description by mr azar of his department s capabilities the meeting was jolted when stephen e biegun the newly installed deputy secretary of state announced plans to issue a level four travel warning strongly discouraging americans from traveling to china the room erupted into bickering a few days later on the evening of jan 30 mick mulvaney the acting white house chief of staff at the time and mr azar called air force one as the president was making the final decision to go ahead with the restrictions on china travel mr azar was blunt warning that the virus could develop into a pandemic and arguing that china should be criticized for failing to be transparent mr trump rejected the idea of criticizing china saying the country had enough to deal with and if the president s decision on the travel restrictions suggested that he fully grasped the seriousness of the situation his response to mr azar indicated otherwise stop panicking mr trump told him that sentiment was present throughout february as the president s top aides reached for a consistent message but took few concrete steps to prepare for the possibility of a major public health crisis during a briefing on capitol hill on feb 5 senators urged administration officials to take the threat more seriously several asked if the administration needed additional money to help local and state health departments prepare derek kan a senior official from the office of management and budget replied that the administration had all the money it needed at least at that point to stop the virus two senators who attended the briefing said just left the administration briefing on coronavirus senator christopher s murphy democrat of connecticut wrote in a tweet shortly after bottom line they aren t taking this seriously enough the administration also struggled to carry out plans it did agree on in mid february with the effort to roll out widespread testing stalled mr azar announced a plan to repurpose a flu surveillance system in five major cities to help track the virus among the general population the effort all but collapsed even before it got started as mr azar struggled to win approval for 100 million in funding and the c d c failed to make reliable tests available the number of infections in the united states started to surge through february and early march but the trump administration did not move to place large scale orders for masks and other protective equipment or critical hospital equipment such as ventilators the pentagon sat on standby awaiting any orders to help provide temporary hospitals or other assistance as february gave way to march the president continued to be surrounded by divided factions even as it became clearer that avoiding more aggressive steps was not tenable mr trump had agreed to give an oval office address on the evening of march 11 announcing restrictions on travel from europe where the virus was ravaging italy but responding to the views of his business friends and others he continued to resist calls for social distancing school closures and other steps that would imperil the economy but the virus was already multiplying across the country and hospitals were at risk of buckling under the looming wave of severely ill people lacking masks and other protective equipment ventilators and sufficient intensive care beds the question loomed over the president and his aides after weeks of stalling and inaction what were they going to do the approach that mr azar and others had planned to bring to him weeks earlier moved to the top of the agenda even then and even by trump white house standards the debate over whether to shut down much of the country to slow the spread was especially fierce always attuned to anything that could trigger a stock market decline or an economic slowdown that could hamper his re election effort mr trump also reached out to prominent investors like stephen a schwarzman the chief executive of blackstone group a private equity firm everybody questioned it for a while not everybody but a good portion questioned it mr trump said earlier this month they said let s keep it open let s ride it in a tense oval office meeting when mr mnuchin again stressed that the economy would be ravaged mr o brien the national security adviser who had been worried about the virus for weeks sounded exasperated as he told mr mnuchin that the economy would be destroyed regardless if officials did nothing soon after the oval office address dr scott gottlieb the former commissioner of the food and drug administration and a trusted sounding board inside the white house visited mr trump partly at the urging of jared kushner the president s son in law dr gottlieb s role was to impress upon the president how serious the crisis could become mr pence by then in charge of the task force also played a key role at that point in getting through to the president about the seriousness of the moment in a way that mr azar had not but in the end aides said it was dr deborah l birx the veteran aids researcher who had joined the task force who helped to persuade mr trump soft spoken and fond of the kind of charts and graphs mr trump prefers dr birx did not have the rough edges that could irritate the president he often told people he thought she was elegant on monday march 16 mr trump announced new social distancing guidelines saying they would be in place for two weeks the subsequent economic disruptions were so severe that the president repeatedly suggested that he wanted to lift even those temporary restrictions he frequently asked aides why his administration was still being blamed in news coverage for the widespread failures involving testing insisting the responsibility had shifted to the states during the last week in march kellyanne conway a senior white house adviser involved in task force meetings gave voice to concerns other aides had she warned mr trump that his wished for date of easter to reopen the country likely couldn t be accomplished among other things she told him he would end up being blamed by critics for every subsequent death caused by the virus within days he watched images on television of a calamitous situation at elmhurst hospital center miles from his childhood home in queens n y where 13 people had died from the coronavirus in 24 hours he left the restrictions in place mark walker contributed reporting from washington and mike baker from seattle kitty bennett contributed research advertisement
