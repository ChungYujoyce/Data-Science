the officials who investigated and convicted kevin mallory for conspiracy to commit espionage tell 60 minutes how their case came together kevin mallory was a down on his luck former clandestine case officer for the cia when he was approached by a man the department of justice believes was a chinese spy officials say mallory was a prime target for recruitment he was out of work three months behind on his mortgage and thousands of dollars in debt but as we first reported in december and as the chinese would discover kevin mallory wasn t exactly james bond the department of justice agreed to show us how they caught mr mallory and why they believe his recruitment by china is part of a massive clandestine campaign to steal not just national security secrets from the u s government but industrial and technological secrets from american companies this is what espionage looks like the man standing on the right in the yellow shirt is kevin mallory who once held a top secret security clearance while working for the cia and the defense intelligence agency footage from a surveillance camera at a virginia fedex store in april 2017 caught him as he prepared to hand a clerk stacks of classified documents to be scanned onto an sd card the kind that can be inserted into a mobile phone ryan gaynor so this is the rare moment right in an investigation in an espionage case where we actually have video footage of the individual preparing the classified material for transmission to the foreign intelligence service we watched the tape with ryan gaynor the fbi supervisory special agent who investigated mallory and jennifer gellie who prosecuted the case against him for the national security division of the department of justice they say kevin mallory sent national security secrets to a chinese spy on a covert communication device jennifer gellie so here you see him talking with the store clerk about the scanning job and throughout this video you see little pops of yellow little yellow pieces of paper that flash by when he s showing the documents that was important for us because the document that he successfully passed consisted of a typed up white piece of paper that was the classified information followed by two yellow sheets of paper with his handwriting on them and here you can see anderson cooper so that s the those are the yellow sheets of paper jennifer gellie you can see the yellow sheets of paper going through that scanning process prosecutors say some of the information mallory sent could have revealed the identity of a couple who had secretly spied on china for the u s it was a very personal betrayal mallory had supervised the couple years before anderson cooper he was betraying people this is people s lives at stake jennifer gellie correct these were documents that specifically talked about human beings whose lives could be in danger anderson cooper if they had traveled to china they could have been arrested john demers at the time he gave the information to the chinese intelligence officer he knew they were planning on traveling to china john demers is the top official in charge of the department of justice s national security division which helps guard the u s against terrorism cyberattacks and espionage he s responsible for coordinating activities across law enforcement and u s intelligence agencies he says kevin mallory s recruitment is just one of many efforts by the chinese ministry of state security or mss to spy on the united states anderson cooper what is mss john demers so mss is the principal intelligence agency of the chinese government and in rough terms it is like the cia and the fbi put together their capabilities are world class they have cyber capabilities they have expertise in turning people into cooperators and they have all of the tools and expertise of a very capable intelligence organization john demers says kevin mallory hadn t worked for any u s intelligence agency in five years but he was still of interest to china he spoke mandarin was desperate for money and had classified information he might be willing to sell john demers you re looking for people who will be willing to work with you for one reason or another you start very slowly you start to see what information they are willing to share with you originally innocuous information then something maybe slightly more sensitive and so forth and that relationship develops over time it s a patient process anderson cooper it s a grooming of an intelligence asset john demers it s a grooming and it s a constant testing to see what the person is willing to do the chinese didn t reach out to kevin mallory in a dark alley like in a movie they made contact with him like any job recruiter would they sent him a message on the career networking site linkedin anderson cooper what could the chinese tell from reading his linkedin page ryan gaynor when you look at this linkedin page it s very clear immediately that he worked in national security that he had the type of background that the chinese intelligence services are most interested in anderson cooper he s good at national security military international relations counterterrorism security clearance dispute resolution this is a signpost to i was a former intelligence official ryan gaynor and it led to what you would expect mallory ended up in contact with this man who called himself michael yang and claimed to be an employee at a chinese think tank anderson cooper so he s a chinese intelligence officer ryan gaynor we believe him to be a chinese intelligence officer and more importantly mr mallory when meeting with him believed him to be an intelligence officer over the next several weeks michael yang paid mallory 25 000 to come to shanghai twice and mallory reached out to former colleagues at the cia asking to be put in touch with people who had current intelligence on china prosecutors say his former colleagues grew suspicious and reported him to cia security putting him on the radar of law enforcement when mallory returned from his second trip to china he was stopped by customs at chicago s o hare airport he had lied on this form about how much money he was carrying more than 16 000 in cash and agents discovered this box with a phone in it mallory claimed it was a gift for his wife but it was actually a covert communication device that had been given to him by chinese intelligence anderson cooper this looks just like a regular phone what makes it a covert communication device ryan gaynor so it s not so much the hardware the phone itself had a unique piece of software installed on it designed to allow secure communication both in text and also the secure transmission of documents later you might think a former cia officer would be cautious about the texts he sends to a chinese spy but kevin mallory was remarkably direct complaining about the money he was paid and the risk he was taking your object is to gain information he told michael yang and my object is to be paid for i will destroy all electronic records after you confirm receipt mallory wrote to yang i already destroyed the paper records i cannot keep these around too dangerous at this point all the risk is on me jennifer gellie so he says i m taking all the risk but then he goes on a few bubbles later to actually try to transmit additional information to the chinese but technology wasn t mallory s strong suit he complained to michael yang that the phone wasn t working properly this system sucks it s too cumbersome he wrote i put all these messages and then and you can t read them because you are not logged in the same time that s a poor system at this point prosecutors say mallory was scared he d been stopped at customs and he feared the cia and fbi were onto him prosecutors say he decided to come up with a cover story and reached out to the cia telling them he thought he was being recruited by chinese spies the cia called him in for an interview mallory in cia interview clip my judgement is and we haven t gone through this conversation that these guys work for chinese intelligence so my sense is that they were looking for government secrets u s government secrets at some level in this meeting mallory admitted the phone was a covert communication device given to him by the chinese but prosecutors say he lied about the classified documents he d already sent interviewer in cia interview clip did you send them anything on that phone mallory in cia interview clip i sent them some tests of some sort just to see if i could do it right and i couldn t figure it out i messed that up ryan gaynor he s trying to control the narrative so what you have here likely is an attempt to steer the story to explain away some of the more alerting pieces while not admitting to the criminal activity of providing the classified information to the foreign intelligence service jennifer gellie we now know at this point in time kevin mallory has successfully sent the classified table of contents the classified white paper and tried to send several other documents unsuccessfully mallory offered to bring in the phone to be examined by the cia confident that all his messages to michael yang had automatically been deleted anderson cooper so he believes everything he s sent has disappeared from the device so that s why he s willing to bring the device in ryan gaynor we have every reason to believe that he believed at the time that those communications would be gone two weeks later mallory arrived at a hotel room in ashburn virginia for a second meeting with the cia when he got there the fbi was waiting for him along with a computer forensic examiner he agreed to show them how the phone worked ryan gaynor when he goes to demonstrate it up on the screen where he expects to have his whole chat history basically deleted up on the screen comes some of the chat history the fbi recorded the meeting fbi audio clip mallory i m i m surprised it kept this much fbi so you made a comment that you were surprised that there was this much there mallory right cause you cause this right cause uh in the past uh maybe it was the s screen size or something cause some of it just disappeared one of the most incriminating messages that appeared on the phone was mallory planning another trip to china i can also come in the middle of june he wrote i can bring the remainder of the documents i have at that time ryan gaynor from the fbi perspective this is a pivotal moment in the investigation four weeks later the fbi arrested kevin mallory and searched his home hidden in the back of this closet in a junk drawer agents discovered an sd card wrapped in tinfoil on which he had placed eight secret and top secret documents the same ones he scanned at that fedex store in april ryan gaynor it is our belief that it was his intention to take this sd card to china to provide to them anderson cooper does the mallory case fit a pattern that you re seeing coming from chinese intelligence john demers yes we currently have three pending cases against former intelligence officers and they re alleged to have been spying on behalf of the chinese anderson cooper it s hard to overstate how unusual it is to have three cases like this ongoing john demers it s not unusual its unprecedented bill evanina to me it s disappointing and its really hurtful i think to everyone to know that we still have people who are willing to betray the u s for a few dollars bill evanina is director of the national counterintelligence and security center a division of the office of the director of national intelligence he serves as the u s government s top counterintelligence official anderson cooper when it comes to espionage against the united states does china pose the greatest threat or russia bill evanina when it comes to espionage china poses the greatest threat and it s not even close compared to russia or iran or any other country and if you include economic espionage industrial espionage it s not even in the same ballgame anderson cooper when most people think of espionage they think of somebody in a trench coat trying to steal a state secret what s happening now with china it s not just about state secrets it s about technological secrets that s the prize that china wants bill evanina that s correct it s trade secrets proprietary data intelligence emerging technology nanotechnology hybrid anything that they can see that is the future supercomputing encryption those are the issues that they look at and they have a prioritized schedule that they look at and they send people forward to go collect that data john demers of the justice department s national security division says since 2011 more than 90 percent of the economic espionage cases they have charged have involved china which has stolen secrets about everything from genetically modified rice seeds to wind turbine technology anderson cooper this is a persistent campaign you re seeing john demers yes very persistent very sophisticated very well resourced very patient and very broad in scope demers says chinese operatives have intensified their efforts on industries critical to chinese president xi jinping s made in china 2025 program a 10 year plan to jump ahead of the united states in aerospace automation artificial intelligence quantum computing and other cutting edge industries anderson cooper i think some people who see this are going to think well this is the something the u s must do as well john demers the u s intelligence community doesn t take trade secrets from foreign companies for the benefit of american companies anderson cooper that doesn t happen john demers this is not something that we do as for former cia officer kevin mallory he continues to deny sending any classified information to the chinese last june a jury in virginia found him guilty of conspiracy under the espionage act and lying to the fbi in may mallory was sentenced to 20 years in prison produced by katherine davis associate producer jennifer marz anderson cooper anchor of cnn s anderson cooper
