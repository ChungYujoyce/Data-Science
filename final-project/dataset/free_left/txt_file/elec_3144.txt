republican governors and donors in washington on feb 19 he warned that donald j trump s increasingly likely nomination would be catastrophic dooming the party in november but mr rove the master strategist of george w bush s campaigns insisted it was not too late for them to stop mr trump according to three people present at a meeting of republican governors the next morning paul r lepage of maine called for action seated at a long boardroom table at the willard hotel he erupted in frustration over the state of the 2016 race saying mr trump s nomination would deeply wound the republican party mr lepage urged the governors to draft an open letter to the people disavowing mr trump and his divisive brand of politics the suggestion was not taken up since then mr trump has only gotten stronger winning two more state contests and collecting the endorsement of gov chris christie of new jersey in public there were calls for the party to unite behind a single candidate in dozens of interviews elected officials political strategists and donors described a frantic last ditch campaign to block mr trump and the agonizing reasons that many of them have become convinced it will fail behind the scenes a desperate mission to save the party sputtered and stalled at every turn efforts to unite warring candidates behind one failed spectacularly an overture from senator marco rubio to mr christie angered and insulted the governor an unsubtle appeal from mitt romney to john kasich about the party s need to consolidate behind one rival to mr trump fell on deaf ears at least two campaigns have drafted plans to overtake mr trump in a brokered convention and the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky has laid out a plan that would have lawmakers break with mr trump explicitly in a general election despite all the forces arrayed against mr trump the interviews show the party has been gripped by a nearly incapacitating leadership vacuum and a paralytic sense of indecision and despair as he has won smashing victories in south carolina and nevada donors have dreaded the consequences of clashing with mr trump directly elected officials have balked at attacking him out of concern that they might unintentionally fuel his populist revolt and republicans have lacked someone from outside the presidential race who could help set the terms of debate from afar the endorsement by mr christie a not unblemished but still highly regarded figure within the party s elite he is a former chairman of the republican governors association landed friday with crippling force it was by far the most important defection to mr trump s insurgency mr christie may give cover to other republicans tempted to join mr trump rather than trying to beat him not just the stop trump forces seemed in peril but also the traditional party establishment itself should mr trump clinch the presidential nomination it would represent a rout of historic proportions for the institutional republican party and could set off an internal rift unseen in either party for a half century since white southerners abandoned the democratic party en masse during the civil rights movement former gov michael o leavitt of utah a top adviser to mr romney s 2012 presidential campaign said the party was unable to come up with a united front to quash mr trump s campaign there is no mechanism mr leavitt said there is no smoke filled room if there is i ve never seen it nor do i know anyone who has this is going to play out in the way that it will resistance runs deep republicans have ruefully acknowledged that they came to this dire pass in no small part because of their own passivity there were ample opportunities to battle mr trump earlier more than one plan was drawn up only to be rejected rivals who attacked him early like rick perry and bobby jindal the former governors of texas and louisiana received little backup and quickly faded late last fall the strategists alex castellanos and gail gitcho both presidential campaign veterans reached out to dozens of the party s leading donors including the casino magnate sheldon adelson and the hedge fund manager paul singer with a plan to create a super pac that would take down mr trump in a confidential memo the strategists laid out the mission of a group they called protectus we want voters to imagine donald trump in the big chair in the oval office with responsibilities for worldwide confrontation at his fingertips they wrote in the previously unreported memo mr castellanos even produced ads portraying mr trump as unfit for the presidency according to people who saw them and who along with many of those interviewed insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations the two strategists who declined to comment proposed to attack mr trump in new hampshire over his business failures and past liberal positions and emphasized the extreme urgency of their project a trump nomination would not only cause republicans to lose the presidency they wrote but we also lose the senate competitive gubernatorial elections and moderate house republicans no major donors committed to the project and it was abandoned no other sustained stop trump effort sprang up in its place resistance to mr trump still runs deep the party s biggest benefactors remain totally opposed to him at a recent presentation hosted by the billionaires charles g and david h koch the country s most prolific conservative donors their political advisers characterized mr trump s record as utterly unacceptable and highlighted his support for government funded business subsidies and government backed health care according to people who attended but the kochs like mr adelson have shown no appetite to intervene directly in the primary with decisive force the american future fund a conservative group that does not disclose its donors announced plans on friday to run ads blasting mr trump for his role in an educational company that is alleged to have defrauded students but there is only limited time for the commercials to sink in before some of the country s biggest states award their delegates in early march instead mr trump s challengers are staking their hopes on a set of guerrilla tactics and long shot possibilities racing to line up mainstream voters and interest groups against his increasingly formidable campaign donors and elected leaders have begun to rouse themselves for the fight but perhaps too late two of mr trump s opponents have openly acknowledged that they may have to wrest the republican nomination from him in a deadlocked convention transcript na speaking to political donors in manhattan on wednesday evening mr rubio s campaign manager terry sullivan noted that most delegates are bound to a candidate only on the first ballot many of them moreover are likely to be party regulars who may not support mr trump over multiple rounds of balloting he added according to a person present for mr sullivan s presentation which was first reported by cnn advisers to mr kasich the ohio governor have told potential supporters that his strategy boils down to a convention battle judd gregg a former new hampshire senator who had endorsed jeb bush said mr kasich s emissaries had sketched an outcome in which mr kasich probably ends up with the second highest delegate count going into the convention and digs in there to compete with mr trump several senior republicans including mr romney have made direct appeals to mr kasich to gauge his willingness to stand down and allow the party to unify behind another candidate but mr kasich has told at least one person that his plan is to win the ohio primary on march 15 and gather the party behind his campaign if mr rubio loses in florida his home state on the same day in washington mr kasich s persistence in the race has become a source of frustration at senate luncheons on wednesday and thursday republican lawmakers vented about mr kasich s intransigence calling it selfishness one senior republican senator noting that mr kasich has truly contested only one of the first four states complained he s just flailing his arms around and having a wonderful time going around the country and it just drives me up the wall mr mcconnell was especially vocal describing mr kasich s persistence as irrational because he has no plausible path to the nomination several senators said while still hopeful that mr rubio might prevail mr mcconnell has begun preparing senators for the prospect of a trump nomination assuring them that if it threatened to harm them in the general election they could run negative ads about mr trump to create space between him and republican senators seeking re election mr mcconnell has raised the possibility of treating mr trump s loss as a given and describing a republican senate to voters as a necessary check on a president hillary clinton according to senators at the lunches he has reminded colleagues of his own 1996 re election campaign when he won comfortably amid president bill clinton s easy re election of mr trump mr mcconnell has said we ll drop him like a hot rock according to his colleagues the rubio hope there is still hope that mr rubio might be able to unite much of the party and slow mr trump s advance in a series of big state primaries in march and a host of top elected officials endorsed him over the last week but mr rubio has struggled to sideline mr kasich and senator ted cruz of texas who is running a dogged campaign on the right he has also been unable to win over several of his former rivals who might help consolidate the republican establishment more squarely behind him mr rubio showed a lack of finesse in dealing with his fallen rivals injured egos mr christie had attacked mr rubio contemptuously in new hampshire calling him shallow and scripted and humiliating him in a debate nevertheless mr rubio made a tentative overture to mr christie after his withdrawal from the presidential race he left the governor a voice mail message seeking mr christie s support and assuring him that he had a bright future in public service according to people who have heard mr christie s characterization of the message mr christie 53 took the message as deeply disrespectful and patronizing questioning why a 44 year old was telling him about his future said people who described his reaction on the condition of anonymity further efforts to connect the two never yielded a direct conversation mr trump by contrast made frequent calls to mr christie once he dropped out a person close to the governor said after the two met at trump tower on thursday with their wives mr christie flew to texas and emerged on friday to back mr trump and mock mr rubio as a desperate candidate near the end of a losing campaign verging on panic efforts to reconcile mr rubio and mr bush a former governor of florida have been scarcely more successful dating to before the south carolina primary when mr rove reached out to their aides to broker a cease fire according to republicans briefed on the conversations it did not last mr bush has been nearly silent since quitting the race feb 20 playing golf with his son jeb jr in miami and turning to the task of thank you notes in a wednesday conference call with supporters he did not express a preference among the remaining contenders when mr rubio called him on monday their conversation did not last long two people briefed on it said and mr rubio did not ask for his endorsement there s this desire verging on panic to consolidate the field said senator lindsey graham of south carolina a former supporter of mr bush but i don t see any movement at all mr rubio s advisers were also thwarted in their efforts to secure an endorsement from mr romney whom they lobbied strenuously after the feb 20 south carolina primary mr romney had been eager to tilt the race and even called mr christie after he ended his campaign to vent about mr trump and say he must be stopped on the night of the primary mr romney was close to endorsing mr rubio himself people familiar with his deliberations said yet mr romney pulled back instead telling advisers that he would take on mr trump directly after a tuesday night dinner with former campaign aides during which he expressed a sense of horror at the republican race mr romney made a blunt demand wednesday on fox news mr trump must release his tax returns to prove he was not concealing a bombshell political vulnerability mr trump responded only with casual derision dismissing mr romney on twitter as one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of republican politics mr romney is expected to withhold his support before the voting this week on the so called super tuesday but some of his allies have urged him to endorse mr rubio before michigan and idaho vote march 8 mr romney grew up in michigan and many idahoans are fellow mormons but already a handful of senior party leaders have struck a conciliatory tone toward mr trump representative kevin mccarthy of california the house majority leader said on television that he believed he could work with him as president many in the party acknowledged a growing mood of resignation fred malek the finance chairman of the republican governors association said the party s mainstream had simply run up against the limits of its influence there s no single leader and no single institution that can bring a diverse group called the republican party together behind a single candidate mr malek said it just doesn t exist on friday a few hours after mr christie endorsed him mr trump collected support from a second governor who in a radio interview said mr trump could be one of the greatest presidents that governor was paul lepage advertisement
