 2016 we read every tweet of his 2015 campaign and what we learned might surprise you by nolan d mccaskill 01 01 2016 07 00 am est donald trump enters the new year with more than 5 5 million twitter followers and a slimmed down campaign operation that he says is 35 million under budget ap photo donald trump didn t just dominate media coverage and polls since announcing his white house bid in june he dominated twitter too a surprisingly effective strategy that saw him drive entire news cycles merely by blasting out choppy pronouncements on his samsung galaxy smartphone often at odd hours trump enters the new year with more than 5 5 million twitter followers and a slimmed down campaign operation that he says is 35 million under budget the billionaire businessman has saved millions on ad buys by voicing his always unfiltered sometimes inflammatory comments to a mass audience through his timeline with a reach far exceeding most of his competitors advertisement politico examined thousands of trump s tweets from mid july through mid december 3 249 tweets and retweets to be exact what we found is a tug of war between the manhattan mogul s famous ego and his equally infamous id bragging about his poll numbers crowd sizes and tv ratings in one moment then viciously attacking his rivals and critics the next trump s obsession with polls leaps out most of all trump sent roughly 330 poll related messages into the twittersphere throughout the five month span typically touting his first place position in early state and national polls ripping any dishonest media organizations that report a survey that suggests otherwise or bashing failing candidates for their poll positions 2016 by eli stokols on dec 15 alone trump tweeted about surveys seven times isn t it amazing that cnn paid a fortune for an iowa poll which shows me in first place over cruz by 13 33 to 20 then doesn t use it trump said referencing texas sen ted cruz why isn t anyone using the cnn iowa poll with me having a big lead they only want to use the one negative poll 2nd place he followed up dishonest press trump then trained his sights on a familiar target this time for misstating his lead over ted cruz in a national poll emailprotected the most overrated anchor at foxnews worked hard to explain away the new monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead trump tweeted she said 15 kelly is very bad at math trump charged she was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and cruz in the new monmouth poll 41to14 all told trump has tweeted about the fox news anchorwoman 66 times but trump is more likely to cast his cruel criticisms toward his white house rivals than at the media his most frequent target jeb bush trump went after the former florida governor 97 times compared to 65 hits on hillary clinton and 49 on florida sen marco rubio emailprotected is totally lost he spends too much time managing the bloated staff of his campaign not enough talking about america s future trump said in one of two bush blasting tweets on oct 24 emailprotected had a tiny 300 person crowd at senator tim scott s forum i had thousands and they had real passion trump tweeted next alongside a picture of a crowd taken from a stage large crowds were also a consistent theme trump couldn t resist tweeting about he boasted 45 times about the tv ratings he brings in and made more than 80 references to his crowds just read that trump has the largest and i add most enthusiastic crowds he remarked on sept 30 tonight i will be in new hampshire the place will be packed but trump isn t always on the offensive he praises media outlets for favorable coverage and retweets his followers more than anything our tally totaled 1 778 retweets perhaps most surprising is that trump often tweets like a typical politician promoting his new book crippled america more than 30 times and regularly informing the world of his upcoming campaign stops and tv appearances while also frequently thanking his supporters by hadas gold people have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems trump wrote on dec 14 in one of his thousand plus more innocuous tweets later in the day he retweeted former talk show host piers morgan who said a trump clinton race would be the greatest presidential battle in history and thanked scottie hughes a trump supporter for her fantastic interview on cnn in which she said nice words in fact one of trump s most popular tweets of 2015 his nov 13 offer of prayers for the victims of the paris attacks which generated 14 263 retweets and 30 628 likes was a completely normal political sentiment somewhat more popular his tweet asking is our president insane for letting in syrian refugees trump s social game is a bewildering blend of brash and bland but overall his twitter feed is an astonishing campaign lesson in how to command the world s biggest stage the internet i understand social media maybe better than anybody ever he boasted in november somebody said i m the ernest hemingway of 140 characters maybe so but trump s online moveable feast isn t just connecting with millions of readers it could help put him in the white house kristen hayford hanna trudo jesse rifkin and noah weiland contributed missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and
