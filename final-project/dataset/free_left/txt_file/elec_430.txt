 the take with rick klein the gop midterm slate hasn t been hijacked by an army of roy moores and don blankenships and kelli wards to name three failed senate candidates who pledged loyalty to president donald trump but trump s push to put himself on the midterm ballot nonetheless puts his style of politics everywhere and potentially on the ballot too in florida his hand picked candidate for governor launched the first day of his general election campaign by warning floridians that the last thing we need to do is monkey this up his african american opponent called it a bullhorn instead of a whistle call and said he took a page from the campaign manual of donald trump trump said he didn t hear the comments but his own words and own conduct speak loudly enough the president campaigns in indiana on thursday for the first time since telling evangelical leaders earlier this week that democrats would overturn everything that we ve done and they ll do it quickly and violently the rundown with maryalice parks he consistently called for rewriting nafta and during the 2016 presidential campaign he bashed his opponent for supporting the initial trade deal in fact it was always one of the biggest applause lines during sen bernie sanders campaign stump speeches fast forward to today and president trump s insistence on being tough on two of america s closest trading partners arguably puts him more aligned with the independent democratic socialist senator than with traditionally free trade minded republicans of course although progressives like sanders also wanted to modify the trade agreement that does not mean they will like the new version trump comes up with democrats and labor unions have pushed for increased environmental and labor standards to be included and it s not clear if those are priorities for the president nonetheless this week with so much other news swirling it would be easy to dismiss trump s work on trade as a deliberate white house effort to distract from the headlines but it s a cause that might resonate with a huge swath of voters especially those frustrated by a decline in domestic manufacturing a new deal could be among other things a real political win for the president the tip with john verhovek the texas gop is bringing memes into one of this cycle s most anticipated senate matchups the state s republican party is going after democratic rep beto o rourke for what it claims is his refusal to debate sen ted cruz it s important to note that there have been various debate proposals just none agreed to by both campaigns after o rourke addressed his 1998 arrest for drunk driving in an op ed proposing a plan to reform the criminal justice system the texas gop trolled him tweeting out o rourke s mugshot monday overlaid with the words sorry can t debate had a little too much to drink the texas gop also tweeted out an old photo of o rourke from his punk rock band days with sorry can t debate we have a gig written over the photo cruz strategist jeff roe then tweeted that the photo is embarrassing because o rourke is wearing a dress the episode shows the gop s broader strategy as it tries to paint o rourke as too liberal for the generally conservative texas electorate that strategy has kept republicans in power in the state but it s one that this cycle will be put to the test what you need to know today quote
