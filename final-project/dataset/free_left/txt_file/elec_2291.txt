about six events that could occur to flip the polls in favor of donald trump over hillary clinton and then i assessed how much each would matter no single occurrence apart from the preposterously unlikely event of barack obama endorsing trump seemed to have a ton of power on its own non silly scenarios included the release of new and questionable clinton e mails a month of passable behavior from trump and a serious health setback for clinton what the column failed to consider however was the power of a few of these incidents occurring at the same time we ve now seen new unfavorable e mail stories this was inevitable two weeks of moderately controlled behavior from trump the previous record had been about two days and a genuine health issue for clinton a near collapse during a 9 11 ceremony we also saw a small but foolish gaffe from the democratic nominee on friday night when she dismissed fully half of trump s supporters as part of a basket of deplorables which she defined as the racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamophobic you name it at a time when trump should have been further on the defensive contending with almost comically devastating revelations about his approach to charity more on that in a bit he is instead pulling even with his rival rumors of clinton s failing health which had been easy to write off because they were so obviously orchestrated have become legitimate concerns there s no use in discussing clinton s e mails here at least for now it s not just that there are plenty of other outlets that will further beat that horse so much so that the washington post editorial page has hollered nuff it s that nothing we ve learned is likely to move anyone s opinion the general narrative out there whether that s fair or not is that clinton is untrustworthy the bottom line in horse race terms is this the drumbeat persists there s only slightly more use in dwelling on trump s streak of good behavior yes he has kept his impulses under control for a couple of weeks a near miracle especially given the rise to power of campaign chief steve bannon widely viewed as the high priest of full freak trumping while trump has said plenty of recent things to appall the sober minded like resurrecting a promise to steal the oil of any place we bother to invade he has said them calmly rather than in a way that makes news so this is an important development especially if trump starts to notice how big a friend he has in silence but one ludicrous outburst changes that and those used to come at about one per cockcrow so we ll have to see if he can keep the lull going unfortunately the near collapse of clinton on sunday from feeling overheated now diagnosed as pneumonia does call for some sentences clinton s line about the basket of deplorables might have caused a blip but it has now been overshadowed the video of her seeming to buckle is terrible and heartrending and it feels almost indecent to witness but now the rumors of clinton s failing health which had been easy to write off because they were so obviously orchestrated with help from rudy giuliani no less have become legitimate concerns it s easy to dismiss symptoms like extended coughing especially with a candidate who must endure countless hours and speeches on the campaign trail it s impossible to dismiss being overcome at a commemoration for 9 11 the sort of event during which every political bone in your body is telling you do not make news do not make news do not make news the setting for clinton s overheating was especially unfortunate you could argue and i have that clinton s health doesn t matter that much politically because not many of those who favor her over trump a split viewed by many of clinton s supporters as akin in severity to god versus satan will suddenly prefer him instead but voters do think a lot about national security and if you believe scott adams when a would be commander in chief withers literally in front of our most emotional reminder of an attack on the homeland we feel unsafe is adams right he might be or at least right enough that two out of a hundred voters could change their minds which is all that it takes clinton s health problems are just the latest example of how fortune so often works in favor of trump they hit just after the publication of a remarkable piece of reporting by the washington post s david a fahrenthold who revealed that the candidate s record of philanthropy seems to be close to nonexistent apparently trump is so pathologically stingy that even organizations to which he claimed to donate had received no money worse his own family foundation took in nothing from trump himself after 2008 relying instead on funds from outside donors even worse trump illegally redirected 25 000 of the money toward the fund raising committee of florida attorney general pam bondi who was deciding on whether to pursue a lawsuit against trump university even worse than that donald trump spent 20 000 of his charity s money to purchase a six foot tall painting of maybe you guessed it donald trump that would all be poor optics as they say except that news of clinton s health came in and dwarfed everything but let s suppose that investigations of trump s charity come back to the fore as they probably will they will still have close to zero effect on most trump supporters those who still believe trump is a benevolent fellow have already had to process several container ships full of cognitive dissonance and don t mind a few tons more those who believe trump is a non benevolent fellow and this includes many probably most of his supporters to judge by what they write and say already know he s a rascal they accept that the thing is he s their rascal for those who find such loyalty hard to understand or accept recall that trump in the eyes of many voters is the only candidate who has bucked the bipartisan globalist consensus and seemed to mean it just imagine if you were on the left but among both democrats and republicans running for office nearly everyone in political life had long expressed indifference to climate change and had views on abortion that ranged from strongly pro life to weakly pro life then along came one candidate who loudly insisted on combatting global warming and fighting for a woman s right to chose on the minus side he also said nasty things about coal miners and fetuses repelling everyone would you be tempted to forgive him this brings us finally to a much discussed recent essay in the claremont review of books called the flight 93 election written by one publius decius mus decius who writes as if he were born in 1850 meaning he was probably born well after 1980 is one of those intellectuals who because of trump s positions on immigration trade and war forgive trump for his many sins the use of flight 93 is an allusion of dubious taste to the hijacked plane in which passengers heroically charged the cockpit on 9 11 the point being that trump versus clinton is possible death versus guaranteed death yes trump is worse than imperfect decius writes so what we can lament until we choke the lack of a great statesman to address the fundamental issues of our time decius has not been alone in his mind set trump supporters know he s a uniquely risky candidate but they make the case for gambling on him all the same no matter the poor track record of huge political rolls of the dice our recent wars come to mind they feel things are very bad and many americans agree this is why trump is again pulling even with hillary clinton unfortunately we understand one another less and less across this divide one side says i know how bad you think things are out there but you have no idea how bad trump is the other side says i know how bad you think trump is but you have no idea how bad things are out there it s a conversation designed to fail leaving only hardened factions all that remains at this point is to wait and count up the polls while technically within the margin of error still favor clinton yet the energy on balance seems to favor trump even when john mccain briefly led obama in 2008 he never attracted swooning and feverish supporters at least not when he wasn t addressing a hospital obama did and trump does many americans seem to want an excuse to vote for him and the rise of bannon seems ironically to be leading to a more controlled candidate if he keeps cool and collected during the debates even if he calls for plundering the globe s energy supplies he probably comes out ahead so no one can relax anymore on the plus side we ll enjoy the extra oil will be used in accordance with our privacy policy it wasn t a coordinated effort and there is only one way to stop it by t a frank a
