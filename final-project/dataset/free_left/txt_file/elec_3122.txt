abigail and john pilger call themselves fiscal conservatives they ve voted for house republican candidates for decades both have even donated money to previous campaigns of karen handel the republican candidate in georgia s upcoming special election but on tuesday the pilger family plans to cross party lines to do something they once considered unthinkable voting to elect a democrat to congress handel is a republican and i don t want a republican representing my district in this era and in these times said abigail pilger 73 in an interview at a starbucks traditionally republican voters like the pilgers are essential for understanding why democrat jon ossoff 30 even has a chance tuesday in a district that rep tom price won by more than 20 points this fall and that democrats haven t held for decades though in the heart of ruby red georgia hillary clinton came within a point of winning the district that s largely thanks to the affluent educated suburban voters who swung away from the republican party across the country in 2016 and do not like donald trump in the republican primary trump lost every county in the sixth district one of the wealthiest and best educated in the state even as he won the state overall these anti trump republicans are also key for ossoff s hopes on tuesday this weekend i had coffee with the pilgers and their son joel at a starbucks in the city of alpharetta one of the wealthiest parts of the district to better understand why they were breaking party ranks a transcript of my conversations sunday with the pilger family follows the three of us are all republicans who are now recovering and are more independent than ever that doesn t mean i would have voted for hillary i didn t but trump is ruining this country this time we re all for ossoff we did vote for tom price every time tom price s stated positions and his performance more or less coincided with the way i look at things in particular being fiscally conservative what changed to make you now skeptical of the republican party it s trump i didn t like him from well before the election it s gotten worse since the election but he s a buffoon he has no experience he has no interest in learning he has no philosophy or interested in learning he s just basically a rich idiot and i don t like him at all i m very libertarian we both are neither of us voted for the mainline candidate in 2016 we both voted for the libertarian gary johnson why were we skeptical of trump as soon as he announced in 2015 and we read the new york times the wall street journal the ajc and many other things online but we had started telling friends that we thought he was if not in the clutches of the russian government then too enamored with the russian regime we were calling him the siberian candidate this time around we were very skeptical of him as a person and as a candidate we knew he was all about show and everything was all about him for the trump name to make money for trump to have publicity for trump that he was getting from running do you have a lot of friends and family who voted for trump my whole family voted for trump except for my husband a lot of people around here they really weren t for trump particularly at the beginning they were for marco rubio they were for ted cruz anybody but trump once he became the republican nominee a lot of them said we can t have hillary so we re voting for trump and i said i in good conscience can t vote for someone who will destroy the republican party and he s done a good job of that and he s continuing to do a good job of it right now so you re both voting for ossoff now but you re libertarians and a lot of voters here say ossoff is a liberal how do you reconcile that because he s not going to be a republican in the house of representatives to give more credence to trump s agenda the republican agenda right now is crappy everything they re doing is to undo what obama did regardless of who it hurts whether it s conservative policy or moderate policy it s all about undoing the obama eight years i m not saying everything obama did was right but you can t just i mean just look at health care it s all in secrecy just like they lambasted the democrats for doing and i m thinking you re no better than the competition are you worried about reports that the bill will take health insurance from 23 million people oh of course i m on medicare i see what it does for us my son is self employed and he d have to spend a fortune for health care if he couldn t get on the exchanges i see it in my own family and i m thinking what in the hell is going on health care is too complicated i wasn t for the obama democratic plan that came into being but so many people have been saved particularly those with preexisting conditions that i can t say you have to completely repeal it that s madness it s really one of those things where there may be some things that need to be done but you know what it will come down to when the democrats take power in 2018 and they will whether it s house and senate or just one of them i think it will come down to medicaid for everyone because i hope they don t pass trumpcare that s what it should come down to what s interesting to me about this is that you say you re a libertarian which is very conservative on economics while also anti trump but we re also socially liberal but in a way tom price who you voted for is behind the health care bill more than trump is yes he s in charge of health and human services and he s being directed by paul ryan the senate has a dozen or so people who are supposedly writing their version and they re doing it in secret and won t present it until they have this bill put together you don t know a darned thing about what s in it so i m thinking this is crazy it s no different than it was in 2009 as a republican was it tough for you to support a democrat like ossoff what were your hesitations i had no hesitations i voted for him the first time i m voting for him in the runoff and i had voted for and supported and sent money to karen handel when she ran for the secretary of state and when she ran for governor and i like her as a person but unfortunately she s a republican and i don t want a republican representing my district in this era and in these times this is the era when we need to say no more you ve got to come up with a better plan if ossoff wins how much of it do you think has to do with the republican health bill in the sixth district health care is a big concern even though economically we re better off than any other in the state we re also the better educated in the whole state so i think our education and our feeling of we ve gotten there and so many people haven t matters i know georgia politics but have seen through reading what s happening both throughout the world and the united states that we re losing people because health care is out of control any republican that goes to washington is effectively tainted because they have to carry the trump mantle and follow the line and toe the line the republican party is in a very precarious situation where they say we have to embrace our president and he s not a traditional conservative they re in this really screwed up position how do you react when you hear handel say a vote for ossoff is a vote for nancy pelosi yawn the democrats are the minority still by some 30 votes and i have to say okay he ll be there for a year and a half and we can see if he does what he says he s going to do worst case scenario he s a hardline super liberal democrat but i think he knows he wouldn t be reelected if he did that get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
