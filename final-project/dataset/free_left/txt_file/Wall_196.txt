advertisement supported by data from new york new jersey and connecticut suggested that steps to control the coronavirus s spread might be working this briefing has ended for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak in the new york area read tuesday s live coverage for days officials in and around new york have sought indications that the coronavirus was nearing a peak and that the number of cases might start leveling off in the region which is the u s epicenter of the pandemic and for days the death toll just kept climbing more sharply in new york state for instance it rose by more than 200 in a day then more by than 400 and then by 630 people but on monday for the second straight day officials found reasons for hope even as hundreds of people continued to die and thousands clung to life on ventilators on both sunday and monday fewer than 600 deaths related to the virus were reported in new york 594 on sunday and 599 on monday gov andrew m cuomo said in new jersey gov philip d murphy reported a similar trend 71 deaths on monday and 86 on sunday after a three day streak when deaths broke triple digits and in connecticut gov ned lamont on monday reported a one day death toll of 17 the lowest since last wednesday transcript total number of hospitalizations are down the i c u admissions are down and the daily intubations are down those are all good signs and again would suggest a possible flattening of the curve the number of discharged is down but that reflects the overall reduction in the numbers big question that we re looking at now is what is the curve if we are plateauing we are plateauing at a very high level and there s tremendous stress on the health care system and to say that this health care system which is at maximum capacity today right this is a hospital system where we have our foot to the floor and the engine is at red line and you can t go any faster and by the way you can t stay at red line for any period of time because the system will blow and that s where we are we are at red line control what you can do what you can the challenge is to make sure that we don t lose anyone who could have been saved if our health care system was operating fully mr cuomo said the data suggested that the spread of the virus in new york at least was nearing its apex but he emphasized that the state remained in a dire unsustainable state of emergency if we are plateauing we are plateauing at a very high level he said and there is tremendous stress on the health care system here were the latest numbers from the day deaths in new york state 4 758 up 599 from 4 159 on sunday morning confirmed cases in the state 130 689 up from 122 031 in new york hospitalizations in the states 16 837 up 2 percent from 16 479 on sunday it was the third straight day of single digit percentage growth after a long period when hospitalizations were growing 20 to 30 percent a day patients in intensive care 4 504 up 2 percent from 4 376 on sunday the day over day increase 128 was the smallest in at least two weeks last week the number of people in intensive care beds which have ventilators was growing by more than 300 people a day mr cuomo asserted that new york had done all it could to prevent the loss of lives that could have been saved have we saved everyone he said no but have we lost anyone because we didn t have a bed or we didn t have a ventilator or we didn t have health care staff no later in the day mr cuomo said in an interview on msnbc that president trump had approved his request for the u s n s comfort a 1 000 bed navy hospital ship that arrived in new york last week to begin treating virus patients mr murphy said separately that the president had approved the comfort treating virus patients from new jersey mayor bill de blasio expressed similarly cautious optimism about the coronavirus outbreak in new york city saying in an interview with ny1 late monday that he and other officials were starting to see promising signs that signaled some improvement he emphasized that officials needed more evidence before they could draw meaningful conclusions but he said the shortage of intensive care beds and ventilators the city had been plagued by appeared to change meaningfully in the past day as the state delivered hundreds of ventilators and the number of people who needed them declined the growth that we have seen day by day seemed to be constantly going up seemed to be sustained at a high level he said now we ve actually seen it begin to pause and start the other way again we ll need a series of days to be able to see if we really have a trend here but something has started to change as a result mr de blasio said that he believed the city could be able to handle the number of cases it had through the end of the week and hopefully even farther than that from dorm rooms and apartments 52 medical students watched video of themselves roll across their screens miles away their proud families followed online gazing into webcams the students pledged the hippocratic oath in frayed unison dozens of different starts and voices all coming to the same point they could get on with doctoring on friday a virtual graduation was held over video chat for nearly half the 2020 class at new york university s grossman school of medicine they were two months ahead of schedule that moment will be repeated in some form at other medical schools in the coming days the more ragged the ritual the more soul stirring its core young people were stepping up to join others already serving at an hour of crisis little different than soldiers being deployed in war the country needs to mobilize people said dr steven abramson the dean of the grossman school last time this happened was in world war ii when medical schools were shortened to three years celebrate the students today remember too that they stand as proxies for an entire caste of the essential doctors nurses and technicians of course but also those who drive buses pick up garbage save lives in ambulances stock grocery shelves deliver mail push bins of dirty sheets down corridors keep the electricity grid humming and the sewer system flowing and figure out how to make space in hospitals when none is left among unnamed others the vast interior of the cathedral church of st john the divine in manhattan stood empty on monday the thousands of chairs that normally sit beneath its soaring ceiling and stained glass windows removed to make room for a more grim sight a coronavirus field hospital the cathedral which describes itself as the largest gothic cathedral in the world said on monday that its 600 foot long nave and equally large subterranean crypt would be turned into an emergency hospital as part of the fight against the pandemic nine climate controlled medical tents capable of holding a total of at least 200 patients will be erected inside the cathedral by the end of the week said the rt rev clifton daniel iii the dean of the cathedral the crypt which is primarily accessible via a series of winding staircases will be used as a staging area for medical personnel he said it is the first time the cathedral which is the seat of the episcopal diocese of new york will have been used for such a task he said mr murphy said on monday that there had been 3 663 new confirmed virus cases in new jersey since the day before bringing the state s total to 41 090 he also noted the 86 new deaths which brought new jersey s total to 1 003 mr murphy arrived at the news conference where he delivered the numbers wearing a face mask which he removed before speaking our protocol has been that when we re in any setting with more than a modest amount of folks we re going to wear our masks including for press conferences both coming in and leaving he said the governor shared data showing that while the number of positive case results continued to rise there had been a decline in the growth rate over the past week from 24 percent day over day on march 30 to about 12 percent as of monday this means that our efforts to flatten the curve are starting and i say starting to pay off even with the lag time in getting testing result back from the labs mr murphy said mr murphy in message posted on twitter on monday expressed his continuing frustration over the failure of some new jersey residents to follow social distancing guidelines calling such people jackasses who we now have to carry one example of the kind of behavior the governor was criticizing happened saturday night when the police in rumson broke up a loud party of about 30 people all in their 40s and 50s when officers arrived at the house where the party was being held officials said they found the homeowner and another man strumming guitars and performing pink floyd songs because the gathering violated the state s social distancing orders officials said the police told those who were there to disperse at that point officials said the crowd became raucous with at least one man ryan sheftel 46 of rumson shouting vulgarities and yelling welcome to nazi germany the homeowner john maldjian 54 was charged with reckless endangerment disorderly conduct and two separate charges related to violating the state s coronavirus emergency orders the state attorney general s office said mr sheftel was charged with disorderly conduct and violating a borough ordinance by disturbing the peace the authorities said in a statement mitchell j ansell a lawyer for mr maldjian said his clients had planned a concert to be broadcast online via facebook live and had decided at the last minute to perform on his front porch he never intended nor invited a crowd of people to come watch him play in person mr ansell said in a statement but neighbors and other people eventually wander over mr answell said calling the decision to perform on the porch a mistake that mr maldjian regretted the party came two weeks after new jersey enacted a statewide ban on most gatherings in an effort to blunt the virus outbreak as of monday more than 1 000 people had died of the virus in the state nonetheless the authorities announced that they had arrested several people over the weekend for violating various emergency orders as least two people besides mr maldjian were arrested in connection with holding parties officials said thousands of domestic workers in new york city who clean and cook for well off families are still working every day they ride the mostly empty subway and buses to go clean and sustain the homes of people who can afford to self quarantine some of these workers have lost their jobs when their employers departed to second homes at the beach or upstate while others grapple with working and risking exposure to the coronavirus or staying home and falling into a deep financial hole you run a risk each time you step out of your home said luz 36 an undocumented immigrant from mexico who works for a family on the upper east side with two children the nearly half million undocumented immigrants in new york city report the lowest median annual earnings of any group of working new yorkers just over 26 000 they do not qualify for most forms of government assistance including any of the emergency benefits in the 2 trillion stimulus package that congress approved last month but many cleaners do pay taxes though not with a social security number that would qualify them for one of the 1 200 cash payments included in the aid package i came here to work said celsio a cleaner in manhattan who is from ecuador but also to pay taxes p p e every day and every day p p e that was the call and response outside harlem hospital center on monday as dozens of nurses protested for more personal protective equipment on the sidewalk out the hospital the names of health care workers who died after treating coronavirus patients were written in brightly colored chalk the manhattan hospital has been inundated with virus patients including some who were transferred from hospitals in queens and the bronx but the hospital staff has been stretched thin and critical workers have been provided with little protective equipment nurses said the hospital has only a small number of respiratory therapists and staff members get one n95 mask to wear for five 12 hour shifts said sarah dowd a staff nurse who helped organize the protest we deserve better she said reciting a list of demands that includes at least one mask a day for hospital workers and more nurses doctors respiratory therapists the harlem nurses were joined by counterparts from other public and private hospitals in the city the protesters held signs that read patients before profits and who will care for you when we are dead foluke fashakin a nurse who was at harlem hospital said that nurses were wearing the same equipment to treat those who were infected and those who were not we are not comfortable with this kind of system she said all dog parks and dog runs in new york city were shut down on monday for the foreseeable future the city parks department said after it received complaints about people not maintaining social distancing at them there are dozens of dog runs throughout the city where dogs are allowed to play with other dogs off leash dogs will be still allowed inside parks but they must be leashed the department said in addition park officials said that all public tennis courts handball courts and basketball courts outside playgrounds would be closed to further discourage their use tennis nets and basketball rims will be removed later this week new york city received 600 000 n95 masks from the federal government mayor bill de blasio said monday thanking president trump and jared kushner and saying that the city had a sufficiently secure supply of the masks for the week this has definitely changed the dynamic for us this week and that s a very good thing the mayor said the previous day the mayor had said that the city was in dire need of medical supplies and only had enough to get through the middle of the week updated may 12 2020 there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others this is a difficult question because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained a better question might be how will we know when to reopen the country in an american enterprise institute report scott gottlieb caitlin rivers mark b mcclellan lauren silvis and crystal watson staked out four goal posts for recovery hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested it seems to spread very easily from person to person especially in homes hospitals and other confined spaces the pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out it may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face no clinical trials are underway in the united states china and europe but american officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away unlike the flu there is no known treatment or vaccine and little is known about this particular virus so far it seems to be more lethal than the flu but the numbers are still uncertain and it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions not just those with respiratory diseases particularly hard if the family member doesn t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms while also keeping as much distance as possible according to guidelines issued by the c d c if there s space the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if masks are available both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters doorknobs toilets and tables don t forget to wash your hands frequently plan two weeks of meals if possible but people should not hoard food or supplies despite the empty shelves the supply chain remains strong and remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea that s not a good idea even if you re retired having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation or even grows makes sense but retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years watching your balance go up and down can be scary you may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions don t if your employer matches any part of your contributions make sure you re at least saving as much as you can to get that free money the city had 135 ventilators in reserve and needs 1 000 to 1 500 more to get through the week mr de blasio said on sunday on monday he reiterated that fact adding that other medical supplies such as surgical gowns were also necessary we continue to focus this week on finding more surgical gowns and of course on ventilators to get us through he said the mayor also repeated that 291 military

holidays off to replace one type of instruction with another weeks after the coronavirus was first detected in rikers island the first inmate at the jail complex died on sunday from complications related to the virus according to two people with knowledge of the matter the inmate a 53 year old arrived at rikers on feb 28 and was hospitalized on march 26 according to an official who spoke on

some streets in each borough to vehicles officials said on monday a spokeswoman for mr de blasio said that the initiative which was started to create more space for pedestrians required 80 city police officers to shut each six to seven block stretch officials decided after a two week trial that not enough people were taking advantage of the program to justify it according to the spokeswoman jane meyer mr de blasio had said on sunday that he wanted to continue testing the program because bad weather might have discouraged people from going outside during the two weeks it was in effect we had

pharmacies state officials said on monday that its june regents examinations for high school students would be canceled many high school students in new york state take the exams which help determine

were grateful for having time with those closest to them and that they enjoy the small things even more now with the vast majority of the nation s schools closed and lessons being conducted remotely
