the following is a transcript of the interview with former treasury secretary henry paulson that aired sunday may 12 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan we re now joined by henry paulson treasury secretary for george w bush he was the administration s point person on the 2008 financial crisis and also led previous u s trade talks with china it s great to have you here in studio you know china s leadership very well both from your time as treasury secretary and building out business for goldman sachs there for many many years how do you expect china to retaliate against the u s since these talks seem to have stalled former secretary henry paulson well margaret let me begin by saying happy mother s day margaret brennan oh thank you fmr sec paulson and and and to my mom mariana and my wife wendi now i i m not going to predict how china is going to respond they ve been very restrained to date they clearly want a deal and need a deal as does the united states no one wins a trade war so i i m expecting you know a a a fairly restrained response margaret brennan you had one of the president s top economic advisers larry kudlow on air today saying that the chinese came to talks this week and then backslid on some of the things they d previously agreed to why the miscalculation fmr sec paulson well there there there s often miscalculations right people misunderstand china they ve got a different political system than ours but they ve got politics they ve got vested interests but you know the bigger picture here is this is a deal that s can be very good for the united states and very good for china the trump administration has been working very hard to do something which i think would make a big difference for american workers for the american people in terms of getting more balanced trade in terms of protecting ipr in terms of breaking down some big structural barriers to competition and china s got plenty of problems themselves they ve got an inefficient financial system inefficient state owned enterprises massive misallocations of capital so their reformers know that if they re going to grow at an acceptable level they need some structural changes so this i think is a you know been a missed opportunity for both both countries but i i believe and i think the overriding point here the big picture is if and when this deal is done and i m an optimist i think it will get done the the underlying tensions are still going to be there because this is the stakes are much bigger than a trade war the you know the the the basic economic problem is still going to exist margaret brennan you ve put up a huge warning signs around this you said you fear an economic cold war an economic iron wall fmr sec paulson yeah i i said i talked about an economic iron curtain and the reason i did is this margaret that the as i said the stakes are much bigger than than than than it than a trade war this is a battle between two countries to drive to set the standards for the technologies of the future the technologies which are going bolster economic growth and competitiveness around the world and so the fundamental issue is technology okay that s where the battleground is and technology has blurred the lines between national security and economic competitiveness and so you know i think it s vitally important we protect our national security but in growing an important part of trade is technology related and so the real risk is that both countries through their actions will throw up or create an economic iron wall which means we ll be decoupling global supply chains right we ll be having two systems with with incompatible standards in in rules and so as i look at it the defining strength of america is innovation and we need to protect our technology need to protect our innovation but if we close ourselves off from other you know other innovative economies and entrepreneurs we jeopardize our leadership position in the world and we re much less attractive as a destination for foreign investment margaret brennan so you seem to be saying the moment is ripe for this deal you re optimistic but you don t like tariffs that s the president s main tool here is this going to damage the u s economy fmr sec paulson well so you re darn right i don t like tariffs why don t i like them because they re a tax on the american consumer but i see an even more perverse effect with tariffs those who do us the great honor of investing in america of doing business with our companies and suppliers do so because we ve always had predictable reliable economic policies tariffs jeopardize it but now we see a situation where republicans and democrats and many and and many international companies are applauding for tariffs if they re used to to get concessions from china and why is that the reason is is because we re in a tough spot in negotiations our our tariffs are either nonexistent or very low so how do you put pressure on other countries to act how do you put pressure on china we don t have very many good tools so that s why they they they prefer tariffs now margaret brennan is it going to hurt us fmr sec paulson not really margaret brennan economically fmr sec paulson yeah but but i would i ll say this i would prefer i would i would prefer the tactic of working with our allies to put pressure but i gotta admit that s an imperfect tool right because our allies aren t very tough when it comes to negotiating with china but will it hurt us i tell you if this persists too long it will okay there will be a cost to it we re we re we re we re trying to accomplish something that s very important in terms of opening up the chinese economy but there is a cost and as strong as our economy is right now and it is margaret brennan yeah fmr sec paulson very very strong as strong as it is i ll tell you if there s margaret brennan mr secretary we have to leave it there fmr sec paulson okay margaret brennan i am so sorry we re running up against a hard break we will be right back watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or
