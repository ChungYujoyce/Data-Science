rare earth elements and metals used in cell phones supercomputers and more are sitting on the ocean floor ready to be mined by multiple countries so why is the u s on the sidelines picture a lump of rock about the size of a potato now pack it with some of the most valuable metals on earth like nickel cobalt and other minerals known as rare earth elements there are trillions of these nodules that s what they re called just waiting to be picked up the problem is they re on the bottom of the pacific ocean the nodules were discovered more than a century ago now new technology has triggered a fierce competition to go get them these metals are critical for modern life cell phones electric cars and supercomputers nineteen countries including china and russia have already jumped into the deep but the one country on the sidelines the united states more on that in a moment but first we wanted to take a look at this new frontier our adventure began at three in the morning loading up our tugboat we pulled out of san diego the harbor lights sank quickly behind us ten hours later we were cutting through the chop of the pacific with nothing to see but the tossing ocean so it wasn t hard to spot the maersk launcher a 300 foot mining research vessel that we d come to join all we had to do was get on board while the launcher dangled a rope ladder above us the tugboat backed in with swells over ten feet timing was everything at the top of the wave we took a leap of faith and landed in the new world of deep sea mining we were travelling with gerard barron the ceo of canadian company deepgreen metals he was eager to catch up with the launcher s crew they d been at sea for five weeks on a test run mapping the seafloor and fishing for nodules this was the sunken treasure we had come to see bill whitaker so what makes them so valuable what s is in that gerard barron well that is a electric vehicle battery in a rock bill whitaker it looks like a lump of charcoal laugh gerard barron it does but it s a beautiful lump of lump of nodule the amazing thing is it s filled with nickel and cobalt and copper and manganese and that s everything we need to build a battery to get the nodules the crew hoists a three ton rig called a box core over the side plunging into the ocean it begins its three mile descent to the sea floor hours later it neared the bottom it felt like watching a new lunar landing and there they were giant fields of nodules covering an alien landscape millions of years old the nodules grow by absorbing metals from the seawater expanding slowly around a core of shell bone or rock the potential is staggering estimates of their worth run from 8 to more than 16 trillion they are primarily found in the clarion clipperton zone or ccz about 2 million square miles of ocean between hawaii and mexico on this research trip deepgreen scooped up over 100 helpings of the seafloor each box reeled back on board heavy with the catch of the day thousands of nodules in 30 years as a geologist warwick miller told us he d never seen anything like it warwick miller it s a great day to be a geologist bill whitaker you said it was a great day to be a geologist what d you mean warwick miller ah we were standing by the box core i remember holding my hand up i was covered in mud its nice that i get to touch them you know it s better than looking at them behind in a glass case for example bill whitaker they re in all sizes all different sizes like this warwick miller there s different types the type you re holding there would be type three nodule which is larger and it s got a characteristic sort of cauliflower texture to it miller told us each nodule has the same proportion of metals after they re weighed and measured they re stored in a refrigerated container they will be further analyzed on shore to help deepgreen figure out where to mine first they hope to start in three years bill whitaker they re that many of them down there warwick miller yeah exactly if they found a deposit with this much metal concentration on land it would be a bonanza that nobody would stop talking about for years the rules for deep sea mining are set by an obscure u n agency called the international seabed authority it s already divided the ccz into dozens of concessions deepgreen operates two the company calculates the nickel and cobalt in their patch of ocean alone is enough to make batteries for 150 million electric cars gerard barron laugh i love the fact that they re the way we re gonna get away from fossil fuels i love the fact that in these are all the metals we need to go and build those batteries i mean it s it s it s the most amazing coincidence that i ve ever encountered mother nature made these nodules bill whitaker they re just sitting there gerard barron it s like okay you guys you ve messed up planet earth come and get me bill whitaker so you call yourself an environmentalist but you re also a miner laugh how do you combine the two gerard barron well you know i don t call myself a miner but we are collecting nodules off the ocean floor bill whitaker so if you re not a miner what what do you call what you will be doing gerard barron well we call it harvesting bill whitaker harvesting gerard barron harvesting nodules from the ocean floor unlike on land there s no drilling or digging instead enormous deep sea robots will do the heavy lifting to see one of the most advanced we travelled to antwerp belgium in a country better known for beer and chocolate we met patania kris van nijen it s a caterpillar it s a caterpillar track so we said what is the fastest caterpillar on earth and it s called the patania ruralis kris van nijen the managing director of global sea mineral resources or gsr told us patania cost 12 million it s what you might expect if you crossed a bulldozer with a giant vacuum cleaner and then stuffed it with electronics kris van nijen so the nodules are sucked into a stream and they go into the system it s got the capacity to store three tons of nodules bill whitaker three tons of kris van nijen three tons of nodules bill whitaker how many nodules are down there kris van nijen it is estimated that there is more nickel more cobalt and more manganese than on the rest of the planet in 2017 gsr was the first to put a robot on the seafloor last summer expectations were high for patania s second plunge into the pacific a specially built frame swung the35 ton machine over the edge of the ship a fibre optic umbilical cord unspooling as it sank from sight but then something went wrong the crew lost the signal to patania the test was called off bill whitaker was that a big setback kris van nijen a very big setback bill whitaker you have said that the deep sea has no mercy is this what you mean kris van nijen that s exactly what we mean it has no mercy it has to be 1 000 perfect or it won t work gsr hopes to take patania back to the clarion clipperton zone soon when mining begins van nijen told us the nodules will be pumped to the surface to a waiting ship before they re processed onshore with supplies of some critical metals running low the race to develop underwater crawlers like this one led by a dutch group is in high gear but some scientists fear that deep sea mining will wreck the seafloor a world not fully understood this rare albino octopus nicknamed casper a species only discovered three years ago dr craig smith when we go out and collect a sample on the seafloor we collect hundreds of new species bill whitaker things that you ve never seen before dr craig smith sure oh yeah yeah craig smith is an oceanographer at the university of hawaii he told us he was surprised at how much life could survive three miles deep his expeditions to the ccz have turned up fantastical creatures like this squidworm or a fluorescent sea cucumber dubbed a gummy squirrel there are other deep sea originals too a foot long shrimp a ping pong tree sponge and a galloping sea urchin bill whitaker mining companies say that the ccz is only about 1 of the ocean that the ocean is so vast that it could absorb the activity in that dr craig smith right bill whitaker small portion of dr craig smith yeah that s bill whitaker the ocean dr craig smith a little bit like saying the amazon rainforest is only 8 of the the global land area so we can wipe it out and it doesn t matter bill whitaker won t deep sea mining actually be less invasive have less of an impact than mining on land dr craig smith i would say no mining is mining i think it s similar to strip mining on land and it ll take a really long time for things to recover smith is working with the united nation s seabed authority which set aside nine protected areas that will be off limits to miners and kris van nijen has invited independent scientists to monitor gsr s work bill whitaker if you find that the environmental impact is severe would this stop the project kris van nijen absolutely i don t think we re not in into this project to come up with a means to produce metals worse than what is being done today we re in it because we believe it can be done better so far 19 different countries have licenses in the clarion clipperton zone china has more than anyone else russia and japan have also jumped in so has france germany korea even cuba and tonga have stakes who s missing the united states it s not for lack of trying the u n s law of the sea covers deep sea mining and in 1994 president bill clinton signed the treaty but it was dead on arrival in the senate despite repeated attempts to ratify it including this past july bill whitaker is that doing us harm jonathan white absolutely we don t have a seat at that table jonathan white is a retired rear admiral who now runs a non profit to protect oceans he told us that being outside the treaty means the u s has no say in how this new gold rush is being run jonathan white it s a law and if we re not gonna be part of that lawful system doesn t it make us sort of outlaws of the sea with the u s on the sidelines china has poured hundreds of millions into its deep sea ambitions last month china unveiled its new weapons that included an underwater drone that will patrol the ocean jonathan white if you re in the military a weapon system the guidance of our weapons x ray machines microwaves they all rely on elements that are hard to come by bill whitaker so china controls most of these elements from terrestrial sources jonathan white yes bill whitaker and now they re going after the lion s share of the seabed sources jonathan white they certainly are bill whitaker does that concern you jonathan white it absolutely concerns me it concerns me with relation to our national security going forward we need to be in this game so we called the 22 senators opposed to the treaty all republicans to ask why none would appear on camera those who wrote us said that ceding any control to the united nations was a deal breaker but rear admiral white worries if the u s doesn t ratify the law of the sea it will soon be too late bill whitaker and if we don t what does that mean for us jonathan white i think it means that again we become more isolated especially in terms of a growing global economy bill whitaker and we re dependent on china jonathan white and absolutely more dependent on china bill whitaker so what sense does that make jonathan white it makes no sense the country that made it to the moon first may now miss the race to this new frontier and the untold riches of the
