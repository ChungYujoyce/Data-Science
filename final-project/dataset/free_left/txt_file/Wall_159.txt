advertisement supported by from the pantry is there anything more satisfying than an easy bowl of carbonara by melissa clark mondays are always a little hard self isolation notwithstanding but a big bowl of cheesy pasta makes it better and if you ve got bacon and a hard grating type cheese then carbonara is within reach it s speedy too to make enough for three or four people cook 12 ounces pasta in well salted water until very al dente any shape works but spaghetti or linguine are traditional be sure to undercook the pasta by a minute or two because you re going to finish it in the skillet with the sauce just before draining dip a coffee cup into the pot and retrieve some of the pasta cooking water save this for the sauce while the pasta is cooking use a fork to beat two eggs plus a couple of yolks with 1 3 cup each grated parmesan and pecorino romano or use 2 3 cup of just one kind of cheese if that s all you have save those egg whites in the fridge they will keep for at least two weeks and i m planning on using mine for macaroons later this week add a pinch of salt and pepper to the beaten eggs using more salt if you don t have the salty pecorino romano if you like garlic you can also add a grated clove to the eggs in a large skillet over medium low heat cook 3 or 4 slices of diced bacon or 3 or 4 ounces guanciale pancetta or even salami if you ve got some on hand until golden depending on how fatty the bacon is you might need a drizzle of olive oil in the pan to get it rendering you don t want it crisp just golden at the edges but still tender some people add a chopped onion to the pan at this point but i don t take the bacon pan off the heat and let it cool for a few minutes you want the pan to be very warm when you add the pasta but not so hot that you overcook the egg mixture when the pasta is drained add it to the warm bacon pan along with a big splash of reserved pasta cooking water and toss well add the egg mixture and toss energetically for a minute or two until everything is well coated and creamy if the mix seems dry add another splash of pasta water top with loads more grated cheese a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper or red pepper flakes serve immediately pasta carbonara doesn t wait for slowpokes this is part of a weekday series in which melissa clark teaches you how to cook with pantry staples other recipes in the series cornmeal poundcake root vegetables with chickpeas and yogurt cheesy shakshuka sardine celery salad brothy lentils and rice flaky biscuits tahini omelet cold peanut noodles crunchy pantry popcorn vegetarian skillet chili dried beans baked oats canned tuna pasta any vegetable soup pantry crumb cake follow nyt food on twitter and nyt cooking on instagram facebook youtube and pinterest get regular updates from nyt cooking with recipe suggestions cooking tips and shopping advice advertisement
