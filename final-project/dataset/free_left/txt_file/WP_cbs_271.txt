document how state election officials administered the 2020 primary election and special elections for california s 25th and 50th congressional districts cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidarreports in addition to observing highly irregular means of collecting and tallying votes without oversight mechanism the report says minority staff also noticed that los angeles county lacks adequate security protocols in its custody of vote by mail ballots the report claims that the los angeles county registrar s office used a large bin outside of its building to serve as a deposit location for vote by mail ballots without election officials or registrar office staff there to supervise one concern with this practice is that there is no way to track who drops off ballots whether they are affiliated with a campaign organization or what their relationship is to the voters whose ballots they have been entrusted with davis wrote furthermore davis says that minority staff went to the los angeles county registrar s office and observed unopened vote by mail ballots sitting in an unsecured room open to the public in addition there was no way to clearly distinguish election officials from the voting public and observers the report claims davis writes that ballot harvesting destroys the secret ballot he also suggests it breaks anti electioneering laws a voter cannot wear a campaign button to a polling location but a political operative can collect your ballot in your living room the report reads the 12 page report was also guided by incidents during the 2018 midterm
