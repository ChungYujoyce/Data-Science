the following is a transcript of an interview with ronna mcdaniel that aired sunday february 2 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan joining us now is the head of the republican national committee ronna mcdaniel good morning good to have you here republican national committee chair ronna mcdaniel good morning great to be here margaret brennan so president trump will be the first american president to run for re election after having been impeached how do you turn that into an asset mcdaniel well we re already seeing it as an asset with our base we ve added 600 000 new small online donors since this impeachment began we re seeing his approval ratings tick up we re seeing independents come our way because the american people recognize this hasn t been bipartisan this hasn t been held to the standard we ve seen with past presidents and they really view it as democrats pushing their agenda against a president they never wanted to see elected to begin with and they fought him every step of the way and they want and then they see the president signing the phase one deal with china signing usmca he s governing while they re continuing to resist and i think it s working in his favor margaret brennan so you ve been fundraising mcdaniel yes margaret brennan off of impeachment but the rnc is also picking up the tab isn t it true for some of the president s legal defense his his lawyers how how this is instead of creating some kind of fund like bill clinton did when he was impeached why did the rnc choose to do it this way mcdaniel well we do have a legal fund that is specifically for these types of things it s not taking away from our ground game or helping with re election and our infrastructure we re building in the states it s specifically for legal expenses and guess what we re paying for it and not the taxpayers the democrats are doing this on the taxpayer dime they re not getting the things done that the american people want and we re helping to pay for some of these costs because we don t want to see our president impeached we think he should be re elected and that s what the majority of our supporters and investors feel at the rnc as well margaret brennan do you know what the cost has been mcdaniel i don t know what the cost has been margaret brennan so i want to ask you about some of the polls mcdaniel sure margaret brennan your home state in particular out there in michigan an epic mra poll shows that out there president trump trails all five top democratic candidates who do you think is the toughest candidate for president trump trump to beat joe biden says you re scared to death of him mcdaniel well i ll just say this our internal polling where we ve been in all these states our analytics which is more accurate shows the president in very good shape in all of these states i am not concerned about any of them nobody has become the presumptive front runner you re actually seeing more people get in the race you re seeing an energy problem for biden you have a huge issue with his national security stances as vice president and then with bernie he s gone way too far with talking about taking away people s health care plans and taking a government control of health care so we re going to be good against any of them because we ve a record that the president can run on of seven million new jobs wages going up and you see in poll after poll that you do see that people feel good about the economy they know that they re better off than they were four years ago and that s what we re gonna get to run on margaret brennan and you think that s your strongest argument the economy mcdaniel it s a huge argument i mean people have more money they feel better about their future they can send their kids to college their kids can get jobs after college these are things that the american voter cares about margaret brennan but president trump has already tweeted quite a lot in the past 12 hours or so about mike bloomberg he told fox as well he would love to run against him michael bloomberg s already spent a quarter of a billion dollars on his advertising around his campaign president trump has spent just slightly over 50 million dollars how concerned are you not just about bloomberg himself but what he s building in terms of an operation that he says he will hand off to any democrat who wins the nomination mcdaniel well he s building an outside operation outside of the party which is like a super pac essentially once he s not a candidate i m not concerned about that from a party structure we re working with our state parties our county parties our district committees we re able to coordinate directly with the candidate it s not an outside group and the rnc is already on the ground in 18 states we ve already trained 500 000 volunteers we re going into 2020 with 200 million dollars between us and the and the trump campaign so we are building the biggest infrastructure in the history of politics i m not concerned about what bloomberg s putting out and his ads i see them all the time i think they re terrible mike gets it done what does he get done i don t know i don t know anything about him we re not seeing him talking to the voters at the level that i think you need to margaret brennan yeah mcdaniel to be competitive and the president s not afraid of anybody let s be honest he punches at everybody margaret brennan fair but mike bloomberg has tremendous spending ability here mcdaniel he does margaret brennan he s not putting limits really on what he s willing to do to defeat president trump he s worth 60 billion dollars and he s going to hand this off even if it s not him mcdaniel well president trump went up against hillary clinton who had significantly more money than he did we ve seen candidate after candidate with these huge war chests come in and think they can buy an election and the american people don t like that and president trump if you look at the crowds that we re seeing which are bigger than ever a hundred and fifty thousand people signed up to come to a rally in new jersey in blue new jersey if you look at the fundraising if you look at the margaret brennan but bloomberg s modeling a lot of what he s doing around what trump did it s a lot of digital mcdaniel yeah margaret brennan it s a lot of tv advertising mcdaniel he s modeling it but he s not trump that s the big factor bloomberg is not trump he s not going to get a crowd like that i d like to see him do a rally and try and even get a hundred people to come i mean this is not the movement candidate bloomberg and i think he s got a real issue with the democrat party i mean listen they just changed their debate rules and their structure for a billionaire and they refused to do it when you had cory booker and julian castro saying listen we deserve more diversity on the stage representing our party and they said nope we re not going to change the rules for you margaret brennan right mcdaniel but this billionaire can buy his way into the debate bloomberg had every ability to change the way he was raising money to qualify for the debates but they re changing the rules for the billionaire and i think that speaks volumes about the democrat party margaret brennan i want to ask you though about president trump s relationship with i mean he s reshaped the party but there are still traditional republicans who aren t entirely comfortable with everything he does including your uncle senator mitt romney who voted for witnesses he was one of only two republicans who did so in this impeachment trial the conservative political action conference has disinvited him from an upcoming meeting and they re kind of they put up this ad online there are tv ads against him i mean do you think this is proper political retaliation mcdaniel i i disagree that margaret brennan are you comfortable with that mcdaniel the president s changed the republican party i think the president s strengthened our party and if you look at things that he s done margaret brennan i don t know if you saw that ad but it was your uncle s face there mcdaniel i haven t i haven t seen the ad margaret brennan it says disinvited or not invited mcdaniel well that s the grassroots part of our party and they re upset they re upset when people aren t supporting the president and supporting our party and and they think if you re not supporting him you re helping a democrat get elected that s a very common belief among the grassroots of our party but i will say this president has stood for life he stood for rule of law judges he stood for tax cuts he stood for deregulation energy independence these are republican ideals margaret brennan but mcdaniel and he has made the rnc significantly stronger by supporting our party and we will be stronger after him because of the investment he s put in data and digital and the things to make us strong beyond his presidency margaret brennan okay i understand you don t want to comment on your comfort and your uncle and the comments about him but we do have to leave it there good to have you here mcdaniel great to be here margaret brennan in
