advertisement supported by david brooks by david brooks i have two presidential election traditions i begin covering each campaign by reading a book about abraham lincoln and i end each election night usually after midnight at the statue of the lincoln memorial i begin by reading a book about lincoln not because it s fair to hold any of the candidates to the lincoln standard but because he gets you thinking about what sorts of things we should be looking for in a presidential candidate any candidate worthy of support should at least have in rudiments what lincoln had in fullness a fundamental vision a golden temperament and a shrewd strategy for how to cope with the political realities of the moment lincoln developed his fundamental vision in a way that seems to refute our contemporary educational practices today we pile on years of education we assign hundreds of books over the years we cluster our students on campuses with people with similar grades and test scores lincoln had very little formal education he was not cloistered on a campus but spent his formative years in daily contact with an astounding array of characters if his social experience was wide his literary experience was narrow he read fewer books over his entire formative life than many contemporary students do in a single year in literary terms he preferred depth to breadth grasp to reach he intensely read shakespeare the king james bible the pilgrim s progress and parson weems s the life of washington this education gave him a moral vision that emerged from life not from reading he saw america as a land where ambitious poor boys and girls like himself could transform themselves through hard morally improving work he believed in a government that built canals and railroads and banks to stoke the fires of industry he believed slavery was wrong in part because people should be free to control their own labor he believed in a providence that was active but unknowable this whiggish vision was his north star he could bob and weave as politics demanded but his incremental means always pointed to the same transformational end any presidential candidate needs that sort of consistent animating vision an image of an ideal america baked so deeply into his or her bones as to be unconscious useful as a compass when the distractions of washington life come in a flurry lincoln s temperament surpasses all explanation his early experience of depression and suffering gave him a radical self honesty he had the double minded personality that we need in all our leaders he was involved in a bloody civil war but he was an exceptionally poor hater he was deeply engaged but also able to step back a passionate advocate but also able to see his enemy s point of view aware of his own power but aware of when he was helpless in the hands of fate extremely self confident but extremely humble candidates who don t have a contradictory temperament have no way to check themselves and are thus dangerous lincoln s skills as a political tactician seem like the least of his gifts but are among his greatest it s easy to be a true believer or to govern or campaign with your pedal to the metal all the time it s much harder to know when to tap on the brake and when to step on the gas we study lincoln s tactical phase shifts in the grand strategy class i help with at yale there s never enough time to cover them all most of lincoln s efforts were designed to tamp down passion for the sake of sustainable incremental progress others would have delivered a heroic first inaugural address but lincoln made his a dry legal brief others would have stuffed the emancipation proclamation with ringing exclamations but lincoln s draft is as dull as possible others wanted an immediate end to slavery lincoln tried to end it through unromantic gradual economic means he hoped that if he limited the demand for slaves by halting the spread of slavery and by paying people not to keep them he could drive down the price and render the whole enterprise unprofitable this year lincoln s strategic restraint is the most necessary of his traits we live in a partisan time with movements who treat trimmers compromisers and incrementalists harshly but to pass legislation the next president will have to perpetually disappoint the fervent and devise a legislative strategy that can consistently get a house majority and 60 senate votes we will not get a lincoln a person with his face could not survive the tv age a person with his capacity for introspection could not survive the 24 7 self branding campaign environment but we do need someone with a portion of his gifts someone who is philosophically grounded emotionally mature and tactically cunning well at least we can find the closest possible approximation advertisement
