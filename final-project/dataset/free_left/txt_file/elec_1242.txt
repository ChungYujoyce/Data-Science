advertisement supported by political memo by jonathan martin and maggie haberman in the space of a few hours last week hillary rodham clinton and jeb bush showed how their parties two best funded candidates are grappling with insistent intensifying demands from activists on the left and the right who are deeply disenchanted with the political establishment before a heavily african american audience in south carolina mrs clinton sought to outflank her democratic rivals who have struggled with questions of race it s essential that we all stand up and say loudly and clearly that yes black lives matter she said on thursday and we all have a responsibility to face these hard truths about race and justice honestly and directly but mrs clinton offered little in the way of ideas to satisfy activists in search of far reaching solutions to systemic discrimination later the same day in rural new hampshire mr bush sought to strike a balance between his view that republicans must be inclusive to win and a desire not to give in to what he called excessive political correctness a republican will never be elected president of the united states again unless we campaign like this he said spreading his arms wide it was an implicit rejection of donald j trump s incendiary remarks about immigrants yet talking to reporters after the event mr bush was nearly incredulous that martin o malley a democratic contender and former maryland governor had apologized for telling demonstrators who interrupted him at netroots nation last weekend that all lives matter we re so uptight and politically correct now that you apologize for saying lives matter he said dismissing black lives matter as a slogan the well organized black lives matter movement against discrimination and police brutality on the one hand and conservatives uneasy about immigration and assimilation on the other reflect sharply different currents of anger in american life but the demands that each constituency is placing on the leading presidential candidates reflect a growing unwillingness to accept the usual assurances an expectation of action and discomfiting strains on the political center there s tension at the seams of both political coalitions said pat buchanan the conservative commentator who has run republican and third party campaigns for president on the left young black activists furious about discrimination and inequities in criminal justice say the usual rhetorical nods toward equality incremental increases in funding for housing or education and vague promises of change from mainstream political leaders are inadequate instead they are confronting democrats imploring them to offer specific solutions for what they see as an urgent crisis tia oso the black activist who interrupted mr o malley s speech at the progressive netroots gathering in phoenix cited an emergency the most important and urgent issue of our day is structural violence and systemic racism that is oppressing and killing black women men and children ms oso wrote on mic com and jamilah nasheed a missouri state senator from heavily black northern st louis near the center of protests over the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man in ferguson last year said the anger was moving beyond protest you re seeing a movement now ms nasheed said describing a boil over of anger and hopelessness mrs clinton was praised for a speech on race she delivered days after the massacre at a black church in charleston s c last month but several black leaders questioned whether her early words would translate into calls for substantive changes beyond the debate over policing in the eyes of many black liberals no candidate is addressing race and poverty with the boldness of a robert f kennedy on the right by contrast blue collar conservatives have responded to mr trump who has given voice to their fears about what they see as america s identity crisis it s not only illegal immigration but mass immigration and the changing character and composition of the country that unsettles people mr buchanan said mr trump s success so far suggests that the eventual republican nominee could face difficulties persuading many in the party to adopt a more accommodating tone and policies toward immigrants a recent washington post abc poll found that his support came largely from white voters with high school diplomas a constituency that was most likely to believe that immigration does not strengthen american society while mr bush has continued to advocate a pathway to legal status for those in the country illegally some of his rivals have mused about a harder line the next president and the next congress need to make decisions about a legal immigration system that s based first and foremost on protecting american workers and american wages gov scott walker of wisconsin said in april and in an ad aired by his super pac in iowa gov bobby jindal of louisiana took on the matter of assimilation directly saying that he was tired of hyphenated americans and that immigrants must adopt our values should the two parties nominate mr bush and mrs clinton heirs in the country s leading political families it is not difficult to imagine a conservative candidate s mounting a populist third party run much as mr buchanan once did that taps into anti trade and anti immigration fervor on the right the enhanced expectations and louder shouting from both ends of the political spectrum are a natural outgrowth of president obama s administration said michael kazin a georgetown university historian ambitious presidents who usher in or oversee periods of sweeping change he said often lead to the creation of pressure groups on their own side and a fiercer backlash from the opposition the john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson presidencies mr kazin said did not just spawn an idealistic generation of democratic baby boomers they created the new left and black freedom movement both of which became quite critical of kennedy johnson and the entire political establishment he said the sense then and now is that their problems are not being addressed and nobody in either party is truly addressing them mr kazin said but elon james white the founder of this week in blackness a digital media platform who also works with netroots nation said that would have to change folks are going to have to learn he said that people are not going to sit around anymore and let this ride advertisement
