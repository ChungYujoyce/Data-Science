the u s and china during a recent television appearance peter altmaier was defending the german government s refusal to ban chinese tech giant huawei from building the country s 5g cellular network saying if the company were indeed transmitting data to intelligence agencies in beijing it would be no worse than what the u s has already done altmaier noted that germany had not imposed a boycott on u s tech firms after it was revealed that the u s national security agency had monitored cell phone calls in the country in 2013 and allegedly even spied on chancellor angela merkel the u s has long called on its allies to boycott huawei warning that china could use the telecoms provider s equipment to conduct espionage or cyber sabotage altmaier pointed out that the u s also demands that its companies pass on information needed for fighting terrorism his remarks drew a strong rebuke from the white house s man in germany ambassador richard grenell the recent claims by senior german officials that the united states is equivalent to the chinese communist party are an insult to the thousands of american troops who helped ensure germany s security and the millions of americans committed to a strong western alliance he said in a statement issued by the u s embassy in berlin there is no moral equivalency between china and the united states and anyone suggesting it ignores history and is bound to repeat it to drive his point home grenell flagged at least a couple tweets this week to altmaier s account linking to news articles about china s human rights abuses of muslim minorities in the country cc peteraltmaier https t co jxsjebwug4 grenell s indignation was echoed by president trump s national security adviser robert o brien who noted that the u s was a country that sacrificed a lot of blood and wealth during the cold war to protect germany altmaier s comments also caused a stir among senior german politicians the reaction prompted him to say he had been misinterpreted at no point did i draw parallels between the u s and chinese political systems he told bild we need the highest possible security standards when dealing with sensitive data no matter where the products originate u s german relations have been tense since mr trump s envoy to the country took office in may last year grenell has ruffled feathers with a number of controversial forays into germany s domestic politics critics have accused him of flouting diplomatic norms and harming the transatlantic alliance on his first day as ambassador in berlin he took to twitter and called on german companies to immediately withdraw from iran against which the u s had just announced new sanctions germany has tried for months along with france and britain to keep the 2015 nuclear deal with iran viable after the trump administration s unilateral withdrawal from it in response to that tweet wolfgang ischinger a former german ambassador to the u s and now chairman of the munich security conference said ric my advice after a long ambassadorial career explain your own country s policies and lobby the host country but never tell the host country what to do if you want to stay out of trouble germans are eager to listen but they will resent instructions grenell is an ardent backer of his boss president trump s policies and just a month into his job he expressed controversial support for europe s right wing political movements in an interview with breitbart i absolutely want to empower other conservatives throughout europe other leaders grenell said to the news site previously run by steve bannon i think there is a groundswell of conservative policies that are taking hold because of the failed policies of the left he presented himself as a big fan of the then austrian chancellor sebastian kurz a right wing conservative politician who espoused a tough stance in favor of limiting immigration to austria and europe more broadly grenell dismissed accusations that he was interfering in germany s internal affairs as absurd i stand by my comments that we are experiencing an awakening from the silent majority those who reject the elites their bubble led by trump he said in a tweet mr trump has consistently drawn low approval ratings across europe including in germany and even among backers of the country s right wing populist party afd in january of this year grenell again angered many in germany by threatening german companies involved in the development of the nord stream 2 natural gas pipeline companies involved in russian energy exports are taking part in something that could prompt a significant risk of sanctions he said first published on november 28 2019 5 43 am 2019 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the know get the
