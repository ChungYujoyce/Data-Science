if we are being honest the presidential race between hillary clinton and donald trump is effectively over which means that the big fight over the next 15 days is for control of the senate where democrats need a net gain of four seats to retake control that prospect is looking more and more likely of late thanks in large part to trump s collapse at the top of the ticket a fall that appears to be dragging down the likes of richard burr in north carolina kelly ayotte in new hampshire and joseph j heck in nevada buoyed by rising polls clinton shifts to a new target the house and senate what few people talk about but should is that this could be a very short lived majority for senate democrats as the 2018 field is remarkably bad for them the numbers for that year are stunning 25 democratic or democratic affiliated independents are up for reelection compared with just eight republicans that s as lopsided an election cycle as you will ever see but a look inside the numbers makes the democrats challenge in 2018 all the more daunting fully 20percent of the 25democratic seats are in states that then republican presidential nominee mitt romney carried in 2012 and even trump is likely to carry on nov 8 indiana missouri montana north dakota and west virginia all five democratic incumbents in those states are expected to run for reelection a prospect that gives democrats a chance in each but with 2018 looking almost certain to be the first midterm election of a hillary clinton presidency it s hard to see how her party avoids major losses in red states the battle for the senate is going down to the wire here s where we stand some important historical context in the first midterm election of president obama s term in 2010 democrats lost 63house seats and six senate seats in bill clinton s first midterm as president in 1994 democrats lost 54 house seats and eight senate seats george w bush was the exception with his party gaining eight house seats and two senate seats in 2002 although that election was heavily influenced by the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks while those five states are deeply endangered for democrats in 2018 they are far from the only possible republican targets sen bill nelson d fla has said he plans to run for reelection but retirement rumors still swirl even if he stays put he could face a very competitive race sen sherrod brown d ohio cruised to a victory in 2012 but the buckeye state s natural competitiveness suggests he will face a serious republican opponent wisconsin too where sen tammy baldwin d is in her first term could see a real race then there is the wild card of virginia sen tim kaine s likely ascension to the vice presidency will force gov terry mcauliffe d to appoint a replacement that person will serve until november 2017 when he or she rep robert c bobby scott is the leading name will face a special election for the remaining year of kaine s term whoever wins that special election will have to run again for a full six year term in november 2018 gop braces for trump loss roiled by refusal to accept election results while democratic problems are everywhere on the map democratic opportunities are few and far between sen dean heller r nev is an obvious target given the state s competitiveness at the federal level but after that the pickings get very very slim sen jeff flake r ariz might be a democratic opportunity given the state s increasing competitiveness in 2016 but flake has been one of the most outspoken anti trump voices within his own party and will not be easily caricatured as a trump republican in short even if democrats win the senate in 2016 it could be a blink before they are back in the minority which means that a president hillary clinton will have two years to work with a friendly senate before things get much much tougher for her in congress
