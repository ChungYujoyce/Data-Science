the following is a transcript of the interview with former defense secretary james mattisthat aired sunday september 8 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan we turn now to secretary pompeo s former colleague secretary of defense james mattis he is also a retired marine corps general and the author of call sign chaos learning to lead thank you for being here good morning to you general james mattis good morning margaret good to be here margaret brennan thousands of americans have died at the hand hands of the taliban in afghanistan they gave safe haven to osama bin laden to plan the 9 11 attacks did you ever think you d see the day when the taliban was invited to camp david gen mattis well it was a surprise margaret but i would say that all wars eventually come to an end and i salute efforts to try to end that war no doubt secretary pompeo just before we are speaking here he mentioned that we have to stay true to first principles and i think that we are seeing what he said come true margaret brennan but you were involved from the very beginning of this war in the invasion in 2001 in your experience can the taliban ever be trusted to make a clean break with terrorists and honor a diplomatic deal gen mattis well you re going to the heart of the issue right there can they be trusted you remember when we reduced nuclear weapons with russia we talked about trust but verify in this case with this group i think you want to verify then trust we ve asked them demanded that they break with al qaeda since the bush administration they ve refused to do so they murdered three thousand innocent people citizens of 91 countries on 9 11 we should never forget that that the taliban hid those people among them refused to break with them and have refused to this day to break so i think secretary pompeo say saying go back to first principles is exactly the right thing to do margaret brennan but every single democrat running for president is promising to bring the troops home president trump campaigned on bringing the troops home gen mattis yes margaret brennan you re saying just pulling out is the wrong decision gen mattis margaret margaret brennan can you remind people why there needs to be a continued presence there gen mattis right the the fact is we need to maintain an influence there until the government of afghanistan and the people of afghanistan are strong enough to deny afghanistan as a safe haven now one margaret brennan the taliban control so much territory right now gen mattis well they do and and wars go like that sometimes but the point is that you may want a war over you may even declare a war over but the enemy gets a vote a a fact brought home to me repeatedly over my 40 years of service margaret brennan if you had to fight this war again and i know you don t get do overs but would you have done something differently gen mattis well you can always look back and hopefully learn from what you did learn from the lessons of the of the reality on the battlefield that sort of thing but i think the fundamentals of forcing al qaeda and terrorist groups out of those safe havens ensuring that the taliban do not give them safe havens those goals should be foremost and any other goals we then attach to those should be secondary don t let them distract you from that primary goal margaret brennan and you think america got distracted gen mattis i i believe we did whether it was the war in iraq or we are back there and we re trying to do perhaps some people say too much in the country you have to embrace the culture you re in you don t surrender what we re about but you cannot walk in and say you re going to turn another culture around in a matter of a couple of years from things that they ve stood for over the generations so you just have to accept at times you have to have limited goals but you should not have limited resources you should put in whatever resources are necessary so when our diplomats negotiate they negotiate from a position of strength margaret brennan you have made clear that you will not speak ill of president trump you will not speak about him you say out of respect in your book you do talk about policy disagreements with past presidents that you served under with bush and with president obama as well with draw down from iraq you wrote about vice president biden and you said you were telling him what you were seeing on the ground in iraq and warning him of what a pullout would do you wrote he exuded the confidence of a man whose mind was made up perhaps even indifferent to considering the consequences were he judging the situation incorrectly gen mattis yes well i was writing a history book at that point margaret because i started writing this book in 2013 it was done pretty much by version five by 2017 had i known the former vice president was going to run for office i assure you i would not have probably been that that forthcoming why do i do that margaret brennan what should people understand about what you meant there were you raising questions about his judgment gen mattis i think the obama administration president obama s administration had made the decision to leave iraq despite what the intelligence community was telling us would happen they were very clear that an al qaeda associated group would rise that the iraqi government the iraqi people the iraqi nation was in a post combat pre reconciliation phase we needed to keep our influence there a little longer and draw down year by year not draw everyone out at one time the intelligence community was very clear they forecasted the rise of a group you and i know it as isis and we should have taken their advice on board margaret brennan do you think that your resignation did help to stop the withdrawal from syria because u s troops remain there now gen mattis well i ll i ll let the historians sort that out i i don t know what all went into the decision to reverse that that call the pull everyone out but i i i just i i can t answer that margaret brennan you write that pakistan is the most dangerous country in the world from your perspective gen mattis yes margaret brennan what is the biggest national security threat gen mattis i think the biggest national security threat can be broken into two segments one is external and clearly those nations russia and china that are trying to impose their authoritarian models and decisions over other countries whether it be in the south china sea or in the ukraine in parts of georgia that russia is occupied they ve mucked around in our elections so externally i would look at those two and that s why we rewrote the national defense strategy to acknowledge the reality of those nations not the nations we wanted to be dealing with but russia of putin the reality the russia president xi or excuse me the china president xi but internally my bigger concern is two fold it s it s our growing debt that we re going to transfer to the younger generation with seeming no fiscal discipline and more than that it s the it s the lack of friendliness it s the increasing contempt i see between americans who have different opinions i mean we re going to have to sit down and remember if we want this country to survive we re going to have to work together and and that there there s no way around that that s the way a democracy is set up so i would i would break it into those two fundamental difference threats right now margaret brennan on that note we will leave it there i think a lot of people would agree with you like everyone to be a little bit friendly these days one other thing before you go though i want to wish you a happy birthday gen mattis oh thank you margaret watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our
