 las vegas the republican presidential debates have become appointment television tens of millions of americans have tuned in to watch donald trump whack his unwieldy field of opponents pooh poohing jeb bush s energy level for example or disparaging rand paul s appearance so what happens if the biggest fireworks in the first democratic debate here tuesday night are over which candidates opposed the keystone xl pipeline first which would resurrect the glass steagall banking act or how each would pay for his or her higher education overhauls democrats expect the debate to be substantive and to set thecourse for an unexpectedly contentious nominating contest americans are either going to find a pleasing contrast to the rip roaring show republicans have put on or they re going to be bored senseless let s be honest donald trump truly is a ratings machine twenty three million people did not tune in to see marco rubio said paul begala a democratic strategist and an analyst on cnn which is airing tuesday s debate so unless the democrats can talk one of the kardashians into running don t expect the democrats ratings to approach the republicans for better or worse republicans have engaged a massive swath of the country with their first two debates which were watched by 25million and 23million people respectively by comparison the highest rated democratic presidential debate in 2008 when barack obama and hillary rodham clinton were locked in a battle royal drew 10 7million viewers even if some voters tuned in just to witness the spectacle that is trump s front running candidacy they now are familiar with many of the other gop candidates a test for democrats is whether clinton a former secretary of state and first lady and a cast of four challengers led by liberal insurgent sen bernie sanders i vt can generate the same level of interest in their primary campaign bernie sanders prepares for his national debate stage debut in the run up to tuesday s debate there are signs that they could on sunday there were 124 812 mentions of the democratic candidates on social media television and in newspapers by comparison there were 377 223 mentions of the republican candidates two days out from their sept 16 debate according to an analysis by zignal labs the washington post s analytics partner but the republican statistic is larger in part because it included many more candidates and came on a monday which tends to have more traffic than a sunday generally clinton and sanders have larger social media presences than any gop candidate other than trump according to zignal more people are talking about the democrats than about the republicans outside of trump said josh ginsberg zignal s co founder and chief executive the clinton sanders horse race is interesting to people as they prepare for their first face off clinton and sanders have signaled that they will wear velvet gloves each plans to focus on his or her own policy proposals and backgrounds drawing comparisons with each other wherever appropriate but avoiding the kind of direct personal attacks that have been so prominent in the republican race none of the democratic candidates is trump s equal in bombast and showmanship and unlike many of the republican candidates the democrats are downright predictable sanders will probably bring the most passion as he has all summer and fall while drawing massive crowds across the country clinton who earned a reputation as a steady and skilled debater in her 2008 campaign is by her nature cautious and is likely to display more competence than entertainment value two lesser known candidates former senator jim webb of virginia and former governor and senator lincoln chafee of rhode island tend to be understated the level of humility and seriousness in this debate will be stark compared to what has been happening in the republican debates and that s a good thing for our party said stephanie cutter a democratic strategist and veteran of president obama s campaigns the wild card could be former maryland governor martin o mal ley who is struggling to break out of the low single digits in polls and sees the fall debates as make or break opportunities on the campaign trail he has fired shots at clinton and he could do so on the debate stage second gop debate fiorina gets rave reviews as trump dominates airtime still anderson cooper the cnn anchor who will moderate tuesday s debate said he does not expect the democratic candidates to be willing to criticize one another too much he is preparing for a different kind of debate than the republicans have held i m always uncomfortable with that notion of setting people up in order to kind of promote some sort of a face off cooper said sunday on cnn s reliable sources i think these are all serious people this is a serious debate they want to talk about the issues and i want to give them an opportunity to do that cnn chief political correspondent dana bash and cnn en espa ol anchor juan carlos lopez will join cooper as questioners cnn anchor don lemon will ask questions submitted through facebook which is co sponsoring the debate the debate at the wynn las vegas luxury resort will begin at 8 30 p m eastern time and last two hours there are expected to be five candidates on stage should vice president biden enter the race before tuesday night he is pre qualified to appear at the debate his advisers have said he will not attend but cnn has a sixth lectern at the ready in case he springs a surprise harvard law professor lawrence lessig who says he has raised more than 1million from a devoted base of supporters but is polling at or below 1 percent was not invited the republicans who began the debate season with 17 candidates wisconsin gov scott walker and former texas governor rick perry have since dropped out have had to hold undercard debates just to fit everyone on stage steve schmidt a strategist on george w bush s and john mccain s presidential campaigns said the comparison between what he considers a vibrant republican debate stage and the democratic stage of five will not be favorable for the democrats the country s not yet had an opportunity to see the current field of democrats all on the stage together schmidt said certainly there is a high likelihood that the weaknesses of that field will become more apparent than they are today regardless cutter predicted that tuesday s debate will draw the kind of audience that counts most the voters who will be voting in the primaries will tune in she said the number of people tuning in to the republican debate it was more like watching a car wreck than choosing a president in an interview with the washington post last week trump was asked whether he thought the democratic debate would be as popular a show as the republican debates he gave a one word answer no why not because i m not in it trump said as they say donald trump has always been a big ratings machine
