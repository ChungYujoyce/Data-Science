 2016 the kentucky senator s presidential bid is showing few signs of life by daniel strauss 12 12 2015 10 38 pm est updated 12 13 2015 01 39 pm est rand paul is on the verge of being demoted to the undercard stage in the next republican presidential debate m scott mahaskey start typing the words is rand paul into google and the search engine s autocomplete function fills in the rest of the question still running for president the answer of course is yes but barely indeed if paul were a patient on the operating table he d be flatlining right now by nearly every measure the kentucky senator s white house bid is struggling to find a pulse advertisement paul seemed to be on the verge of being demoted to the undercard stage in the next republican presidential debate the result of poll numbers that haven t moved above single digits since the summer but on sunday it was announced he would be included he isn t faring much better in state polls either a wbur poll in new hampshire released friday found him at 4 percent in the gop field up just 1 point from late october when wbur last released a survey and down from earlier in november the latest bloomberg politics des moines register poll out saturday found him at 3 percent in iowa down 2 points from october now amid growing speculation that paul s presidential bid will soon come to an end his campaign has been forced to insist that he isn t dropping out and that he really does belong on the main debate stage on tuesday the challenge from day one for rand paul has always been expanding his support outside of his father s network said michael dennehy referring to 2012 candidate ron paul dennehy who ran sen john mccain s successful presidential political operation in new hampshire sees few signs that paul has met that challenge the picture is similarly grim in iowa another early contest that at the very beginning of the 2016 presidential cycle seemed ripe for paul s libertarian flavored message but the younger paul is averaging just 3 2 percent in the state s polling and republican observers there are skeptical that he can tap some hidden reservoir of support there just doesn t seem to be much excitement for him out here in iowa said eric woolson who served as a top iowa adviser for wisconsin gov scott walker and who is now neutral it just seems like among the activists there doesn t seem to be much interest from them none of this is due to an absent paul political operation since the last republican presidential debate on nov 10 he s held more than 26 campaign events six of which were in kentucky where the senator is also running for reelection and just finished another handful of events in new hampshire over the weekend the pro paul super pac concerned american voters which is not blessed by the campaign unlike america s liberty pac has been especially active in volunteer organizing and voter outreach in iowa but paul s presidential campaign hasn t run a television ad in nearly three months and has not yet reserved any air time this year or next year a reflection of his dire financial straits his last redoubt of support social media is not looking so strong either paul s facebook numbers have barely budged while those of his rivals have surged along with their popularity between sept 10 and oct 10 for instance paul was the topic of conversation among 1 509 000 people on facebook and saw 4 586 000 interactions an aggregation of likes posts comments and shares on a candidate s page between nov 8 and dec 8 facebook counted 1 569 000 people and 4 402 000 interactions for paul by comparison sen ted cruz amid a dramatic surge of support in iowa was counting 4 095 000 people and 18 708 000 interactions on facebook up from 2 846 000 people and 11 742 000 interactions in october by daniel strauss paul was already having difficulty making his dovish case on foreign policy to skeptical republican voters and then the paris and san bernardino california attacks happened a cnn orc poll conducted right before the san bernardino shooting found that just 1 percent of those surveyed said paul could best handle the islamic state and 3 percent said that paul would make the best president on foreign policy i just don t think there are as many people in the republican party who share his isolationist views of the world as he may have thought or as there were a year ago said the campaign manager for a rival republican candidate who s aligned more closely with republican hawks i think that events have proven out that his view is incorrect then there s money paul raised just 2 5 million in the most recently reported fundraising quarter barely enough to keep the lights on and down from 7 million in the previous quarter i think the biggest indication of how rand paul is doing is the next fundraising report observed dennehy adding that previous reports haven t been great but if the next one isn t better the handwriting s on the wall the first deathwatch story was written in june and we ve outlasted several candidates who ve dropped out and we continue to survive a top paul aide insisted we ve got a lean operation rand seems to attract big crowds we ve got great organization but it seems unlikely that paul can rebound he s actually grown less popular among gop voters as the race has dragged on in the most recent wbur poll in new hampshire for instance 53 percent of those surveyed said they had an unfavorable opinion of him up from 46 percent in the previous poll i think once you ve been considered top tier and you fall below that it s so difficult to get back into that top tier said woolson there s probably this sentiment that we ve given him a look and we ve moved on to someone else steven shepard contributed to this report missing
