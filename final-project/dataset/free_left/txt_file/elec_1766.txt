child rapist and playing a major role in the whitewater and benghazi scandals a democratic email highlights donald trump s proposed ban on muslim immigrants stand with us and denounce donald trump s bigoted plan congressional republicans and democrats may despise the other party s pick for the white house but let s face it trump and clinton are great for business the business that is of raising huge sums of money for the battle to control the senate and house in 2017 advertisement both republican and democratic congressional fundraising committees see major monetary promise in the other party s candidates for the right clinton s endless cloud of controversies from whitewater to the ongoing fbi investigation of her email practices as secretary of state offers a gold mine for their cash operations ditto for the left and trump s comments about deporting hispanics banning muslims and punishing women who ve had abortions each side says the specter of the other s presumed nominee has already been critical to priming the financial pump national republican congressional committee web pages mentioning clinton for example are bringing in 44 percent more in revenue than pages without her officials say and democratic congressional campaign committee chairman ben ray luj n believes trump s primary romp in the first quarter of this year is a key reason his outfit raised 25 million a record he said for the first part of a presidential campaign cycle with trump as the front runner the dccc has seen a major spike in grass roots enthusiasm and donations the new mexico democrat said in an interview trump at the top of the ticket provides a greater opportunity to gain seats our supporters are more engaged and generous to ensure democrats have the resources necessary to win republican fundraising committees weeks ago started trumpeting the most controversial parts of clinton s past even highlighting years old but sensitive issues like her defense of an accused child rapist as a criminal defense attorney early in her career by nolan d mccaskill she s a living history of scandal lies and spin says the narrator in a new national republican senatorial committee video set to dramatic music and a thudding background heartbeat defended an accused child rapist then laughed about his lenient sentence whitewater travel gate china gate file gate she politically attacked sexual harassment victims democrat senate candidates she is your burden to bear that video is tucked into an nrsc email blasted out sunday asking to show that you re neverhillary with your donation of just 3 or more today another nrcc email to donors wednesday lists another series of clinton controversies benghazi coverup sending classified information through her private unsecured email server improper ties between the clinton foundation and state department contracts when is enough enough nrcc spokeswoman katie martin said internal committee data confirm clinton s effect on donors more than 60 percent of all nrcc sales are for items such as bumper stickers branded hill no and emails that mention clinton have a 10 percent higher engagement rate than ones that don t nrcc officials told politico another sure tell the nrcc s second best online fundraising day last year was the day clinton announced her candidacy for president and now the committee has a record amount of cash on hand 50 million more than in any presidential election cycle before nrcc chairman greg walden r ore said clinton s politics are as much of a factor as her controversies with many viewing her candidacy as a continuation of the obama administration the whole clinton history is such that just as minority leader nancy pelosi has motivated our bases because she has such a liberal agenda set i think hillary clinton is going to be right there with her walden said our supporters don t want to see the obama philosophy perpetuated for another four years democrats are similarly finding that invoking trump opens wallets in the period since the new york mogul won the new hampshire primary on feb 9 the campaign arm has raised nearly 1 5 million just from emails that focus on him officials said the dccc tapped muslim rep keith ellison d minn personally to send an email to donors just hours after trump first came out with his pitch to ban muslim immigration last december 2016 by annie karni was i shocked when donald trump called for a ban on muslims entering america sadly no ellison wrote that s why i m asking you to take a stand denounce the republicans anti muslim bigotry right away months later they re still offering stop bigotry stickers to donors who respond to online solicitations democrats have also raise money off of trump s success after the manhattan mogul won the new york primary on april 19 for example the dccc asked supporters for money to stop the former reality tv star from making it to the white house after donald trump s huge victory in new york last night one thing is clear we cannot allow him to be our president the email read we need 150 000 in the door by midnight tonight to fight back will you chip in 5 to defeat republicans lujan said linking trump to hill republicans is an easy call in part because he believes trump s comments are putting a national spotlight on house republicans extreme tea party positions donors want to beat trump but also house republicans that are spewing similar divisive anti women anti immigrant positions that have helped pave the way for his rise he said trump however may be giving a boost to house republicans too many republican donors walden said fear that clinton will beat trump and democrats will take the senate that would make the house the last bulwark against a democratic controlled washington the nrcc head said there s certainly a large donor block that is very committed to making sure we maintain a majority of the house because they realize the senate is a bit tenuous and the white house is clearly in play as well he said the house is the backstop guarantee you can invest in and secure so we re finding that while donors may have fatigue elsewhere they re bought into our
