on this face the nation broadcast moderated by margaret brennan clickhereto browse full transcripts of face the nation margaret brennan it s sunday july 14th i m margaret brennan and this is face the nation tensions are high this sunday morning after president trump announced a crackdown on undocumented migrants in cities across the country president donald trump people come into our country illegally we re taking them out legally it s very simple margaret brennan as the political battle over how to handle migrants seeking asylum in the u s and what to do about the deplorable conditions at some detention centers gets even more divisive elizabeth warren no great nation tears families apart margaret brennan vice president mike pence toured detention facilities in mcallen texas friday defending immigration officials treatment of detainees mike pence are they taking good care of you here man 1 speaking foreign language mike pence do you have enough to eat man 2 speaking foreign language margaret brennan but even he concedes man 3 we are not a terrorist margaret brennan it s a crisis situation that needs urgent attention mike pence to be honest with you i was not surprised by what i saw this is tough stuff margaret brennan can leaders put politics aside to fix the broken immigration system man 4 we are forty days here we haven t taken a shower for forty days margaret brennan we ll talk with acting head of the customs and border protection agency mark morgan plus the number two democrat in the senate richard durbin and former homeland security secretary jeh johnson neil armstrong that s one small step for man one giant leap for mankind margaret brennan and as cbs news launches a week of network wide coverage of the fiftieth anniversary of the apollo 11 mission to the moon we ll look back at how we got there plus we ll talk with nasa administrator jim bridenstine about what s ahead for space exploration in the next fifty years and beyond it s all coming up on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation as we come on the air residents and local officials in nine major u s cities are preparing for agents from the immigrations and customs enforcement agency commonly known as ice to round up immigrants who have either missed a court appearance or who have been ordered removed from the united states we begin today with mark morgan he is the acting commissioner of u s customs and border protection cbp which enforces immigration law and patrols the u s border good morning to you commissioner mark morgan acting commissioner of u s customs and border protection cbpmarkmorgan good morning thanks for having me margaret brennan i understand you re at cbp you were previously at ice the president has said those who will be arrested today will either be put in prison or sent back what can you tell us about how many people will be rounded up and where they ll go mark morgan so the the numbers are really going to be left up to ice and so i really want to try to stay away from the operational details specifically focus on the numbers or cities or where they re going to be going out but again i think what we need to do part of this this narrative is we need to be intellectually honest when we re going forward with this is that the individuals that ice goes after and they do this every single day are not individuals that are here undocumented they re individuals that are here illegally and in this case their priority has always been and it will be to go after those that are criminal aliens meaning those people that are here illegally and have and have committed additional crimes against american citizens but also part of that priority is to also go after and and apply consequences and enforce the rule of law to those individuals who had due process and received a final order of removal from a judge and they still remain here illegally to to maintain integrity in the system we have to apply cuts consequences to everyone margaret brennan so can you say though whether there will be family separations if someone is arrested their children come home either they re u s born or they re just coming home to find a parent who is now in detention what happens can you avoid that situation mark morgan so of of course the the design is not about family separation that s not the intent never has been and never will be the intent is to enforce margaret brennan can you avoid it mark morgan the rule of law there there are challenges absolutely but i can tell you the men and women of ice they are true american heroes they they re mothers they are fathers brothers and sisters they re going to apply this with with humanity and compassion there s a whole host of scenarios that could go i ll give you an example for one if they run across a mother who came here illegally had due process had a order removal but she s currently in her third trimester of pregnancy of of course they re not going to apprehend that individual they re going to give her a a paper a notice to appear and and then come back later when it s appropriate margaret brennan where will these people go because as we ve been talking about and in the facilities you run there s this crisis of overcrowding is ice putting these people in centers that are already overcrowded as well mark morgan no so and and i m glad you asked that question because there s a lot of confusion with respect to the holding facilities that customs and border protection hold that are meant just kind of like a police station they re not meant to be nor they were ever designed to be long term holding facilities ice the facilities that they have are and so families for example will go to family residential centers that are specifically designed to house families on a longer term basis and it s a very different environment than what you ll see from a cbp border patrol holding facility margaret brennan president obama deported about three million people president bush about two million president trump s far below that but there is this question of why these arrests are happening now at a time when you have been talking about overcrowding at a time when you re in the middle of a re election campaign it seems to be to many critics politically motivated mark morgan so i can t take speak to you from from a political side i can speak to you from a law enforcement side and i can tell you margaret one of the largest incentives pull factors for these people is you grab a kid that is your passport into the country and once you get in the country you re allowed to stay if we don t apply interior enforcement action consequences to those that have received due process margaret brennan right but why mark morgan they ve received an idle order margaret brennan did the president announce it this is a law enforcement action he announced mark morgan you you ll have to ask the president on that but all is i can tell you is i support this one hundred percent this is a an essential consequence that we need to apply to help take that element away that pull factor so they ll stop making the dangerous trek and risking their lives margaret brennan mm hm the president this morning put out a series of tweets that i want to read to you or part of he suggested that foreign born female members of congress need to quote go back to quote the places from which they came who is the president talking about and how is this helpful if you re trying to get democrats in congress to work with you mark morgan again you re going to have to ask the president what he means by those specific tweets margaret brennan you don t know who he is talking about mark morgan i i i think that you need to talk to the president about his specific tweets what what i what i will tell you is that we absolutely have a crisis on the border one hundred percent and congress i i can tell you unequivocally congress has failed to do what they need to do to adjust this crisis we ve been pleading with them our for a long time and we ve been on the hill asking for a long time you fix the floor settlement agreement margaret brennan mm hm mark morgan you fix the tvpra catch and release and eighty five percent of this crisis ends the next day that s what we need congress to do on a bipartisan effort margaret brennan which is why i asked you if it was helpful or not to make comments like that let me ask you about what s happening in some of the facilities that you oversee today the president also tweeted there have been great reviews of children s detention centers we know the vice president went down and toured multiple facilities one of them being a children s center the house oversight committee this week released a report saying there are at least still thirty children separated from their parents for more than a year who haven t been reunited with them and have not been released to somebody else to take care of them so do you understand why facts like that make it hard for anyone in congress democrats say to trust the administration with holding children in detention or potentially for longer periods of time as some are proposing mark morgan so what what i would say is facts matter all the way around neither does the rhetoric that s out there that s absolutely false that that margaret brennan but this is a house oversight report mark morgan again you said facts are important and i m saying i agree facts are important just just margaret brennan you agree that that is a fact this thirty the thirty children who continue to be separated mark morgan yes we we ve been margaret brennan okay mark morgan talking about that for a long time and again they re they re making progress to reunite those families that happened a long time ago but again what what we re talking about now let s talk about facts and the facts are that that we ve been asking congress for a very long time for the supplemental for example right because we ve agreed that children should not be in facilities that border patrol have they re holding facilities they were never designed for kids margaret brennan that s the four and a half billion that was just approved mark morgan yes yes ma am and so so the four and a half billion we ve been asking three and a half billion that went to hhs i i m not in that department but yet i am asking for the supplemental to to get hhs the funding they need so the children for example could get out of the border patrol holding facilities where they don t belong we were we were asking that for months and congress sat on their hands margaret brennan right mark morgan and didn t provide that funding margaret brennan well that funding you do have now the vice president said mark morgan and it s working margaret brennan on this mark morgan and it s working margaret brennan on this program two weeks ago that some of these some of these conditions are unacceptable we have video of the tour that he went on as well where he saw where men are being held different facility than where the children are and i want to read from the pool report written by washington post josh dawsey he said the cages were so crowded it would have been impossible for all of the men to lie in the concrete there were three hundred and eighty four single men in the portal no mats or pillows some sleeping on concrete when they saw the press arrive the men began shouting and wanted to tell us they d been in there forty days or longer they were hungry and wanted to brush their teeth it was sweltering hot agents were wearing face masks are these acceptable conditions mark morgan so first of all the the way to describe those conditions i would not describe them as as they were described but but even even so margaret brennan this was the video mark morgan no you you re margaret brennan this is the video and this is a reporter s eyewitness account mark morgan right so i i would not consider that swelteringingly sic hot i was there alongside the vice president when i was there but make no mistake was it overcrowded absolutely but margaret we ve been saying that for a very long time that these conditions are overcrowded margaret brennan so you agree it s unacceptable mark morgan oh absolutely it s unacceptable and and margaret brennan so what are you doing to change those conditions now mark morgan so margaret brennan as you said that funding has been approved mark morgan okay but but this is very important though is this could have been prevented in in a couple of ways had congress given the funding earlier than than when we ask it would have helped alleviate some of the overcrowding margaret brennan but now mark morgan the other thing right now is we re con continuing to ask congress we need legislative fix we need congress to act right now margaret brennan mm hm mark morgan senator lindsey graham has a bill that he s trying to push forward right now that would absolutely overnight help eliminate that what you saw when we went down there with the vice president congress needs to act they know it margaret brennan yes mark morgan and they re failing to do so margaret brennan we re going to talk to senator dick durbin next thank you commissioner who is working with senator graham whose legislation you mentioned there margaret brennan senator durbin joins us from chicago good morning to you senator senator dick durbin d illinois senatordurbin democratic whip good morning margaret margaret brennan you re in one of the cities where these ice arrests are expected to happen what are you seeing out there what are you hearing senator dick durbin i m hearing two things the fear level in the community particularly in the hispanic community i ve never seen it at a higher level just this last friday i was handed this note by a a young girl who is a high school student her name is guadalupe she couldn t read it to me she broke down crying but she basically says in here is i don t want to live in fear and i don t want to lose my mother and father they ve been here working hard they never broke the law they just want to be part of the future of this city this country and give me a chance the second thing that i m feeling across this community is a mobilization a belief that we are all in this together that we re going to stand together in support of families just like this margaret brennan yeah senator dick durbin who simply want a chance to be part of america s future margaret brennan senator you said that many of these people haven t broken the law according to ice ninety percent of migrants they arrest have a criminal conviction criminal charges or they have illegally re entered the country after being removed are you arguing that law enforcement shouldn t be enforcing the law as it is written senator dick durbin i will just tell you this if someone has come to this country and broken the law they ve disqualified themselves as far as i am concerned for staying in this country margaret brennan by entering illegally though by definition they have broken the law whether it s criminal senator dick durbin well of course margaret brennan or civil infraction is a matter for debate senator dick durbin yes but that s that s a significant difference and even mister morgan went to that point he said if there was an additional criminal violation i feel the same way about a serious criminal violation they ve disqualified themselves but what we re finding is as we did with the zero tolerance policy the simple fact of crossing the border and perhaps having a technical legal violation at that point is being used as a basis for deportation of people who otherwise have nothing in their background or nothing in their record that s a danger to us that s when you get into trouble that s when you start not only deporting people who may be serious offenders but innocent people who are trying to lead a good life here and want to have a chance that s the difference margaret brennan senator president trump tweeted this morning that female democrat congresswomen who are foreign born he suggests should go back to where they came from what do these comments do to your attempts to work across the aisle do you consider that a racist tweet senator dick durbin i could just tell you that when we are dealing with mass arrests and mass deportation and that kind of careless rhetoric by the president it doesn t help one bit my mother was an immigrant to this country and brought here by my grandparents from lithuania under the control of tsarist russia do i fit into the president s category i m going to stick with the united states as my mother did and my brothers did trying to make this a better country and i say the same for these members of congress and i think there is only one in particular he s pointing to the fact that they went through refugee camps came to the united states clawed their way into an existence and eventually were elected thank goodness that is part of what america holds as a dream for people around the world and the president should not diminish it margaret brennan why we talk about you trying to work across the aisle why didn t you go on this tour with republicans and the vice president down to see the border facilities on friday senator dick durbin i ve been there i was just there eight weeks ago in the el paso area i m going to return in the next week i i watched as this group was in formation and it became apparent to me it was more about public relations than really getting down to serious policy discussions i m going to continue margaret brennan well we ve shown the video and not all of it is necessarily favorable to the administration wouldn t it have been helpful for you to be there alongside republicans to make the statement that you are working across the aisle or trying to senator dick durbin well senator lindsey graham republican and chairman of the judiciary committee and i are still in serious conversation about dealing with the policy we will continue to i have been there i m going back i think the circumstances which are shown in the video were bad what i saw were even worse these kids in cages were not part of the video i can understand that there s sensitivity to exposing them to public review but the fact is it s happening and america is rejecting this approach by the trump administration they don t want to see more with these mass arrests and deportations margaret brennan mm hm senator dick durbin families split apart now listen to this we re hearing from the administration the serious humanitarian challenges at the border those are going to be multiplied now by these ice raids across the united states as families are divided and young people are sent to more detention facilities it is not going to make it any better margaret brennan you the the administration says that the work you and senator graham are doing essentially the only game in town you said there are at least five or six areas of common ground that democrats in the senate and the house could support what are they senator dick durbin well i can give you several of them right off the top my head first unlike the president we happen to believe that we need to have foreign assistance to these three countries in central america it s the only only hope we have to stabilize the situation so fewer people are exiting trying to find their way into the united states secondly when it comes to the transporters and smugglers come down on them like a ton of bricks i have no sympathy for human traffickers wherever they may be stiffer penalties more enforcement i am for it more immigration court judges of course a faster process for hearing of these cases particularly those involving children of course we ought to reinstate what obama had and that was in the embassies of these three countries we could have young people and perhaps adults as well applying for asylum in country not making that dangerous expensive trip to the united states border margaret brennan but it if they re endangered in the country that they are fleeing from how does applying for asylum from that same country protect them senator dick durbin you put your finger on one of the flaws in what i have just said we answer it by saying if we can find a place in mexico for example maybe under united nations supervision where there is a safe venue for them to apply for asylum status in the united states i am open to that conversation but we have to understand and i d state representative delia ramirez just came back from guatemala she and i met this this weekend the situation is desperate in that country the people have nowhere to turn gangs extortion threats of of rape and murder that are going on constantly they are going to risk their lives because they know staying in guatemala margaret brennan mm hm senator dick durbin in many circumstances is deadly margaret brennan senator durbin thank you very much we will be back in one minute with former homeland security secretary jeh johnson announcements margaret brennan secretary jeh johnson served in the obama administration and he joins us from new york this morning good morning to you mister secretary president obama jeh johnson former secretary of homeland security good morning margaret brennan deported three million migrants from the united states you were secretary at that time how is what president trump is trying to do any different jeh johnson well first margaret i have to say mister morgan ducked your question about the president s tweet i will not i cannot believe a president of the united states would make a statement about foreign born members of congress suggesting they they go back from where they from where they came from and what the president needs to appreciate in addition to it being offensive you are undermining your very own administration s efforts at working with congress constructively on what mister morgan referred to as needed legislative fixes and so americans should not become numb to this kind of of language and and offensive statements and we need to work with congress and the executive branch in order to get anything done so in the obama administration certainly the last few years i served as secretary of homeland security we prioritized from within the interior deporting those who are convicted felons you have to also have as a priority those apprehended at the border for the sake of border security but the number of deportations over time in the obama administration actually went down while the percentage of those deported who were convicted felons and who were in local jails went up and it it s all about enforcing our immigration laws but in a way that is fair and humane and promotes public safety and that was our priority and on day one of this margaret brennan mm hm jeh johnson administration the president literally tore up those priorities margaret brennan the president jeh johnson and so now margaret brennan the president jeh johnson you re seeing these these ex margaret brennan sorry go ahead jeh johnson go ahead sorry margaret brennan the president some in his administration have said there re up to one million migrants that have pending orders of removal against them is is it realistic to say that many people can be deported jeh johnson no it is not and it s important for people to know their rights in this circumstance if someone from ice ero comes to someone s home unless they have a warrant that person is not required to to admit them they have a right to remain silent they have a right to a lawyer and they should not be deported from this country unless there has been a final order of deportation by an immigration judge after the individuals had an opportunity to go through the appellate process and make whatever claims for asylum they they have and so there must be a final order of removal very often if someone s ordered deported in absentia without being present in court they have a right to a rehearing and so it s important for people particularly today and over the next week to know exactly what their rights are margaret brennan we ve been talking about the conditions at facilities detention facilities of many forms under the trump administration i want to show an image of you touring a facility in arizona back in 2014 jeh johnson mm hm margaret brennan president trump often refers to the language referring to these chain linked fence dividers cages as some call them as unique that the obama administration is doing though all of this in a way that he just had to continue that he is doing things essentially the same way he inherited the policy what s so different jeh johnson well there are a number of things different margaret first there was no zero tolerance policy in the obama administration we did not separate families as a policy and practice and the photograph you showed i remembered that visit well it was arizona it was june 2014 during the spike we had then though the numbers were not as high as they are now and under the law if you have an unaccompanied child cross the border dhs within seventy two hours is required to turn that child over to to hhs and in that seventy two hour period we needed to have places like the one we set up temporarily in arizona to to house the kids until they could be placed with hhs and the partitions you see some call them cages are meant to separate the the women from from the men the girls from the boys but these were temporary what that photograph doesn t show is i probably spent half my time at that facility actually inside those fenced in areas talking to the the young boys and girls about their situation and about the conditions margaret brennan all right secretary johnson thank you for your time we ll be back in a moment don t go away announcements margaret brennan fifty years ago this week cbs s walter cronkite reported on the historic journey of apollo 11 from blast off to putting a man on the moon we will commemorate that anniversary all week long across all cbs news platforms including a prime time special tuesday night at 10 00 pm eastern anchored by norah o donnell cbsn and cbs news radio will also re air cronkite s coverage of the liftoff on tuesday in real time announcements margaret brennan some of our stations are leaving us now but we will be right back with a lot more face the nation including a look at what s ahead for the network this week as we honor that fiftieth anniversary of the apollo 11 launch and landing but our panel is up next so stay with us announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation it is time now for some political analysis from our panel ben domenech is the founder and publisher of the federalist and kelsey snell is a congressional reporter for npr and toluse olorunnipa one of these days i m going to get it right covers the white house for the washington post toluse help me how do i say your last name better toluse olorunnipa washington post toluseo olorunnipa margaret brennan olorunnipa i think i said it once correct but we re so glad to have you back here i want to start off with the tweet that the president series of them that the president put out this morning targeting members of congress specifically female members who he says he doesn t name them but says should go back to where they came from toluse this reaction is what i mean we re putting up on screen four individuals only one of whom was foreign born it seems to be who the president is suggesting should go home toluse olorunnipa yeah jeh johnson said earlier that we shouldn t get numb to this type of rhetoric we have actually gotten somewhat numb to this type of rhetoric from the president because it s par for the course this is the type of campaigning he is going to do in advance of 2020 sort of promoting division promoting divisive messages he wants this election to be about immigration if you look at the citizenship question if you look at these raids that are going on if you look at this tweet about you know congresswomen who for the most part are american are actually all of them are american citizens most most of them are actually american born the president wants to sort of use division as a tool for his re election and his supporters will say you know don t parse the president s words he s making the argument that you know all of these people are privileged to be in the best country on earth and they shouldn t be so negative about the country but one thing he s doing is actually uniting what was a very fractured democratic caucus with nancy pelosi speaking out negatively about some of these congresswomen some of them pushing back over the last week and you ve seen her come out with a tweet sort of coming to their defense and and going against the president he is sort of the best unifier for the democrats and by inserting himself into his argument he is making some of those fights from the past be much less of the part of the focus and now they re trying to unify and figure out how they can take him on margaret brennan mm hm ben i was looking online after the president said this and there are a number of members of congress who are foreign born many of them who actually are allies of the president ben domenech the federalist bdomenech mm margaret brennan this targeting of these individuals has been suggested it is a flat out racist attack ben domenech i don t margaret brennan will republicans see it that way ben domenech i don t know that they ll see it necessarily that way though i do think that you know in this context i mean the only one of these four members of congress that you re talking about who was foreign born is ilhan omar who is obviously herself engaged in some of the most violent rhetoric when it comes to anti semitic speech and the like in ways that have you know obviously come up in the congress before in ways that i think have frustrated speaker pelosi the fact is that this week we found a real gift for the president in terms of the animosity that was being aired between some of these more progressive members of the conference and the speaker herself and i think when the president engages in this kind of behavior it it undoes to your point a lot of the the assistance that he is getting from the fractious nature of of these backs back and forth between more extreme members of the sort of left wing of the democratic caucus and those who want to run a more centrist campaign one that is about restoring normalcy to political life in america which is certainly you know the main thrust of the margaret brennan mm hm ben domenech biden campaign and others and others who want to achieve that kind of message i don t think that this is a situation where the president is doing himself any favors margaret brennan kelsey when earlier in the week before the president tweeted this alexandria ocasio cortez said that the speaker by singling her out along with the squad not naming them but in a different interview prior in the week prior had talked about them not holding with the caucus and voting with leadership on specific issue related to immigration is any singling out of these individuals who do have death threats against them going to continue to to be a theme and and a dangerous one kelsey snell npr kelsey snell well pelosi later said she wasn t really trying to single out those specific people she was trying to single out division in the party whether or not that s read that way by the people who support these the the four women that we mentioned is another question altogether i think margaret brennan aoc said it was targeting women of color kelsey snell and she yes and she did do a little bit of cleanup afterwards talking to reporters saying she thought this was all over and was trying to move on though we saw on twitter over the weekend that that wasn t necessarily the case the fight kind of continued to play out i think the question is whether or not the people who are directly involved in this are ready to move on we i i think that in you know as ben said it would be a really big gift to democrats to have the president intervening here but the activists who support the more progressive members aren t really ready to move on we saw that at the netroots conference they are upset and it will be up to democrats to find a new way to move forward and to find a new way to talk to one another and you know in some ways they have to do it quickly margaret brennan mm hm kelsey snell because they re about to go out on august recess and not be in washington for over a month and that amount of time when these people are back at home talking to their constituents really often changes kind of the path of congress for the year margaret brennan ben i asked you if you what do you think republicans will do about the president s tweet ben domenech mm hm margaret brennan i mean the the usual answer is oh i didn t see it can republicans claim that they didn t see these series of tweets from the president that many do consider to be racist should they be distancing themselves from it ben domenech well i mean i don t think they can claim that realistically i mean you know we we play all sorts of games i mean this is kind of like those those comments from you know athletes that they don t listen to sports talk radio you know you you can t really believe that on its on its face but again i think that the the context here is one where democrats have a real division within their party between those who want to run a more centrist campaign in 2020 one that is more much more likely to win and to take back the white house and those who are sort of newly woke who are much more radical on a lot of these different subjects and who want a much more aggressive progressive agenda in response to what they view as the overreach of of president trump and his administration i think that s a a divide that isn t going to be solved in in a very quick term and to kelsey s point it kind of needs to be margaret brennan mm hm ben domenech because they need to be united on this front in order to take him on margaret brennan but in terms of political usefulness toluse this this overlay of the president s rhetoric and the context in which what should be as many would argue standard law enforcement operations like these arrests it changes the tone about everything and it comes at a time when the president is running for re election immigration being one of the key platforms is that the prism through which everything should be seen right now toluse olorunnipa yeah you have margaret brennan is that the motivation for the raids toluse olorunnipa you have to look at all of this from the 2020 point of view i mean these raids may have happened either way but the president decided to go out in front of it and tweet about it and sort of make it into this big thing where he talks about millions of people being brought out of the country he wants to show his base which he believes is going to be the determining factor of this election that he is doing everything possible to fulfill his promises whether it s the wall whether it s putting up question about citizenship on the census you know overruling his legal department and the justice department and and try trying to fight for the citizenship question on the census he wants to constantly be showing his base that he is turning up the notch and doing as much as possible on this immigration issue because the images that are coming out of the southern border for him is actually an image of failure that he said ben domenech mm hm toluse olorunnipa he was going to clean up the the border he was going to stop people from coming across he was going to build a wall and now we re seeing record numbers of families coming across and it s a it s a a sign of failure of his administration not being able to do things now he can talk about the democrats not margaret brennan mm hm toluse olorunnipa not helping but when he said that he was going to fix this problem in 2016 he is having to campaign on the same issue in 2020 ben domenech margaret he is doing this because he s failed in that in those respects he promised a wall he promised a crackdown in all these different ways and the fact is that this administration has shown us margaret brennan mm hm ben domenech how much they have stumbled over their own message how much they have stumbled over their own policy in so many respects including having acting people in these various jobs who can t actually drive the train on policy and this is a way to try to make up for that but it s it s going to be something where he s going to have to convince his own base that he hasn t failed in this respect and i think that s going to be a hard act margaret brennan and sixteen total that was what we tallied up here in terms of acting officials whether they be secretaries cabinet level mem members agency heads sixteen total just acting not actually confirmed not officially in the job kelsey does the president have any incentive or ability to get these nominees confirmed kelsey snell he certainly has the ability and republicans in the senate that i talked to say they would like very much to have their you know their role of advising consent returned to them by this president but it doesn t help him he he enjoys the acting secretaries he said that many times before margaret brennan he said that in an interview in february with us kelsey snell and he he says it gives him more flexibility now the senators the one that when you talk to them say that this is not good for the way the country functions it s not good for you know keeping the separation of powers but they don t have much power to take back you know the the the advice and consent role they have done a lot over margaret brennan mm hm kelsey snell many many many years if not decades to cede power to the executive and there are a lot of people i talked to republicans included who have a lot of questions about why they did that and margaret brennan yeah kelsey snell you know where they can go from here margaret brennan we have to leave the conversation there but good to talk to the three of you today we will be back in a moment announcements walter cronkite from houston texas in color a special one hour version of face the nation the first exclusive television interview with the apollo 11 crew who returned on thursday from the nationwide tour celebrating their historic first steps on the moon millions in new york chicago and los angeles turned out to greet the returning space pioneers margaret brennan that was walter cronkite anchoring our broadcast back on august 17 1969 almost fifty years later we are joined by nasa administrator jim bridenstine thank you and good morning jim bridenstine nasa administrator jimbridenstine good morning it s great to be here margaret brennan this is an incredible anniversary week for nasa jim bridenstine it is margaret brennan the last man to walk on the moon was 1972 jim bridenstine jack gene cernan yes margaret brennan yeah you you get an a tell me though about your plans for artemis the plan to put humans back on the moon just five years from now jim bridenstine that s right so we want to go back to the moon sustainably in other words to stay but we also want to keep our eye on what is president trump s goal what is his vision he wants to put an american flag on mars so we go to the moon so that we can learn how to live and work on another world and ultimately have more access to the solar system than ever before so that we can get no kidding to mars but here s i think the important point about artemis specifically in the 1960s we we love apollo what an amazing program a contest of great powers the united states of america in the cold war and of course we came out on top but i think the important thing is in those days all of our astronauts came from test pilots and fighter pilots and there were no opportunities for women today under the artemis program we have a very diverse highly qualified astronaut corps that includes women and artemis in greek mythology happens to be the twin sister of apollo so now when we go back to the moon and she was the goddess of the moon by the way so now when we go back to the moon we go with all of america and i think that s a great message margaret brennan so the first steps in 2024 will be by women jim bridenstine that s the goal margaret brennan a female astronaut jim bridenstine yes margaret brennan but all of this requires a a rocket that s never flown a space capsule that hasn t flown a lunar lander hasn t even been designed yet given the track record how realistic is that five year timeline jim bridenstine so the way i talk about this there s two risks there s technical risk and then there s political risk we would be on the moon right now if it weren t for the political risk we would be on mars quite frankly by now had it not been for the political risk but as you ve identified we did sixteen margaret brennan what do you mean political risk you mean funding jim bridenstine i m talking about funding so in the past in the 1990s and in the early 2000s we made efforts to go back to the moon and on to mars and in each case the program was too long it took too too long and too much money what the president said is in order to retire the political risk we want to go faster we want to go within five years the vice president delivered a message at the national space council and he said we want to go back to the moon within five years then they amended the president s budget request to give us the resources margaret brennan mm hm jim bridenstine necessary to make it a reality and that s where we are margaret brennan but then the president tweeted nasa should not be talking about going to the moon we did that fifty years ago we should be focused on much bigger things is he fully onboard with what you just laid out jim bridenstine a hundred percent i talked to him after that tweet i wanted to make sure we were in alignment we absolutely are he understands and in fact he said to me i know we ve got to go to the moon to get to mars but he said what is that generational achievement that will inspire all of americans it s putting an american flag on mars he said make sure you re committed to the to the flag on mars margaret brennan you said before you believe in science and you believe that humankind is contributing to climate change have you suggested some kind of major earth initiative what is nasa doing about the planet we are currently living on jim bridenstine so what nasa s job is is to study the earth and every part of the electromagnetic spectrum and we have been doing that we continue to do that and we share that data with the entire world and we do it for free to the entire world margaret brennan and you share that with president trump who has been a skeptic of jim bridenstine it s available margaret brennan human contribution to climate change jim bridenstine it s it s available to the entire world for free it s online anybody can have access to it and of course margaret brennan does he believe you when you lay this out to him jim bridenstine so i m i m one agency there are other agencies in the federal government epa noaa others when i talk to the president i am talking about space exploration in general margaret brennan mm hm jim bridenstine but we do have a role to study the earth and it is changing and the president is very committed to clean water and clean air know this nasa is spending as much money on studying the earth as we ever have and of course when you look at the comparison between what we re investing in studying the earth and what others are investing look at all of our partners on the international space station fifteen countries the european space agency russia canada japan we are spending as much as the rest of them combined margaret brennan america s rivalry with the soviet union helped to fuel some of the initiative fifty years ago do you see a scenario where either china s feeling that for the united states or there is the chance to partner with china jim bridenstine so quite frankly at this point neither one of those but you re right apollo was a contest of great powers we were trying to demonstrate technological prowess and the the goal was to demonstrate that our political system and economic system was superior and in fact we achieved that but know this we re doing amazing things we re so far ahead of china right now it s not even a comparison margaret brennan mm hm jim bridenstine just recently we had the crew drag and attach to the international space station before that we landed on the far side of mars for the eighth time in human history we landed on mars the united states of america is the only country that s been able to achieve that margaret brennan mm hm jim bridenstine we re now entering orbit around bennu for the first time in human history doing an asteroid margaret brennan okay jim bridenstine return mission and then of course brilliant images of pluto margaret brennan mm hm jim bridenstine and that same spacecraft now four billion miles from earth giving us more science than ever before we re margaret brennan thank you jim bridenstine we are winning margaret brennan thank you and we will be watching we hope all of you will all this week on cbs stay with us announcements margaret brennan for some perspective on how apollo 11 first got off the ground we spoke earlier with presidential historian douglas brinkley his new book is american moonshot john f kennedy and the great space race begin vt margaret brennan what did the great space race do for america douglas brinkley american moonshot oh it lifted america s morale incredibly you know in the 1960s we were mired in the vietnam war we had dealt with the assassinations of john f kennedy and bobby kennedy and martin luther king and then we kept thinking can we get to the moon can we fulfill john f kennedy s pledge president john f kennedy may 25 1961 i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth douglas brinkley and so it was bipartisan in nature it cost twenty five billion dollars that s a hundred and eighty billion in today s currency but the american public said let s do it and they kept funding it via congressional appropriations margaret brennan if you try to look at it in the calculation made to get all that funding the billions you talk about that there were those in congress who also said why don t we spend this money at home alleviate american poverty douglas brinkley there were critics of the moonshot many on the right barry goldwater senator of arizona wanted the money to go to the u s air force on the left people like liberals walter mondale j william fulbright senators said what you re suggesting let s go put money into poverty programs and into schools with that said there was always enough appropriations and particularly after john f kennedy was assassinated lyndon johnson changes to cape canaveral to the kennedy space center and we start going to the moon to fulfill john f kennedy s pledge in a way to honor the martyred slain president neil armstrong one giant leap for mankind margaret brennan a lot of americans may not know the involvement of nazi scientists in the space program and a personal relationship between kennedy and a scientist called wernher von braun who is he douglas brinkley well von braun was the great german rocketeer of the 1920s 1930s and he works for adolf hitler in world war ii he s an ss officer and he develops vengeance weapons for hitler but von braun always has an eye for the moon and the stars the big deal is how can you put a projectile sixty two miles up breaking great earth s gravity grip and going into outer space and von braun is the one who accomplishes this feat during world war ii but alas the war ends von braun could be charged for war crimes for building these weapons and using jewish slave labor to build them and he makes a deal with the truman administration to become part of the u s army and start building missiles for the united states and it s wernher von braun s saturn v that is apollo 11 that brought our astronauts to the moon margaret brennan and it was the american deal to bring those nazi scientists to the u s that really irked and concerned the soviets douglas brinkley very much so because we it was the greatest technology heist maybe in world history where suddenly we we had all of the nazi rocket and missile assets there s a moral conundrum going on here of whether we should have done this but we did but from 1945 to 1949 the united states had a nuclear monopoly we were the superpower suddenly under joe stalin russia had the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb they put up the first intercontinental ballistic missile the r 7 then october of 1957 sputnik the first earth satellite so there s a feeling in the mid fifties that eisenhower s asleep at the wheel and we re getting our clock cleaned by the soviet union and it s out of sputnik that in 1958 eisenhower creates nasa a civilian space exploration announces mercury astronauts we pick seven and then we start looking can we put an astronaut into space and then when kennedy is president the question is can we put a man on the moon margaret brennan kennedy you write knew that there was a value to this space program beyond the technology and the dominance he knew this was almost a made for tv moment douglas brinkley tv is a big part of it one of the great things about the united states space program we had transparency on may 5 61 we put up alan shepard mercury astronaut from new hampshire only fifteen minutes up fifteen minutes down but he became a space hero and kennedy loved basking in the glory of john glenn and gus grissom and scott carpenter wally schirra and they became kennedy space cadets margaret brennan kennedy even had naysayers in his own family you write about his dad calling white house aides and saying damn it i thought jack was better than that we re going to go broke with this nonsense his own father was saying what are you doing douglas brinkley well and so did everybody at nasa kennedy suddenly going to a joint session of congress out of nowhere saying we re going to the moon and at nasa they said you got to be kidding me we don t have any technology to do this this isn t a stunt and so kennedy got fully behind this it was good tv ratings it was technology was what the new frontier was about he wanted to beat the soviets and he saw that the public pulling together on going to the moon the apollo program margaret brennan and cbs our network also had its own role in this entire enterprise not only were cbs executives consulted in the idea of a space program and what the public reception would be but then it was a documentary that inspired president kennedy as well douglas brinkley absolutely oh let s give walter cronkite a lot of credit for one he adopted space as his bailiwick walter cronkite i am walter cronkite douglas brinkley cronkite it was unabashed that the greatest accomplishment that the united states did in his entire lifetime was apollo 11 was going to the moon he was a he was a fanboy of nasa margaret brennan could america rally and do something this visionary now and in a way that galvanizes people through various presidencies and keeps that commitment douglas brinkley that s what the idea of the moonshot means to people the idea that americans short of war could do something grand collectively together there s still more than nostalgia on apollo 11 it s a kind of a fig leaf of hope that in the coming decades the united states can once again get their act together and do big bold things like we used to do end vt margaret brennan you can see our full interview with doug brinkley on facethenation com we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan that s it for today
