watch cbsn live by grace segers kathryn watson stefan becket updated on august 1 2019 11 41 am cbs news former vice president joe biden came under fire from his fellow democratic presidential hopefuls in the second round of the debate in detroit on wednesday with challengers like kamala harris and cory booker hoping to put a dent in his status as the frontrunner for the party s nomination over the course of more than two hours in detroit s historic fox theater biden defended himself along two lines of attack critiques that his current policy proposals aren t progressive enough and attacks on his extensive record built up over the course of his decades long career biden who got considerably more speaking time than the other candidates on stage appeared far more prepared than he did in the first debate in june he displayed a firm grasp of the details of his rivals proposals on health care and immigration and showed a familiarity with their own records on issues like criminal justice and economic policy read more top takeaways from wednesday night s democratic primary debate kamala harris whose confrontation with biden defined the first debate continued to challenge the former vice president most notably in touting her recently unveiled health care plan but that plan also opened her up to criticism from candidates to her left who charged her plan does not constitute a true medicare for all model since it allows for a role for private insurers the california senator also came under scrutiny for her record as a prosecutor in california despite her attempts to turn that experience into an argument for why she can beat president trump the most strenuous criticism for biden came from those candidates in the middle and low tiers who see an opportunity to pull biden to the left on their signature issues juli n castro challenged him on immigration particularly his record on deportations in the obama administration booker took him to task on criminal justice and biden s support for the 1994 crime bill jay inslee insisted biden s climate change plan is inadequate to grapple with the current crisis but biden survived the barrage of incoming fire and seemed to emerge

general of california in going after predatory corporations as proof she could take on mr trump biden who was targeted throughout the night by nearly every candidate on stage repeated his common phrase that this election is a battle for the soul of america focusing on mr trump as his main competitor instead of the other democrats eight more years of donald trump will change america in

defeat mr trump in michigan by appealing to black voters and black women in particular a demographic critical to the democratic party which saw low turnout in 2016 we lost the state of michigan

violations yang said immigrants are being scapegoated for problems that aren t theirs pointing to automation as a far greater concern in america inslee said america shouldn t allow a white nationalist to continue to be in the white house but it was biden who had one of the starkest lines the former vice president insisted asylum decisions need to be determined quickly and central american nations need more aid but he drew a line that illegal immigration should stay illegal the fact of the matter is if you cross the border illegally you should be able to be sent back it s a crime biden said
