advertisement supported by a sitting commander in chief used to call on predecessors to provide a sense of national unity not this one by kate andersen brower ms andersen brower is the author of the forthcoming team of five the presidents club in the age of trump about a year ago in an interview in the oval office i asked president trump if his years behind the storied resolute desk had made him empathize with his predecessors in the very room where most of them had called on one another in times of crisis for years and well before the novel coronavirus pandemic changed the country and the world mr trump was dismissive of the men who came before him he answered my question without hesitation no no his attitude toward his predecessors has apparently only hardened over time the chaos of the pandemic has shined a spotlight on his contempt for the living presidents he has stripped them of one of their traditional jobs in retirement their unique ability to unify the country in a crisis the relative absence of barack obama george w bush bill clinton and jimmy carter is more striking now than ever before mr obama s endorsement of joe biden on april 14 was as much if not more about calling out mr trump as it was about declaring his support for his former vice president the endorsement gave mr obama the chance to speak up against not only mr trump s muddled handling of the pandemic but also his entire presidency in a video that ran nearly 12 minutes a former president criticizing a sitting president during a crisis of this magnitude used to be unthinkable but now that mr trump has ripped up the playbook of civility members of the so called presidents club have free rein his decision to jettison his predecessors is highly unusual in modern times and he knows it his administration he told me has bested them all and he was not worried about how he would eventually be received in the presidents club i don t think i fit very well because i m a different kind of a president he said i ve broken up a lot of policies a lot of things that they ve done for decades the sitting president has called upon the former presidents to provide a sense of national unity their familiar presence would be reassuring in a world that has become surreal john f kennedy called on all three of his living predecessors during the cuban missile crisis two republicans herbert hoover and dwight d eisenhower and one democrat harry truman in 2005 george w bush sent his father on a trip around the world with mr clinton the elder mr bush s onetime rival after the indian ocean tsunami after hurricane katrina the duo whom barbara bush affectionately called the odd couple raised money and their friendship became an enduring and reassuring sight after the 2010 earthquake in haiti mr obama announced that george w bush and mr clinton would lead a fund raising effort to help haitians rebuild in the rose garden mr obama was flanked by the former presidents this is a model that works mr obama said referring to the partnership between bush sr and mr clinton as the scope of the destruction became apparent i spoke to each of these gentlemen and they each asked the same simple question how can i help it is difficult to imagine mr clinton mr bush or mr obama rejecting a call for help from mr trump but it is equally difficult to imagine him calling when asked at one of his early coronavirus press briefings whether he would reach out to his predecessors for help mr trump said dismissively i don t think i m going to learn much and you know i guess you could say that there s probably a natural inclination not to call if mr obama mr bush mr clinton and mr carter were to start an effort together without mr trump a former obama aide lamented the endeavor would be entirely eclipsed by the fact that they did it without the sitting president mr trump has clearly enjoyed humiliating his predecessors and has called mr bush s invasion of iraq the single worst decision ever made in a mid march tweet just as the nation s economy was shutting down and schools were closing mr trump wasted no time criticizing his predecessor s management of a previous health crisis he railed against mr obama s response to the h1n1 swine flu and called it a full scale disaster with thousands dying and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem until now mr bush recently wrote a note to his staff that was obtained by the dallas morning news he expressed absolute confidence in the experts who are in charge of the nation s coronavirus response he said that he was reading painting and riding mountain bikes and that he and his wife the former first lady laura bush were handwashing and social distancing to the max but wouldn t it be better if he and the other ex presidents could put the lessons they learned in office to lift the country s spirit during this public health crisis of course each still has unique influence bill and hillary clinton sent hundreds of pizzas to hospital staff caring for coronavirus patients and jimmy carter asked donors to forgo their next gift to the carter center and instead support groups working directly to combat the pandemic mr trump has ended up with an opponent who is so much more in the mold of the presidential fraternity mr biden would not hesitate to call a predecessor or a former political rival during a crisis mr biden s dozens of years in the senate and two terms as vice president included many friendships with republicans and at least one with a former member of mr trump s cabinet mr biden told me that at the beginning of the trump presidency he had been in touch with mike pence who mr biden said is a guy you can talk with you can deal with in a traditional sense recalling how mr clinton worked with newt gingrich the republican house speaker during his administration mr biden has no trouble working with people with whom he does not always agree he would fit in the mold of the presidents club perfectly election day 2020 will feature a battle between the candidate who buys into the club idea and seems ready to reignite that tradition and the incumbent who is so eager to make clear he could not care less that he won t pick up the phone during the biggest crisis this country has faced since the sept 11 attacks kate andersen brower is the author of the forthcoming team of five the
