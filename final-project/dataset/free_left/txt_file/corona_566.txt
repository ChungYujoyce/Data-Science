community to process an unprecedented attack this time around it s easy to slip into the unease of viewing a fellow new yorker as a potential coronavirus carrier or a rival for that last bottle of hand sanitizer on a store shelf humans are wired to be social creatures and that s how we cope when a big disaster happens said judith moskowitz a professor of medical social science at northwestern university s feinberg school of medicine now we re being told to cope with this by staying away from each other she pointed to a 2004 study of 129 toronto residents who were under quarantine during
