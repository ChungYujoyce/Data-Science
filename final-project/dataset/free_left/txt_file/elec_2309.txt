 2016 with little to lose trump expected to tear into both clintons at town hall debate by annie karni 10 08 2016 08 53 pm edt updated 10 09 2016 08 12 am edt a clinton campaign official on saturday said the democratic nominee clinton plans to address the bombshell trump tape head on for the first time from the debate stage getty the bombshell donald trump video that surfaced friday has so dramatically altered expectations for sunday s town hall debate that one democrat close to bill and hillary clinton had a new view of what may unfold in st louis expect armageddon hillary clinton will arrive at the washington university debate stage sunday prepped for battle against an opponent many of her allies believe has already lost the election advertisement trump in contrast will walk onto the debate stage with nothing to lose two days after a tape surfaced of the reality television star bragging in obscene terms about groping and kissing women without consent and a day after unprecedented defections of support and calls for his withdrawal from leaders of his own party the second debate now falls at the most precipitous moment in the election that puts clinton in a more precarious position on the debate stage i think that trump will figure he s got nothing to lose so he might as well go all out said the democrat close to the clintons longtime democratic strategist robert shrum who guided the presidential campaigns of al gore and john kerry said that to the extent that he has any chance left at all and i don t think he does this debate is do or die for him her goal is to do no harm and relate to voters 2016 by gabriel debenedetti a clinton campaign official on saturday said the democratic nominee plans to address the bombshell trump tape head on for the first time from the debate stage and that the campaign went dark on saturday in order to capitalize on one of the biggest audiences available with 30 days left of the race tuned in to hear her response but in debate prep sessions in the week leading up to the debate clinton aides were urging the democratic nominee to remain focused on the real people posing questions in the town hall forum rather than engage in an ugly back and forth with trump the goal they said should be to show off the caring connecting maternal side of clinton that voters are less familiar with than the steely war horse who endured an 11 hour benghazi hearing last fall but the weekend s events have upended any expectation of a normal debate in a video statement released late friday night trump said that bill clinton has actually abused women and hillary clinton has bullied attacked shamed and intimidated his victims we will discuss this more in the coming days on saturday evening trump previewed his nothing to lose strategy he retweeted juanita broaddrick the woman who accused bill clinton of raping her in 1978 bill clinton has denied the accusation which broaddrick made in 1999 in the wake of his affair with monica lewinsky clinton was also preparing to respond to questions about her paid wall street speeches which emerged on wikileaks after campaign chairman john podesta s emails were hacked in one line she stressed the importance of having a public and private position on contentious political issues a source familiar with her debate prep said she plans to dismiss any scrutiny of the leaked excerpts from her speech as no different from what she has said in public but many democratic allies predicted that bringing up bill clinton s sex scandals only paints his wife in a sympathetic position as someone who has struggled and suffered to keep her family together as a unit even if trump argues that she disparaged the women who allegedly engaged in affairs with her husband they said many voters will see her through the lens of a hurt wife lashing out but a down in the gutter conversation about sex and speeches is still not how the clinton campaign would like to spend 90 minutes in prime time with millions of viewers tuned in the challenge and the opportunity will be to connect with people in a visceral and not simply a programmatic way said david axelrod a former senior strategist for president barack obama the danger is that she could overplay the attacks in a forum in which her interaction with the questioners should be a primary focus voters identify with the citizens asking the questions added longtime clinton ally paul begala who is working as an adviser to the clinton backing super pac priorities usa i would bet my life that she talks about her 19 point plan on child care what i m wishing and praying for is she makes a reference to the fact that she was a working mom you ve got to be more conversational before trump s weekend massacre clinton s aides were hoping the town hall set up would be an opportunity for the oft obscured real hillary to reveal herself they pointed to a moment last february in las vegas when clinton comforted an emotional 10 year old latina girl who said she feared her parents were going to be deported as one of her finest moments on the trail i m going to do everything i can so you don t have to be scared clinton told karla ortiz wrapping her arm around the girl s waist let me do the worrying i ll do all the worrying is that a deal clinton aides often refer to the scene which occurred in a private meeting and was released by the campaign as a carefully produced television commercial as a prime example of the side of the democratic nominee that voters don t know exists by annie karni more important than attacking trump democratic allies said was creating an ortiz moment which could give undecided voters a sense of something positive to vote for not just someone to vote against even before the release of trump s profane tape in which he talks of grabbing women by the pussy and trying to seduce a married woman by moving on her like a bitch clinton was entering the second debate surging in the polls the fivethirtyeight election forecast had boosted her chances of winning back up to 79 6 percent before the damaging trump tape release and a new quinnipiac university poll released friday morning showed clinton leading trump nationally by 5 points that lead has given some of her longtime aides pause if the past is prelude this is exactly when clinton chokes she has historically been a really horrible front runner conceded one veteran of her 2008 campaign she s extremely cautious and risk averse and it causes her ironically to make mistakes another longtime aide added finishing the deal has been hard for her in many contexts nobody in her universe is fully confident until it s actually over but the trump tape changes the stakes clinton has never in her long career been this close to the finish line and she has never had an opponent falling apart because of his aggressive and disparaging remarks about women she now also has the opportunity to stand as a powerful avatar for disgusted and depressed women across the country it s a role she has in the past hesitated to play in her presidential campaign eight years ago clinton downplayed her gender often saying that she was not running as a woman but because i believe i am the best qualified and experienced person but on saturday her campaign released a powerful 90 second video online splicing trump s profane comments from the leaked video with other misogynistic statements he has made over the course of his campaign women have the power to stop trump clinton s campaign tweeted from the candidate s official account with a link to the web video the official campaign twitter account also tweeted a quote from sen cory booker sometimes the man in the arena it ain t a man it is a woman by gabriel debenedetti the events of the weekend were a boon to clinton s campaign but also required re prepping clinton s aides had been reviewing tape of trump in town hall settings and video of his deposition from june in order to prepare for a more toned down version of the blustering real estate mogul but on saturday longtime clinton allies said they expected trump was more likely to use the debate as a last ditch effort to save his candidacy and if that didn t work possibly get out of the race and turn it over to mike pence to defeat clinton the campaign s attorney marc elias and campaign manager robby mook were huddling saturday to discuss that possibility but elias said that it was too late to replace trump on state ballots and he would be the candidate no matter what on election day trump meanwhile was putting on a strong face even in the wake of unprecedented defections from top gop senators and party leaders on saturday afternoon he strode out of trump tower to wave to a crowd of supporters gathered on fifth avenue in manhattan the media and establishment want me out of the race so badly i will never drop out of the race will never let my supporters down maga he tweeted saturday afternoon and those republicans who were still standing with him previewed a come from behind performance donald trump is a clutch player who does well when he s under pressure said roger stone a former adviser to his campaign any mistakes he makes are more likely when his guard is down and it s casual missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest
