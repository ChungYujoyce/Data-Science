advertisement supported by the run up by michael barbaro by any measure arsenio hall was a hollywood success he had starred in popular films packed houses as a stand up comic and hosted a hit late night television show bearing his name donald j trump saw it differently by the mid 2000s in his eyes mr hall was nothing dead as a doornail was his assessment of mr hall in a previously unreleased interview from two years ago dead as dog meat why such a harsh judgment because in mr trump s eyes mr hall had suffered the most grievous form of public humiliation his celebrity had waned his star had dimmed it was in short mr trump s worst nightmare couldn t get on television mr trump said with disgust they wouldn t even take his phone call the intense ambitions and undisciplined behaviors of mr trump have confounded even those close to him especially as his presidential campaign comes to a tumultuous end and he confronts the possibility of the most stinging defeat of his life but in the more than five hours of conversations the last extensive biographical interviews mr trump granted before running for president a powerful driving force emerges his deep seated fear of public embarrassment the recordings reveal a man who is fixated on his own celebrity anxious about losing his status and contemptuous of those who fall from grace they capture the visceral pleasure he derives from fighting his willful lack of interest in history his reluctance to reflect on his life and his belief that most people do not deserve his respect in the interviews mr trump makes clear just how difficult it is for him to imagine let alone accept defeat i never had a failure mr trump said in one of the interviews despite his repeated corporate bankruptcies and business setbacks because i always turned a failure into a success the interviews were conducted in 2014 by michael d antonio a pulitzer prize winning reporter who later wrote a biography of mr trump called the truth about trump mr d antonio now disapproves of mr trump s candidacy and gave transcripts of the interviews to hillary clinton s campaign this year after a brief meeting with a few clinton aides he said he never heard back from mrs clinton s staff over the past few weeks mr d antonio gave the new york times access to the original audio as well as transcripts of his interviews with mr trump mr trump s first wife ivana and his three oldest children the times is using them as the basis for this article and a two part episode of its election podcast the run up mr trump in a statement on monday night called the recordings pretty old and pretty boring stuff hope people enjoy it in the interviews which occurred in mr trump s office and apartment in trump tower in manhattan he is by turns animated and bored boastful and stubborn when prodded toward soul searching no i don t want to think about it he said when mr d antonio asked him to contemplate the meaning of his life i don t like to analyze myself because i might not like what i see despite his reluctance mr trump reveals himself over and over in the stories he tells in his wide ranging answers to questions and at times in casual seemingly throwaway lines who does he look up to i don t have heroes mr trump said does he examine history to better understand the present i don t like talking about the past he said later adding it s all about the present and the future who earns his respect for the most part he said you can t respect people because most people aren t worthy of respect his lavish lifestyle i could be very happy in a one bedroom he said motioning at his vast penthouse apartment i don t need this three floors his struggle to balance work and love it s very hard for somebody to be married to me he said but he always seems to return in one form or another to the theme of humiliation he reserves special scorn for people who embarrass themselves in front of their peers he tells the story of an unnamed bank president who became inebriated during an award dinner at the waldorf astoria hotel in manhattan a ritual of new york society by the end of the night he recalls the man was incapable of walking and had to be carried out to mr trump s disapproval donald trump we all had a leg an arm a back and we carried him out of the room that night right after he made the worst speech you ve ever heard and i never looked at him the same way after that i ll never forget that in front of a room of the most important people we had to carry him out of the room and so things like that had an impact on me there is little trace of sympathy or understanding when people lose face mr trump s reaction is swift and unforgiving and when mr trump feels he has been made a fool of his response can be volcanic ivana trump told mr d antonio about a colorado ski vacation she took with mr trump soon after they began dating the future mrs trump had not told her boyfriend that she was an accomplished skier as she recalls it mr trump went down the hill first and waited for her at the bottom ivana trump so he goes and stops and he says come on baby come on baby i went up i went two flips up in the air two flips in front of him i disappeared donald was so angry he took off his skis his ski boots and walked up to the restaurant he could not take it he could not take it he had been bested in public as he stormed off the slope leaving behind a trail of equipment she recalled mr trump could not contain his embarrassment i m not going to do this she recalled him saying for anybody including ivana on the tapes mr trump describes a passionate enjoyment of fighting which started during his adolescence in queens it did not matter he said whether an altercation was verbal or physical he loved it all the same mr trump i was a very rebellious kind of person i don t like to talk about it actually but i was a very rebellious person and very set in my ways interviewer in eighth grade mr trump i loved to fight i always loved to fight interviewer physical fights mr trump yeah all kinds of fights physical interviewer arguments mr trump all types of fights any kind of fight i loved it including physical his behavior was so belligerent that his parents sent him off around age 13 to the all boys new york military academy a highly regimented school about an hour north of manhattan he seemed to revel in the masculine culture of confrontation there in the interview he sounds nostalgic for the time when roughness and physical conflict were more acceptable mr trump i m standing there at the military academy and this guy comes out he s like a bulldog too rough guy he was a drill sergeant now they call him major dobias but he was a sergeant when i first knew him he was sergeant dobias right out of the army and he was a rough guy physically rough and mentally rough he was also my baseball coach he said things like stand up and i went give me a expletive break and this guy came at me you would never believe it i mean it was really fantastic interviewer did he rough you up mr trump oh yeah absolutely interviewer grabbed you by the shirt mr trump it doesn t matter it was not like what happens today and you had to learn to survive it was tough it wasn t today those were rougher times these guys you go back to some of those old drill sergeants they can t even understand what s going on with this country he still seems to long for those older tougher times as a presidential candidate at a las vegas rally in february as mr trump scolded a protester who tried to interrupt his speech he used strikingly similar language i love the old days mr trump told the crowd to loud cheers you know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this they d be carried out on a stretcher folks he is intoxicated by the glow of his name in the news media a subject he brings up repeatedly in the interviews he can still recall the thrill of a newspaper mentioning his name for the first time as a high school baseball player whose performance had clinched his team s victory mr trump and i said i love it i loved it it was the first time i was ever in a newspaper i was a young kid right i was probably a sophomore in high school i don t think there s anything wrong with that i thought it was amazing it felt good he was hooked but it was not enough for mr trump to become an object of media fascination he took pleasure in knowing that such coverage was denied to almost everybody else when mr d antonio said that it was exciting for anybody to be mentioned in a newspaper a seemingly wounded mr trump interrupted to explain why his experience was special well most people aren t in print though don t forget how many people are in print he asked nobody s in print mr trump refused to let the subject go emphasizing over and over how unique it was that he had been mentioned in the newspaper by the time he was an established businessman mr trump hired a service to compile the swelling number of references to him in the media which he then reviewed there are thousands of them a day he told mr d antonio thousands thousands a day he quickly figured out that media attention was free advertising for his new hotels and golf courses a fact that led him to frequently participate in newspaper interviews and television shows mr trump i could say no and then i could advertise a project that i m doing like doral or something and spend a half a million dollars on it or a million dollars or i can do the show and spend nothing and be on for a lot longer do you understand what i meant so i ve always felt it was a positive thing no matter the newspaper magazine or show mr trump was always keeping score of how positive the coverage was and how often he was featured just as he does today he recounted his experience as a guest on barbara walters s abc special 10 most fascinating people boasting that he was on the show twice just one other person had earned that distinction mr trump grudgingly acknowledged hillary clinton in fact mrs clinton had made the list four times ultimately mr trump fears more than anything else being ignored overlooked or irrelevant that s how he saw arsenio hall in the 2000s as forgotten and ungrateful for his time on the celebrity apprentice mr trump s reality television competition which mr hall won in 2012 during his final interview with mr d antonio as their relationship had warmed and deepened mr trump turned philosophical he recalled a favorite song performed by peggy lee is that all there is a poignant ballad about unfulfilled dreams and dissatisfaction with life mr trump it s a great song because i ve had these tremendous successes and then i m off to the next one because it s like oh is that all there is that s a great song actually that s a very interesting song especially sung by her because she had such a troubled life but he quickly retreats from the moment declining mr d antonio s invitation to further explain how the song makes him feel about himself saying he might not like what he discovers of this however mr trump is certain he needs the world s attention and its embrace a life force that has sustained him for decades he recalled the feeling of walking into a giant room and watching as the crowd surrounded him as if he were a magnet attracting everything around him mr d antonio asked him when that first started long time ago mr trump replied it s always been that way did it ever unnerve him the author wondered no mr trump said i think what would unnerve me is if it didn t happen advertisement
