advertisement supported by by jonathan martin and ashley parker manchester n h in the crowded new hampshire primary no candidate may shape the direction of the republican presidential campaign more than the man who finished sixth in iowa jeb bush with senator ted cruz of texas donald j trump and senator marco rubio of florida each finishing more than 20 percentage points higher than mr bush in the iowa caucuses on monday the former florida governor is facing growing pressure to either demonstrate his appeal to voters or leave the race specifically many republicans including some of his supporters and donors said that mr bush must finish ahead of mr rubio in the primary here next tuesday to justify continuing his campaign into south carolina if rubio beats him badly in new hampshire jeb is toast said senator lindsey graham republican of south carolina a bush backer who spent most of tuesday traveling the state with him mr graham added that mr bush must either tie rubio or beat him in this state the burden falls so heavily on mr bush who won just 2 8 percent of the vote in iowa because of republican anxieties about the top two finishers there mr cruz and mr trump many party leaders fear that the nomination of mr trump or mr cruz would lead to an electoral rout this fall were mr bush to keep campaigning into south carolina he could create a split among pragmatic minded voters denying mr rubio the chance to consolidate this bloc of republicans and strengthening the hands of mr cruz and mr trump many republicans believe that if mr rubio who won an unexpected 23 percent in iowa right behind mr trump s 24 percent again delivers a strong performance in new hampshire he will have earned the right to carry the banner for the party establishment asked tuesday evening by reporters how well he felt he needed to do in new hampshire to justify staying in the race mr bush struck a defiant note oh i m continuing on he said i m continuing on yeah two rivals gov chris christie of new jersey and gov john r kasich of ohio are appealing to the same voters and also need a strong showing in new hampshire but mr bush is far better financed and organized and can most likely stay in the race longer than they can otherwise while mr bush had 7 6 million in the bank and the super pac supporting him had an additional 58 6 million as of jan 1 mr kasich had just 2 5 million and mr christie a paltry 1 1 million and neither mr christie nor mr kasich both of whom have spent the vast majority of their time in new hampshire has much in the way of organization in south carolina mr bush by contrast has an active network of supporters there and has tapped into mr graham s organization and perhaps most important the super pac supporting mr bush has shown a willingness to put it mildly to spend millions of dollars against his rivals particularly mr rubio whom it has spent more than 20 million attacking the prospect of the super pac maintaining its assault on mr rubio after the new hampshire primary leaves many republicans uneasy about mr bush s intentions and mr rubio s supporters cognizant of these concerns began moving on tuesday to stoke these fears if jeb doesn t do well there and he s still got millions and millions to spend does he stay around mused senator cory gardner republican of colorado a rubio backer who knows but mr gardner noted more money has been spent attacking republicans by fellow republicans in this election than any cycle in the history of the party it is not just supporters of mr rubio who are dismayed some of mr bush s major donors including those with long ties to the family are also growing impatient hoping he will not go past new hampshire absent a strong finish here few are willing to say so publicly and on a tuesday conference call the campaign held for fund raisers they did not even get a chance to say so privately the bush aides running the call did not open it up to questions after the iowa caucuses the paths to the nomination diverge for the three leading candidates it is unclear what threshold mr bush might feel he must reach to continue after the new hampshire vote but on the conference call and in talking points the campaign emailed late monday night to supporters mr bush s team pointed to surveys showing him in a statistical tie for second in new hampshire the campaign also built up mr bush s effort to win the state and trumpeted new hampshire s recent role in determining the republican standard bearer left unmentioned was the 2000 primary here in which mr bush s older brother george w lost in a landslide and still went on to claim the nomination the granite state has long been the state voters look to in choosing the nominee and next president the staff wrote in the email to supporters highlighting mr bush s endorsements and organizational strength in reality mr bush s top advisers know mr rubio s finish in iowa makes it harder for mr bush to claim that he is the logical alternative to mr trump and mr cruz yet he seems torn between focusing his fire on mr rubio or mr trump on tuesday his campaign began airing an unusually long two minute ad in new hampshire attacking mr trump for insulting veterans women and the disabled and at a stop in henniker n h mr bush aimed some of his most pointed language yet at mr trump who finished second in iowa calling him a loser with deep insecurities yet on the same day mr bush went so aggressively after mr trump he also sought to raise doubts about mr rubio incorporating mr cruz for purposes of comparison if you look at their records they re gifted in how they speak but what about their life experience mr bush said at franklin pierce university in rindge likening the two to president obama who was elected president after less than four years in the senate is there something in their past that would suggest they have the capability of making a tough decision yet there are signs mr bush may still have some work to do speaking at the hanover inn near the vermont border on tuesday mr bush finished a fiery riff about protecting the country i won t be out here blow harding talking a big game without backing it up he said and was met with total silence please clap he said sounding defeated the crowd laughed and then finally clapped advertisement
