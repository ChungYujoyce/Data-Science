filed under many sanders supporters don t think biden is progressive enough biden will have to win them over and sanders will need to go all out to deliver them when vermont sen bernie sanders finally announced he was suspending his campaign but oddly that he will remain on the ballot and collect delegates the news hit his supporters understandably hard despite sanders clear lack of viability over the past month and a pandemic that paralyzed his and all political campaigns his proponents reacted to the news with varied degrees of sadness appreciation and defiance comedian sarah silverman wow i m heartbroken about bernie in depth political coverage sports analysis entertainment reviews and cultural commentary democratic socialist activist meagan day bernie sanders upended american politics

vote for him in ny rising co host and sanders supporter krystal ball said bernie sanders suspending his campaign i respect his decision but i think this is the wrong move and sanders campaign press secretary briahna joy gray mused on the plus side i can drop the democratic from my tweets about why socialism is good many sanders supporters have already said they will vote for the democrats presumptive nominee joe biden and sanders himself motioned at party unity in his announcement saying today i congratulate joe biden a very decent man who i will work with to move our progressive ideas forward notably however sanders did not endorse biden getting sanders supporters many of whom are notoriously loyal and pugilistic see bros bernie to transfer their enthusiasm over to biden will be no small challenge for a candidate who many progressives see as insufficiently liberal in the past few months sanders supporters had also mounted an effort to question biden s mental acuity biden will make the effort as he suggested today but there s a subset of sanders supporters who were all in on bernie and no one else will do their tweets came in fast and furious too dovahfem i m not voting for joe biden i ll be staying home f the dnc and f unity with these ghouls i meant it when i said bernieorbust good luck in november bernieorelse let s get bernieorbust trending and sign the pledge now burn this s to the ground saynotoheteros the democratic party is over vote green this year to help ensure the future of progressives in this country neverbiden bernieorbust bernieorgreen it s hard to know how big a group of voters bernieorbust truly is it s obvious that some on social media are merely bots and trump trolls hoping to disrupt the elections but are there truly enough bob voters to make a difference just ask hillary clinton there s evidence that at least some of the bernieorbust threats were mere bravado in january when sanders was considered the frontrunner a national emerson college poll found that only 53 of sanders supporters said they would support the democratic nominee even if it was not their candidate now after sanders precipitous primary fall that gap has closed significantly a morning consult poll conducted last week found that 80 of sanders supporters would support biden still that 20 who are not committed 7 say they are supporting trump and 13 say they do not know should be worrisome to the biden the campaign and is likely very good news for the trump campaign trump himself tweeted that sanders supporters should vote republican in the fall and they just might others still may stay home while it s hard to imagine the sitting president attracting new voters while tragically mismanaging one of the worst human health crises our country has ever seen there s always been a weird venn diagram of trump sanders policy and personality overlap even while trump s inadequacies and vulnerabilities are on full display on a daily basis he can still win over plenty of disaffected democrats who think the party has sold out he did it in 2016 he ll do it again it will be up to biden to convince them otherwise but it will also depend on whether sanders is truly interested in delivering his voters clinton and her supporters believe he was too late in 2016 for biden s sake he better hope 2020 is not a repeat send letters to letters suntimes com s e cupp
