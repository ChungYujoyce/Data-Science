advertisement supported by by alexander burns troy n y the ambush came seconds after senator kirsten gillibrand began launching into a pitch for one of her core policy proposals a system of publicly financing elections as she began describing her idea a man to her right interrupted i m sorry i have to step in here said the man who was going by the name of andrew yang one of ms gillibrand s rivals ms gillibrand rebuffed him parried a skeptical moderator s question and returned to her main argument that a proposal like hers would help neuter special interests like the national rifle association let s talk about the real cost to taxpayers the fact that washington is so corrupt ms gillibrand said the fact that any big idea that we re going to hear from this debate stage tonight none of them can get done until you get the money out of politics transcript i am a candidate for president i m announcing my candidacy for president i m running for president i m running for president president president president president i am running for president of the united states you ran up mountains of debt as well as losses using other people s money and you were forced to file for bankruptcy we don t need an apprentice in the white house we have one right now donald you know is great at the one liners but he s a chaos candidate how is it conservative to add a trillion dollar expenditure for the federal government that you re not paying for there was a battle over amnesty and some chose like senator rubio to stand with barack obama and chuck schumer and support a massive amnesty plan for the 11 million people come on folks we all know you can t pick them up and ship them across back across the border it s a silly argument it s not an adult argument his visceral response to attack people on their appearance my goodness that happened in junior high to subject my wife into the middle of a raucous political conversation was completely inappropriate and i hope you apologize the donors the special interests the lobbyists have very strong power over these people they continue to debate about this bill and then the subcommittee and what nobody in america cares about that this is the difference between actually having been a federal prosecutor actually doing something i saw you on the senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in iowa that s what washington d c does and then the memorized 25 second speech this notion that barack obama doesn t know what he s doing is just not true there it is he knows exactly there it is the memorized 25 seconds speech i m a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid fat and ugly now that we ve gotten the donald trump portion out of the way i m also aware of that california has a drought and so that s why i made sure i brought my own water not only are we the a team we even have our own mr t who doesn t mind saying about others you re a fool mr yang was speechless or at least a simulated version of him was for ms gillibrand was not sparring with mr yang and lester holt of nbc news on a stage in miami she was practicing for the upcoming primary debates with a group of 10 campaign aides in a converted auto dealership with a neon colored mural of john lennon on the wall with ms gillibrand squeezed between them in a row of podiums two of her campaign consultants raghu devaguptapu and brandon hall rotated through a list of roles that included mr yang senators bernie sanders of vermont and michael bennet of colorado and joseph r biden jr the former vice president mr devaguptapu sporting a checked blazer played mr yang sign up for our politics newsletter and we ll send you a reminder about our live chat on debate night for candidates like ms gillibrand the season of preliminary debates that begins this week is more than a high stakes political test the debates on wednesday and thursday nights and another two at the end of july may represent the first best and for some the only opportunity to stand out from an enormous throng of competitors and build national momentum in the democratic primary if these debates are designed to let candidates showcase themselves to a national audience for some they could end up serving less as a moment of introduction than as a farewell as they separate the democrats capable of exciting the imaginations of primary voters from those who lack that gift more than half of the candidates debating this week risk being blocked from debates starting in september unless they can significantly lift their polling and fund raising numbers before then ms gillibrand was far from alone in her intensive preparations across the country in spare hotel conference rooms and bustling campaign offices many of the 20 democrats who will debate wednesday and thursday have spent long hours holding their own debate simulations and rapid fire policy drills the democratic debate lineups are set here s what to expect in each debate the candidates could have as little as six or seven minutes of speaking time to put all that practice to work the leading candidates are girding for criticism mr biden who leads in the polls but spent last week under attack for his history of striking deals with segregationists has been holding mock debates to practice as his advisers urge him to stay above the fray mr sanders struggling to keep his second place standing as senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts a fellow populist rises quickly has been reading written policy briefings prepared by advisers but has resisted certain kinds of debate drills as his advisers discuss whether to aggressively harry mr biden and there are the skilled underdogs determined to break out of the pack senator amy klobuchar of minnesota a fastidious moderate said she has watched the crowded republican primary debates of 2012 and 2016 to soak in the highly fluid format allies of senator cory booker who challenged mr biden assertively last week on matters of race said he has been holding extended study sessions breaking up his preparations by doing push ups on the floor and wedging one practice session into a car ride between washington d c and his home state new jersey gov jay inslee of washington said in an interview that he had been practicing mock debates with his former chief counsel nick brown playing a number of rival debaters but mr inslee said he was mainly focused on explaining his record as governor and his vision for addressing climate change as a national emergency for a candidate like myself who is essentially unknown this is a great chance to make a first impression on the nation said mr inslee adding i think the dialogue will be much more between the candidates and the viewers than between the candidates for the best known candidates mr biden 76 and mr sanders 77 a different challenge looms when they debate on thursday universally known to democratic voters their task in the debates is less one of self introduction than of self defense addressing criticism from younger and for mr biden more liberal rivals and perhaps from each other which democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week three other democrats who have gained varying degrees of traction ms warren her senate colleague kamala harris of california and pete buttigieg the mayor of south bend ind view the debates as a chance to extend or accelerate their momentum ms warren by far the most prominent candidate in the wednesday debate is looking to deliver a forceful version of the policy heavy calls for political reform she has been trumpeting on the trail ms harris and mr buttigieg who are both in the thursday debate are also aiming to amplify their core themes while navigating the complicated dynamics of sharing a stage with mr biden and mr sanders ms gillibrand who will be on stage with mr biden and mr sanders said she did not expect to grapple much with those two men on the contrary she predicted mr biden and mr sanders would clash mostly with each other but ms gillibrand made plain that she had studied her major opponents records we have contrast with biden we have contrast with bernie we have contrast with maybe a couple with kamala ms gillibrand said ticking off rivals one by one we have contrast certainly with bennet i don t know what andrew yang what his platform is so i don t know if i contrast with him and i don t know much of mayor pete s platform geoff garin a democratic pollster who is unaligned in the primary said voters would be watching the debate through the lens of seeking a candidate who can beat president trump in that respect it could be an especially important test of mr biden who has staked his candidacy on the perception that he is the most electable person in the race rank and file democrats like biden but they also have questions about his age and whether he is in step with the times and many will be watching for some telltale signs in this regard mr garin said adding of the rest of the field the debate is a chance for warren harris and buttigieg to solidify their position in the top tier and build some additional momentum and a chance for booker in particular to move himself up into the top tier mr biden and his advisers are bracing for an especially strenuous outing having entered the race in april as the front runner mr biden has campaigned so far at a cautious distance from his rivals and from the media it may be difficult to sustain that regal pose in what will be his first debate since his one on one outing against paul ryan in the lone 2012 vice presidential debate mr biden has been studying for the debates for weeks according to people familiar with his preparations he has been reading through briefing books and engaging in rehearsal sessions and his preparations are led by two of his closest advisers anita dunn a former white house communications director and ron klain mr biden s former chief of staff some of his closest political allies have urged him to do his best to avoid squabbling with other candidates even if they come after him in iowa earlier this month mr biden told reporters that he did not intend to go after other democrats and said he expected the overflowing debate stages to yield less than substantive repartee it s a little bit of an exaggeration to call it a debate mr biden said there s not really much time so it s like a lightning round but the stakes for mr biden have risen substantially his allies acknowledge following the uproar last week over his habit of telling stories about working with segregationists in the senate and an ensuing clash with mr booker about mr biden s judgment on race among the major candidates mr sanders is said to have been least interested in participating in intensive pre debate drills people briefed on his activities said he has been reading up on his rivals policy positions these people said but he has little patience for mock debates there is a split within mr sanders s camp as to how aggressive he ought to be with mr biden while the senator has stark ideological differences with mr biden and sees the former vice president as his most important opponent mr sanders is said to want to focus on his own message and engage mr biden only if the situation arises organically on sunday ms gillibrand and her advisers seemed to settle on something of a wait and see approach to her best known opponents she practiced an answer on health care that strongly implied she was a more politically daring advocate for single payer medicine than mr sanders it was something i actually ran on in 2006 and won in a two to one republican district she said answering a riff by mr hall as mr sanders and ms gillibrand a politically agile former corporate lawyer seemed alert to opportunities to play off mr biden albeit in a tongue in cheek manner as her staff ran through a lightning round of questions asking the debaters to raise their hands if they supported ideas like prosecuting drug manufacturers and abolishing the death penalty ms gillibrand noticed at one point that mr hall as mr biden was not raising his hand to oppose capital punishment biden you suck she taunted her adviser grinning widely before quickly turning serious again sorry i m kidding it was a joke join us for live analysis on debate night subscribe to on
