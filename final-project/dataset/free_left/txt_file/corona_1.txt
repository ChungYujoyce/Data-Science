filed under amazon is positioning itself as an essential service during the pandemic a move that benefits the company and puts its warehouse workers and drivers in danger last night speaking from the state s emergency operations center in sacramento california gov gavin newsom ordered everyone in the state to stay home to slow the spread of covid 19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus malls retail stores and other businesses not considered critical infrastructure were to close in the most sweeping lockdown so far in the us that same night also in sacramento an amazon worker received an automated call telling him that his job at a distribution center was essential and he should continue to come to work in washington an early epicenter of the us outbreak managers at an amazon warehouse told employees that they would continue doing their jobs despite the state mandated closure of nonessential businesses and the fact that workers in amazon s nearby corporate offices have been working remotely since march 5th as the virus spreads and cities lock down amazon workers across the country are finding themselves thrust into a new role delivering goods to a nation in quarantine but many fear that the safety precautions benefits and protections have not changed sufficiently to reflect the new reality and that if their warehouses continue operating as everything else shuts down many will fall ill we re all going to get sick eventually said a worker at a facility in washington the vibe with coworkers is that we are all probably going to get it it s just a matter of time amazon is uniquely positioned to thrive in the crisis it s spent more than two decades building a robust logistics network capable of delivering almost anything to anyone and now americans stuck at home are turning to the company to supply basic necessities data supplied by junglescout shows search volume surging first for face masks and hand sanitizer then for rice soup webcams monitors anything americans might need as they hunker down already infrastructure for a huge portion of e commerce amazon is becoming infrastructure for a house bound populace but the virus also poses an unprecedented threat to amazon s logistics system and more importantly the workers who make it run the company s fulfillment centers depend on staffs of a thousand or more working in close proximity the verge spoke with 24 warehouse workers and delivery drivers many of whom spoke of crowded workplaces nonexistent screenings for symptoms a lack of cleaning supplies and a pace of work that made proper sanitation difficult across the country workers are weighing the need for an income against the fear that they might become infected and endanger their loved ones these concerns will only become more acute as the pandemic worsens on march 18th the atlantic reported that a worker at an amazon distribution center in new york tested positive for the virus workers on the following shift said they weren t notified and were expected to come in but refused when learning of the case from co workers shutting down the facility amazon said it notified workers and that they weren t expected to work the following shift and that it has temporarily closed the facility for cleaning in italy and spain amazon has refused to shut down facilities where workers have been infected prompting protests i think what will wind up happening is the warehouse is going to stay open pretty much no matter what said tyler hamilton a worker at a fulfillment center in minnesota where the governor has ordered schools and many businesses closed i understand why because everything else is closed and to make sure for society that people get basic necessities food toiletries that s important but if you re going to have that happening you should be taking proper precautions for your workers so they re not suffering at the expense for everyone else in response to the pandemic amazon has altered policies and instituted new procedures last week amazon announced that employees who test positive for covid 19 will get two weeks paid leave though testing is still largely unavailable and workers who take time off when symptoms appear risk going without pay if it turns out they were ill with something else amazon also announced that workers can take unlimited time off without pay previously they would have been fired for overdrawing their quota of unpaid time off while some workers have taken unpaid leave because they fear infection or need to care for children who have been sent home from school many more say they cannot afford to go without a paycheck reached for comment about amazon s status as an essential service and safety concerns among workers an amazon spokesperson said that the company had instituted new cleaning procedures taken measures to encourage social distancing in its warehouses and made other changes the health and safety of our employees and contractors around the world continues to be our top priority the spokesperson said in a statement as communities around the world are requiring social distancing we re seeing that our teams much like grocery stores pharmacies and other essential services have a unique role getting customers the critical items they need and this is especially vital for the elderly people with underlying health issues and those sick or quarantined but while workers say they have been told to wipe down their stations and wash their hands with sanitizer they re still expected to maintain the same intense pace which leaves little time to do so the longer you take to do it the faster you re going to have to work later on hamilton said they should allow associates to go to the bathroom to wash their hands regularly as opposed to counting it against them warehouse workers in washington california and minnesota say they are not being screened for symptoms when arriving at work and that their jobs often require them to stand far closer than the six foot distance recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc if you try to stretch your hand it would reach next person said hibaq mohamed who works on the packaging line in a minnesota fulfillment center workers pass items to each other and often share equipment if someone has a virus all of us have it she said william stolz another worker at the facility worries that operating without testing every worker and implementing other safety measures will cause the warehouse to become a major vector for transmission i really think that with this pandemic if amazon is staying open with the risk of the transmission being what it is if this pandemic gets worse they re going to be part of the reason why last week amazon workers in new york began circulating a petition calling for paid sick leave regardless of diagnosis hazard pay the shutdown of facilities if workers test positive for the virus and an end to penalties for not meeting the rate as the coronavirus pandemic unfolds and communities everywhere prepare for the worst amazon workers have become crucial in getting people their food water and sanitation supplies the group wrote safety measures have also been uneven for delivery drivers according to interviews with a dozen drivers most of whom work for third party companies that have contracts with amazon a delivery driver in indianapolis said he was given sanitizing wipes on monday but none after that a driver in virginia said some vans have hand sanitizer and wipes but others don t and that every morning he gathers with 20 to 30 other drivers to collect their keys a driver in georgia said she d been told to sanitize her van and wash her hands but was given no supplies to do so our packages go through so many hands before we even get them she said noting that research found the virus can live on plastic for three days and cardboard for 24 hours she s scared but she can t afford not to work nevertheless some workers are choosing to take the financial hit and stay home for some they need to care for children who are no longer at school others fear becoming infected and passing the virus to others there s more attrition day to day so you don t have the same amount of staffing said a worker at the minnesota facility the reduced staffing comes at a time of unprecedented demand amazon typically hires thousands of temporary workers to handle the surges of prime day and holiday shopping but it lets them go in january it s like prime day every day prime week said one warehouse worker but without the staff to keep up on amazon a growing number of items are showing up as out of stock and deliveries that normally take a day or two now stretch to a week or more the bottleneck is being felt farther down the delivery chain drivers in florida georgia virginia and elsewhere said their routes have been shorter than usual all week when a driver for amazon flex the company s on demand delivery program pulled up to their warehouse this weekend the worker directing traffic said several workers had called out and deliveries were backed up while another worker announced that they were starting hiring that day on tuesday amazon announced that it was hiring 100 000 new workers and raising wages by 2 per hour but it s unclear whether that will be enough to entice people to venture into a crowded warehouse during a pandemic all warehouses right now are going to have a very difficult time maintaining manpower says marc wulfraat of the logistics consulting company mwpvl international e commerce companies like amazon are particularly labor intensive he says because they ship out individual products rather than bulk pallets those buildings that amazon has are extremely populated they have the biggest parking lots of any distribution centers that are being made they re like little cities of two thousand three thousand people working under one roof the only thing i can predict is that even with the extra money that they re offering they are going to be hit hard with throughput shortages workers worry that if amazon s recruitment drive succeeds their warehouses will become even more crowded at a time when other businesses are being ordered to shift to telework reduce staff or close entirely local governments vary on what businesses are considered essential and can maintain operations but so far most orders exempt warehouses food and other categories amazon could reasonably fall under on tuesday amazon announced that it was temporarily halting deliveries of nonessential items to its warehouses an effort to meet surging demand for medical supplies and household staples but also a move that would bolster its case that it needs to keep running many workers agree that the pandemic has transformed their jobs into something more essential though several noted that they re still shipping plenty of phone cases house decorations and other low priority goods we physically cannot keep up with the amount of orders one worker pleaded if you want to buy non essentials put it in your shopping cart get it later because it s coming at the cost of sanitation supplies and food it s people staying fed and people staying healthy but the virus has also transformed their jobs into something more dangerous and if operations are going to continue as everything else shuts down workers feel more substantive safety measures need to be taken you would have something like amazon that does stay open and provide that basic service but the workers would have the full precautions and protection to deal with it because you are working in a pandemic in an area full of people said hamilton the minnesota warehouse worker just like at a hospital that is also mission critical you need the hospital during a pandemic you need that service to make sure you get through it but people in a hospital get protection at least as much as we can he said acknowledging that even medical workers currently lack necessary protective gear if we were to actually prepare better as a society or in amazon s case as a company it would look something like that update march 21 11am et the story has been updated to include a statement from amazon a newsletter about computers
