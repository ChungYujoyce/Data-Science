last updated mar 12 2020 9 57 am edt the following is a transcript of an interview with former fda commissioner scott gottlieb with cbs news margaret brennan that aired sunday march 8 2020 on face the nation in his interview gottlieb warned of the seriousness of the virus as the administration appeared lax in its characterization of the pandemic gottlieb told cbs this is not the flu china didn t shut down their economy because they had a bad flu season margaret brennan joining us now is former fda commissioner dr scott gottlieb good to have you back on the program dr scott gottlieb thanks a lot margaret brennan i want to pick up where we just left off with the surgeon general who said right there at the end that they are switching strategies they are no longer looking to contain the virus they re looking to mitigate it does that me does that mean they re acknowledging what they ve been doing is not working dr gottlieb well we have an epidemic underway here in the united states there s a very large outbreak in seattle that s the one we know about probably one in santa clara or maybe other parts of the country other cities and so we re past the point of containment we have to implement broad mitigation strategies the next two weeks are really going to change the complexion in this country we ll get through this but it s going to be a hard period we re looking at two months probably of difficulty to give you a basis of comparison two weeks ago italy had nine cases ninety five percent of all their cases have been diagnosed in the last 10 days for south korea 85 percent of all their cases have been diagnosed in the last 10 days we re entering that period right now of rapid acceleration and the sooner we can implement tough mitigation steps in places we have outbreaks like seattle the the lower the scope of the epidemic here margaret brennan let s talk about mitigation because when i asked governor inslee what he is doing and i asked him a few ways if he d consider doing what italy just did dr gottlieb right margaret brennan which is essentially trying to i mean they re quarantining a quarter of their population in the most economically vital part of their country this is a massive decision for them to have made when i asked him about doing something like that in washington state he said well they re talking about more distancing and dr gottlieb right margaret brennan more measures like that is it just that it governors like him don t want to say out loud that we may have to do something like what italy did dr gottlieb well i think no state and no city wants to be the first to basically shut down their economy but that s what s going to need to happen states and cities are going to have to act in the interest of the national interest right now to prevent a broader epidemic margaret brennan shut down their economy you mean dr gottlieb close businesses close large gatherings close theaters cancel events i think we need to think about how do we provide assistance to the people of these cities who are going to be hit by hardship as well as the localities themselves to try to give them an incentive to do this right now if there s no economic support to do this you don t want to be the first to go and i think you re seeing that this exposes one of the challenges of our federal system that we leave a lot of authority to state and local officials and there s a good there s good reasons why but in a situation like this we want them to act not just in their local interests but the national interests i think we need to think about both trying to coerce them we can t force them but also try to provide some incentives in terms of support and we re going to end up with a very big federal bailout package here for stricken businesses individuals cities and states we re better off doing it upfront and giving assistance to get them to do the right things than do it on the back end after we ve had a very big epidemic margaret brennan are you telling the white house to do these things you used to work in the administration dr gottlieb i m still having discussions with people in the administration i ve been saying this publicly for you know weeks now i think we should try to get ahead of this right now margaret brennan the president said this morning in a tweet we have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the white house for our attack on the coronavirus and he said the news media is doing everything possible to make us look bad i m asking you this not because i m a member of the media but because we were trying to suss out what reality is versus anxiety for the public is this a perfectly fine tuned plan and is what people are hearing on the news as the president said just to make him look bad dr gottlieb we have a narrow window of opportunity to implement tough measures to try to push down the scope of the epidemic what you want to do is you want to put put in place mitigation steps to reduce the peak number of cases you have to get them below the point at which the health care system gets exhausted because what happened in wuhan china was the health care system got exhausted and fatalities rose quickly what we need right now in terms of a good plan is a systematic approach to what you do in terms of mitigation steps and when cities should be implementing that when margaret brennan and you don t see that happening yet dr gottlieb there is no systematic plan for when a city should close schools when they should tell businesses that they have to telework when they should close movie theaters and cancel large gatherings we leave these decisions to local officials but we really should have a comprehensive plan in terms of recommendations to cities and then some support from the federal government for cities that make that step make that leap if you will margaret brennan so but just on the anxiety question here the administration has compared this to the flu is that how people should be thinking about this dr gottlieb no this is not the flu china didn t shut down their economy because they had a bad flu season the case fatality rate here is going to be higher all through the age ranges this is a more severe disease now it s true that that you don t see the full spectrum of disease that you see with the flu where some people get a mild disease some people get a moderate disease some people get more severe disease here you re seeing a a more binary response some people get a mild moderate disease and some people get very sick but for the people who get very sick this could be a very dangerous disease the case fatality rate is probably going to be about 1 percent and it s not just older americans as tragic as that is and we shouldn t dismiss the burden that this is going to place on older americans if you look at 40 year olds the case fatality rate has been anywhere between point two and point four percent so that means as many as one in 250 40 to 50 year olds who get this could die from it margaret brennan and this data is based on what on china dr gottlieb this data is based on reporting out of margaret brennan on south korea dr gottlieb south korea and china remember when you look at the south korea data the case fatality rate in south korea right now is 0 6 but the time to death is three to six weeks and most of the cases were diagnosed in the last 10 days time to hospitalization is nine to twelve days so most of these people in south korea haven t worked through the severe stages of this of this disease the case fatality rate will go up and i ll one more point you have to make a distinction between the case fatality rate and the infection fatality rate we talk in medicine about the case fatality rate how many people who get the disease will die some people are talking about the infection fatality rate how many people who get the infection will die that s not what we focus on in medicine because we know that some people will get the infection but not be symptomatic we typically don t count those we count people who get the disease and for that the case fatality rate probably it might not reach one percent in our system but it might get close to that it s not 0 1 and that s the seasonal flu and it s not 05 and that s a mild flu season margaret brennan and to get there you need the adequate number of tests out there and testing to happen dr gottlieb which we re getting margaret brennan which we re getting there dr gottlieb yeah margaret brennan all right thank you very much dr gottlieb
