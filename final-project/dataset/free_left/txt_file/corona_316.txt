a coronavirus testing site was going to be set up in syracuse new york not far from where he lives with his partner stephanie keefe the couple who are both artists own a company that makes 3 d printers they knew that medical workers had a shortage of face shields one kind of personal protective equipment p p e and they wondered if they could help on a recent saturday evening after a few hours of research budmen and keefe designed and printed a face shield prototype it wasn t very good budmen told me they modified the design adding sizes for different face shapes making sure there would not be a space between the shield and the wearer s forehead where microbes might be able to reach the eyes nose or mouth with their printers running all night they figured they could make a total of fifty shields the office of the onondaga county executive asked them to make three hundred according to a survey released by the u s conference of mayors on friday about ninety two per cent of the group s members two hundred and thirteen mayors from forty one states and puerto rico representing forty two million americans do not have enough testing kits or face masks for first responders and health care workers eighty five per cent said that their hospitals do not have enough ventilators the u c s f health hospital system in san francisco is running out of nasal swabs for testing and a health care system in texas that serves a million people is in danger of shutting down testing sites because of a shortage of protective gear in new york where people are now waiting in long lines outside of emergency rooms and refrigerated trucks have been deployed as temporary morgues governor andrew cuomo asked the federal government to help the state get thirty thousand ventilators but that help doesn t appear to be coming anytime soon in a recent interview on fox news donald trump said i don t believe you need forty thousand or thirty thousand ventilators you go into major hospitals sometimes and they ll have two ventilators and now all of a sudden they re saying can we order thirty thousand ventilators the new yorker s coronavirus news coverage and analysis are free for all readers across the united states an ad hoc corps of health care workers designers engineers and fabricators like budmen and keefe have stepped into the breach dr paul biddinger the chair of emergency preparedness at massachusetts general hospital recently said at a virtual town hall for the newly formed massachusetts general brigham center for covid innovation that the situation requires an apollo 11 moonshot dr gary tearney a pathologist and the co director of the center said that the initiative was set up to marshal the enormous outpouring of support following the hospital s recent public plea to anyone with 3 d printing and other prototyping capabilities to make personal protective equipment for health care workers we re looking at designs and co rdinating a way to print the most promising tearney told me we have to make sure they are safe for providers and patients while bypassing the standard protracted ways of vetting new equipment he said on a separate call dr reza farivar a neuroscientist at mcgill university likened the effort to the apollo 13 mission you know when they had to build a filtration system out of tubes and so on the new england journal of medicine recently predicted that the united states may need as many as a million ventilators and estimates put the country s current stock at no more than a hundred and sixty thousand some of these are non functional as californians found out last week when los angeles received a hundred and seventy broken ventilators from the federal emergency reserve farivar has put his brain research on hold to organize the code life ventilator challenge a two week competition to design a coronavirus specific ventilator so simple that it can be built and deployed anywhere on the planet the challenge comes with a hundred and forty thousand dollar prize from the montreal general hospital foundation and nearly seven hundred teams from all over the world have signed up to participate this is an all hands on deck situation farivar said all of us are anxious but the antidote to anxiety is creativity a similar competition the covent challenge created by a group of fourth year anesthesiology residents at massachusetts general hospital is just getting under way the ventilators that are used in the i c u cost twenty to thirty thousand dollars and have millions of parts dr richard boyer the founder and director of the challenge told me we re looking for something less sophisticated that can keep someone alive these efforts join a number of global crowdsourced initiatives like projectopenair in portugal open source ventilator in ireland and m i t s e vent project in which participants are trying to create an emergency ventilator by mechanizing a manual resuscitation bag for boyer who is just coming off a fourteen day quarantine after being exposed to the coronavirus the challenge is personal he and the other anesthesiology residents are responsible for intubating patients and controlling their mechanical ventilators one of the people on the center for covid innovation call was dan baker in nashville baker is the global supply chain officer at smile direct club a company that makes invisible aligners it turns out that a printed nylon his company uses can be employed to fabricate face shields on friday smile direct club shipped its first thousand face shields to a hospital in boise idaho baker and his crew are also figuring out how to make n95 like filtration masks that snap together like legos our r d and engineering team was in the lab all weekend baker told me working like mad scientists pulling designs off the internet making different things we re at the final stages of designing and testing to prove the efficacy of the design to enable multiple use that they can be sterilized and used safely the mask is a class ii medical device which requires approval from the f d a once they get the go ahead he estimates that smile direct club can crank out three thousand masks a day repurposing thirty to sixty of the company s industrial 3 d printers to do so last week shortly before the white house was set to announce a collaboration between general motors and ventec life systems to retool a car parts factory to produce ventilators trump balked at its billion dollar price tag he later invoked the defense production act and ordered g m to make ventilators though a g m spokesperson said that this directive did not change its production plans retooling a 3 d printer by contrast is a matter of changing its software to design and model the item being produced industrial 3 d printers are now so sophisticated that they are used to make prosthetics airplane parts and hip replacements with 3 d printing we can go from design to production within an hour ramon pastor the acting president of 3 d printing and manufacturing at hp inc told me but in traditional manufacturing you have to work from a mold and the mold has to be made first pastor who lives and works in barcelona watched the virus rip through his country and ravage the medical community hp has turned its research and development centers in spain and the united states into factories for face masks face shields mask adjusters nasal swabs hands free door openers and respirator parts and hp has mobilized a network of its customers including smile direct club to do the same sending out designs that they can print locally at scale we ve realized that in moments of crisis having digital factories and a distributed supply chain is a good thing pastor said hp is also collaborating with researchers to make splitters so that existing ventilators can be shared and participating in the global effort to design and manufacture field ventilators pastor had just received word that the f d a had approved an exemption for 3 d printed nasal testing swabs and expected that h p would soon be shipping a million of them a week formlabs a 3 d printing company whose printers are used by hospitals to make pre operative models are ramping up the production of nasal swabs to fast track tests gaurav manchanda formlabs director of healthcare estimates that between the company s two hundred in house 3 d printers and those of its customers they will be able to produce up to a hundred thousand swabs a day at peak capacity they will begin to be shipped to testing centers in new york and florida this week it s taken about two weeks to go from an idea to something we can offer patients manchanda said as for keefe and budmen after they produced the three hundred face shields for onondaga county they published their design on the internet and devoted their web site to connecting those in need of p p e health care workers first responders prison medical personnel with those who can print them a local film company is running the logistics the couple s fourteen industrial 3 d printers each of which is able to produce one face shield an hour are running day and night so it seems are budmen and keefe the first time i spoke with budmen it was nearly midnight it s been a little overwhelming he said when we talk to people on the front lines it s hard not to take their urgency as our urgency and their panic as our panic at the same time it s amazing to see how many people are willing to give everything they have to help will be used in accordance with our privacy policy sars cov 2 which honed
