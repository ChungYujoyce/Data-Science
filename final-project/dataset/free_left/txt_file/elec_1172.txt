the big idea hillary clinton is building her delegate lead and bernie sanders is getting angry the vermont senator needed a good night in michigan to change the dynamic of a nominating contest that has been slipping away from him he didn t get it get more must read campaign news delivered directly to your email inbox from the daily 202 instead in the seventh democratic debate sanders found himself on the defensive for the first time ever over his vote against the auto bailout he poorly handled delicate racial and gender dynamics he seemed angry and he came across as someone who is running to make a point not to win he even managed to offend the mentally ill while many pundits are calling the cnn debate a draw after reading the clips and monitoring cable chatter this morning we are convinced it was a clear loss here are five main reasons why 1 clinton caught sanders off guard with her attacks on his vote against the auto industry bailout not only is the best defense a good offense but the element of surprise really matters in these situations clinton s campaign suggested that she would focus more on contrasting herself against the republicans specifically donald trump than attacking sanders sanders on the other hand has always telegraphed his attacks against clinton ahead of time so she knew he was going to come out swinging over her past support for trade deals that are unpopular with the democratic base from nafta to the tpp when he did the former senator from new york pounced the wall street bailouts that sanders loves to brag he voted against included 82 billion for the auto industry she noted if everybody had voted the way he did i believe the auto industry would have collapsed clinton said the money was there and had to be released in order to save the auto industry and 4 million jobs and to begin the restructuring clinton added that barack obama who remains heavily popular with democratic voters especially african americans supported it you were either for saving the auto industry or against it she said i voted to save the auto industry he voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry clinton is a deft tactician and her performance showed that she s been to a few rodeos sanders who said he protected hard working americans from bailing out the crooks of wall street has never been quick on his feet reporters abhor repetition and this was new information after a series of debates that have included a lot of the same back and forth it also played to a parochial concern ahead of michigan s tuesday primary and it happened early enough during the two hour debate that it could make all the stories reporters needed to file before their final print deadlines notably the auto rescue exchange made the lead of the stories about the debate from the flint journal the detroit news and the detroit free press the clinton campaign has already turned a one minute radio ad off the back and forth that will go on the air in michigan today listen here 2 sanders seemed condescending when he cut off clinton the 74 year old got testy even grumpy multiple times she clearly got under his skin with the auto rescue hit sanders hushed clinton as she sought to speak during the ensuing exchange excuse me i m talking he said the audience gasped if you re going to talk tell the whole story clinton replied you ll get your turn he snapped let me tell my story you tell yours sanders said later your story is voting for every disastrous trade amendment and voting for corporate america later in the debate he bristled again let me finish please he also said can i finish please all right sanders may speak with everyone this way he often cuts off reporters of both genders mid sentence but in this case he risked offending female voters who have been wavering on whether to back clinton one of the consequences of the vulgarity in the republican race is the coarsening of our broader national discourse while it is harder to shock the conscience than it used to be sanders still went too far i know bernie needs to stand his ground when being interrupted but his tone made my stomach turn a bit an oft quotedmichigan political analyst sanders kind of went all berniebro on clinton for a moment demdebate this is the clinton campaign staffer in charge ofonline outreach to liberals she was formerly at cosmo and essence magazine oh hell no clinton allies were trying to brand it as a rick lazio moment hillaryclinton comms dir jmpalmieri on demdebate tone we thought he berniesanders sounded pretty desperate and disrespectful that said if team clinton believes sanders was bad just imagine what three clinton trump debates would look like this fall here s a one minute clip that includes sanders shushingclinton 3 sanders once again seemed oblivious on racial issues the biggest gaffe of the night was his response to a pretty straightforward question what racial blind spots do you have his answer showed he has plenty when you are white you don t know what it s like to be living in a ghetto you don t know what it s like to be poor you don t know what it s like to be hassled when you are walking down a street or dragged out of a car sanders said this of course suggests that there are not poor whites and non poor african americans it shows the degree to which the democratic socialist views everything through a class based lens african american voters accounted for 23 percent of the democratic electorate in michigan in the 2008 primary he s already trailing badly among this constituency and talking about the ghetto is not going to help close the gap not sure how the sanders line that white people in america don t know what it s like to live in the ghetto will land demdebate of course many white americans know exactly what it s like to live in the ghetto many including immigrants have do and did and most african americans are not poor the aa poverty rate is too high of course at about 28 but that s not most or all he knows that all black people don t live in ghettos right sanders line about how white people don t know what it s like to be poor seems offensive to both non whites and poor white people watch the answer for yourself incidentally sanders also managed to offend mental health patients with a flip joke he saidthe republican field showswhy money needs to be invested in mental health services our yanan wang reports that this struck a nerve with some i m part of the 18 2 american adults with mental health problems tweeted one woman bigotry is not a mental illness 4 sanders sounded like a protest candidate who is running to make a point we are going to stay in this campaign to the convention in july he said a few hours before the debate saying what happens in the primaries will not deter him when hydraulic fracking came up clinton gave a characteristically nuanced answer that tried to wink and nod to all sides when sanders turn came he said my answer is a lot shorter no it s a reminder that bernie is not ultimately focused on how to win states like ohio in november but he wants to pull the conversation leftward hrc is running as a leader of a loose coalition of interests sanders is running as a champion of liberal interests slate s jamelle bouie explained it s noteworthy that hrc is strongest among most stalwart democratic voters sanders among most ideological democratic voters in a real sense hrc and sanders are running for two completely different jobs sanders was also widely mocked for invoking wall street when asked how he d solve the lead water crisis in flint until i heard bernie tonight i had no idea the flint crisis was the fault of wall street the military industrial complex senator sanders how do you plan to defeat isis how about we send in wall street and solve two problems at once crowd goes wild bernie can you talk about anything but wall street serious question the presidency is not a single issue job onetrickpony demdebate i appreciate that hillary offers more specifics sanders ideas are more audacious and exciting but unclear this is the contrast she s detailed on education policy and the parent s questions he says think big and doesn t do details 5 sanders failed to change the underlying dynamic of the race clinton led sanders by nearly 200 pledged delegates after super tuesday while bernie won nebraska and kansas on saturday and maine on sunday clinton appears to have actually expanded her delegate lead because of a big win in louisiana ahead of tomorrow s primary polls show sanders trailing by double digits in michigan where he hoped to make an impressive stand an nbc wsj marist survey released yesterday has clinton up 17 points 57 40 among likely primary voters the same poll had trump up 19 points over cruz chris cillizza who names sanders the loser of the night explains that the bar is getting higher for sanders if you think wall street is the problem for much of what ails the country you were for sanders before this debate and certainly for him after it too but as we know from the first 40 percent or so of states that have voted there aren t enough of those people to make him the nominee sanders didn t knock clinton off her game in any meaningful way making the debate a loss for him like most of the other dem debates both did well enough to please their supporters but likely changed little about the race demdebate bloomberg s mark halperin who gives hillary a b and bernie a b says sanders lacked a strategy to score a definitive win and was for some too tetchy with his opponent on several occasions many good tactical moments on core issues but built no mosaic of contrast to knock down the front runner other storylines the war for the soul of the democratic party is just beginning few of the attacks from either candidate were new but their postures onstage made it clear that even if the ultimate outcome of the nomination may soon be a foregone conclusion the fight over what the democratic party stands for will go on writes slate s josh voorhees the race for the democratic nomination may be effectively over or at least well on its way but the populist fire that s being stoked by sanders campaign isn t dying down writes abc s rick klein clinton went farther in supporting gun control than she usually does i think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the number of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms she said the post s fact checkers highlight 13 suspicious or notable claims from the debate five highlights

president obama s nomination to the supreme court focusing on jurists with scant discernable ideology and limited judicial records as part of a strategy to surmount fierce republican opposition amy goldstein jerry markon and sari horwitz report in a story that just posted based on interviews with legal experts and others including some who have spoken in recent days with obama administration officials involved in the vetting process the president is leaning towards a sitting federal judge to fill the vacancy and probably one the senate confirmed with bipartisan support during his tenure who is on the short list the candidates under consideration include two judges who joined the influential u s court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in 2013 sri srinivasan and patricia a millett jane l kelly an iowan appointed that year to the u s court of appeals for the 8th circuit paul j watford a judge since 2012 on the california based u s court of appeals for the 9th circuit

their positions on any divisive legal question facing the nation and the courts according to an examination of the judges public statements and writings their mentors and their career paths in the

a longer paper trail merrick garland chief judge of the u s court of appeals in washington he is a moderate who has served on the court for nearly two decades and was considered by obama for a previous supreme court vacancy according to one person knowledgeable about the vetting process the white house initially thought about attorney general loretta lynch but she is no longer under consideration nancy reagan dies at 94 first lady was a defining figure of the 1980s by lois romano the cause was congestive heart failure as first lady from 1981 to 1989 mrs reagan had a knack for inviting controversy from her spending habits to her request that the white house abide by an astrologer when planning the president s schedule but the controversies during her years as first lady often obscured her profound influence on one of the most popular presidents in modern history they were a universe of two and their legendary devotion helped define the reagan presidency president obama said sunday that mrs reagan had redefined the role of first lady and he praised her for becoming an advocate for alzheimer s disease treatments and research after her husband was diagnosed in 1994 mrs reagan was often seen as the bad cop to her husband s congenial good cop putting her at odds with his senior staff who wanted more exposure for the man known as the great communicator after john w hinckley jr attempted to assassinate her husband in 1981 mrs reagan kept his senior aides and a sympathetic public at bay while he convalesced she argued vociferously against his running for reelection in 1984 in part because of fears about his safety always working behind the scenes she was involved in the hiring and firing of senior staff at pivotal junctures she insisted over the objections of some senior advisers that her husband publicly apologize for the government s secret arms sales to iran a scandal that rocked his presidency it proved to be the right call she also

heriberto su rez cuba s commissioner of baseball more on the democratic race time sanders long history with alternative medicine by sam frizell as sanders medical records make clear he s kept his good health through regular visits to the doctor but he also has a long history of interest in alternative medicine including a few ideas far outside the mainstream from linking sexual abstinence to cancer to blaming disease on the ails of society sanders has professed health opinions as alternative as his politics he penned essays in his twenties arguing that sexual repression causes cancer in women suggesting through his late forties that the disease has psychosomatic causes those ideas are nowhere to be found in sanders current campaign proposals but he has boosted them in the past including in some freelance columns in alternative newspapers when the spirit is broken when the life force is squashed cancer becomes a possibility sanders wrote his views on health appear to have changed over the years but they began with some radical ideas clintoninsisted that a former staffer getting immunity to talk about her private email server is a good thing when the justice department granted immunity to former clinton aide bryan pagliano who set up her private email server in 2009 some legal analysts interpreted it as an ominous sign but clinton claims differently in an appearance on cbs s face the nation host john dickerson asked whether she views the immunity given to pagliano as good news clinton replied yeah i do absolutely there is no basis to worry about an indictment clinton said it s a security review i m delighted that he has agreed to cooperate and i think that we ll be moving toward a resolution of this callum borchers the louisiana democratic party announced hrc will

costa conservative donor randy kendrick is rallying other wealthy contributors to finance a last ditch campaign against trump matea gold scoops this morning the wife of arizona diamondbacks owner ken kendrick who is active in the koch political network said the final straw was the way trump handled a question about former kkk leader david duke that was just a dog whistle to racists before southern

significant donation to anti trump super pac our principles this makes them the second mlb owners to support the organization which received 3 million from chicago cubs family matriarch marlene

for the highly skilled yet no skills are required of the wealthy chinese being courted by a subtitled video to finance a huge trump branded tower in new jersey the video was produced to help raise millions through a controversial government program known as eb 5 offering expedited visas to foreign investors overwhelmingly from china in exchange for investing at least 500 000 in a project promising to create jobs foreigners receive a two year visa with a good chance of obtaining permanent residency for them and their families the jersey city project has raised 50 million a quarter of

knew him i flew in the helicopter with ivana and the kids i like trump but it pisses me off he denies knowing my father trump s response to questions about libutti underscores a recurring theme his tendency to minimize or deny associations with unsavory characters with whom he has done business trump first faced questions about his dealings with libutti later banned from new jersey casinos for his ties to mafia boss john gotti in 1991 according to isikoff that probe resulted in a 200 000 fine against the trump plaza for violating anti discrimination laws additionally libutti referenced
