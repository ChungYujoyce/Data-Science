advertisement supported by congressional memo the house s vote on friday to allow lawmakers to work from afar will fundamentally change how congress operates by nicholas fandos when the house of representatives acted on friday to allow remote voting and virtual hearings the coronavirus pandemic officially succeeded in doing what philadelphia s yellow fever outbreak of 1793 the spanish influenza of 1918 the sept 11 2001 attacks and generations of agitators for institutional change never could untethering congress from its mandate to come together physically those earlier crises prompted novel contingency plans and prolonged recesses but for 231 years since the founding members of the body first laid out their rules in 1789 to cast a vote or fully participate in a hearing lawmakers were required to be present notwithstanding the state of the nation to be a congress as the word suggests people had to come together no member shall vote on any questions the rules adopted by the first house say in any case where he was not present when the question was put no longer with friday s party line vote 217 to 189 as long as the public health emergency persists lawmakers from alaska to florida need not leave the safety of their own homes to question witnesses at a hearing sign subpoenas or vote on legislation the new rules immediately allow for any member to vote remotely by giving precise binding instructions to a proxy who is able to be present on the house floor they also provide pending certification for a process in which lawmakers will eventually be able to cast their votes technologically from home either via a secure online portal or a video conferencing system in redefining what present means in the 21st century democrats who control the chamber have stressed that they are simply trying to find a way for the house a coequal branch of government and they argue a crucial counterweight to president trump to perform its basic functions at a time when the coronavirus has made congregating in washington a dire health risk they promise the changes will only be temporary point to similar moves by legislatures around the world including british parliament and insist that the alternative is a house that cannot function as intended it is in keeping with the vitality of the house that we are doing this not in opposition to the traditions of the house speaker nancy pelosi of california said before the vote but in going forward so quickly with so major a change democrats are nevertheless plunging the house into a constitutional and institutional unknown republicans almost reflexively are opposed to the changes and have denounced them as an unconstitutional power grab by democrats who control the chamber but beyond the partisan considerations a broad cross section of congressional scholars parliamentary experts and former officials warn that the decision could have unintended and long lasting consequences altering the course of the body in fundamental ways that few rules changes in the last two centuries have most agree the shift to remote voting is unlikely to prompt a real constitutional challenge even if some third party were to sue to try to stop the plan the courts tend to be reluctant to second guess the ability of either chamber of congress to set its own rules and function as it sees fit the more nagging questions even to those who support the changes have to do with what happens next what will become of the in person back slapping ear whispering wheeling and dealing that powers the congress even if that is not a requirement the institution is built on that practice and that understanding said michael stern a former senior legal counsel to the house who writes about congressional legal issues it is not built upon the idea that members can sort of legislate independently from each other he added there is a pretty strong argument that if you cut that out you are losing something and you may not know how significant it is until it s gone losses may be hard to measure lawmakers who are outfitted with large staffs employed to offer expert advice and draft the finer points of bills nonetheless often do much of their most consequential legislative work in person they hammer out a compromise amendment in a hushed conversation during a committee meeting they provoke debates they whip votes on the floor of the house find unexpected allies and have to explain themselves face to face to their peers when they go back on their word daniel schuman the policy director of demand progress a progressive organization that presses for government transparency and accountability said the absence of such interactions would accelerate trends in the modern congress that have already concentrated power in the hands of the majority particularly the speaker at the expense of committees and ad hoc policy alliances between like minded republicans and democrats who controls the mute button who controls where the camera is positioned he asked speculating about a future of congressional debates by video conference do you silence the minority do you give more power to the committee chair at the expense of the regular committee members that is a problem because it looks like you are shifting where the power goes some republicans privately support a remote house but sided with their leaders on friday and voted against it anyway the vast majority though have resisted the changes calling democrats decision to move ahead over their objections the most significant power grab in the history of congress on the house floor on friday an unmasked representative jim jordan republican of ohio accused democrats of suspending the constitution and setting up a scheme where just 22 members with 10 proxies in their back pocket could do the business of 300 million great people in this country but their own proposed solution to begin coming back to work in person and to rely on daily rapid testing comes with steep risks both to members health and public image if they are seen as cutting to the front of the united states very long testing line the senate even more reluctant to abandon its storied traditions than the house has taken a more conservative approach it has begun to allow senators and even witnesses to participate in hearings remotely by videoconference but senator mitch mcconnell republican of kentucky and the majority leader rebuffed a bipartisan push for emergency remote voting and has reconvened senators in the capitol to something approximating normal business democrats argue that the house s rules have always been malleable to adapt to the needs of the country at the time even if tradition has provided guideposts representative jim mcgovern democrat of massachusetts and the chairman of the rules committee who drafted the changes said he was just as worried about a slippery slope as republicans were and conceded his plan was not perfect but he said he was willing to take a risk to get the institution functioning again the more i see what is happening the more i came to the conclusion we have to do something or we are not going to be able to function he said we ve just passed trillions of dollars to address this crisis we need to do oversight much of the anxiety may come from the speed of the changes in march when the scope of the pandemic had yet to be felt at the capitol ms pelosi and her leadership team scoffed at the idea of a remote congress we are captains of the ship she said then as she sought to quell any push by the rank and file for a work from home congress a little over two months later with many states and the district of columbia under stay home orders and social distancing edicts she pushed through rules changes that effectively allow that ship to be steered remotely if necessary it took far longer nearly a century of pushing for the house to add an electronic voting system it was nearly 50 years after the advent of commercial television before leaders acquiesced and allowed cameras to broadcast its proceedings after the sept 11 2001 attacks congress studied and debated for years before making modest rules changes that would allow it to better function in the event of a national catastrophe even if the house returns to something approaching normalcy the use of remote voting now could provide a precedent and justification for its expanded use in the future said raymond w smock the former in house historian of the house there may be pressure to continue that way these members are overworked to begin with he said i see it as a way to dissolve the cohesiveness of both the house and the senate because there is pressure to be someplace else all the time doing other things
