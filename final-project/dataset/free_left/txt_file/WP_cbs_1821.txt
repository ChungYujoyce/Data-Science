million men and women in uniform also is working on fighter planes the first chinese built aircraft carrier and a new generation of nuclear powered submarines one of the most closely watched weapons unveiled tuesday was the dongfeng 17 a hypersonic ballistic nuclear missile believed capable of breaching all existing anti missile shields deployed by the u s and its allies some analysts have called the missile a threat to regional stability because its speed allows far less time to determine whether to fire nuclear weapons in response that speed and its use of multiple independently maneuverable re entry vehicles to deliver its warheads makes it far more difficult to detect and intercept the df 17 s hypersonic glide vehicle technology also permits it to fly at a much lower altitude just prior to delivering its warhead further frustrating attempts to detect and intercept another missile displayed the dongfeng 41 is believed to have a range of up to 9 400 miles which would make it world s longest range military missile analysts say it may be able to carry as many as 10 warheads to hit separate targets the party s emphasis on missiles and other long range weapons reflects beijing s
