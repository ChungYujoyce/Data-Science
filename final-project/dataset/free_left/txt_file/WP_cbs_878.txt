wednesday joe biden was leading bernie sanders in total allocated delegates 1 093 to 802 that means 1 668 delegates just under half of the pledged delegates available are still up for grabs five states have so far postponed democratic presidential primaries ohio was slated to hold its primary on march 17 with 136 pledged delegates available it has moved in person voting to june 2 read more on the primary shakeups and what to expect in the coming weekshere from the candidates joe biden as president trump was addressing reporters from the white house podium biden s campaign aimed to counter program and released a statement criticizing the president s response cbs news campaign reporter bo ericksonreports much has been made of changes in the president s tone in recent days biden said in the statement but with our health care system at risk a virus spreading our economy on the brink and so many lives at stake it s time to be less interested in the president s words and more focused on his actions or inaction the campaign also reiterated steps biden believes the trump administration should be taking to address the spreading virus his suggestions include instituting a transparent reporting process regarding testing expanding the number of beds and facilities ready to accept sick patients and surging medical personnel to the places that need it most biden also blamed the lack of medical equipment on trump s misguided trade war with china which led to tariffs on essential medical supplies and reduced their availability in the united states as biden continues to practice social distancing at his home in delaware his campaign also took time after last night s latest contest to forecast his growing delegate lead over bernie sanders deputy campaign manager kate bedingfield calculated in a memo that in order to close the delegate deficit sanders would need to win every remaining contest by roughly 40 points she also noted biden s delegate lead at this point is three times as large as barack obama s was in 2008 and hillary clinton s was in 2016 bernie sanders sanders staffers s phones were buzzing this morning and afternoon as the senator s presidential campaign prospects seemed more dire than ever this morning campaign manager faiz shakir released a statement saying the next primary contest is at least three weeks away sen sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign shakir also noted that sanders attention is fully focused on covid 19 soon after shakir wrote to supporters saying that sanders and his wife jane would be returning to their burlington vermont home tonight to evaluate the campaign s future in light of the three losses last night no sugarcoating it last night did not go the way we wanted he wrote notably this email did not contain the otherwise ubiquitous request for campaign funding along those same lines it was reported today that the sanders camp was pulling facebook ads communications director mike casca toldcbs news campaign reporter cara kortethat the move was to conserve resources that was reason enough to scramble until an errant tweet released briefly this afternoon incorrectly stated that sanders was suspending his campaign that report was quickly denied to cbs news here s what we know the mathematic outlook for sanders is bleak to surpass biden s delegate lead sanders would have to trounce biden in an unprecedented way in primaries to come since that is unlikely sanders is now in a position to choose whether or not he fights on or throws in the towel sanders is unusual in that he represents a movement as much as he does a candidacy there are some who argue his campaign should go on so that themovementcontinues others say that carrying on a losing battle only bruises the validity of the cause no aide or ally can predict what sanders will do cbs news has been told that he will consult with his family and supporters in the days or possibly weeks ahead watch for communication between the sanders and biden camps if sanders is to concede he would presumably want something in return perhaps the reassurance that his agenda which

from the unofficial number count turnout in yesterday s primaries was 25 7 a concrete result from a state that decided to hold its primary in the face of the covid 19 pandemic while more numbers from mail and early vote ballots will be coming in the next two weeks the turnout is a definite drop from the 46 5 turnout in 2016 and the 33 average in chicago where precincts started the day with missing voting machines and confusion with polling locations overall turnout was around 31 in rockford illinois where turnout was around 26 executive director of the board of elections stacey bixby toldcbs

tuberville and sessions will compete in the runoff in july to take on incumbent democrat senator doug jones in november in the house the marquee house race last night in illinois 3rd saw a tight finish though with 99 of precincts in progressive candidate marie newman has officially beaten incumbent congressman dan lipinski it is a win for a progressive movement that saw losses with other house backed candidates like jessica cisneros in texas 28th and a 3 0 sweep for biden in all three states on tuesday this is a critical victory for the progressive movement in showing that voters are ready for a new generation of progressive leadership in the democratic party an email from justice democrats which backed newman said in a call with reporters newman toldcbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarrothat while her win shows the progressive movement is strong she was able to win because of a wider coalition of democratic voters i have been fortunate and blessed enough to be endorsed by everyone from cory booker kirsten gillibrand bernie sanders elizabeth warren pramila jayapal jan schakowsky aoc ro khanna every part of the party understands that my platform is in alignment with my district and alignment with the district is really the most important thing she said she ousted lipinski who has been representing southwest chicago and its suburbs since 2004 when his father and former congressman bill lipinski named him as his replacement i m very proud of the work i ve done and my father did before me we can talk more about the legacy later on but i am very proud of what i have done as a representative in the district and what my father did in the district lipinski said in a press conference wednesday where he officially conceded we ran a good campaign against tremendous headwinds but as the numbers stand right now it appears that i will not prevail in 2018 newman lost by two points to lipinski a blue dog democrat who is notably pro life she is going to be the likely winner in november since a republican hasn t held office here since 1975 and hillary clinton won this district by 15 points in 2016 another notable race result could be seen in illinois 14th district which also encompasses parts of chicago s suburbs dairy business owner jim oberweis won with 25 6 of the vote in a crowded republican field this has been a spirited and well fought campaign i have been disappointed in the negative tone that the campaign has taken but all of that is behind us now is the time for us as republicans to come together and finish the mission which is to defeat lauren underwood in november he said in a statement last night this district is a target for house republicans after democrat congresswoman lauren underwood flipped the district in 2018 but oberweis is a perennial illinois candidate who has lost in bids for senate governor and this same district in 2008 other illinois gop results like jeanne ives and illinois 6th and particularly mary miller in illinois 15th bode well for efforts to add more republican women in the house there are currently 11 active incumbent women republicans though miller s nomination in a safely republican open seat in southeast illinois could add to the ranks in champaign county the only county won by sanders democrat betsy dirksen londrigan easily won her primary and is set for a
