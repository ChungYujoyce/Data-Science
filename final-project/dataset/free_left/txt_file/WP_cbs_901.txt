saudi arabia s crown prince also discusses the impact of a september attack on saudi oil facilities and responds to allegations that a female saudi activist has been tortured in prison crown prince mohammad bin salman rules saudi arabia day to day on behalf of his father the king the heir to the throne is a man of contradictions he presents himself as a young progressive leader a supporter of women in the workplace and famously behind the wheel but he is also conducting a bloody war in yemen stands accused of targeting civilians and children and employing famine as a weapon he s rounded up political dissidents and the cia believes he is behind the brutal murder of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi a prominent critic of the crown prince earlier this month after an iranian missile and drone attack on saudi oil facilities the united states committed additional american troops to help defend the saudis it was nearly midnight by the time we spoke with crown prince mohammad bin salman on tuesday at the royal court in jeddah there was a lot to ask our first question was about the death a year ago of jamal khashoggi something the crown prince has never discussed in a television interview norah o donnell did you order the murder of jamal khashoggi crown prince mohammad bin salman translation absolutely not this was a heinous crime but i take full responsibility as a leader in saudi arabia especially since it was committed by individuals working for the saudi government norah o donnell what does that mean that you take responsibility crown prince mohammad bin salman translation when a crime is committed against a saudi citizen by officials working for the saudi government as a leader i must take responsibility this was a mistake and i must take all actions to avoid such a thing in the future on october 2 2018 jamal khashoggi entered the saudi consulate in istanbul and never left turkish investigators allege a saudi hit team was waiting for him they report he was killed almost immediately and that his body was dismembered to this day his remains have not been found saudi public prosecutors have charged 11 men including the deputy intelligence chief major general ahmed asiri saud al qahtani once the prince s powerful right hand man has been implicated but not formally charged norah o donnell the world wants the answer to this question how did you not know about this operation crown prince mohammad bin salman translation some think that i should know what three million people working for the saudi government do daily it s impossible that the three million would send their daily reports to the leader or the second highest person in the saudi government norah o donnell two of your closest advisors who are accused of orchestrating this plot were fired by the king removed from your inner circle the question is how could you not know if this was carried out by people who are close to you crown prince mohammad bin salman translation today the investigations are being carried out and once charges are proven against someone regardless of their rank it will be taken to court no exception made norah o donnell i ve read what the saudi prosecutor has said about those that are charged in this murder and it s gruesome the details when you heard that people close to you and in your government carried out such a grisly murder and that the american government thinks that you ordered it what did you think crown prince mohammad bin salman translation i believe what you mentioned is not correct there isn t an official statement announced by the american government in this regard there isn t clear information or evidence that someone close to me did something to that effect there are charges and they re being investigated but again you cannot imagine the pain that we suffered especially as the saudi government from a crime such as this one norah o donnell the cia has concluded with medium to high confidence that you personally targeted khashoggi and you probably ordered his death crown prince mohammad bin salman translation i hope this information to be brought forward if there is any such information that charges me i hope it is brought forward publicly norah o donnell what kind of threat is a newspaper columnist to the kingdom of saudi arabia that he would deserve to be brutally murdered crown prince mohammad bin salman translation there is no threat from any journalist the threat to saudi arabia is from such actions against a saudi journalist this heinous crime that took place in a saudi consulate norah o donnell i spoke with a prominent u s senator before i came here and he said because of what happened with jamal khashoggi and what s happened in yemen that in his words there s not a lot of good will around here in congress for saudi arabia how much has it hurt the relationship crown prince mohammad bin salman translation the relationship is much larger than that and this is a heinous incident and painful to all of us our role is to work day and night to overcome this and to make sure our future is much better than anything that happened in the past on saturday september 14 just before 4 a m an onslaught of more than two dozen iranian made drones and low flying cruise missiles crippled the kingdom s oil production these images never before released are from the saudi state oil company known as aramco norah o donnell this attack hit the heart of saudi arabia s oil industry were you blindsided crown prince mohammad bin salman translation i might disagree with you this attack didn t hit the heart of the saudi energy industry but rather the heart of the global energy industry it disrupted 5 5 of the world s energy needs the needs of the u s and china and the whole world norah o donnell the kingdom is the world s number one importer of arms of military equipment billions of dollars spent on equipment how could it not prevent an attack like this crown prince mohammad bin salman translation saudi arabia is almost the size of a continent it is bigger than all of western europe we have 360 degrees of threats it s challenging to cover all of this fully saudia arabia s air defenses include u s patriot and hawk missile systems which were not designed to shoot down drones norah o donnell what do you think was the strategic reason that iran struck aramco crown prince mohammad bin salman translation i believe it s stupidity there is no strategic goal only a fool would attack 5 of global supplies the only strategic goal is to prove that they are stupid and that is what they did norah o donnell secretary mike pompeo has called what iran did in his words an act of war was it an act of war crown prince mohammad bin salman translation of course yes norah o donnell what kind of effect would a war between saudi arabia and iran have on the region crown prince mohammad bin salman translation the region represents about 30 of the world s energy supplies about 20 of global trade passages about 4 of the world gdp imagine all of these three things stop this means a total collapse of the global economy and not just saudi arabia or the middle east countries iran appears willing to risk war to improve its position after the trump administration pulled out of the iran nuclear deal the u s imposed tough economic sanctions iran s president hassan rouhani will not negotiate until the sanctions are lifted it is a standoff the crown prince told us all options should remain on the table crown prince mohammad bin salman translation if the world does not take a strong and firm action to deter iran we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests oil supplies will be disrupted and oil prices will jump to unimaginably high numbers that we haven t seen in our lifetimes norah o donnell does it have to be a military response crown prince mohammad bin salman translation i hope not norah o donnell why not crown prince mohammad bin salman translation because the political and peaceful solution is much better than the military one norah o donnell do you think that president trump should sit down with president rouhani and craft a new deal crown prince mohammad bin salman translation absolutely this is what president trump is asking for this is what we all ask for however it is the iranians who don t want to sit at the table since 2015 the united states has provided limited support to saudi arabia in their war against an iranian backed militia to their south in yemen the united nations estimates that the conflict has left more than 19 000 civilians dead or injured 10 million people are starving norah o donnell it is called the worst humanitarian crisis in the world what s the solution crown prince mohammad bin salman translation first if iran stops its support of the houthi militia the political solution will be much easier today we open all initiatives for a political solution in yemen we hope this happens today rather than tomorrow norah o donnell you re saying tonight that you want to negotiate an end to the war in yemen crown prince mohammad bin salman translation we are doing this every day but we try to turn this discussion into an actual implementation on the ground and the houthis a few days ago announced a ceasefire from their side we consider it a positive step to push for more serious and active political dialogue norah o donnell why after five years are you optimistic tonight that a ceasefire could hold that could lead to an end to the war in yemen crown prince mohammad bin salman translation as a leader i must always be optimistic every day if i m a pessimist i should leave my post and work somewhere else in saudi arabia social change is happening slowly more than two years after the crown prince came to power most women still cover their faces and we struggled to find any who would speak with us on camera women recently won the right to drive by royal decree guardianship laws that prevent women from travelling without a man s permission have also been relaxed but some of the women who fought for these rights have lost their own freedom in the process norah o donnell there are about a dozen female activists that have been detained for more than a year why were they put in jail crown prince mohammad bin salman translation saudi arabia is a country governed by laws some of these laws i might disagree with personally but as long as they are now existing laws they must be respected until they are reformed one of the most prominent female activists who fought for the right to drive is loujain al hathloul she has been held in a saudi prison for over a year norah o donnell is it time to let her go crown prince mohammad bin salman translation this decision is not up to me it s up to the public prosecutor and it s an independent public prosecutor norah o donnell her family says that she has been tortured in prison is that right crown prince mohammad bin salman translation if this is correct it is very heinous islam forbids torture the saudi laws forbid torture human conscience forbids torture and i will personally follow up on this matter norah o donnell you will personally follow up on it crown prince mohammad bin salman translation without a doubt norah o donnell publicly you have pledged to change saudi arabia to transform the economy to talk about a moderate islam to allow women to have more rights yet there is a crackdown and a jailing of women who raise issues about things that need to change in saudi arabia that is the perception that you do not support women s rights and human rights and that these are concrete examples of women who have been jailed crown prince mohammad bin salman translation this perception pains me it pains me when some people look at the picture from a very narrow angle i hope that everybody comes to the kingdom of saudi arabia and sees the reality and meets women and saudi citizens and judges for themselves norah o donnell what lessons have you learned and have you made mistakes crown prince mohammad bin salman translation even prophets made mistakes so how come we as humans expect not to make mistakes the important thing is that we learn from these mistakes and not repeat them produced by keith sharman associate producer alex j diamond norah o donnell is the
