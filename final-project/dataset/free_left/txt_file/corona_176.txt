with congress on tax cuts and other measures after the worst stock market drop in more than a decade the president who played down the virus threat earlier in the day made an unscheduled evening appearance in the white house briefing room after two republican members of congress who have spent time with him in recent days including one who just rode with him on air force one put themselves into quarantine following exposure to the virus also putting himself into isolation was mark meadows the president s newly designated white house chief of staff mr meadows who was named to the role

conference while he tested negative for the coronavirus his office said he would remain quarantined until wednesday out of caution while none of the three men have displayed symptoms the threat of the virus coming so close to the president represented a new stage of the outbreak even as organizations across the country restricted travel and canceled gatherings mr trump made no mention of his own contacts with the affected lawmakers but his spokeswoman stephanie grisham later said the president would not be tested because he has neither had prolonged close contact with confirmed patients nor does he have any symptoms but clearly unsettled by the plunging markets and the potential effect on his re election prospects mr trump offered an economic response without any new health measures speaking with reporters he said he would meet on tuesday with republican congressional leaders to discuss a very substantial payroll tax cut and legislation to protect hourly wage earners who miss work because of the virus he said he would also explore expanding loans by the small business administration he did not provide any details it s not their fault he said of affected workers it s not our country s fault this was something that we were thrown into and we re going to handle it and we have been handling it very well he added the main thing is that we re taking care of the american public and we will be taking care of the american public the developments came on one of the most jarring days of mr trump s presidency as markets plummeted infections rose schools and universities shut down classes and other nations imposed drastic travel restrictions with individual lawmakers now heading into isolation members of congress contemplated whether it should recess altogether for the foreseeable future to guard against a further spread among the nation s legislators the tension of the day was reflected on air force one as it made its way back to washington from florida representative matt gaetz republican of florida boarded the plane steps behind the president in orlando where mr trump held a campaign fund raiser only to learn shortly after takeoff that he had been in contact with an infected person at a conservative conference late last month he then essentially quarantined himself in the air sitting alone in a compartment of the plane as the jet raced toward washington its television screens were tuned to fox news showing the slow motion progress of a cruise ship with 21 infected passengers heading to a port in oakland calif followed by overhead cameras under a virus ship watch chyron while a red box in the lower left hand corner showed the sinking dow jones industrial average which finished the day down more than 2 000 points or about 7 percent mr trump who regularly invokes the market as an indicator of his success on twitter initially blamed the meltdown on falling oil prices and the news media even though most market analysts attributed the bulk of it to concern about the effect of the virus on the global economy he made no mention of it when he met with reporters in the evening he did praise his own decision last month to restrict entry to the united states by foreign citizens who had been to china in the previous 14 days the big decision was early when we shut down our borders he said overstating the action he took we were the first ones ever to do that we ve never done that in our country before we would have a situation that would be a lot more dire mr trump has resisted canceling campaign rallies despite other large events being scrubbed and a campaign aide said he would announce another one on tuesday but his campaign on monday called off a women for trump bus tour featuring his daughter in law lara trump and other top election surrogates including mercedes schlapp whose husband oversees the conservative political action conference after which an attendee tested positive for the virus that attendee came into contact with mr meadows mr gaetz and at least three other republican lawmakers who have now quarantined themselves mr gaetz who attended events with mr trump at his mar a lago estate in palm beach on friday and saturday night met up with the president again on monday at the orlando fund raiser mr trump then invited mr gaetz to join him on air force one back to washington in an interview mr gaetz said that he received a phone call from his chief of staff as the plane was taking off telling him that a picture had been found of him with the infected conference attendee 11 days earlier meaning he had potentially been exposed to the virus he said he told john mcentee a top white house official and asked to be separated from the other passengers he walked me back to a room toward the rear of air force one mr gaetz said i went in there by myself a physician traveling with the president then came back and told him that because he had no symptoms 11 days later he probably had not contracted the virus but mr gaetz said he remained apart from the rest of the passengers for the rest of the flight as air force one was landing mr trump summoned him to the front of the plane i would not go into his office mr gaetz said i stood outside of it he just wanted to see if i was all right which i am he said the president used humor to lighten the situation he asked if i needed to be wrapped in cellophane mr gaetz said i told him that i was willing to jump out of the plane without a parachute if necessary he added that he was tested after landing and expects his results back on tuesday mr gaetz drew attention last week when he wore a bulky gas mask in the capitol for the vote on an 8 3 billion emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus days later a resident of his florida district died from the coronavirus prompting some to suggest that he had made light of the risks mr gaetz denied that saying he was making a serious point about the risk to lawmakers who interact with so many people representative doug collins republican of georgia who toured the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta with mr trump on friday likewise went into isolation on monday after being told by the c d c that he too had been spotted in a photograph with the infected person at the conference mr collins was on the tarmac when mr trump landed in atlanta on friday and shook the president s hand before joining him on the tour of the c d c while i am not experiencing any symptoms i have decided to self quarantine out of an abundance of caution mr collins wrote on his twitter feed mr meadows was told over the weekend that he too might have come into contact with the infected attendee but tested negative his congressional office said in a statement while he s experiencing zero symptoms under doctors standard precautionary recommendations he ll remain at home until the 14 day period expires this wednesday the statement said updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities mr trump started monday playing down the virus reminding americans that tens of thousands of people die of the ordinary flu every year nothing is shut down life the economy go on he wrote on twitter at this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of coronavirus with 22 deaths think about that he dismissed the effect of the outbreak in fueling monday s market meltdown saudi arabia and russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil he wrote that and the fake news is the reason for the market drop he even sought to cast the decline in oil prices in positive terms good for the consumer gasoline prices coming down he wrote the white house has debated how to proceed with some advisers to the president advocating more aggressive action and others urging caution for fear of the economic impact senior officials engaged in spirited talks last week about whether to warn older americans against traveling on cruise ships or to go even further than that as those discussions intensified at least eight members of the administration s coronavirus task force including those with medical backgrounds as well as cabinet officials like steven mnuchin the treasury secretary and alex m azar ii the health and human services secretary recommended sending the cruise notice but two senior white house officials joe grogan the head of the domestic policy council and larry kudlow the president s national economic adviser argued that they should consider the effects of such a move on 150 000 jobs in florida where the tourism industry could be particularly hard hit according to two senior administration officials ultimately the proponents of a notice won out and the state department posted it on its website on sunday the white house doctor who treats mr trump has attended meetings related to the coronavirus administration officials said and has monitored how many events are put on the president s schedule he has cautioned against overloading mr trump s day to the point where he gets run down according to one senior administration official who added that the doctor has given such guidance in the past as well another official asserted that nothing out of the ordinary had been suggested by the doctor mr trump has asked advisers whether he needs to reduce how many hands he shakes but he has shown reluctance to change his habits long before the current outbreak he made a practice of slathering his hands with sanitizer once he finishes with crowds at the orlando airport on monday he made a point of shaking hands with supporters waiting for him peter baker and annie karni reported from washington and maggie haberman from new york noah weiland contributed reporting from washington
