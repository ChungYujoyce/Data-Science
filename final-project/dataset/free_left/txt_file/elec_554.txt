 first read is a morning briefing from meet the press and the nbc political unit on the day s most important political stories and why they matter status quo heading into the holidays after two debates in the past week several new controversies and even a new saturday night live episode lampooning it all both the republican and democratic presidential races are unchanged heading into the holiday doldrums on the republican side donald trump remains the overall frontrunner ted cruz has a clear path to victory in iowa and marco rubio is still trying to break through in an early state on the democratic side hillary clinton is in firm control bernie sanders though is still making it very interesting in both iowa and especially new hampshire and martin o malley has still been unable to break through so it s the status quo heading into the christmas and new year s holidays and before the four week sprint into the iowa caucuses that will begin on jan 3 hillary vs trump has trump has been a recruitment tool for isis a fight between the democratic frontrunner clinton and republican frontrunner trump has been the driving political story over the last 24 hours it all started when hillary clinton said this of trump at the democratic debate on saturday night he is becoming isis best recruiter they are going to people showing videos of donald trump insulting islam and muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists on nbc s meet the press the next morning as well as on today this morning trump fired back n obody has been able to back that up it s nonsense it s just another hillary lie she lies like crazy about everything whether it s trips where she was being gunned down in a helicopter or an airplane she s a liar and everybody knows that but she just made this up in thin air he said on meet yesterday while the clinton campaign backs up her claim with articles like this one donald trump s muslim bashing aids cause of terror networks say experts we ve found no proof of isis using trump its videos yet here s the kicker to this entire controversy trump said on meet that he wouldn t change his rhetoric even if isis uses it in the future no because i think that my words represent toughness and strength hillary s not strong hillary s weak frankly let us praise strong men speaking of strength trump continued to praise vladimir putin when one of us asked him about it on meet yesterday todd why are you so comfortable praising vladimir putin this site is protected by recaptchaprivacy policy terms of service trump i m not i didn t praise him he praised me he called me brilliant he said very nice things about me i mean i accept it todd well you ve called him a strong leader trump he is a strong leader what am i gonna say he s a weak leader he s making mincemeat out of our president he is a strong leader i mean you would like me to call him a weak leader he s a strong leader and i m not going to be politically correct he s got an 80 of approval rating done by pollsters from i understand this country okay so it s not even done by his pollsters he s very popular within russia now that may change but i didn t say anything one way or the other he came out with a very nice statement about me and i said that s very nice i m honored by it also on abc trump said that there was no proof putin has killed journalists in russia but in all fairness to putin you re saying he killed people i haven t seen that i don t know that he has have you been able to prove that do you know the names of the reporters that he s killed obama vs trump president obama said in a radio interview airing on monday that donald j trump a leading contender for the republican presidential nomination is exploiting the resentment and anxieties of working class men to boost his campaign mr obama also argued that some of the scorn directed at him personally stems from the fact that he is the first african american to hold the white house the new york times writes of obama s interview on npr you combine those things and it means that there is going to be potential anger frustration fear some of it justified but just misdirected the president added i think somebody like mr trump is taking advantage of that that s what he s exploiting during the course of his campaign that dnc data story isn t 100 over although hillary clinton and bernie sanders hugged it out over the allegation that a fired sanders staffer or staffers stole data files from the clinton campaign as well as the sanders counterclaim that the dnc unfairly froze the campaign out of the voter file as a result of the controversy the story isn t 100 over as it turns out both the dnc and the vendor ngp van argue that the sanders campaign did take something from team clinton here s the statement from ngp van a one page style report containing summary data on a list was saved out of votebuilder by one sanders user this is what some people have referred to as the export from votebuilder ngp van adds however that the sanders campaign was unable to access the actual voters and their information with the clinton camp s voter lists and here s the dnc as a result of this after action analysis ngp van found that campaign staff on the sanders campaign including the campaign s national data director had accessed proprietary information about which voters were being targeted by the clinton campaign and in doing so violated their agreements with the dnc and so it raises the question does the sanders campaign still have this summary data proprietary information and if so is it going to give it back rubio not voting for it is a vote against it another missed vote is dogging marco rubio and his campaign asked by cbs why he criticized the recently passed omnibus spending bill but didn t show up for the vote rubio gave a john kerry like response in essence not voting for it is a vote against it he said per nbc s hallie jackson rubio communications director alex conant said rubio s comment here was specific to this instance in other words jackson explains not all of rubio s missed senate votes are intended to indicate a no vote conant also noted it s verbatim the same argument ted cruz made when he skipped the loretta lynch vote conant added of the omnibus vote it had the practical impact of a no vote if his vote would ve made a difference we would have been there to vote against it he didn t return to dc because his presence would not have had any impact today s an important deadline for lindsey graham and the rest of the gop field finally today is a deadline
