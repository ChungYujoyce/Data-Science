back on april 13 president trump made an astonishing declaration even for him and he s made some doozies you may recall that this was the briefing at which he showed a strange campaign style video featuring compliments from democratic officials which had clearly been inspired by a very similar compilation shown the night before on sean hannity s fox news show already a de facto trump celebration hour it was also the appearance in which he repeatedly made the claim that he had total authority to reopen the government and blathered on about how he d saved hundreds of thousands of lives when he supposedly closed the country in the first place kaitlan collins of cnn asked him a question i think we all were wondering at that point you said when someone is president of the united states their authority is total that is not true who who told you that trump didn t answer the next day trump announced that it would be up to the governors to decide when they wanted to open up he said he would authorize them to do it even though they don t need any suchauthorization various media outlets have reported that he was convinced to do this because it would be better for his electoral prospects if he canblame the governors for whatevergoes wrong with the reopening trump has often touted his alleged total authority saying on one famous occasionthat article ii of the constitution gives him the right to do whatever i want as president but when collins asked him that question i was pretty sure i knew who told him that the most powerful legal authority in the administration who believes that the president has almost unlimited power isattorney generalwilliam barr barr made an appearance on laura ingraham s show not long ago i wrote about it here andmade some comments at the time which give us a clue about how he sees the president s authority in this circumstance ingraham wenton a tear about forcing churches to close during the pandemic and barr correctly pointed out that unless the state was singling out religious institutions for closure while allowing other large gatherings the first amendment had not been violated what came next in that conversation reveals barr sreal agenda however and possibly that of all the other schemers in the administration at the time of the interview the first rumblings from the astroturf groups in various swing states with democratic governors were starting to be heard barr was on it already i think we have to be very careful to make sure this is you know that the draconian measures that are being adopted are fully justified and there are not alternative ways of protecting people and i think you know when this when this period of time is at the end of april expires i think we have to allow people to adapt more than we have and not just tell people to go home and hide under the bed but allow them to use other ways social distancing and other means to protect themselves since then we ve had heavily covered small protests like this around the country demanding that governors rescind their stay at home orders https twitter com shanedunlap status 1252273164274536449 s 20 at least they were wearing masks on tuesday barr appeared on hugh hewitt s show and made clear that if anyone thought the top law enforcement officer in the country might find armed protests against public health measures to be a threat to public order they needed to think again he reiterated his belief that the states have imposed unnecessary and draconian measures and implicitly backedthe protests calling stay at home orders disturbingly close to house arrest the legal issues he believes are salient are civil liberties and something vague to do with interstate commerce if i had to guess i d suggest that barr intends to argue that states that are not open for business are somehow impinging on other states rights to conductbusiness across state lines either that or he anticipates that there really will be checkpoints on the highways as infected people from trump states decide to descend upon others in any case he announced that the federal government will join individual lawsuits to force states to open whatever the task force guidelines endorsed by vice president pence may say according to the detroit news barr has the support of the man who was widely considered the worst attorney general of recenthistory reagan administration stalwarted meese apparently meese and some other right wing extremists wrote to barr earlier this week accusing the states of rampant abuses of constitutional rights and civil liberties and exhorting him to undertake an immediate review of all the orders that have been issued by the states and local governments across the nation is it possible that these people are unaware that these measures are being taken all over the world to contain a deadly virus do they think these governors are doing this out of some twisted ideological desire to destroy their constituents livelihoods and their states tax bases apparently so it s hard to know how widely barr plans to use department of justice levers to force americans to risk their lives for donald trump but he is definitely figuring out ways to help make that happen for a man without a medical degree or any other relevant expertise he seemsconfident that he knows more than the public health experts about how to deal with a deadly pandemic you can t just keep on feeding the patient chemotherapy and say well we re killing the cancer because we were getting to the point where we re killing the patient and now is the time that we have to start looking ahead and adjusting to more targeted therapies if there is a worse analogy forwhat we re going through i haven t heard it at the moment social distancing is theonlyway we have of mitigating the spread of the disease and killing tens of thousands of people unnecessarily there is no targeted therapy metaphorical or otherwise but trump and barr and the rest of the nihilist rightare telling americans that they should ignore all the scientific expertise and go out and play russian roulette in workplaces malls and restaurants all in the name of freedom and liberty it s true that barr hasn t said that trump cansimply issue an order forcing these state governments to go against all the pubic health recommendations but he hasalmost certainly told him that thedepartment of justice can figure out how to get the job done there is more than one way to exercise total authority heather digby parton also known as digby is a
