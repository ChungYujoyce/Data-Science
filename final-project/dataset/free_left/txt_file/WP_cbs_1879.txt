wednesday marks the 50th anniversary of earth day and since well before the covid 19 outbreak the world health organization has been tracing and analyzing the impact of how climate change is impacting public health but as the global community continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic top climate officials say our attention needs to shift to climate related issues that directly impact our health in an interview with face the nation moderator margaret brennan dr diarmid campbell lendrum head of the climate change and health program at the world health organization says presently air pollution is one of the severest problems that we face around the world air pollution increases the risk of other illnesses like heart disease and respiratory issues something that has had a direct impact on those suffering during the coronavirus outbreak about one in eight deaths around the world are caused by air pollution additionally extreme weather events and increased temperature can all have negative effects on public health the extreme weather events are getting more severe so we re seeing more severe heat waves we re seeing more severe wildfires dr campbell lendrum said so it s absolutely clear to us that climate change is making these extreme weather events worse and it brings a whole range of severe impacts to human health dr campbell lendrum noted that while climate change did not cause coronavirus if we want to reduce the chances of the next pandemic then we have to start taking more care of the natural environment here are five other things to know about how climate change is expected to impact public health worldwide about 9 in 10 people around the world are inhaling polluted air air pollution is a contributing risk factor for many other illnesses such as heart disease and respiratory illness according to the world health organization a third of the deaths from strokes lung cancer and heart disease are due to air pollution and there is some evidence emerging out of the covid 19 outbreak that suggests people living in areas with higher air pollution are more likely to be infected with the virus we re getting the first indications that places with high levels of air pollution may also have high rates of death and disease from covid 19 said dr campbell lendrum it s not conclusive at the moment but it s what we would expect and that s what we think we re starting to see while the coronavirus has had devastating impacts around the globe it has also led to a decrease in air pollution in the northeastern united states air pollution dropped by 30 percent in march and countries like china and italy have experienced similar decreases we would never want to say this is okay because the human cost of covid 19 is so great said dr campabell lendrum what we do want to make clear is that we should try and hang on to some of these gains as we come out of the covid 19 crisis most infectious diseases the world has had to deal with over the last few decades have come from the natural environment so it s very clear that the damage that we re doing to the natural world does make it more likely that these diseases will emerge said dr campbell lendrum evidence shows that covid 19 was a zoonotic event that jumped from animal to humans many of the infectious diseases like sars and even hiv were transmitted by animal to human contact coming out of the natural environment so when we damage the natural environment when we overexploit it and then when we don t monitor what s happening to infections in wildlife and infections in domestic animals and infections in humans we re basically leaving ourselves open to these these risks said dr campbell lendrum dr campbell lendrum explained that while climate change isn t directly correlated to the cause of coronavirus it s very clear that the damage that we re doing to the natural world does make it more likely that these diseases will emerge warming climates and increasing variability in weather patterns across the globe make it inherently easier to transmit diseases of any origin in order to reduce our chances for the next pandemic campbell lendrum says we need to start taking more care of our planet overall environmental damage seems to be increasing the risks either of past epidemics of this pandemic and potentially of future pandemics as well he said campbell lendrum rightly noted that the covid 19 crisis exposed our lack of preparedness for pandemics in general across the world in many cases we ve gone in with weak health systems in many cases we ve gone in with a really high burden of environmental pollution such as air pollution he said he added one of the things we re saying is that we shouldn t come out of this crisis in the same direction that we went in we should be thinking can we get can we hang on to some of the environmental gains that we re seeing in the covid crisis such as cleaner air last year the united nations released a report saying that plant based diets are better for the environment one of the reasons is that cows produce large amounts of the greenhouse gas methane when they eat additionally eating large amounts of meat regularly particularly processed meats is not that healthy for humans we re not telling people they they have to or they should become vegetarians said dr campbell lendrum if you want to think about whether a more sustainable diet is going to be good for your health and good for the environment now is a really good time to do it watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news
