advertisement supported by the judge rejected the defense s argument of juror bias in a politically fraught case in which president trump publicly attacked his friend s conviction by sharon lafraniere washington the federal judge overseeing the criminal case against roger j stone jr refused on thursday to grant him a new trial rejecting the defense s argument of juror misconduct that president trump has also repeatedly trumpeted judge amy berman jackson of the united states district court in washington ordered mr stone to surrender to the federal bureau of prisons as soon as he is notified to do so she also released him and his lawyers from a gag order she imposed months ago the judge s decision appears to end one of the most politically fraught federal criminal cases in recent years in a last ditch effort to keep their client out of prison mr stone s lawyers had claimed that the jury forewoman had improperly concealed a bias against mr stone justifying a new trial the jury convicted mr stone 67 in november of seven felonies for an attempt to thwart a congressional inquiry that threatened his longtime friend mr trump and judge jackson sentenced him in february to 40 months in prison the case took on broad national significance pitting a president who condemned the proceedings as unfair against a federal judge who has defended them in ever stronger terms in the last two and a half weeks of february alone mr trump attacked the prosecution at least nine times in twitter messages or other public statements accusing the judge the prosecutors and the jury forewoman of creating a miscarriage of justice the sentencing of mr stone also set off an internal crisis at the justice department after attorney general william p barr intervened to recommend a more lenient sentence for mr stone than prosecutors had initially sought all four of the prosecutors quit the case one left the justice department entirely and others began privately expressing fears of political pressures on their work which is usually afforded a degree of independence mr stone s lawyers sought a new trial on the basis of social media posts by the jury forewoman saying that they showed she had deliberately concealed a bias toward mr stone when she filled out a questionnaire and was questioned in court before the jury was selected but in an exhaustive 81 page opinion judge jackson found no basis for that claim while the social media posts showed the juror had strong opinions about mr trump the judge wrote they did not show she would be unfair to mr stone the defense s argument that one can infer from the juror s opinions about the president that she could not fairly consider the evidence against the defendant is not supported by any facts and it is contrary to controlling legal precedent she wrote moreover she found that the defense failed to meet the legal standard for a new trial of newly discovered evidence because they could have easily found the juror s social media posts before the trial began essentially the judge said the defense was trying to equate anti trump sentiment with anti stone sentiment in a last ditch attempt to save mr stone from prison the judge s order comes at a time when the coronavirus is spreading quickly in american prisons leading authorities across the country to release thousands of inmates to save lives and preserve medical resources the decision of how soon mr stone will be ordered to report to prison is up to the federal court s probation and pretrial services office mr trump has loomed large in the proceedings against mr stone he repeatedly complained on twitter and to the news media that the judge the jury and the prosecutors were being unfair to his friend the judge twice rebuked mr trump in court though not always by name during mr stone s sentencing hearing she simply described comments by a longtime friend of his as entirely inappropriate she added pointedly there was nothing phony or disgraceful about the investigation or the prosecution during a hearing on the defense s request for a new trial she said that the the president himself has shone a spotlight on the jury and read aloud one of his tweets attacking the jury forewoman as an example she also noted that tucker carlson the fox news commentator who is close to mr trump had also tried to stoke public anger about the case and the jurors attacking jurors is completely antithetical to our entire system of justice she said and could provoke someone to take it out on them personally prosecutors argued that the defense motion for a new trial was nothing more than an attempt to fuel its public campaign to undermine the jury s verdict through a frivolous juror misconduct claim nonetheless in an unusual move judge jackson held a four hour hearing on the motion summoning a dozen jurors back to the courtroom in february three months after they had rendered a verdict nancy gertner a retired federal judge who now teaches at harvard law school said she believed the judge was being especially careful because the case had been so high profile not because the president was breathing down her neck i would have done what she did she said mr stone s defense lawyers acknowledged during the february hearing that even though they had hired a jury consultant they failed to scour the social media posts of potential jurors on the witness stand the jury forewoman said she had honestly answered all the questions put to her during the jury selection process on the 20 page written questionnaire filled out by potential jurors she wrote that she could not recall all her social media posts in her opinion judge jackson wrote she found the juror s testimony to be entirely sincere and credible noting that she openly admitted what she could not remember and refused to give a definitive answer if she was uncertain she said that the juror s social media posts did convey a negative view of the president or disagreement with certain policy decisions but she said the juror acknowledged on her questionnaire that she had run for local office as a democrat and that she had opinions about people on a list that included mr trump if defense lawyers were concerned about her political views judge jackson noted they could have simply excluded her from the jury panel the evidence the defense claims was critical was never concealed it was a few clicks of a mouse away she wrote the failure of the defense team to exercise that diligence did not constitute a miscarriage of justice she found the defense motion for a new trial dovetailed with the president s own claims that the jury forewoman was influenced by her antipathy toward him but legal experts said that jury pools in the district of columbia are typically politically liberal and all jurors are expected to put their political views aside and simply evaluate the evidence in the case of paul manafort another trial of a former trump aide that the president also denounced one juror s political views meshed closely with mr trump s yet she voted with the rest of the jurors to convict mr manafort the president s former campaign chairman of a financial fraud scheme during the jury selection process she kept the fact that she is a trump supporter to herself because she said later i knew i could be fair and impartial judge jackson noted that even during the prosecutions that arose from the watergate scandal that led to president richard m nixon s resignation courts ruled that jurors with open minds could be found in the district of columbia advertisement
