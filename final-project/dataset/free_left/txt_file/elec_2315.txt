advertisement supported by letter from washington by albert r hunt bloomberg view in 1980 the democratic pollster peter d hart warned gaylord nelson wisconsin s champion vote getter as governor and senator that he was going to lose mr hart saw a republican wave coming ronald reagan would defeat president jimmy carter and carry other republican candidates to victory as well the opposite of the wave effect in elections is the so called eisenhower jacket a term coined by democrats predicting that the immensely popular ike wouldn t have the coattails to help other republicans down the ballot with three months to go in the 2016 race there is a presumption among most democrats and more than a few republicans that hillary clinton is headed to a decisive victory democrats are talking about a possible wave while republicans see a no coattails election particularly since mrs clinton herself remains unpopular of course the race could change donald j trump could get his act together or there could be a crisis or a clinton contretemps most wave elections such as the democrats victories in 2006 and republicans gains in 2010 are in nonpresidential years exceptions were in 1964 when lyndon b johnson trounced barry goldwater and in 1980 an encouraging note for republicans the only time in the modern era that an incumbent party ran successfully for a third presidential term 1988 the makeup of congress remained virtually the same but even a mini wave could affect the senate where 24 of the 34 seats up for election are held by republicans the democrats need a net gain of at least four seats to take control it might take a tsunami to capture 30 seats and win the house all 435 seats may be in play but with redistricting and population patterns democrats have to win the overall vote by seven percentage points to take it back david wasserman of the cook political report estimates nevertheless almost daily another house republican says he or she can t vote for mr trump last week representative mike coffman of colorado ran a commercial declaring honestly i don t care for him much and he vowed that if mr trump were elected i ll stand up to him plain and simple some republicans say that differentiating their congressional candidates from the nominee may not be hard one great thing for many republican candidates is that donald trump is unusual he s not a generic republican says kristen soltis anderson a republican pollster in a state like ohio voters will be able to distinguish between trump and rob portman senator portman is locked in a tight race some endangered senate incumbents like mark kirk of illinois have flatly declared they won t vote for mr trump most others however are trying to avoid offending the fervent trump followers while not alienating more independent minded centrists senator kelly ayotte of new hampshire said she s supporting mr trump but isn t endorsing him if he comes to her state she will be awol some of her supporters want her to distance herself further especially since mr trump gave her an opening last week when he called her weak few republicans are suffering as much as senator john mccain of arizona privately he has contempt for mr trump but the senator faces a right wing primary challenge this month in which many trump supporters will turn out thus even when mr trump took a shot at him too last week mr mccain held his fire and reiterated that he always supports the party nominee several recent polls however might widen cracks in this delicate facade mrs clinton has opened up huge leads in new hampshire and pennsylvania amid signs mr trump was dragging down incumbent senators republican strategists say a five point clinton victory in these states is survivable for down ballot candidates anything more particularly if her margin hits double digits might mean curtains democrats today are more optimistic that these wider margins are possible noting that in this polarized environment ticket splitting is less prevalent and waves as gaylord nelson discovered in 1980 usually break late advertisement
