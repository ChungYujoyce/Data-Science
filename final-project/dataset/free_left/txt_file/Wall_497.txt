advertisement supported by fact check the president has served up a series of false and misleading statements as he seeks to counter uncomfortable facts about the spread of covid 19 and questions about his push to reopen the economy by linda qiu faced with intense criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic stubbornly high rates of new infections across much of the country and questions about whether he is pushing too soon to get the economy going again president trump has settled into a messaging routine deflect reject and minimize confronted with projections showing that the number of cases and deaths will continue to rise mr trump has mischaracterized how the models work with states and many public health experts saying testing remains inadequate he has countered with false and misleading comparisons to other countries and when asked to reconcile the gap between his earlier sunny predictions of few deaths and the current situation he has used false assertions to blame others and continued to rewrite the history of his own response here s an assessment of some of the president s recent claims what mr trump said we are helping other countries which are desperate for them likewise after having been left little we are now doing more testing than all other countries combined and with superior tests on twitter on wednesday false mr trump has embellished a previously misleading talking point to a wholly untrue one he has regularly heralded the total number of tests conducted in the united states as the highest of any single country in the world that is technically accurate though on a per capita basis the united states still lags others but testing in the united states does not eclipse the rest of the world combined the united states had conducted more than 7 7 million tests by wednesday according to the covid tracking project in comparison only three countries combined russia germany and italy had conducted more than 9 7 million tests according to our world in data and worldometers combined the 82 countries monitored by our world in data had conducted at least 28 1 million tests while the 183 countries measured by worldometers performed about 33 7 million tests what mr trump said don t forget the cupboard was bare the other administration the last administration left us nothing we didn t have ventilators we didn t have medical equipment we didn t have testing the tests were broken you saw that we had broken tests in an interview with abc news on tuesday false the strategic national stockpile the federal government s repository of medicines and medicinal products contained more than 7 billion worth of supplies when mr trump took office an archived page of the centers for disease control and prevention s website from december 2016 estimated that the stockpile was valued at more than 7 billion and included ventilators as well as antibiotics chemical antidotes antitoxins vaccines antiviral drugs personal protective equipment and other medical supplies after mr trump took office the estimate remained over 7 billion according to a june 2017 government brief while the c d c does not disclose specific details about the contents or locations of the stockpile it has offered some glimpses into the secret warehouses where supplies are stashed a reporter for npr toured one location in june 2016 and described how shelves packed with stuff stand so tall that looking up makes me dizzy and rows upon rows of ventilators that could keep sick or injured people breathing the president s complaint about inheriting broken tests is nonsensical as the novel coronavirus was discovered in late 2019 more than two years after his predecessor left office the trump administration botched development of its own tests leaving the united states initially blind to the virus s spread and behind other nations it is reasonable to argue that previous administrations failed to leave mr trump with a stockpile large enough to handle the scale of the current pandemic the times has reported for example on a stalled government effort to procure more ventilators under previous administrations but the president is clearly wrong that the stockpile contained nothing at all what mr trump said those models that you re mentioning are talking about without mitigation in the abc interview false mr trump was referring to two projections publicized this week that predicted rising death tolls both factored in mitigation strategies one produced by johns hopkins university for the federal emergency management agency and obtained by the times estimated about 200 000 new cases each day by june up from 25 000 cases a day currently the university stressed in a statement that the analyses were preliminary and not finished and included situations in which social distancing measures are prematurely relaxed some assume the policies are either highly or moderately effective and become half as effective going forward as current measures expire the epidemiologist who produced the estimates said in an interview with npr the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington also updated its forecast to estimate nearly 135 000 deaths by august this model also accounts for social distancing policies our model now assumes that mandates that are currently still in place and have not been scheduled to be relaxed will stay in place through at least august 4 the institute wrote for locations where distancing policies have been eased or clear plans have been instituted for their easement we used those dates for the predictions what mr trump said bret baier fox news host you did talk a lot about hydroxychloroquine for a while mr trump i do and i still do mr baier and there were some studies that came out that questioned the cardiac tie but you stopped talking about it mr trump one study one study but there was studies that came out that say it s very good too in a town hall style event on fox news on sunday this is misleading hundreds of studies are in the works on the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine two malaria drugs mr trump has promoted for treatment of the coronavirus but the current body of research is limited and insufficient many of the studies that have shown the drugs might be effective come with heavy caveats and the food and drug administration has warned that the drugs can cause abnormal heart rhythms a review published last week of seven completed clinical trials five in china and two in france found that five showed favorable outcomes for patients using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat covid 19 the disease caused by the virus while two showed no change but the review noted that all seven trials carried varying degrees of bias and poor study design for example sample sizes were too small to be reliable or the randomization of subjects was inadequate it concluded that the data was insufficient to support using the two antivirals as treatments the review did not include two prominent studies one conducted in brazil and one performed on veterans affairs patients because the first was not completed and the other was not a clinical trial the brazilian study was halted because patients developed irregular heart rates what mr trump said i closed our country to china nancy pelosi was a month later saying it s going to pass everybody even tony fauci was saying it s going to pass not going to be a big deal in the fox news event false at the end of january mr trump barred most foreign citizens from entering the united states if they had recently visited china a month later dr anthony s fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases was repeatedly saying that the scale of the outbreak would depend on mitigation while speaker nancy pelosi s comments on the coronavirus were largely limited to criticizing mr trump s response rather than predictions about its spread in an interview on cbs in mid february dr fauci defined a pandemic as transmission from person to person in multiple countries around the world and said it certainly is on the verge of that happening reasonably soon unless containment is more successful than it is right now two weeks later dr fauci appeared on the today show where he was asked whether americans needed to change their habits no right now at this moment there s no need to change anything that you re doing on a day by day basis right now the risk is still low but this could change he responded this could be a major outbreak i hope not or it could be something that s reasonably well controlled later that day dr fauci said at a white house briefing that the risk of contracting the virus was low across the country but he added when we say that we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation ms pelosi addressed the outbreak at a news conference in late february and called the trump administration s response opaque and often chaotic she also spoke about an earlier visit to san francisco s chinatown and said we want to be fully prepared but not panicking or fearful of what s happening she did not comment on the trajectory of the disease mr trump may have been mixing up their comments with his own in february he said the virus could disappear though he added that nobody really knows and that cases were going down not up curious about the accuracy of a claim email factcheck nytimes com advertisement
