before mike huckabee took the stage at the launch of his presidential campaign tuesday crooner tony orlando warmed up the crowd with his 1970s hit tie a yellow ribbon it was a fitting prelude because huckabee s campaign for the republican presidential nomination is also a throwback the former arkansas governor is the candidate of the little guy at a time when big money is ascendant in politics generally and in the republican nominating process in particular i never have been and i m not going to be the favored candidate of those in the washington to wall street corridor of power he told supporters tuesday at a kickoff rally in hope ark the hometown he shares with bill clinton i will be funded and fueled not by the billionaires but by working people who will find out that 15 and 25 a month contributions can take us from hope to higher ground it s a worthy aim but the only place 15 and 25 contributions are going to take him is to irrelevance american politics and republican politics in particular have become entirely about big money in this election cycle when candidates will be sponsored by billionaires who have been recently freed by the supreme court to give unlimited sums to super pacs huckabee is running against all that making a populist attack on wall street free trade deals and efforts to cut social security and medicare benefits i don t have a global foundation or a taxpayer funded paycheck to live off of he told his supporters wednesday a reference to hillary rodham clinton and to the various senators in the race i don t come from a family dynasty but a working family he said contrasting himself with jeb bush i grew up blue collar not blue blood this worked fairly well for huckabee in 2008 where grass roots support among blue collar voters and religious conservatives propelled him to victory in the iowa caucuses before his lack of money kept him from competing nationally but this time the nominating process for republicans like the tea party movement earlier has been consumed by corporate interests and a few of the wealthiest americans a lone billionaire can keep an otherwise uncompetitive candidate viable but an otherwise viable candidate will be out of luck if he or she doesn t have a patron huckabee wasn t among the republican candidates appearing in las vegas a couple of weeks ago to kiss the ring of sheldon adelson a major gop contributor he didn t score an invite earlier this year to a forum hosted by the koch brothers the biggest donors of them all already the anti tax club for growth backed by wealthy interests has announced that it is beginning an ad campaign against him huckabee joked about his status as the poor man s candidate in 16 if you want to give a million dollars please do it he said a request that as the post s philip bump pointed out technically violates campaign finance laws i know most of you can t those who can probably won t because his anti corporate policies don t suit them we don t create good jobs for americans by entering into unbalanced trade deals that forego congressional scrutiny and then looking the other way as the law is ignored so that we can import low wage labor undercut american workers and drive wages lower than the dead sea huckabee told his supporters calling for bringing manufacturing back to our communities he also took aim at fellow republicans who propose restructuring entitlement programs if congress wants to take away someone s retirement let them end their own congressional pensions not your social security huckabee is clearly less hostile to government than many of his rivals he talked about spending more on veterans they should be getting the first fruits of our treasury not the leftovers and on medical research focusing on cures instead of treatments saves money lives and families he also praised the moon landing for making him believe that america could do anything it set its mind to huckabee whose tv and radio gigs have made him a wealthy man since his 2008 run is not a pure populist his fair tax a national sales tax would disproportionately benefit the rich but the other man from hope hit many of the right notes tuesday particularly when he spoke about the large number of americans in poverty because most americans wages haven t risen in decades the power and money and political influence have left a lot of americans lagging behind he said they work hard they lift heavy things and they sweat through their clothes grinding out a living but they can t seem to get ahead or in some cases even stay even that s an important message for republican primary voters to hear too bad the super rich won t give them the chance twitter milbank read more from dana milbank s archive follow him on twitter or
