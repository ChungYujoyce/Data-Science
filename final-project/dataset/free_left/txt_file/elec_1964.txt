say what you will about donald trump but the man is winner trump didn t just wallop his opponents tuesday he crushed them up 41 percent in delaware 40 percent in rhode island 37 percent in pennsylvania 33 percent in maryland 30 percent in connecticut he s estimated to have won 110 delegates versus five for kasich and three for cruz if the race for the gop nomination were a little league game the mercy rule would be imposed here s where we stand today ted cruz is mathematically eliminated from winning the republican nomination before the convention in cleveland john kasich has now won a single state ohio where he is governor if ever there were a series of states that would at least theoretically be fertile territory for him it would be the northeast home of the last vestiges of republican moderates yet he didn t crack 30 percent anywhere republicans can talk all they want about never trump and trying to stop him at the rnc in cleveland they can talk about changing the rules and holding out hope that a white knight candidate will emerge it isn t going to happen either trump is the nominee or he ll burn the whole thing to the ground if you re a gambler go all in on the former it is worth stepping back however and noting that trump s hammerlock over the party and his ascendancy within the gop is astounding he s a political amateur who never held elected office he s a xenophobe a bully and a misogynist and he has run directly against the leadership of the party he hopes to lead yet today he stands on the cusp of winning the nomination of the party of lincoln eisenhower nixon and reagan i know we ve all become inured to trump s insults his know nothingness and his crudeness but it can t be said enough truly we are living in a political moment unlike anything that any of us has seen before advertisement here s what might be even more amazing trump s position as the presumptive nominee of the republican party is not the most remarkable political event this year rather it s that the democratic party is poised to nominate the first woman to be a major party candidate for president somehow this constantly seems to be forgotten and whether you like hillary clinton or despise her that america is poised to nominate a woman for president is a big deal advertisement tuesday night clinton racked up four more primary wins including the delegate rich states of maryland and pennsylvania only in rhode island did bernie sanders thwart her early on in the evening before all the races had been called he gave a victory speech in west virginia that not only left unmentioned the evening s results but plowed forward with confidence about the road ahead it s a fitting metaphor for the sanders campaign which increasingly seems to operate in a realm completely divorced from reality sanders cannot and will not win the democratic nomination period indeed in her victory speech clinton as she has increasingly done simply ignored sanders instead she aimed her daggers at her real target donald trump the democratic race will continue but for all intents and purposes it is over clinton can now begin her pivot to the general election and sanders can play out the string advertisement what we now with some certainty is that we re only a few months away from an historic unprecedented presidential campaign and no matter which candidate wins on election day history will be made michael a cohen s column appears regularly in the globe follow him on twitter speechboy71 digital access home delivery gift subscriptions log in manage my account customer service help faqs globe newsroom advertise newsletters view the epaper order back issues news in education search the archives privacy policy terms of service terms of purchase work at boston globe media
