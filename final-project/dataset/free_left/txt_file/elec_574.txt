advertisement supported by transcript na by nick corasaniti and patrick healy lynchburg va senator ted cruz of texas announced on monday morning that he would run for president in 2016 becoming the first republican candidate to declare himself officially in the race linking the determination of his immigrant father with the resolve of the founding fathers and his own faith in the promise of america mr cruz spoke at length about his family and his faith as he laid out a case for his candidacy god s blessing has been on america from the very beginning of this nation and i believe god isn t done with america yet mr cruz said before thousands of cheering students here at liberty university i believe in you i believe in the power of millions of courageous conservatives rising up to re ignite the promise of america today i am announcing that i am running for president of the united states mr cruz added it is a time for truth it is a time for liberty it is a time to reclaim the constitution of the united states mr cruz a first term senator is seen by republicans and democrats as a divisive figure in washington but as a truth telling hero to many conservatives and evangelical americans his speech was packed with calls to imagine a president who would repeal the affordable care act abolish the internal revenue service defend the sanctity of human life and uphold the sacrament of marriage at times a history lesson he invoked both franklin d roosevelt and patrick henry and at times a call to action mr cruz sought to position himself as the candidate who would give the republican party s right wing the country they desire he spoke directly to conservatives with no real broad appeal to the more moderate wing of his party the power of the american people when we rise up and stand for liberty knows no bounds mr cruz said before asking those in attendance to break a rule and text the word constitution to his campaign donald j trump officially accepted the republican party s nomination on july 22 hillary clinton was officially nominated on july 26 at the democratic convention with his two daughters and wife heidi in attendance mr cruz opened his speech by providing a biography not of himself but of his parents and describing his connection to his faith mr cruz told the story of his mom a little girl growing up in delaware who became a pioneering computer programmer and his dad the teenage rebel fighter in cuba who fled at age 18 to america mr cruz was candid about his parents alcohol abuse and marital troubles and he told the story of how his parents found their faith he also presented himself as dedicated to hard work noting he took two jobs to pay for school as a teenager and took out 100 000 in student loans paying them off just a few years ago there are people who wonder if faith is real mr cruz said i can tell you in my family there is not a second of doubt several republicans said on monday that given mr cruz s rhetorical skills and passion and his ability to inspire restless or disenchanted conservatives and evangelical americans his candidacy should not be underestimated he has had the single best sound bite over the last three years saying that the big problem in washington is we don t listen said frank luntz a longtime republican pollster that message transcends ideology and partisanship because so many in the public think washington is out of touch mr cruz s chief downside mr luntz said is reflected in his relationships with other republicans in the senate his colleagues really don t like him and it s very difficult when your own colleagues won t stand up for you mr luntz said there s a subtle message that there is something wrong or as steve elmendorf a veteran democratic strategist and washington lobbyist put it on monday the question for republicans is can an unlikable candidate who holds positions unappealing for the general election be viable transcript na republican party leaders in several states welcomed mr cruz to the nominating contest but they declined to analyze his chances since their primaries and caucuses are at least 10 months away there was a lot of energy in his speech and he laid out a full vision for the future of our country said jennifer horn the republican party chairman in new hampshire which is expected to hold its first in the nation presidential primary in february 2016 the folks in new hampshire are going to be eager to start asking detailed questions about his vision he s coming back to visit here later this week and there a lot of people looking forward to that jeff kaufmann chairman of the republican party in iowa which holds the first caucuses said the location for mr cruz s speech was telling it s clear he wants to run as the christian evangelical candidate and the liberty candidate in both senses of liberty which will definitely hold appeal for some iowa voters mr kaufmann said how he tries to position and separate himself from other republicans trying to appeal to the same groups of iowans that will be interesting to watch mr cruz s early entry into the race according to people briefed on his strategy is a deliberate effort to recapture the attention of his party s right wing as he seeks to build a coalition of tea party conservatives and evangelical christians to try to cut through a crowded field of republican contenders the decision to announce the campaign on monday was made about a month ago according to a senior adviser to the cruz campaign though there was some consideration given to making a simple announcement on social media the decision was ultimately made to deliver a speech at liberty in part financial urgency prompted the accelerated timetable advisers to mr cruz have seen donors of the party flock to other potential candidates including gov scott walker of wisconsin who since january has won the most notice among republicans clamoring for a nominee other than former gov jeb bush of florida mr cruz s advisers say his goal is to raise at least 40 million with roughly 1 million in the first week mr cruz s recent pronouncements have been rich with the sort of proposals popular with the tea party conservatives who helped start his career in elected office he has called for abolishing the internal revenue service and he has joked about sending tax agents to help secure the nation s border instead he has denied the prevailing science on climate change most recently in an interview last week with the talk show host seth meyers notably however mr cruz has also begun championing a message of economic populism denouncing income inequality and borrowing the two americas metaphor used most famously by former senator john edwards in two unsuccessful campaigns for the democratic presidential nomination since starting his campaign for the senate in 2011 mr cruz has often defied and battled his party s establishment he defeated david dewhurst the sitting lieutenant governor of texas at the time in a republican primary in which gov rick perry and others campaigned hard for mr dewhurst in a runoff mr cruz beat mr dewhurst by 14 percentage points mr cruz s tenure in washington has been marked by accusations of demagogy he sometimes deploys the soaring diction of a preacher while staking out uncompromising and rigid conservative positions often playing the role of political flamethrower he championed the government shutdown of 2013 infuriating many in his party and some like representative peter t king of new york accused him of bringing the country to the edge of ruin mr cruz however stood firm saying that he was elected to shake up the status quo in washington and that he was doing just that mr cruz has an evident flair for the theatric his 21 hour speech on the senate floor in 2013 delivered under the veil of a filibuster against the affordable care act except that the senate had already scheduled a vote for later in the day featured mr cruz criticizing politicians in cheap suits and bad haircuts and later reading green eggs and ham in its entirety he compared his fight against the president s signature health care legislation to the efforts of those who resisted the nazis ended the cold war or started the american revolution despite his frequently antagonistic approach toward the republican establishment mr cruz is indebted to it in one important way he met his wife heidi while working on the 2000 campaign of george w bush after his speech mr cruz spent more than 30 minutes taking photos signing autographs and meeting students before bumping into jerry falwell jr the liberty university president and chancellor in the scrum these students are so grateful mr falwell said i can t say how much we appreciate it i ll tell you your students lift up my spirits and they inspire me mr cruz responded there s an energy i think the young men and women in the auditorium today have the power literally to turn the country around mr falwell agreed they keep me young amen mr cruz replied advertisement
