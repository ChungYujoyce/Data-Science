watch cbsn live by kathryn watson october 12 2019 8 27 am cbs news in television interviews hallways and events back home republican lawmakers who hold president trump s fate in their hands are struggling to give a yes or no answer to one question is it wrong for a u s president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival president trump s request in a july 25 phone call with ukraine president volodymyr zelensky to investigate joe and hunter biden and subsequent comments to reporters that china should also investigate the bidens have left republicans on capitol hill without a coherent or unified response regarding a president who still enjoys strong approval ratings among self identified republicans a recent quinnipiac poll found 68 of republicans say asking a foreign leader for help in defeating an opponent in an upcoming election is not an impeachable offense but no small number of gop senators have seemed unable to answer whether asking a foreign leader for help in defeating an opponent is even unethical senator cory gardner a republican up for reelection next year in a purple state refused to directly answer at least five times when reporters in denver on thursday asked whether the president s conduct was wrong pressed on whether it s okay for an american president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival gardner responded well look this is what we re going to get into the senate intelligence committee is having an investigation a bipartisan investigation unfortunately though what we ve seen is a very political process take over asked again gardner responded it s an answer that you get from a very serious investigation on thursday cbs this morning co hosts anthony mason and tony dokoupil pressed republican senator rand paul on whether the president was wrong to ask zelensky to investigate the bidens and repeatedly paul skirted directly answering here is their exchange is it wrong or isn t it asked cbs this morning co host anthony mason of the president s request to investigate the bidens well the no i think it s not incorrect or wrong to paul responded it s okay for the president to be mason questioned well no let me finish paul said what i would say is that aid that we give to other countries should be contingent upon behavior and whether or not we should have ukraine trying to eradicate corruption yes this was specifically about mr biden mason interjected well i don t know ask the american people if they think 50 000 paul said i m asking you you re a senator mason said well i know but ask the american people do you think 50 000 a month that hunter biden was getting might have been corrupt paul said you were running for president in 2016 would you have done this if you were elected co host tony dokoupil said i think everybody has different ways that they would approach things paul said you sir you dokoupil said well the thing is now we re getting down to whether or not it s personality and how he interacted in a phone call do you impeach people because he has a more direct way of approaching paul said it s not a question of impeachment it s a question of is it right or wrong to ask a foreign leader to ask in an election with by the way nearly 400 million in aid hanging over his head mason said i guess the thing is would you say we can t investigate corruption if they happen to be a political figure paul said a handful of republicans have taken a different tactic suggesting the president was joking or unserious when he openly called on china to investigate the bidens in front of dozens of journalists and cameras on the white house south lawn missouri senator roy blunt suggested to cbs news face the nation host margaret brennan on sunday the president was simply baiting the press with those comments a theory also offered by florida senator marco rubio although the white house has made no such suggestion brennan are you comfortable with what the president has said here in this call for foreign governments ukraine and china to investigate his political opponent blunt well i i doubt if the china comment was serious to tell you the truth the president brennan you don t take the president blunt the president brennan at his word blunt no the president loves to go out on the on the white house driveway i haven t talked to him about this i don t know what the president was thinking but i do know he loves to bait the press and he does that almost every day some have gone as far as republican senator lindsey graham who says he didn t see anything wrong with the ukraine call as summarized but graham did have concerns about any request about china i m okay with what the president did graham told wspa i don t think he did anything wrong talking to the ukraine cause we give them money and aid i think it was wrong to ask china to investigate i don t trust china to be fair to anybody trump me or you so that was a mistake republicans will face more questions on the topic when they return from a two week recess on tuesday senator rob portman of ohio is among the few republican senators who has uttered anything critical about the president s request the president should not have raised the biden issue on that call period it s not appropriate for a president to engage a foreign government in an investigation of a political opponent portman said at a defense forum monday in ohio according to the columbus dispatch mitt romney arguably the republican senator most politically free to speak his opinions given his red state s unique lack of support for the president and give that he isn t up for reelection until 2024 has offered the sharpest criticism of the president by any gop senator asked by a reporter in utah whether he was surprised to be the only gop senator strongly calling out the president romney had this answer i think everyone understands that asking a foreign government to investigate one s political opponent is wrong romney said i don t think there s any exception to that first published on october 12 2019 8 27 am 2019 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved kathryn watson is a politics reporter for cbs news
