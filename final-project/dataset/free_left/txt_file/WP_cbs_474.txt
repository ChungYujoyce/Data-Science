a new app allows people to put their faces into scenes from movies and tv shows by uploading a single photo but there could be a potential cost to a user s privacy one user of the chinese app zao posted a video on twitter in which he was able to become leonardo dicaprio the app is currently only available in china but it raises new concerns that fake videos are becoming toorealistic and that your face could be used for anything cbs news contributor and wired editor in chief nick thompson visited cbs this morning to discuss the privacy implications of what is known as deepfake technology he admitted that the zao app is a lot of fun that s why it s become so popular so quickly the concerns are that people can take your image and do whatever they want with it in china in particular where an image is used for financial transactions having somebody create realistic simulacrums of your face is scary thompson said what makes this app different from similar programs is that it s really good and they came up with a very clever idea of creating a bunch of set movie scenes or tv scenes and allowing you to put your face in the scenes it was a brilliant idea for an app in case you haven t heard zao is a chinese app which completely blew up since friday best application of deepfake style ai facial replacement i ve ever seen here s an example of me as dicaprio generated in under 8 secs from that one photo in the thumbnail pic twitter com 1rpnjj3wgt my feeling about this is there are real privacy concerns thompson said and the terms of service initially when the app launched were quite bad they said we can do whatever we want with your face for as long as we want it we can even give it to the government for whatever purpose they might have so that s concerning thompson said privacy concerns would be greater for those trying to keep themselves anonymous for a public figure or for someone who shares their face all over the place as all four of us do i don t see why it s particularly bad if you re a dissident if you re an undercover operative if you re concerned about chinese state surveillance don t use this app some have already raised concerns about the impact technology like this could have in the upcoming presidential campaign co host tony dokoupil said adam schiff a democratic congressman said that there are nightmarish scenarios tied to this technology into 2020 we used to believe what you see with your eyes or hear with your ears now you can t anymore absolutely said thompson in 2020 it is highly likely that someone will make some kind of a very realistic fake video of one of the candidates saying something that they didn t say or doing something they didn t do that s concerning but candidates also have cameras with them all the time it s relatively easy to disapprove what i worry about the most is bullying and kids creating videos of classmates there s a lot of bad stuff that you can do with this technology to really hurt people s feelings that may be worse than what s going to happen in politics thompson says the company behind the zao app has agreed to change their terms of service they ve had a lot of problems because of the privacy backlash he said but the threat of deepfake technology runs both ways by allowing someone who is in a genuinely compromising video to be able to claim i don t think it s me that s not me in blackface or that s not me singing that particular song or making those particular comments absolutely said thompson we re going to need real verification technology which fortunately some people are working on david morgan is a senior editor at cbsnews com and cbssundaymorning com watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
