normally during a presidential debate it is the candidates who defend their records against attacks from their rivals on saturday night it was cnn cnn took the extraordinary step of sending out a press release during an abc news debate accusing sen ted cruz of knowingly misrepresenting its reporting about the ben carson campaign the cruz campaign s actions the night of the iowa caucuses had nothing to do with cnn s reporting the fact that senator cruz continues to knowingly mislead the voters about this is astonishing cnn said the flap is unlikely to hurt cruz who has often reveled in sparring with the media and the debate moderators before the iowa caucuses ted cruz s campaign said rival ben carson would be suspending campaigning after the vote an apparent attempt to persuade carson caucus goers to swing to cruz at the last minute but the the claim was not true the cruz campaign left voicemails with caucus goers that said carson would be taking a leave of absence from the campaign trail so it is very important that you tell any ben carson voters that for tonight uh that they not waste a vote on ben carson cruz tried ducking responsibility for these false messages during saturday night s republican primary debate by blaming cnn s reporting cnn reported that ben was not going from iowa to new hampshire or south carolina rather he was quote taking a break from campaigning cruz said my political team saw cnn s report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers cruz also accused cnn of failing to promptly correct its reporting about the carson campaign there s a simple problem with cruz s statement cnn never reported that carson was going to be suspending his campaign what senator cruz said tonight in the debate is categorically false cnn never corrected its reporting because cnn never had anything to correct cnn said in a story posted to its website during the debate cnn had reported that carson would be going to florida after iowa rather than new hampshire but cnn never reported nor implied that carson was going to suspend his campaign as cruz s campaign did cnn reporter dylan byers wrote in strong terms that went beyond the network s usually measured tone cnn condemned cruz for knowingly distorting the facts at the debate cruz himself had already admitted before the debate that cnn got it correct and politifact has termed his statements false one of the most frequent criticisms of cnn is that it is more interested in promoting a false equivalency showing that both sides have a fair point rather than finding the truth the statement about cruz breaks that mold explicitly stating that the texas senator is stating falsehoods marks a break the glass escalation of its reporting a sort of nuclear option for a network committed to maintaining its reputation for evenhanded journalism you rarely see this https t co 0vjharlwon pic twitter com xan8y9g0ok but as many observers pointed out saturday night it s unlikely to work cruz has long made attacking the media a key debate strategy as have many of the republican presidential candidates if donald trump can openly feud with fox news host megyn kelly getting called a liar by cnn is unlikely to hurt cruz with primary voters get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
