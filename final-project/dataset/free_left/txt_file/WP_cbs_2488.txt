recent sexual assault allegation against joe biden a charge the presumptive nominee s campaign has denied on tuesday evening in an online conversation with the wing a networking and community space for women a questioner asked ocasio cortez about the accusation recently leveled against biden by tara reade who worked for him when he was a delaware senator in the 1990s the questioner opposes president trump s reelection but also really resent s the fact that the other choice is someone who has a really long history of being creepy to women ocasio cortez responded what you re voicing is so legitimate and real that s why i find this kind of silencing of all dissent to be a form of gaslighting she went on to say i think it s legitimate to talk about these things and if we want if we again want to have integrity you can t say you know both believe women support all of this until it inconveniences you until it inconveniences us a lot of us are survivors and it s really really hard and uncomfortable not discussing allegations is the exact opposite of integrity the congresswoman said adding that it is not okay to prioritize beating trump over discussing sensitive metoo issues like these because they are very legitimate thing s i think a lot of us are just in this moment where it s like how did we get here you know it almost felt like we started this cycle where we had kind of moved on from you know from all of this and now it feels like we re kind of back in it ocasio cortez said and you know the most diverse field that we ve ever seen that we re kind of back kind of replaying old movies in a way reade is grateful for ocasio cortez s support i m very humbled and honored because she is literally the only politician that has spoken up on my behalf reade told cbs news after the initial publication of this story in march reade told cbs news she came forward with these allegations during the height of the primary contest whenshe supported bernie sanders because she was offered a platform to do so on a podcast biden himself has not addressed the allegation directly according to the new york times reade accused biden of sexually assaulting her in the halls of the capitol in 1993 the paper cited both interviews with reade s family members who say she told them about the allegation and also interviews with reade s former colleagues who did not remember any complaints from reade about the kind of behavior from biden she describes now several people who worked in the senate office with ms reade said they did not recall any talk of such an incident or similar behavior by mr biden toward her or any women two office interns who worked directly with ms reade said they were unaware of the allegation or any treatment that troubled her the times wrote one of reade s former colleagues marianne baker biden s former executive assistant provided a statement to the times through the campaign i never once witnessed or heard of or received any reports of inappropriate conduct period not from ms reade not from anyone the statement from baker said i have absolutely no knowledge or memory of ms reade s accounting of events which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional and as a manager the washington post reported that reade s accusation has changed over the past year in interviews she has given when she accused biden of inappropriate touching last year she did not mention anything about the physical assault the post reported reade voted for the obama biden ticket twice and sometimes tweeted positively about biden the paper noted in conversations with reade last year she faulted biden s staff for bullying her and said the then senator should have been more aware this is what i want to emphasize it s not him it s the people around him who keep covering for him the post reported reade told the paper last year adding later for instance he should have known what was happening to me looking back now that s my criticism maybe he could have been a little more in touch with his own staff in addition the ap reported that after speaking with reade about her complaints in april 2019 it declined to publish details of the interview at the time because reporters were unable to corroborate her allegations and aspects of her story contradicted other reporting biden s deputy campaign manager kate bedingfield told cbs news the accusation was untrue vice president biden has dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around violence against women bedingfield s statement read he authored and fought for the passage and reauthorization of the landmark violence against women act he firmly believes that women have a right to be heard and heard respectfully such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press what is clear about this claim it is untrue this absolutely did not happen these new statements from the new york congresswoman come just hours after former president barack obama broke his 2020 campaign silence and endorsed biden via an online 12 minute video a day after biden s remaining opponent sanders also endorsed him ocasio cortez was sanders highest profile supporter she also explained in the tuesday evening conversation how she sees her role as a prominent progressive voice in the presidential race my job is to push and push back against everyone to push back against republican party and the democratic party that makes people uncomfortable but we re just not where we need to be right now first published on april 14 2020 8 14 pm 2020
