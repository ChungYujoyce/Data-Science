iran as the main topic in a statement cmdr sean robertson a pentagon spokesman said a u s warship inspection discovered a cache of weapons and advanced missile components he said an initial investigation indicates that these advanced missile components are of iranian origin according to the u s officials who spoke to the ap sailors aboard the uss forrest sherman noticed a small wooden boat that was not displaying a country flag the navy and coast guard personnel stopped boarded the boat for inspection and found the weapons the officials did not provide the exact number of missiles

and has seized smaller and less sophisticated weapons in transit officials told the associated press that the missile parts found in this latest incident were more advanced than any others previously seized since the spring the pentagon has beefed up its military strength in the region adding about 14 000 troops ships aircraft and other assets in response to what officials said is a growing threat from iran officials have been considering another increase of several thousand forces which could include air naval and ground troops and weapons systems but no decisions have been made pentagon press secretary alyssa farah on wednesday denied a report by the wall street journal that the administration was considering sending as many as 14 000 more troops to the middle east as a bulwark against iranian aggression but she did not refute discussions about some level of additional deployment to be clear the reporting is wrong the u s is not considering sending 14 000 additional troops to the middle east any decision by the white house to further increase the american troop presence in the middle east is likely to draw scrutiny from lawmakers given president trump s frequently expressed desire to extricate the u s from endless wars in the region farah flagged one of her tweets denying the wall street journal report on wednesday to republican senator josh hawley from missouri who said in an earlier tweet that he looked forward to questioning american military leaders about any plans for a new deployment after sending 14 000 already this year alone hawley said is the pentagon preparing for a land war smuggling weapons into yemen is a violation of an existing u n security council resolution against iran since president trump s may 2018 decision to pull the u s unilaterally out of the 2015 international nuclear deal with iran the islamic republic has steadily increased its violations of the terms of that agreement tehran blames washington for abandoning it first and european countries for failing to keep it viable by finding a way around newly imposed u s sanctions meant to choke off the country s vital oil revenues one of the stipulations of the nuclear deal calls on iran to refrain from any work to develop new nuclear capable missiles while the agreement does not include an outright ban on such activity it urges tehran not to work on such weapons and three european nations this week have accused iran of violating that principle france germany and the united kingdom said wednesday that iran s developments of nuclear capable ballistic missiles were ongoing and showed further non compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal ambassadors from the three european nations urged u n secretary general antonio guterres in a letter circulated wednesday to inform the council in his next report that iran s ballistic missile activity was inconsistent with the resolution the letter cites footage released on social media on april 22 2019 of a previously unseen flight test of a new shahab 3 medium range ballistic missile variant equipped with a maneuverable re entry vehicle it says the shahab 3 booster used in the test is a missile technology control regime category 1 system and as such is technically capable of delivering a nuclear weapon officials in the trump administration also have said iran is working to obtain nuclear capable missiles something the iranians deny while president trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement in may 2018 it is still supported by the five other parties france britain russia and china which are all veto wielding security council members and germany which is currently serving a two year term on the council the iranian government insists all its missile activities are legal and not nuclear related pamela falk
