advertisement supported by the ad which calls joe biden soft on china and falsely suggests a former governor of washington is chinese shows that president trump plans to continue exploiting racial discord in his re election bid by nick corasaniti jeremy w peters and annie karni president trump has kicked off his general election advertising campaign with a xenophobic attack ad against joseph r biden jr the presumptive democratic nominee the opening shot in a messaging war that is expected to be exceptionally ugly in a minute long digital ad released late thursday that relies heavily on imagery of china and people of asian descent the trump campaign signaled the lines of attack it will use in its attempts to rally the president s base and define mr biden the ad reprises accusations mr trump has made that the former vice president s family profited from his relationships with chinese officials and presents selectively edited scenes and statements attempting to portray him as doddering and weak for the president and his allies the approach represents their assessment of the race as it narrows into a one on one contest with mr biden the opponent who is least susceptible to their charges that the democratic party is too far outside the political mainstream the new ad also shows that while the country has changed drastically in recent weeks amid a national health crisis the president has not he continues to lead the nation and run his campaign the way he always has by belittling his adversaries and exploiting racial discord while other presidents have used campaigns during periods of national trauma to try to unite the country political strategists said that mr trump was taking the opposite approach they re just going to run a white grievance campaign said stuart stevens who worked on the presidential campaigns of the republicans mitt romney and george w bush it s not complicated he s losing with everybody but white men over 50 mr stevens added trump hasn t changed he said he hasn t changed in 30 years mr biden amplified that criticism with a statement friday saying the casual racism and regular xenophobia that we have seen from trump and this administration is a national scourge donald trump only knows how to speak to people s fears not their better angels he added since the coronavirus started spreading in the united states mr trump has tried to steer the conversation over his response toward themes and issues he is most comfortable with like nationalism and border security until recently he had been referring to the coronavirus as the chinese virus now with unfounded claims that mr biden and his family have profited from below board business deals with the chinese mr trump is attempting to link his political rival to his chief geopolitical foe at a time when there is rising xenophobia and violence in the united states aimed at chinese americans during america s crisis biden protected china s feelings the online ad says presenting a montage of clips of mr biden complimenting and praising the chinese including the country s leader xi jinping and of a news segment accusing mr biden of helping his son hunter profit off chinese investments the ad also includes an image of a smiling mr biden standing alongside an asian american man an apparent attempt to suggest that the former president has an inappropriately cozy relationship with china but the man in the image is a chinese american the former governor of washington gary locke who also served as president barack obama s commerce secretary and ambassador to china the picture which appears briefly in between clips showing mr biden socializing with chinese officials and stammering through speeches was taken at a 2013 event in beijing where mr locke and the former vice president appeared together the ad s implication that mr biden is soft on china is oddly timed coming as mr trump s own stance toward china and mr xi has been more positive mr trump has been complimenting mr xi and as recently as last week the president described the two of them as close allies and good friends the trump campaign defended using an image of an asian american to illustrate mr biden s ties to the chinese saying it was selected simply because hunter biden accompanied his father on the 2013 trip to china mr trump has repeatedly accused him without evidence of using his father s official visit to further his own business interests the shot with the flags specifically places biden in beijing in 2013 tim murtaugh a trump campaign spokesman wrote on twitter referring to the picture with mr locke it s for a reason that s the hunter biden trip memory lane for ol joe mr murtaugh did not address the fact that mr locke is not chinese or that the ad presents the image with no context or explanation mr locke responded by accusing mr trump of stoking hatred against asian americans the trump team is making it worse he said in a written statement asian americans are americans period in recent weeks asian americans have reported being physically attacked yelled at and spit upon organizations have begun to track the incidents mr trump s rise has only pushed many asian americans further into the democratic party though they were once considered a fairly reliable republican demographic some democratic strategists said that the tone and nature of the trump ad should serve as a wake up call the coronavirus pandemic and the human and economic suffering it has unleashed does not mean that politics as usual are on hiatus they said this should tell the biden campaign and every other entity trying to beat trump that we have to rethink the playbook said kelly gibson a democratic media strategist who advised the campaigns of andrew yang and juli n castro so if democrats don t sink to his level at least a little we will be at a sizable disadvantage you can t beat fear with logic it has never worked and it will never work the trump campaign s approach is a coarser version of the strategy that incumbent presidents typically deploy against their opponents try to define them early before they get a chance to define themselves what the trump campaign wants to do is introduce on their terms or in the case of joe biden reintroduce that opponent to the american people before that opponent gets a chance to introduce himself said ken goldstein a professor of politics at the university of san francisco their whole campaign is going to be about disqualifying joe biden though the ad is among the first to come from the trump campaign directly since mr biden became the presumptive nominee an undeclared ad war has been raging for months initially begun during the impeachment of mr trump in previous ads including two that cnn refused to air citing demonstrably false claims mr trump has already attacked the bidens on similar grounds and since late february priorities usa one of the largest democratic super pacs has spent 6 5 million on ads attacking mr trump in key swing states an early round featured former supporters of mr trump voicing their displeasure with his administration priorities usa has since started airing ads starkly criticizing the president s response to the coronavirus outbreak in total democratic groups have already spent 15 5 million on general election ads this cycle according to advertising analytics an ad tracking firm many millions more have been spent online as well priorities usa alone has spent 19 million on digital attack ads already and acronym another democratic outside group has spent 10 million but it is unclear how much any of this advertising will matter given americans preoccupation with more pressing concerns mr biden who lacks the financial wherewithal that mr trump and the republican national committee have amassed could stand to benefit in this regard the shorter the race the more it favors the person with the least amount of money said mr stevens who saw firsthand in 2012 how mr obama s financial advantage and the advertising it bought made it difficult for mr romney to define himself one of the major advantages of an incumbent president is monetary mr stevens added and that s being mitigated by this virus updated may 18 2020 advertisement
