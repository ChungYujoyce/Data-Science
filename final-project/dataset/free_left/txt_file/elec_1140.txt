politico ap photo carly fiorina nailed it in the second republican debate that s the assessment of gop insiders in a special edition of the politico caucus our weekly survey of the top operatives activists and strategists in iowa and new hampshire they offered their reactions immediately after watching wednesday s 8 p m prime time debate in simi valley california advertisement sixty percent of republican insiders called fiorina the biggest winner of the evening no one else was even close pointing to everything from how she handled donald trump to her grasp of policy issues a new hampshire republican cheered the nation finally got a chance to see what we in new hampshire have been intrigued and impressed by a political outsider with some real policy chops and the demeanor to be considered a serious contender she was new onstage with most to gain and she delivered for herself carly dispatched trump moved to substance was moving while discussing her late daughter and closed with inspiration said an iowa republican fiorina s performance even captured the attention of some democratic insiders carly hands down added a new hampshire democrat who like all caucus insiders responded via an online survey fiorina drops the mic her closing argument was jeffersonian she handled trump like the junior high schooler he is holy shit the spotlight was on fiorina as she headed into the debate cnn altered the rules to include her on the stage and insiders said she delivered especially in her tussles with trump the confrontations followed a week of skirmishes with the real estate mogul after he made a crack about her physical appearance look at that face he jabbed last week i think women all over this country heard very clearly what mr trump said fiorina said during the debate to applause that understated but cutting approach was the right way to manage him insiders said trump take downs were appropriately icy without being over the top a new hampshire republican said consistently strong memorable answers and made trump seem very small tonight added another applauded an iowa republican she caused the fifth and final bankruptcy of donald trump bankrupt of policy ideas and stature he was finally shown to be the fraud con artist of 2016 the winner of the debate wasn t as clear cut to democrats they were evenly divided between trump and fiorina those who picked the billionaire developer largely did so because many of the candidates were reacting to him all issues were trump said this about your position how do you respond trump had once again all the oxygen in room a new hampshire democrat said among republicans jeb bush was the distant runner up with 18 percent of gop insiders pointing to him as the winner bush whom trump has accused of being low energy came out spoiling for a fight and he got one he and trump clashed over everything from bush s brother s legacy in iraq to whether trump would apologize to bush s wife for making disparaging comments about her mexican heritage he came across as presidential knowledgeable and with some energy and humor a new hampshire republican said added an iowa republican jeb led the way with a huge moment of strength saying my brother kept us safe with that comment he united candidates behind him against trump who was shut down for the next 40 minutes republicans walker and trump were the biggest losers republicans were divided by geography over who was the biggest loser of the evening trump had the worst night according to 40 percent of new hampshire republicans walker came in second with 20 percent but in iowa republicans thought walker had the worst night 42 percent said the wisconsin governor flopped walker who was he even in the debate jabbed one iowa republican it s hard to believe he was once the frontrunner in this race agreed another walker desperately needed a strong performance in the wednesday contest but insiders said he fell short when he entered the presidential race in july politico caucus insiders overwhelmingly expected him to win the iowa caucuses more than eight in 10 iowa gop insiders said at the time that he would win if the caucuses were held then but since that time he has plummeted to around 3 percent in the state and nervous donors and supporters were banking on a solid debate performance to stop the bleeding he seems dull and unintelligent his money will dry up and he will be out by november 1 predicted a third iowa republican added an iowa democrat walker needed a game changer and he barely spoke new hampshire republicans who haven t seen walker as much in their state said trump had a terrible night completely blew it a new hampshire republican said his most sophomoric performance yet the format allowed longer more in depth answers and the opportunity to expose knowledge and personality all of which plays against a trump campaign added another worst night of campaign after the fireworks early trump demonstrated his total lack of familiarity with issues policy nuance the would be emperor tonight was severely under dressed ben carson the soft spoken retired pediatric neurosurgeon who has pushed into a surprise second place position in the polls barely registered with insiders and 20 percent of new hamsphire republicans said he had the worst performance it is becoming clear a new hampshire republican said of fiorina that of the outsider candidates she is the one who speaks with the most authority understanding and class lindsey shined insiders shrugged lindsey graham whose polling average is under 1 percent nonetheless had a standout performance in the undercard debate insiders said more than half of gop insiders said he most stood out in an early debate that also featured fellow long shots rick santorum bobby jindal and george pataki graham who appeared wooden and gloomy in the first debate served up a zinger filled performance this time around dishing out witty jabs and self deprecating remarks in a high energy performance graham brought his a game an entertaining combo of wit humor knowledge and confidence an iowa republican said he s low in the polls but he s fun to watch added a new hampshire republican graham has a rationale for running and a position that he articulates repeatedly and credibly and he has a sense of humor but said a number of insiders it likely won t matter graham and jindal both took advantage of the smaller field and excelled unfortunately i think there was really only one ticket from the happy hour debate to primetime and carly already got that ticket a new hampshire republican said others acknowledeged that they didn t watch because they didn t see it making a difference as one blunt iowa republican put it zzzzzzz these are the members of the politico
