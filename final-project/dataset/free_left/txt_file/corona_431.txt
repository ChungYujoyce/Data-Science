advertisement supported by the president suggested he wanted to move soon but he also promised to listen to public health officials cautioning against relaxing restrictions prematurely by peter baker zolan kanno youngs and alan rappeport washington as he grapples simultaneously with the most devastating public health and economic crises of a lifetime president trump finds himself pulled in opposite directions on what to do next the bankers corporate executives and industrialists plead with him to reopen the country as soon as possible while the medical experts beg for more time to curb the coronavirus the phone calls from his business friends compete against the television images of overwhelmed hospitals the public health experts tell him what he is doing is working so he should not let up yet the economic advisers and others in his white house tell him what he has done has worked so he should begin to figure out how to ease up tens of thousands more could die millions more could lose their jobs i m going to have to make a decision and i only hope to god that it s the right decision mr trump said on friday during his daily news briefing on the fight against the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 18 000 americans so far and put more than 16 million out of work but i would say without question it s the biggest decision i ve ever had to make seizing on new estimates of a lower than projected death toll the president signaled that he wanted to start resuming business on some basis after his current stay at home guidelines expire on april 30 and he announced that he would name a task force next week to develop a plan but he also promised to listen to public health officials cautioning against a premature move to relax limits in actuality the decision on when and how to reopen is not entirely mr trump s to make because he never ordered it closed the stay at home edicts that have kept the vast bulk of americans indoors were issued by governors state by state but the president did issue nonbinding guidelines urging a pause in daily life through the end of the month and if he were to issue new guidance saying it was safe to reopen or outlining a path toward reopening many states would most likely follow or feel pressure from their businesses and constituents to ease up on restrictions we re not doing anything until we know this country is going to be healthy mr trump said we don t want to go back and start doing it over again but he added that the nation s current paralysis was not sustainable you know what staying at home leads to death also he said it s very traumatic for the country the number of deaths worldwide from the coronavirus topped 100 000 on friday as a surge of cases in moscow pushed the russian capital s health care system to its limit lockdowns were extended across much of the globe heading into the easter weekend as countries desperately struggled to slow infections the strain of people out of work and dependent on assistance was starting to show a distribution of food turned into a bloody melee in a poor area of nairobi kenya in the united states the death toll has surpassed that of spain with only italy reporting more in washington lawmakers and administration officials made some progress in breaking a stalemate over a 250 billion federal infusion to replenish a fast depleting loan program for distressed small businesses senator chuck schumer of new york the democratic leader said that the trump administration had agreed to bipartisan negotiations early next week but the central question dominating the conversation in washington new york and elsewhere was how long would it be until the country could begin to get back to normal gov andrew m cuomo of new york the hardest hit state said any easing of restrictions would require widespread testing to cover millions of workers first while mr trump said that you don t need full testing but instead concentrated screening in the most affected areas new government projections presented to officials this week concluded that stay at home orders school closures and social distancing have greatly reduced infections but added that lifting them after only 30 days as the president is considering could result in a rash of new illnesses and fatalities that would rival doing nothing to counter the pandemic without any of the mitigation policies now in place the death toll from the coronavirus could have reached 300 000 according to the projections but if the 30 day stay at home guideline is lifted the death toll could reach 200 000 even if schools remain closed until summer 25 percent of the country continues to work from home and some social distancing continues using the demand for ventilators as a stand in for serious coronavirus infection rates the model foresees a modest bump immediately after stay at home orders are lifted and a major new increase in infections about 70 days after a shelter order is lifted peaking after 120 days the projections dated thursday were prepared by the departments of homeland security and health and human services and obtained by the new york times these numbers fueling the projections may already be out of date forecasts accepted by the white house that once estimated at least 100 000 deaths in the united states have now been revised to about 60 000 thanks to aggressive social distancing but if the numbers are off the direction and increases may be consistent the government models show a rise in demand for ventilators 120 days after lifting stay at home restrictions that would be more severe than if the united states had never issued such orders in the first place and instead relied simply on school closures sending people home to telework and directing the public to socially distance christopher murray the director of the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington whose forecasts have been relied on by the white house added a warning against lifting restrictions too soon it s enough to say that if we were to stop at the national level may 1 we re seeing a return to almost where we are now sometime in july he said on cnn at his briefing on friday mr trump said he was not aware of the government s own latest forecasts but aides said he had interpreted the decreasing death projection to mean that his health advisers may have been overly pessimistic the president cited the 60 000 estimated death toll as evidence of progress i think we ll be substantially under that number he said of the earlier 100 000 forecast hard to believe that if you have 60 000 you can never be happy but that s a lot fewer than we were originally told but his public health advisers took a more cautious approach as encouraging as they are we have not reached the peak dr deborah l birx the white house pandemic coordinator said of the latest figures she noted that without universal testing experts were seeing only the most serious cases is this the tip of the iceberg or is this half the iceberg or three quarters of the iceberg that we ve seen to date she said five administration officials said it was highly unlikely that mr trump would extend the guidelines beyond april 30 adding that he would be more likely to find a way to announce some lifting of quarantine measures even if it might not be a full flip the lightswitch reopening of the country mr trump has been having conversations both formally and informally in recent weeks with business leaders like michael corbat the chief executive of citigroup and brian moynihan the chief executive of bank of america about how to support the economy and when it might be able to reopen many of those discussions have been facilitated by treasury secretary steven mnuchin who has fielded calls from executives like stephen a schwarzman the chief executive of blackstone looking for a road map to when a semblance of normalcy could return although some people close to the discussions said that mr schwarzman and steven roth a real estate investor close to mr trump have not been aggressive as others other business executives have gone through jared kushner the president s son in law and senior adviser paul tudor jones made an impassioned push to reopen the economy on a conference call organized by mr kushner several weeks ago these people said and the investor nelson peltz was said to be influential in mr trump s since aborted plan to begin reopening by easter lobbying groups have become more vocal about the need for the administration to create a plan for the reopening of the economy the longer we stay shut down the worse off people will be and the harder it will be getting the economy going again and getting people jobs so they can go back to work said david mcintosh the president of the club for growth what we need now is a plan for when we reopen the economy because the plan curve has been flattened some business leaders have been particularly frustrated that the government is not being realistic about the economic consequences of the fight against the coronavirus they note that there are many health risks and that not all of them warrant shutting down the economy updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities jacob wintersteen a real estate developer in texas and the finance chairman for the houston area for the state s republican party said businesses should have the right to operate if they see fit despite the risks people in front of my face are watching their businesses be destroyed by our choice of the cure he said the president s economic advisers have been laying the groundwork for reopening the economy larry kudlow the chairman of the national economic council said this week on the fox business network that he could envision returning to work on a rolling basis within the next four to eight weeks mr mnuchin said on cnbc that it could happen as soon as may 1 however people close to mr mnuchin have suggested that a more gradual timeline for reopening the economy could begin in may based on the availability of coronavirus testing and regional case numbers mr kushner and peter navarro the president s trade adviser likewise have talked about opening in stages as quickly as possible fearing that banks will start having real problems if the lockdown continues through may economists say that lifting restrictions particularly on nonessential businesses will restore a limited amount of activity to an economy that is currently in a free fall but some of the president s advisers like marc short the chief of staff to vice president mike pence have argued that ultimately business leaders will not wait for health professionals or administration officials once new infections and deaths start to decrease and may simply reopen their firms many experts caution that growth will be slow when it returns because people will be wary of resuming normal activities before the country has far more extensive testing without widespread confidence in returning to work or other public activities any economic recovery could be tepid a survey of business leaders and market participants this week by s p global found that only 12 percent of respondents believed the economy would make a quick complete recovery soon a quick restart though could carry risks for the economy if the government tells americans to return to normal life and infections rise again that could wipe out consumer optimism and lead to a longer more damaging recession it s not clear to me that the pandemic s direct effect on the economy will end in june or anytime close to that said karl smith the vice president for federal policy at the tax foundation in washington even after official restrictions are lifted lots of people may be uncertain about jumping back into ordinary life companies may be uncertain about putting their workers at risk reporting was contributed by eileen sullivan jim tankersley and annie karni from washington and kate kelly and andrew ross sorkin from new york advertisement
