advertisement supported by white house memo president trump has led no national mourning for the more than 63 000 americans who have died from the coronavirus emphasizing confidence about the future rather than dwelling on the present by peter baker washington one morning this week president trump called food sector executives that afternoon he met with corporate leaders at the white house the day before he paraded small business owners in the east room and the day before that he showcased executives from retail giants like walgreens and walmart in the rose garden as he presides over the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse mr trump has hosted or called many people affected by the devastation including health company executives sports commissioners governors cruise boat company heads religious leaders telecommunications executives and foreign heads of state one category that has yet to make his list americans who have lost someone to the pandemic as the death toll from the coronavirus over eight weeks surpasses the total american military casualties in eight years of major combat in vietnam mr trump has led no national mourning in his daily news conferences he makes only perfunctory references to those who have died as he stiffly reads opening remarks exhibiting more emotion when grieving his lost economic record than his lost constituents empathy has never been considered one of mr trump s political assets he views public displays of sadness as weakness and has made a point of stressing resolve even at the risk of overlooking the deep pain afflicting so much of the country his favorite words in his televised appearances of recent weeks are powerful and strong he talks of incredible days ahead without dwelling on the miserable days of now he plans fireworks while americans plan funerals the contrast with his predecessors could hardly be starker president ronald reagan captured the emotions of the nation with his poetic eulogy to the crew of the space shuttle challenger after it exploded president bill clinton channeled the country s anger and grief after the bombing of an oklahoma city federal building 25 years ago president george w bush shed tears and shared hugs with the families of those killed on sept 11 2001 and in the wars in afghanistan and iraq even the famously stoic president barack obama wept openly after the school massacre in newtown conn and sang amazing grace at a service for black churchgoers killed by a white supremacist in charleston s c i can think of many presidents whose finest hours included times of mourning said david greenberg a presidential scholar at rutgers university in these and other times the president binds us as a nation by acknowledging and giving voice to our shared sense of loss grief and pain and pointing the way to better times ahead trump hasn t shown himself capable of this in my view indeed mr trump appears reluctant to talk about the more than 63 000 people who have died in the united states from the coronavirus he mentioned a few times that a friend of his stanley chera a major new york real estate developer had been infected and later died but did not dwell on it for long in response to a question this week the president said that he had also lost a few other friends and had spoken with families of other victims but he quickly shifted the conversation to distance learning for children i know many stories mr trump told reporters i ve spoken to three maybe i guess four families unrelated to me i did i lost a very good friend i also lost three other friends two of whom i didn t know as well but they were friends and people i did business with white house officials offered no further details to the extent that he discusses the deaths caused by the virus he generally does so in clinical and at times even self congratulatory terms our death totals our numbers per million people are really very very strong he told reporters on thursday we are very proud of the job we have done only after he was asked about former vice president joseph r biden jr s calling on him to lower the flag at the white house to honor the dead did mr trump say he would consider the idea i don t think anybody could feel any worse than i do about all of the death and destruction that s so needless nobody he said but i also have to make sure that we handle the situation well judd deere a white house spokesman said the president preferred to emphasize the positive despite democrats and the media s coordinated attempts to criticize this president for providing hope and optimism throughout this pandemic president trump has delivered a message of comfort unity and strength while taking bold actions he said mr trump s reticence to talk about the human toll of the pandemic conflicts with his occasional willingness to describe the personal impact of america s wars visiting dover air force base to greet the bodies of slain troops and telling audiences later about crying mothers and wives in those cases however the tragedy fuels his policy positions bolstering his case to pull american forces out of the middle east in this case focusing on grief from the coronavirus could be politically damaging if the public blames him for playing down the threat of a deadly virus that he had boasted was something we have tremendous control of and would miraculously disappear on its own instead he would prefer to talk about china s mishandling of the original outbreak or how the economy will he hopes roar back once stay at home orders are lifted on thursday the day after the death toll hit 60 000 in the united states he spent much of the day railing against prosecutors and defending his first national security adviser michael t flynn whom he himself fired for lying about contacts with russia other presidents considered the mourner in chief role part of their duties a responsibility to help a nation grappling with tragedy by acknowledging its grief and finding a path forward craig shirley a longtime republican operative and reagan biographer said presidents like reagan abraham lincoln and franklin d roosevelt connected with everyday people because their self confidence gave them the power to exhibit compassion and empathy it takes a strong man to open his heart mr shirley added but it also makes a very good and memorable president few had more experience with that than roosevelt who came to office at the depths of the great depression when millions were out of work then presided over world war ii with hundreds of thousands of young men sacrificing for their country in virtually all of f d r s talks he played a pastoral role said susan dunn a williams college professor and an author of several books on roosevelt he was always empathetic and even when he was talking about economic dislocation unemployment etc he introduced spiritual notes in recent times mr bush found himself repeatedly called to comfort a nation beset by terrorism war natural disaster and financial collapse days after sept 11 he stopped by the jacob k javits convention center in new york to meet with relatives of those killed in the attacks he was supposed to visit for a half hour but stayed for two hours and 20 minutes hugging and talking with hundreds of devastated people in encounters that were so heart wrenching that aides and even secret service agents cried he was really passionate about connecting with people especially because he took this type of tragedy so personally said eric draper the white house photographer who accompanied him he used that passion to express his remorse and sadness but also to connect with people to make them feel better he would say it wasn t about him it was about the presidency and he wanted to share the presidency with them mr obama contended with a series of mass shootings and racial episodes that tore at the country after the children were gunned down at sandy hook elementary school in newtown jon favreau his chief speechwriter found the president in the oval office struggling to hold his composure a grief that mr obama then displayed moments later on camera in the briefing room with tears streaming down his face in five years of watching him i ve never seen trump display a shred of empathy or grace towards another human being mr favreau said i m not sure he has that capacity at least he s never shown it in public sam nunberg a former campaign aide to mr trump said that sort of display does not come naturally to him the president does prefer promoting a public image of strength mr nunberg said any contacts with grieving relatives have remained out of sight when mr trump received a thank you letter from someone he knew mentioning that the writer s mother had been told she had the coronavirus the president called to express concern according to an official who asked not to be identified the only time mr trump has made a point of publicly meeting with victims of the coronavirus came in mid april when he hosted several survivors in the cabinet room an event that seemed aimed at least in part at proving he was right in promoting hydroxychloroquine an unproven treatment since a few of them had taken it since then a study has cast doubt on the drug and mr trump has stopped mentioning it as often but david mangan one of the survivors invited to the session said in an interview this week that the president seemed genuinely interested in his guests and made sure that one of them who had lyme disease saw a white house physician afterward the part of the day that was not captured by any of the media was the personal connection he had with us before the cameras were let in and after the cameras were dismissed from the room said mr mangan 57 a pharmaceutical sales account representative from hot springs ark who was joined by his wife rachel mangan who was also infected by the virus and recovered he came across i think compassionate i think he wanted to hear our stories mr mangan said mr trump should do more to show that side of him his role should show hope and inspiration but i also think it should show compassion he said there are a lot of people that are experiencing a lot of fear so i do think it has a time and a place advertisement
