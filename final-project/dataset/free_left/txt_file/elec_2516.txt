 2016 a portrait of a party in meltdown by katie glueck and kyle cheney 10 12 2016 05 12 am edt matt borges had had enough the ohio republican party chairman had spent a crazed saturday on the phone inundated by demands to respond to newly leaked audio of donald trump bragging about sexual assault and by questions about whether trump was even staying in the race so early sunday morning borges called the republican nominee himself advertisement are you considering withdrawing from the race borges asked trump fearful that there might be more devastating revelations about his party s nominee still to come absolutely not trump replied a rebuke to the slew of spooked republican lawmakers who were calling on him to quit according to borges he warned trump that he needed to knock it out of the park at the presidential debate that night to survive and they hung up agreeing to talk after the contest but by monday trump surrogates and increasingly the candidate himself seemed just as focused on tearing into the republicans defecting from trump as they did on talking up trump s debate performance that prompted borges to send an email to the other 167 members of the republican national committee those candidates and officeholders deserve the leeway to follow their conscience without fear of retribution from the party wrote the swing state party chair and former kasich supporter and the criticism of these folks from our nominee his campaign and others within the party needs to stop immediately 2016 by darren samuelsohn a half hour after sending the letter he took a call from trump who wanted to discuss the debate and borges gave the candidate the same message you are the person who put these people in this position borges said he told trump describing himself as pissed off you did that not them these are your words you need to own that ok ok trump replied in a noncommittal way according to borges yet on tuesday in the culmination of a four day horror show trump was back at it going nuclear on those who abandoned him over the tape he tweeted that the shackles have been taken off me and warned that disloyal r s are far more difficult than crooked hillary with just weeks to go until election day it s as close as it gets to a nightmare scenario for battleground state republicans pro trump loyalists have declared war on those who have renounced their presidential nominee candidates can t get their message out because of the din and democrats are milking it for all it s worth with some even rethinking shifting resources to down ballot contests that previously looked out of reach and it s all due to trump s meltdown new hampshire gop operative tom rath traveling in bermuda said his phone blew up with calls and messages just moments after the news broke friday night he spent the weekend fielding frantic messages from allies worried about the fate of sen kelly ayotte and gop gubernatorial candidate chris sununu val digiorgio gop chairman of pennsylvania s pivotal chester county said he immediately called the 28 local gop leaders in his area to gauge the depth of the damage from the remarks which were already beginning to play on a non stop loop on cable television democrats meanwhile were glued to the carnage david pepper the ohio democratic chairman was on a train with his wife and toddler saturday and to their dismay he couldn t put down his phone he plumbed sen rob portman s twitter feed it took until 8 30 p m on saturday he accurately noted for portman to fully disavow trump and pepper closely monitored the republican statements that poured in all afternoon 2016 by annie karni new hampshire democratic party chairman ray buckley said he was traveling around the state with interim democratic national committee chairwoman donna brazile when the news broke we really weren t near any computers so we were just kind of hearing it over the phone and seeing what was going on on twitter he said but by the end of the weekend he was already contemplating whether to move resources away from the state s most high profile races and toward state legislative races that are often decided by a few dozen votes if the apparent trends continue new hampshire democrats are cautiously making contingency plans for last minute shifting of additional resources to some of our normally marginal down ballot races he said dozens of races are routinely decided by less than a hundred votes any little bit of help can increase our win column by a good number the trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story the timing of the trump s debacle could hardly have been worse coinciding with the most vulnerable point in the election cycle the heart of debate season in many contests and the start of early voting which in ohio begins wednesday to have that hit at the time it did to have trump fighting with paul ryan and portman at the very time you need energetic unified volunteers we have them in huge amounts i think the republicans are literally going to see a real waning in energy pepper said an event that can really sap one side of energy give another a lot of energy to have it come the friday before early voting starts couldn t be better timing for us or worse for them to that end ted strickland the former governor of ohio whose senate challenge to portman has been given up for dead by some national democrats have largely withdrawn funding for his race sprang into action the strickland campaign blasted out statement after statement and by monday announced a new tv ad titled coward linking trump to portman who until the tape had quietly backed the gop nominee the spot highlights how senator portman continued to endorse donald trump for president even after learning about trump s derogatory comments bragging about sexual assault a failure of leadership of historic magnitude a statement from the campaign said portman condemned the tape when it was released then withdrew support from trump a day later portman then panicked in a transparent attempt to try and save his own political ambitions by heather caygle in florida where rep patrick murphy has likewise struggled to gain traction in his race against gop sen marco rubio murphy s campaign is following a similar tack though rubio condemned trump s crude remarks friday evening murphy has ripped his republican opponent as a coward for his silence since then and has busily pumped out statements tying rubio to trump adding to the challenge for down ballot republicans especially in more competitive races is the increasingly bellicose tone trump and his allies are taking toward defectors from house speaker paul ryan to the vulnerable candidates he s trying to protect like nevada senate contender joe heck and rep cresent hardy at a rally saturday morning in summerlin nevada heck a congressman read his denunciation of trump from a sheet of paper to a mixture of light applause boos and cat calls heck along with hardy kept his comments short amid audible jeers but both lawmakers said they could no longer vote for trump heck called for trump to withdraw from the race which ended up sparking sharp condemnations on conservative talk radio callers reamed out the republican congressman on monday with one saying on air as soon as it got hot in the kitchen joe heck jumped out that s not leadership kevin wall a republican talk show host said heck s incredibly bad decision has irreparably harmed his own campaign their decisions to abandon trump has hastened a split within nevada s gop leadership joe heck and cresent hardy are weak republicans here in the state said diana orrock a nevada member of the republican national committee and i think they shot themselves in the foot badly over this weekend in the statements that they made orrock who said she intended to resign from the rnc if trump loses the election said republicans are forgetting the lessons they ve been beaten over the heads with their entire careers all of our lives as republicans we ve been admonished going into a general election in particular to get on board with voting for all the republicans up and down the ticket to get as many republicans into office she said by hadas gold to the south in arizona sen john mccain is also catching it from both sides a trump tweet lambasting mccain for abandoning him on saturday became an anti mccain news release issued by his democratic opponent ann kirkpatrick within a half hour but few candidates have it worse than pennsylvania sen pat toomey who s caught in a vise toomey who has long refused to endorse either presidential candidate blasted trump s remarks over the weekend but democrats have nevertheless aggressively pursued toomey labeling him fraidy pat for ducking chances to clarify his stance on trump s candidacy since 2 p m on sunday the mcginty campaign the pennsylvania democratic party and the democratic senatorial campaign committee have sent out at least 24 news releases using the phrase toomey s not the only one facing blowback from the leaked audio pennsylvania republican sources say they expect several congressional races to feel the impact of the trump tape especially in moderate philadelphia suburbs where independent minded voters found it particularly distasteful gop rep pat meehan who represents the philadelphia suburbs has called for trump to exit the race a sign of how toxic he is in that part of the state brian fitzpatrick a congressional candidate in nearby bucks county said in a statement saturday that he would not vote for either presidential candidate being a nominee for president is such an awesome responsibility not only to your own campaign but to the party said kevin madden a veteran national republican operative that depressive effect is being felt down ballot when you re knocking on doors for swing votes you re not just getting republicans when an incident turns off so many suburban voters suburban women voters you re knocking on doors and getting it slammed in your face people don t want to go out and get doors slammed in the face still digiorgio the chester county gop chair said he surveyed local party committee members and found the remarks haven t shaken trump s core support people that are sticking with trump even if they didn t like his comments and view it as being blown way out of proportion he said as the shock of the news fades somewhat borges says he s now more focused on the newest threat the stream of comments coming from trump s twitter feed and from his surrogates attacking other republicans whether he listens to me or not as a leader in the party i feel i need to say this said borges who insisted that he was speaking out for the good of trump s campaign not just for down ticket candidates i don t want to wake up on nov 9 and say i wish i had called him he and trump have another call scheduled for wednesday morning i think i have some reinforcing to do he said elena
