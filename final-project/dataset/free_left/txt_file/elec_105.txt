with the 2016 presidential election race coming to a close tomorrow here s a roundup of 29 claims being made by donald trump and hillary clinton in their final argument speeches trump repeated many of his greatest hits of debunked claims and clinton mainly attacked trump and remember no matter what your politics please don t take your right to vote for granted trump has been making this claim for weeks but the last news releasefrom his campaign on flag officer endorsements issued sept 16 only listed 164 the list currently stands at 165 this appears to be a reference to a video of barack obama at a 2008 campaign event at kent state university in new philadelphia ohio but trump takes obama s answer out of context and obama does not say he s lucky he s from chicago a voter asked i would just like to know what you can say to reassure us that this election will not be rigged or stolen here s obama s answer trump is misleading by characterizing mexico s 16 percent value added tax or vat as a trade barrier the vat is a consumption tax levied on goods and services that are produced and sold in mexico these taxes do not apply to products exported from mexico this tax works the same way as u s federal excise taxes on certain imported but not exported goods and state retail sales taxes on domestic consumption of products and not exports according to eric toder co director of the tax policy center toder wrote on the tax policy center s taxvox blog that the vat does not favor one country s producers over another s the world trade organization rightly does not view these rules as trade barriers toder wrote they are simply ways for a country to tax its own residents without discriminating based on where goods are produced in contrast the wto would appropriately view a tariff that is imposed only on imported goods and services but exempts domestically produced products as a trade barrier this is false there were fbi agents who argued for the bureau to pursue an investigation into the clinton foundation and allegations of corruption and conflicts of interest but senior law enforcement officials believed there wasn t enough evidence to move forward according to the wall street journal s detailed account of the infighting over whether to investigate the clinton foundation it isn t unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited but the internal debates about the clinton foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president the journal reported trumpisciting fbi data showing homicides were up 10 8 percent nationwide in 2015 that was the biggest percentage jump in a single year since 1971 sometimes he incorrectly cites this figure to say that we have the highest murder rate in this country in 45 years we have awarded that incorrect version four pinocchios we frequently warn against comparing crime trends from short periods of time such as year over year an annual trend can show a trajectory of where the trend might be headed but still does not give a full picture crime trends are determined over at least five years preferably 10 or 20 years of data the sharp increase in violent crime rate and homicide rates in 2015 do notnecessarily indicate a crime wave overall violent crimes and murders have been declining nationwide since their peak in 1991 trump repeats a three pinocchio comparison of how petraeus and clinton handled classified information fbi director james b comey has rejected the claim that petraeus got in trouble for far less than clinton it s the reverse comey has said as the petraeus case illustrates perfectly the kind of cases the department of justice is willing to prosecute mainly the petraeus case involved a combination of obstruction of justice intentional misconduct and a vast quantity of classified information that did not exist in the clinton case and petraeus admitted that he knew that was the wrong thing to do comey has said trump compared the case of kristian saucier to the clinton email case to illustrate that others have been punished for doing nothing by comparison to what she s done but saucier s case is not exactly comparable either thenavy sailor was sentenced to prison after taking photos in classified areas of a nuclear submarine he then destroyed the evidence after learning that he was under investigation in fact saucier s lawyers even acknowledged that the two cases were different saucier admitted knowing that what he was doing was illegal unlike clinton we have awarded three pinocchios to this claim under section 243 d of the immigration and nationality act the secretary of state does have power todiscontinue the granting of certain types of visas to countries that refuse to take back their citizens with u s deportation orders including convicted criminals such action is taken rarely and is used against relatively small countries with little economic power trump goes too far suggestingthat clinton decided to allow these illegal immigrants to stay here under clinton the state department and immigration and customs enforcement in 2011 signed a memorandum of understanding to increase pressure on recalcitrant countries this formalized a series of increasingly tougher steps that could be taken when dealing with countries that refuse to accept the return of their nationals at the end of that process the secretary s authority under section 243 d could be invoked this is a reference to findings of a 2012 pew center on the states studyof ways to make the election system more accurate cost effective and efficient there were morethan 1 8 million records for people who are deceased but whose registrations were still on voter rolls about 2 75 million people were registered to vote in more than one state which could happen if voters move to a new state and register to vote without notifying their former state as we have noted the study does not say that these problems indicated signs of isolated or widespread voter fraud as trump suggests trump repeatedly points out premium hikes in 2017 under the affordable care act and has been using a version of this claim tailored to the state in which he is speaking as we ve explained most americans get their health insurance through their employer and thus are not impacted and a majority of people who purchase health care on the state exchange will not be affected by the increases for example individual health plans sold on the state exchange in michigan will increase 16 7 percent next year but most people in michigan who purchase health care on the state exchange qualify for tax credit subsidies and won t be affected according to the detroit free press if a person makes too much income to qualify for a subsidy then they would face a premium increase trump is technically correct on the timeline but clinton s staff had requested the emails to be deleted months before the subpoena according to the fbi s august 2016 report an employee of the company that managed her server told the fbi he had an oh s moment and realized he did not delete the emails until after the subpoena moreover there s no evidence clinton deleted the emails in anticipation of the subpoena and fbi director james b comey has said his agency s investigation found no evidence that any work related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them here s politifact s helpful timeline of events relating to clinton s release of her emails ford is moving its small car production to mexico but the company has said the expansion will not affect u s workers production of ford focus models will shift to mexico but the plant in michigan will build other larger vehicles ford said mexico is increasingly attractive for automakers because of the low cost of labor which makes it cheaper to make labor intensive small cars in mexico but it tends to be cheaper to build larger and more expensive cars in the united states where electricity is cheaper and there is more access to equipment and skilled technicians not exactly clinton supported the secure fence act of 2006 which authorized the construction of fencing along the u s mexico border the fence is mostly vehicle barriers and single layer pedestrian fence trump has called for a border wall of precast concrete as tall as 30 to 60 feet in a january 2016 interview with jorge ramos clinton said the fence is different from trump s wall so we do need to have secure borders and what that will take is a combination of technology and physical barrier i voted for border security and some of it was a fence trump himself has calledthe fencing under the secure fence act of 2006 such a little wall it was such a nothing wall as we have pointed out repeatedly trump s complaints about currency manipulation by china are out of date china has not manipulated its currency for at least two years and the yuan has appreciated over the past decade recently china has been selling dollars and running down its reserves in an effort to strengthen the currency once upon a time not too long ago we awarded trump the rare geppetto checkmark for using the most up to date figure of 20 veteran suicides a day alas he has reverted since then to using the 22 figure a rough and outdated estimatebased on partial data in 2014 an average of 20 veterans died from suicide a day this is based on thefindings of the most comprehensive data driven study of veteran suicides to date published august 2016 for the first time federal agencies pieced together 55 million veteran records over 35 years using military health and mortality data the study confirmed that veterans generally have higher suicides rates than civilian populations though the degree of difference varies for specific populations trump revived an oldie but goodie that he repeated throughout the primaries but it s still inaccurate pew research center using 2014 data found that the tax bill for americans under various scenarios is below average for developed countries in 2014 according to comparative tables of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product the broadest measure of the economy was 26 percent for the united states out of 34 countries that put the united states in the bottom third and well below the oecd average of 34 4 percent trump repeats a four pinocchio claim the bureau of labor statistics unemployment rate for black youth as of july 2016 is 20 6 percent about one third of the rate trump uses the bls unemployment rate refers to people who are actively looking for jobs but can t find one trump s rateincludes anyone who doesn t have a job whether they are looking for one or not that s particularly problematic with this age range of 16 to 24 years old because trump is counting students as unemployed even though they are in school full time trump s statement lacks context and has earned two pinocchios he could point to 32 countries and probably more where the islamic state has conducted attacks occupies territoryor has terrorist cells that have pledged some sort of allegiance but that is half the size of a comparable list for al qaeda after the sept 11 2001 attacks moreover trump implies thatislamic state has operational control in 32 countries the congressional research service in a june 2016 report listed only six affiliates beyond iraq and syria in egypt saudi arabia libya nigeria afghanistan and yemen we have awarded four pinocchios to thisabsurd comparison broadly speaking people who are in the united states illegally aren t granted the same rights as people here legally both civilians and veterans unauthorized people who are not granted any deferred action status that deems them lawfully present in the country are not eligible to receive social security benefits or any other federal means tested benefits even though many of thempay into social security these lines are all derived from actual statements by trump though in many cases he may have said it only once this is correct on sept 11 2001 trump called wwor tv in new york and made this observation during the 10 minute interview forty wall st actually was the second tallest building in downtown manhattan and it was actually before the world trade center was the tallest and then when they built the world trade center it became known as the second tallest and now it s the tallest there are strong elements of truth in this line but some of it is exaggerated this is true most former republican presidents secretaries of state and national security advisers have remained silent in stark contrast to the strong endorsements of mitt romney in 2012 clinton has been endorsed by brent scowcroft national security adviser under george h w bush and colin powell secretary of state under george w bush who also endorsed obama condoleezza rice who was national security adviser and then secretary of state for george w bush called on trump to drop out of the race there is no way to guarantee this clinton is referring to a proposed law called the paycheck fairness act which would make it easier to sue an employer as we have often noted the pay gap shrinks when factors within a women s control such as choice of occupation and work hours are taken into consideration but there remains a smaller unexplained gap that may be the result of discrimination trump has said this but he s also said the opposite we counted at least five flip flops by trump on this issue more recently he has been open to raising the federal minimum wage trump s practice of not paying bills to contractors has been well documented see for instance this investigation by usa today the clinton campaign can document all of these assertions clinton appears to have modified this claim after our colleagues at politifact found her use of the term bills was half true that s because the list includes nonbinding resolutions and amendments of bills that clinton sponsored only three all noncontroversial became law clinton is listed as a co sponsor on 74 bills that became law of those 27 bills were sponsored by a republican clinton has recast a talking point that previously earned her four pinocchios she used to say trump opposed the government led rescue of the auto industry in 2008 2009 but that was false now she has focused on a meandering comment about the auto bailout on aug 11 2015 in which he tried to have it all ways you could have let it go and rebuild itself through the free enterprise system trump said you could have let it go bankrupt frankly and rebuild itself and a lot of people think that s the way it should have happened or you could have done it the way it went i could have done it either way either way would have been acceptable i think you would have wound up in the same place as can be seen from the full statement trump said the outcome would have been the same no matter what path was chosen experts would disagree he did not say as clinton suggested that it would not have mattered if the auto
