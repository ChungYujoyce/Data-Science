this it s just f up said jim rhoades a republican elector from michigan who runs a home inspection service i ve lost a bunch of business in recent decades the electoral college had become such a reliable rubber stamp of election day results that it was viewed as an afterthought but with many democrats desperate to block the all but certain ascension of donald trump to the white house this

elector alexander kim who estimated he has received at least 30 such calls one rnc insider he said called him three times in one hour to get a response there s a reason electors like kim make republicans nervous while he insists he s voting for trump when the body meets on monday and that nothing can shake him from that position there is a caveat unless trump does something to violate the compact that he created with american citizens just that eyelash of doubt kim suspects has led to his barrage of calls from the party by kyle cheney the tumultuous 2016 primary campaign is in part responsible for the manic lobbying efforts dozens of electors have some degree of hostility to trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton both of whom won their party nominations after contentious
