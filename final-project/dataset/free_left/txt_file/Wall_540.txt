advertisement supported by the move is part of an effort by the acting director of national intelligence to prod countries that outlaw homosexuality to instead decriminalize it by julian e barnes washington the trump administration is considering cutting back on sharing intelligence with partner countries that criminalize homosexuality as part of a push by the acting director of national intelligence richard grenell to prod those nations to change their laws the intelligence community should be pushing american values with the countries it works with mr grenell said in an interview this week we can t just simply make the moral argument and expect others to respond in kind because telling others that it s the right thing to do doesn t always work he said but he added to fight for decriminalization is to fight for basic human rights mr grenell is thought to be the first openly gay cabinet member and has put anti discrimination issues near the top of his agenda in his earlier post as the american ambassador to germany mr grenell began last year assembling gay lesbian bisexual and transgender groups from the united states and other countries as part of the administration s effort to change anti gay laws while tying human rights reforms to national security is often the hallmark of democratic administrations mixing hard power priorities with trade and other issues has been part of president trump s foreign policy stuart milk head of the harvey milk foundation and nephew of harvey milk the first openly gay elected official in a major american city said mr grenell reached out to work with his organization on decriminalization mr milk said he was cleareyed about the trump administration s poor record on l g b t rights particularly given its efforts to roll back anti discrimination efforts for transgender troops in the military in some ways ric is driving this without a lot of deep support in the administration mr milk said but i think he is very sincere he is someone who believes at the very minimum decriminalization should happen and if we have an administration where people wouldn t suspect this drive to be coming from it makes it a little bit more powerful mr grenell said he had the backing of the white house we have the president s total support he said this is an american value and this is united states policy about 69 countries criminalize homosexuality mostly in the middle east africa and southeast asia but the list of countries includes some critical american intelligence partners such as egypt saudi arabia and kenya mr grenell would not say whether the administration was considering withholding additional cooperation or ratcheting back current intelligence sharing with countries that criminalize homosexuality his office is forming a group to review the issue and develop ideas intelligence officials said if a country that we worked in as the united states intelligence community was arresting women because of their gender we would absolutely do something about it mr grenell said ultimately the united states is safer when our partners respect basic human rights mr grenell has also suggested in meetings that foreign aid be used as an incentive to prod countries with bans on homosexuality to remove them said hadi damien the founder of lebanon s beirut pride group who participated in the discussions mr grenell held as ambassador to germany but mr grenell has been careful to try to use aid as an incentive to alter laws not a sanction against countries while the u s or any other country cannot influence how other countries process their domestic affairs the u s can push toward change through the voice of its officials and through the implementation of its programs mr damien said while mr grenell is serving only in an acting capacity and his appointment will likely end in september or when the senate confirms a replacement he has begun work on some controversial changes including a review aimed at shrinking the office of the director of national intelligence and sending some officers detailed to that office back to their home intelligence agencies he has also rebuffed calls by democrats for him to hold off on those changes i am not a seat warmer mr grenell said the president asked me to do a job and i am going to do the job to the best of my ability in a letter sent last week to the agencies he oversees mr grenell said the intelligence community needed to do better to detect and respond to discrimination and harassment of gay lesbian and transgender people i expect every i c agency to ensure policies are specific and deliberate in protecting the l g b t work force mr grenell wrote in the interview mr grenell said his office was reviewing the security clearance process and the kinds of questions that contractors and f b i agents were asking during background checks he said he wanted to ensure the process did not lead to transgender people in transition being outed to former colleagues or gay people who were not out to families being put in difficult positions you have to be sensitive to the individual s personal situation but the l g b t community also has to remember authenticity in the i c is fundamental to doing national security and intelligence jobs mr grenell said you don t ever want to be in a position of hiding anything that is how you can be compromised or blackmailed so it is really important to be authentic but to be authentic people need to feel comfortable and safe until the 1980s the government denied security clearances to gays lesbians bisexual and transgender people under the belief that their sexual identity could be used to force them to give up secrets while those questions have been removed from security clearance questionnaires mr milk said that discrimination against gay lesbian and transgender people persists in the intelligence agencies mr milk held a session last year at the pentagon where he spoke with people working for the national security agency defense intelligence agency and other agencies we had a lot of people from the intelligence community at this listening event people from the n s a and other intelligence branches who were talking about how difficult it was still to this day to be l g b t in those branches of government mr milk said advertisement
