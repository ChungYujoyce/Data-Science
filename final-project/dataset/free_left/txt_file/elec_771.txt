advertisement supported by political memo by jonathan martin urbandale iowa one endured a childhood without running water another spent his youth toiling over a mcdonald s grill and yet another is the son of a man who came to america with money sewn in his underwear you would be forgiven if you mistook the initial introductions of the 2016 presidential candidates for latter day and somewhat clich d versions of a horatio alger story the current white house hopefuls appear eager to outdo one another in recounting their up from poverty biographies even if it means reaching back more than one generation candidates have sought to highlight their hardscrabble roots since the republic was young robert strauss the former democratic chairman who died last year once said every politician wants every voter to believe he was born in a log cabin he built himself yet as members of this group of presidential aspirants travel the circuit of banquets and forums they seem intent on also claiming credit for chopping down the tree that supplied the logs that is in large part because in addition to featuring the son of a cotton farmer the son of a small town minister and the granddaughter of a factory worker the 2016 field includes the son and brother of a president whose grandfather was a senator as jeb bush stockpiles money and attracts early support largely because of his family name his potential adversaries are seeking to differentiate themselves by all but stating explicitly that they are no senator s grandson unlike some out there i didn t inherit fame or fortune from my family gov scott walker republican of wisconsin told a group of religious broadcasters last month mr walker whose father was a baptist minister may be the least subtle about it but nearly all the candidates are introducing or reintroducing themselves to voters in ways that shine a light on mr bush s privileged origins rick perry the former governor of texas was reared on a cotton farm in a house without running water senator ted cruz republican of texas had the father who arrived in the united states with cash in his underwear and mr walker spent some of his teenage years laboring under the golden arches listen my dad put himself through college at night he worked at an ice cream plant in newark new jersey to put himself through college at night after he came back from the army and the next generation his son is the governor of the state of new jersey gov chris christie said at the conservative political action conference last month not to be outdone senator marco rubio republican of florida told cpac about his parents emigration from cuba and the sacrifices they made for their children they had little money no connections quite frankly barely spoke the language and had a very limited education said mr rubio but the stories are not confined to the likely republican field hillary rodham clinton the all but announced democratic candidate used a speech last week to recount a family history that could have come from the pages of a theodore dreiser novel donald j trump officially accepted the republican party s nomination on july 22 hillary clinton was officially nominated on july 26 at the democratic convention i m like so many of you in this room and others whom i ve met across this country mrs clinton told emily s list a democratic women s group my grandfather was a factory worker started at the age of 11 worked until he was 65 and got to retire his son my father went to college was a small business man who worked really hard and made a good life for us my mother had a terrible abusive childhood had to leave at the age of 14 to go to work in order to support herself having been abandoned by both her parents and her paternal grandparents if mrs clinton would like to portray herself as far removed from the goldman sachs boardrooms and east hampton beaches that some in her own party have tried to brand her with republicans feel even more urgency to connect to the electorate for the republicans there is a tactical reason to contrast themselves with mr bush but the need to portray themselves as average americans is even more fundamental the last two republican presidential nominees each wealthy lost in part because voters did not believe the candidates could relate to their struggles mitt romney was savaged by democrats for his tendency to affirm many rich guy stereotypes short of using summer as a verb when mr romney briefly considered a third presidential bid this year republicans pointed to what they saw as the most damning statistic from the 2012 exit polls among voters who said the candidate quality that most mattered to them was cares about people like me president obama won 81 percent to mr romney s 18 percent it has a lot to do with romney and the disastrous campaign last time said dave carney a republican strategist adding that mr romney was for much of the 2012 campaign reluctant to show a more human side the everyman strategy is being employed this cycle in part because republicans generally poll worse than democrats on questions about who can better relate to voters and because of the likely prospect of facing mrs clinton in the general election mrs clinton has her own vulnerabilities such as those 300 000 speeches and the fact that she has not driven a car for nearly a quarter century as the other potential republican candidates sketch their only in america story what is mr bush left to say transcript na john kerry in 2004 leaned on his naval service in vietnam and george w bush recalled his overcoming a fondness for beer bourbon and b b to connect to americans with similar experiences but jeb bush did not serve in the military and had no bouts with the bottle what mr bush does have mr carney noted is a life story similar to that of his father who had children young and left his parents east coast preserve for a new life in the oil patch forty one went to west texas in a studebaker kicking up dust mr carney said of the first president george bush for whom he worked as mr bush touched down here in suburban des moines on friday for his first event in iowa as a likely presidential candidate hints of some forthcoming made for campaign biography could be heard i fell head over heels in love with this young beautiful girl from le n guanajuato mexico and it kind of changed my life mr bush said of meeting his wife when he was 17 he added my life can be divided between b c and a c before columba and after columba then echoing his father he explained how he had set out on his own we got married quickly we had two kids we lived in venezuela working for a bank he said it had the all the makings of an eventual tv spot at least until he got to the part about the bank advertisement
