political report recently shifted the race for the seat in detroit s suburbs from leans republican to toss up tuesday night was a disappointment for the democratic progressive insurgency sanders and alexandria ocasio cortez had travelled to michigan and kansas in support of candidates who shared the platform of medicare for all and 15 federal minimum wage arguing that a liberal agenda that worked in the bronx could work in red states in michigan el sayed whom sanders campaigned for last weekend was easily defeated in every county in kansas where sanders and ocasio cortez hoped their support

gop said the congressman ben ray luj n chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee the fact that we are still counting ballots is an ominous sign for their prospects in november meanwhile missouri voters soundly rejected a right to work law that would have undermined labor organizing in the state delivering a major victory to unions whose power has been greatly undermined by the supreme court and republican controlled state legislatures the right to work legislation was passed by missouri s republican led legislature and signed into law by the state s then republican governor in february 2017 but it never went into effect because labor organizations collected more than 300 000 signatures far exceeding the number required to force a referendum today we sent a clear message to any politician ceo or dark money donor who wants to silence working people the missouri afl cio president mike louis said after the vote was called we will stand together and yell louder than ever before because our families depend upon us supporters of right to work laws say employees should not be compelled to pay union fees when they are hired the fair share fees paid by non union members are less than full union dues and are intended to cover collective bargaining costs earlier this year the supreme court ruled that public sector workers were not obligated to pay union dues
