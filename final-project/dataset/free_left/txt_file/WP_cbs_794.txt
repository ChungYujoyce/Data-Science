plurality of democrats 40 in total said they were not yet settled on a candidate as summer came to a close however nearly every democrat said they were starting to give the field a closer look it s kind of hard to figure out who i want to support because there s so many candidates alicia elliott a 40 year old des moines server said one of the reasons i m at the fair today is actually because there s a lot of democratic candidates and i want to hear what they re saying it s too hard to make a decision frank gale 74 said i m not too sure why a few candidates threw their name in the first place cause i think they really had no chance of going anywhere joebiden has been at the iowa fair for 10 mins and he is already getting ice cream pic twitter com 2kqrnbradh other iowans came to the fair with their favorite presidential hopeful in mind former vice president joe biden led the class with 23 democrats saying they would like to see him take on president donald trump next year some biden backers cited his time as vice president as reason enough to support him anna jackson morris 66 summed up her support as ride or die biden because president obama trusted him therefore i trust him others say pragmatism is pushing them towards biden i m interesting because my favorite candidate is not who i am gonna vote for ellen pirro 70 said as she sat knitting with her local wool spinning guild at the moment it seems to be biden and if that s the case i will definitely vote for him because i want trump beaten more than a particular candidate but pirro said her second choice is sen elizabeth warren who 13 others at the fair said was their top choice married couple marla johnson 61 and marla rigby 66 from prairie city iowa said even though they are not innately familiar with the details of warren s plans they know she has them and trust her as knowledgeable similarly a group of bandana clad des moines university medical students agreed and said her focus on student loans

points but would eventually lose to barack obama in august 2015 hillary clinton s 19 point lead over sanders crumbled into a 0 3 win for her on caucus day it s a big snowballing effect that happens here over the next few months iowa democratic party chair troy price told cbs news there isn t one point where everyone will have made up their mind and honestly given the nature of the field right now i don t know if there will be a point where it locks in the latest iowa caucus poll by monmouth university indicates similar candidate popularity as these fair interviews with biden and warren amassing the most support a large majority of democrats interviewed said they are worried about the future of the economy in iowa democrats indicated while the economy may be working for them personally the trade war with china is threatening the state s agriculture sector for the country there is a lot of wealth on the coasts but it s not here andy argenbright 52 said it s really weird here because you have a lot of people in the small towns that are making almost nothing but then you come to des moines and the salaries are two to three times more others believe the impact from the tariffs will come to bear in the future right now the economy is good but i think we have some warning signs here robert head 80 a farmer who rents his land said we re actually paying for these tariffs not china asked to rate the economy on a scale of 1 to 10 with higher numbers meaning more strength the democrats cbs news interviewed gave it a 5 4 on average fixing the holes in the

undecided voters also spoke favorably about a single payer healthcare system like medicare for all while visiting the horse barn with their two young sons christi and jenniffer bethards welch who are both undecided but are leaning toward supporting harris or sanders said they hoped the as the caucus creeps closer the candidates healthcare plans become more clear we are adoptive parents and we deal with a lot with medical issues and learning disabilities that are not covered by private insurance that we struggle to get help with christi said while admitting private insurance right now is a great thing to keep but i do love the idea of medicare for all she added other healthcare issues like mental health funding and high prescription drug prices were also overwhelmingly mentioned as a problem affecting the lives of the democrats interviewed jackie osam 39 complained that there were too many candidates in the race but that she s leaning toward sanders for his tough talk against
