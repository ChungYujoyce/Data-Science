watch cbsn live october 16 2019 6 28 am cbs ap belgrade serbia when hundreds of video cameras with the power to identify and track individuals started appearing in the streets of belgrade as part of a major surveillance project some protesters began having second thoughts about joining anti government demonstrations in the serbian capital local authorities assert the system created by chinese telecommunications company huawei helps reduce crime in the city of 2 million critics contend it erodes personal freedoms makes political opponents vulnerable to retribution and even exposes the country s citizens to snooping by the chinese government the cameras equipped with facial recognition technology are being rolled out across hundreds of cities around the world particularly in poorer countries with weak track records on human rights where beijing has increased its influence through big business deals with the united states claiming that chinese state authorities can get backdoor access to huawei data the aggressive rollout is raising concerns about the privacy of millions of people in countries with little power to stand up to china the system can be used to trail political opponents monitor regime critics at any moment which is completely against the law said serbia s former commissioner for personal data protection rodoljub sabic groups opposed to serbian president aleksandar vucic say police are leaking video of protests to pro government media which publish the images along with the identities of participants vucic himself has boasted the police have the capability to count each head at anti government gatherings during a recent rally protesters climbed up a pole and covered a camera lens with duct tape scrawled with the word censored serbian police deny any such abuse of the huawei system which will eventually encompass 1 000 cameras in 800 locations throughout belgrade huawei said in a statement that it complies with all applicable laws and regulations in serbia and anywhere else it does business while facial recognition technology is being adopted in many countries spurring debate over the balance between privacy and safety the huawei system has gained extra attention due to accusations that chinese laws requiring companies to assist in national intelligence work give authorities access to its data as a result some countries are reconsidering using huawei technology particularly the superfast 5g networks that are being rolled out later this year still huawei which denies accusations of any chinese government control has had no trouble finding customers eager to install its so called safe cities technology particularly among countries that china has brought closer into its diplomatic and economic orbit besides serbia that list includes turkey russia ukraine azerbaijan angola laos kazakhstan kenya and uganda as well as a few liberal democracies like germany france and italy the system is used in some 230 cities exposing tens of millions of people to its screening in a promotional brochure huawei says its video surveillance technology can scan over long distances to detect abnormal behavior such as loitering track the movement of cars and people calculate crowd size and send alerts to a command center if it detects something suspicious local authorities can then act upon the information they receive in one case advertised on its website the company says a suspect in a hit and run accident in belgrade was later discovered in china with the help of face recognition data shared by the serbian police with their chinese counterparts in view of the cybersecurity accusations leveled by the u s and international rights groups against huawei the relationship between china and countries that use the company s technology is coming under renewed scrutiny china s influence in serbia a european union candidate that beijing views as a gateway to the continent has significantly expanded in recent years through beijing s global belt and road investment programs the populist serbian regime has been keen to develop closer ties and the country s fragile democracy allows china s economic interests to grow relatively unchecked without raising too many questions about human rights environmental standards or transparency china s state investment bank has granted billions of dollars in easy term loans to build coal powered plants roads railroads and bridges chinese police officers even help patrol the streets of belgrade a security presence officially billed as assisting the growing number of chinese tourists who visit the city it s a similar story in uganda where china has invested heavily in infrastructure like highways and a hydropower dam on the nile when longtime president yoweri museveni launched a 126 million project to install huawei facial recognition systems a year ago he said the cameras were eyes ears and a nose to fight rampant street crime in the sprawling capital kampala opposition activists say the real goal is to deter street protesters against an increasingly unpopular government the cameras are politically motivated said joel ssenyonyi a spokesman for the musician and activist known as bobi wine who has emerged as a powerful challenger to museveni they are not doing this for security the focus for them is hunting down political opponents in neighboring kenya the government has also renewed its focus on public safety after a spate of extremist attacks it has been pushing to register people digitally including by recording dna iris and facial data to do so it turned to china which helped finance the installation of surveillance cameras in kenya as far back as 2012 the kenyan government wants to pool into one database all the information from public and private cctv cameras including those with facial recognition technology a move that activists warn would vastly expand its surveillance powers in a country that does not have comprehensive data protection laws san francisco became the first city in the u s to ban facial recognition technology earlier this year this came as part of broader oversight legislation that orders san francisco police and other public agencies to spell out details of any surveillance currently in use and any surveillance they hope to use elsewhere growing number of countries are following china s lead in deploying artificial intelligence to track citizens according to the carnegie endowment for international peace the group says at least 75 countries are actively using ai tools such as facial recognition for surveillance and huawei has sold its systems in 50 of those countries giving it a far wider reach than competitors such as japan based nec and u s based ibm it s very unclear what safeguards are being put in place said steven feldstein a carnegie endowment fellow who authored a report on the issue where are images being stored how long are they being stored for what kind of accountability procedures will there be what type of operations will be linked to these surveillance cameras huawei said in an emailed statement that it complies with all applicable laws and regulations in our countries of business this is the most fundamental principle of our business operations we are dedicated to bringing people better connectivity eliminating digital gaps and promoting the sustainable development of our societies and economies in belgrade s bustling downtown republic square high tech video cameras are pointed in all directions from an office building as
