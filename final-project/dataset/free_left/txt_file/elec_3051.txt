 being jeb bush these days means coping with a series of petty humiliations at a weekend conference in miami fundraisers questioned the direction of the campaign and worried it s too late for a rebound during a foreign policy speech in washington people slipped out of the room to go see rival chris christie instead the jebbush com domain was redirected to donald trump s website because the bush campaign failed to lock it down and on the campaign trail the press corps following the former florida governor is dwindling and focused mostly on his terrible polling numbers now mired in the low single digits while front runner trump packs arenas with thousands fifth place bush rarely musters more than a couple hundred at any given stop at an event in newton iowa last week bush sounded almost incredulous at his position in the race who has the leadership skills to actually make the tough decisions to fix the things that aren t working right now that are holding people back bush said in front of the crowd of about 100 and who has the ideas going forward that will allow us to rise up as a nation and finally he added who can beat hillary clinton for crying out loud the crowd applauded a few minutes later an older gentlemen in the back nodded off is jeb bush ready to embrace his last name no presidential candidate named bush has been in this position before george h w bush lost his 1980 bid for president but never slipped as low as jeb bush has after an early setback in the 2000 new hampshire primary george w bush rebounded and cleared the gop field it doesn t show in the polls but bush has become a stronger campaigner maintaining a grueling schedule of early morning coffee meet and greets interviews with small town television reporters and nighttime town halls and speeches and he still has more money than the rest of the field traveling in a packed suv with a bodyguard a personal aide a press spokesperson and a campaign videographer he seems more comfortable in his own skin but no matter how hard he tries nothing has helped reverse his slide we have had success raising money i ve had success connecting with crowds you guys have been there i m not making this stuff up bush told reporters last week in iowa we re garnering support at each and every event i m confident that we re doing all the right things then he turned to the democratic party s presidential front runner who is neck and neck with bush in many polling matchups in spite of all the pundits saying the end is near which is totally untrue if you look at the head to head polls where i m head to head with hillary clinton i beat her bush said gosh it must not be as bad as you think regardless of how he might fare against clinton bush has stalled at around fifth place among republican primary voters both in national and early state polls he sits between the top tier contenders trump ben carson and sens ted cruz r tex and marco rubio r fla and the rest of the pack including new jersey gov

governor bill owens who is co chairing bush s campaign in that state said the candidate has high name id an excellent record to run on and is well funded he also said bush s recent emphasis on criticizing clinton is a wise strategy the republican party has nominated lots of candidates over the years who were great in the primary process but couldn t win the general election he said for jeb bush the only thing that matters is winning the general election charlie pelton 75 who heard bush speak last week in clinton iowa said he appreciated the candidate s increased focus on foreign affairs and national security he conceded that you don t win elections in iowa on foreign policy generally but that s what our nation needs bush s diminishment was visible at the republican jewish coalition s all day candidate summit on thursday precisely the sort of forum where he might have been expected to dominate right to rise usa the super pac supporting his bid held a breakfast for interested donors and bush held a closed door meet and greet in the main room bush earned a standing ovation when he took the stage and gave an energetic speech about his ability to whup clinton but numerous would be
