the following is a transcript of an interview with national security adviser robert o brien that aired sunday november 10 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan joining us now to weigh in on syria and more is the president s national security adviser robert o brien good morning to you mr ambassador national security adviser robert o brien good morning margaret margaret brennan you just heard charlie lay out a very complicated landscape diplomacy means talking to your friends and to your enemies and having difficult conversations but you just heard everything charlie laid out i mean erdo an defied the united states by invading syria he s buying russian made weapons he s doing everything you re telling him not to why is he getting rewarded for bad behavior o brien well let me just point out margaret that that you got it right and unfortunately charlie got it wrong when charlie said we greenlighted the invasion of syria of syria that s just absolutely false it didn t happen margaret brennan well the u s moved troops o brien the president the president margaret brennan out of the way o brien well the president made it very clear that that turkey shouldn t go in he even said if you go in i may have to obliterate your economy he did it on twitter he did it on on the phone he did it a letter that was a very strongly worded letter so the so the idea that the u s somehow greenlighted turkey s military operation that s that s just simply false and and the american people shouldn t shouldn t believe that now what he did do we had 28 green berets who were at a forward operating post on the border that would have been caught in a crossfire between 15 000 turkish troops and armor and and seven or eight thousand ypg sdf troops and the president was not willing margaret brennan kurdish forces o brien kurdish forces margaret brennan that are allies with the u s o brien correct and the president was not going to leave those young men in in harm s way in a crossfire and so he pulled those those troops out because it s look it s ultimately it s the president who has to call the families it s the president who has to go to dover margaret brennan right o brien if something happens margaret brennan but that s why the question is relevant why reward that bad behavior this is a nato ally who is putting u s troops at risk who is putting u s allies at risk o brien well we re not rewarding the behavior the president promptly put on sanctions and margaret brennan and then he took them off o brien well he did because the turks agreed to a cease fire and and turkey said they wouldn t agree to a cease fire the president dispatched me and a number of top diplomats david satterfield jim jeffrey and then then dispatched the secretary of state and the vice president to ankara and in 24 hours we had a cease fire and by the way that was a cease fire that the kurdish forces had a lot of input into we want we wanted to save lives we wanted to save turkish lives and keep in mind there were turkish civilians being killed and and rocketed by the kurds there were kurdish folks being killed including turkish soldiers we got a cease fire and and in a short amount of time we got those kurdish soldiers evacuated to to a safe area so i think the kurds appreciated the cease fire i think the turks did as well and that was a a real diplomatic coup from the president because he because of his tough line margaret brennan do you recognize that there were war crimes committed o brien look it some of the things that we ve seen are very disturbing and margaret brennan by turkey o brien well margaret brennan and turkish supported militias o brien maybe the turkish supported militias turkey has assured us that those are being investigated we re very concerned about those issues the war crimes issues we re watching them we re monitoring it very closely there is no place for genocide for ethnic cleansing for war crimes in the 21st century the u s won t stand by for it and and we ve made that position very clear to the turks margaret brennan if congress passes any of the at least three sanctions bills on turkey that are going to get bipartisan support will the president veto all of them o brien look we ll have to see what what happens this week with our meetings with president erdo an i mean there are things that turkey s a member of nato turkey plays a very important geopolitical role for for our friends in europe for ourselves they they sit astride the bosporus margaret brennan right o brien the strait that goes into the black sea we have nato allies romania and bulgaria that are black sea powers so so losing turkey as as an ally is not something that s good for the europe for europe or for the united states margaret brennan let s talk o brien and and we re going to we re going to work on making sure that margaret brennan yeah o brien we can do our very best to keep them as a as a nato member margaret brennan more to talk about your portfolio in a moment we have to take a break we ll be right back break margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we continue our conversation with ambassador robert o brien national security adviser to president trump i i want to pick up on this idea where we left it with turkey coming and they are a nato ally as you emphasized one of our nato allies the french president emmanuel macron said this week that nato is suffering a brain death because of lack of american support and resolve from what he s seeing and then what we re seeing with turkey causing these cracks in the alliance i mean you must be very concerned is that why you ve brought the nato secretary general to the white house this week as well o brien well we the nato summit coming up the third and fourth of december so we ll be in london for that summit i think i think it s going to be a good summit between nato allies nato s an important alliance to us but look i think the cracks of that have formed in the alliance are because we have members of the alliance that aren t paying their fair share that aren t spending money on defense i mean the the united states taxpayer and and the taxpayer of eight of the nato country taxpayers of eight of the nato countries that are spending their two percent on national defense we spend over 4 percent they re doing the right things but there are a bunch of countries including germany and others that that aren t paying their fair share it s not it s not right for the american taxpayer to have to defend these countries that don t want to defend themselves so so the president has been very very strong on this issue there s been a hundred billion dollars in new nato defense spending since he took office it s a great accomplishment of president trump i think the americans are happy about it i think most europeans are happy about it margaret brennan well emmanuel macron was voicing out loud some real concerns and if you look at what turkey has done as you just described you thought that there was a potential nato ally would fire on the united states intentionally or not in syria you ve also seen turkey go ahead and buy russian made weapons in defiance of nato o brien yeah we re we re very upset about that and we ve made margaret brennan can you get behind sanctions on them o brien well margaret brennan i mean they re supposed to be triggered by congress o brien well look look if if turkey doesn t get rid of the s 400 i mean there will likely be sanctions the caatsa sanctions will will pass congress with an overwhelming bipartisan majority and turkey will feel the impact of those sanctions we we ve made that very clear to president erdo an there s no place in nato for the s 400 there s no place in nato for significant russian military purchases that s a message that the president will deliver to him very clearly when he s here in washington margaret brennan i know you re just back from asia the president says he wants to meet with xi jinping and possibly get a trade deal by december is that a hard date on the calendar o brien look there there s no deadline we want to get a good deal and i think we re very close to getting a phase one trade deal and it will be the first time that we ve had a trade deal where china has actually respected the united states and and hasn t you know stolen intellectual property has been fair and reciprocal in trade so if we can get a good deal then we ll get a good deal i think we re very close and i think if there is a deal the president and president xi will will get together and sign it look we want great relations with china but this is the first president that stood up to china that that has been you know stealing american intellectual property not all american companies that have access to chinese markets engage in unfair trade practices that has to come to an end because the chinese have been using that to fill to to fund one of the most massive military buildups in history margaret brennan right o brien and and and you know that has to come to a stop margaret brennan well as i just said you re back from asia you ve been raising concerns about china s militarization particularly of the south china sea i mean this only seems to be escalating militarily o brien well i don t think it s escalated militarily i think the president put tariffs on on china we ve always and and those tariffs have have led the chinese to the negotiating table and i think we re going to get a pretty good deal for the american people especially for the american farmers for owners of intellectual property margaret brennan so so you see a trade deal going ahead and what you re talking about in terms of militarization in the south china sea that kind of thing is not going to complicate o brien look we re we re going to still stand up and i did at the asean summit at the east asia summit i made it very clear that that just because one country s big and other countries are small in the region the bigger countries shouldn t bully the smaller countries and and take their resources whether they re fishery resources or oil and gas resources and the u s navy will continue to have freedom of navigation operations through the south china sea this nine dash line or cow s tongue that the chinese have drawn around the entire south china sea which is a major swath of the pacific ocean and claimed that as internal waters as if it was lake tahoe or something that just can t stand the united states navy won t put up with it the countries in the regions region won t put up with it and and all those countries with very few exceptions were grateful because that america s standing up for them standing up for their resource patrimony that s the future for their kids and their grandkids with the oil and gas and the fisheries the minerals off their shores china shouldn t be allowed to take it just because they re bigger margaret brennan you on ukraine i know you were not at the white house when this july 25th phone call happened that is now at the heart of this impeachment inquiry but you are now part of ukraine policymaking you heard senator graham at the top of the program say the policy is completely incoherent will the u s continue lethal military aid to ukraine until russia backs out of crimea and stops supporting separatists in ukraine o brien well look i think you put your finger on the most important issue and that s lethal military aid i was in ukraine in 2014 i was there to observe the elections in ukraine i was there as part of a bipartisan election observation mission and i had younger ukrainian soldiers and young ukrainians come up to me and say why won t the u s the arsenal of democracy send us lethal aid you re sending us blankets and mre s why won t margaret brennan right o brien president obama send us military aid margaret brennan and president trump changed o brien and there and there margaret brennan policy by doing that o brien there was no military aid going to the ukrainians under the the obama biden administration when president trump got into office he sent military aid so i think what people ought to be focusing on is the president has been helping the the ukrainians defend themselves by sending them lethal military aid to stand up to the russians that s the real story that s been lost in all this margaret brennan but is the is the policy though that that that lethal aid will continue until russia stops backing separatists and trying to annex parts of ukraine o brien well i m not going to get into hypotheticals about what could happen down the road i mean hopefully russia and ukraine can get along and there can be some sort of a peace treaty and and an agreement between them so i m not going to commit the united states to what we re going to do forever but but for right now we re set we re the first administration president trump is the first president to send lethal military aid to ukraine i think that s very important and i think that s something that s been lost in in all the hullabaloo about the about the telephone call and one other thing i d say about this i ve been with president trump in two dozen conversations either in person or on the phone with foreign leaders and if the american people could be on those phone calls they d be extraordinarily proud of the president how he represents america the cordiality that he he has with world leaders but also the tough message that he has to to protect u s interests i mean they d they d be proud of what their president does in those meetings with foreign leaders margaret brennan lieutenant colonel vindman who has testified under oath is serving on the national security council currently will he continue to work for you despite testifying against the president o brien well well look one of the things that i ve talked about is that we re streamlining the national security council it got bloated to like two hundred and thirty six people from up from 100 in the bush administration under president obama we re streamlining the national security council there are people that are detailed from different departments and agencies my understanding is he s is that colonel vindman is is detailed from the department of defense so everyone who s detailed at the nsc people are going to start going back to their own departments and we ll bring in new folks but we re going to get that number down to around 100 people that s what it was under condoleezza rice she came and met with me i met with a number of my successors margaret brennan right o brien we don t need to recreate the department of defense the department of state the department of homeland security over at the white house we ve got great diplomats and soldiers and and folks that can that do that work for us in the departments margaret brennan just to button that up though you re saying colonel lieutenant colonel vindman is scheduled to rotate out you are not suggesting in any way that there will be retaliation against him o brien i i never retaliated against anyone so the the it s margaret brennan but his time is coming to an end o brien there there will be a point for everybody who s detailed there margaret brennan okay o brien that their time that their detail will come to an end they ll go back to their agency and what we want them to do is take the experience and skills they learned at the white house take it back to their departments and agencies and and do an even better job there and and so we re grateful that we can have these detailees come in and they ll come spend the year a year or you know maybe a little bit more at the white house and then they ll go back to their agency and they ll do a better job at their agency margaret brennan all right o brien having been at the white house margaret brennan thank you very much o brien thank you for having me margaret margaret brennan ambassador o brien for
