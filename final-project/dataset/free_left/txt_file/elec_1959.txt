nearly half of black americans are solidly behind one democratic presidential candidate former vice president joe biden according to the most recent washington post ipsos poll and there s significant support 20 percent behind sen bernie sanders i vt among black voters but black lawmakers and some rather high profile ones are making headlines for the diversity of their support raising the question what impact could this have on the black electorate recent news that rep bobby l rush d ill is endorsing former new york mayor mike bloomberg is the latest reminder that members of the congressional black caucus appear more divided in their support for 2020 democratic presidential candidates than during any other primary election in recent history and earlier this month rep anthony g brown d md not only endorsed former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg but would become his campaign s first national co chair other members of the cbc one of the most influential groups in democratic politics have endorsed sen elizabeth warren d mass in addition to biden sanders bloomberg and buttigieg and before suspending their campaigns sen kamala d harris d calif former housing secretary juli n castro and sen cory booker d n j also received endorsements from black lawmakers seeing different black lawmakers back different candidates isn t particularly surprising to rhonda foxx a candidate in north carolina s 6th congressional district who has worked for several black lawmakers are not a monolith she told the fix members are looking at the diversity of the candidates the different perspectives of those candidates and making strategic and diverse decisions based on the growing constituency and seeing black lawmakers come out to support an array of candidates particularly those who don t have much backing among black voters has the potential to encourage black voters arguably the most influential voting bloc on the left to consider candidates they may have previously overlooked foxx said i look at it and say this member supported that candidate and i know this member is firm on this issue so this candidate must be she said it drives me to do my own research the endorsements have been more widely spread in 2020 for a couple of reasons the candidate field originally more than 25 candidates and the cbc now more than 50 members are among the largest in democratic primary history with more candidates and more lawmakers than ever the diversity of political thought appears to be wider which gives representatives more options to get behind during the 2008 democratic primaries the endorsements of black lawmakers were spread out over just four candidates just nine democrats were competing in the primaries at that time and in 2016 cbc endorsements went to just two of the democratic candidates although nine candidates have received current endorsements during the 2020 primary it s worth noting that most endorsements have gone to biden the candidate leading with black voters this should be of little surprise given that many black lawmakers in congress worked with biden when he was vice president to the country s first black president and when biden was a lawmaker himself and many appear to think as most other black voters do that he has the best chance of defeating president trump but despite that the most influential endorsements for candidates might not be those that come from black lawmakers but from black mayors leaders of cities with large black populations said bakari sellers a cnn political analyst and former state legislator who previously interned for a black lawmaker and a black mayor this might suggest that political power and influence in black america could increasingly be shifting from washington to the cities where black voters actually live black mayors are slightly more valuable i think sellers told the fix a lot of the black lawmakers haven t had a race in 10 15 20 years while a lot of the black mayors are on the ground they know the people and they actually have legitimate networks which is why you saw a huge battle for birmingham ala mayor randall woodfin atlanta mayor keisha bottoms charlotte mayor vi lyles little rock mayor frank scot and columbia s c mayor steve benjamin receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy
