 philadelphia within hours virginia webb would stand with the rest of the georgia delegation here at wells fargo center on tuesday and vote for the first woman ever to head a major party s presidential ticket but her thoughts would be with another woman one who had fought to put her here and one who did not live to see it happen my grandmother was a suffragette said webb 59 who evoked that era with a white hillary for america sash across her frilly blue dress she made history 96 years ago marching for a woman s right to vote and now we have the first woman for president or at least the first one who has a strong chance of reaching the oval office milestones of history can look smaller through a windshield than they do through a rear view mirror that is especially true if the road has been long and winding and it is not clear what lies around the next turn because of hillary clinton my daughters and all our sons and daughters now take for granted that a woman can be president of the united states first lady michelle obama had said the night before in her address to the democratic national convention that it no longer seems like such a big deal speaks to the fact that clinton herself was slow to embrace the singular nature of her first white house campaign never before 2008 had a woman won so much as a single state in a major party s presidential primary clinton captures historic nomination but that seemed only an asterisk compared with the prospect of electing an african american as president so she played up her experience and seasoning in a campaign that seemed almost genderless practically right up to the concession speech in which she declared that she and her supporters had put 18 million cracks in that highest hardest glass ceiling in this contest maybe different in 2016 than it was in 2008 she has embraced the nature the historic nature of her candidacy and it is a sign that there has been progress john podesta clinton s campaign chairman said tuesday i think she has reflected upon that he added at a breakfast that was hosted by bloomberg politics she is not asking anybody to vote for her because she is a woman but i think she brings that unique sense of history from spouse to senator the evolution of hillary clinton politician at a time when everything about politics seems brutal and bitter clinton s nomination offers many in her party a chance to remember the sweetness they felt eight years ago at the convention in 2008 it was an extraordinary experience to see an african american man with the name barack obama be nominated i had to pinch myself said estela vazquez 68 a member of the new york delegation and the possibility of electing the first woman president it s extraordinary and lagging behind the rest of the world added vazquez who is from the dominican republic for my granddaughters and when my great granddaughters are born they ll have the ability to aspire to something like that she said in other latin american countries it has been done indeed chile elected michelle bachelet in 2005 since then in a region known for its machismo argentina brazil and costa rica have all had female presidents as well whether and how her gender will be an electoral advantage for clinton remain to be seen her republican opponent donald trump has accused her of playing the woman card and he has said she would be at 5percent in the polls if she had a y chromosome but polling suggests that americans are as the first lady suggested almost blas at a moment they have seen coming for such a long time the latest of those surveys was taken in july by cbs news and the new york times it found 30percent saying the fact clinton is a woman helps her as a candidate 14percent saying it hurts her and 56percent saying it makes no difference last year the washington post and the kaiser family foundation asked in a survey whether women thought electing other women was important to improving all of their lives only 38percent called it a top priority which ranked well below other concerns including increasing access to affordable child care 70percent reducing domestic violence 84percent and improving women s health care 66percent there is also the fact that clinton herself has been part of the nation s consciousness for so long as first lady a senator from new york and secretary of state often stilted as a politician she remains a divisive figure and one whose character most americans say they mistrust only the clintons why bill s speech tonight will be unlike anything we ve ever seen the wounds of the bitter primary season also have not healed retired electrician lahoma buckley 66 and her friend kathy adair 64 a retired retail worker plan to vote for a woman this fall jill stein the green party nominee the michigan women who had supported sen bernie sanders vt attended a bernie or bust rally in a public square here tuesday she s the wrong woman buckley said of clinton i don t like her and i don t like her positions and i think she s corrupt for some the real test of the significance of clinton s nomination is whether it will encourage other women to run and voters to elect them documentary filmmaker alexandra pelosi recalled how her mother nancy pelosi d calif was demonized and caricatured when she became the first female speaker of the house in 2007 it s so much worse for women alexandra pelosi said i was always worried that women who saw what happened to my mother would be discouraged yet she also noted that many young women now throng to her mom to take selfies perhaps no one else in the convention hall had quite the perspective of jerry emmett who at 102 can recall her elation the first time she saw her mother winnie cast a ballot i m crying and i never cry emmett said of clinton she deserves it so much she has been so good and such an example that we can do anything as the momentous day came to a close the first female major party nominee appeared by video on a giant screen in the hall at the end of a slideshow of the 44 men she hopes to succeed as president and to the sound of shattering glass if there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch let me just say i may become the first woman president clinton said but one of you is next joel achenbach scott clement kayla epstein ed o keefe lois romano robert samuels and vanessa
