advertisement supported by the president named moncef slaoui a former pharmaceutical executive to lead a crash development program that if successful would shatter speed records for vaccine development by david e sanger maggie haberman and noah weiland president trump doubled down on friday on his promise to have a coronavirus vaccine available by the end of this year betting that he can rally the pharmaceutical industry and the government to have one available to nearly all americans at a speed never before accomplished he made his pledge after the government s senior medical leadership warned repeatedly this week that there was no assurance a safe vaccine would be available as fast as promised by the president or even for years and the president s credibility on the issue has been clouded by months of overpromising exaggerating and misleading about other elements of his response to the pandemic including the availability of testing and the potential of unproven treatments with the nation emerging from two months of lockdown the economy in near depression level crisis and his re election prospects at stake mr trump cast the rapid development of a vaccine as an important but not essential component of returning to normalcy vaccine or no vaccine we re back and we re starting the process he said during an appearance in the rose garden he introduced a longtime pharmaceutical executive and a four star general to lead a national effort that he compared in size and speed to the manhattan project the race 75 years ago to build the first atomic bomb the new chief of what mr trump calls operation warp speed moncef slaoui a former chairman of vaccines at glaxosmithkline called mr trump s goal very credible even though the fastest a new vaccine has been developed and distributed is four years and most have taken considerably longer dr slaoui now a venture capitalist said that he had recently seen early data from a clinical trial with a coronavirus vaccine and these data made me feel even more confident that we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine enough to inoculate much of the united states by the end of 2020 he did not identify which vaccine he was referring to but until friday when he resigned to take on the new job with the white house dr slaoui served on the board of moderna a biotechnology company that has an experimental coronavirus vaccine that just entered phase 2 of clinical trials to determine if it is effective as the chairman of the moderna board s product development committee dr slaoui might have been privy to the early indications of tests of whether the company s approach appeared promising now that it is being injected into human subjects mr trump said the government was already moving to ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity to produce any vaccine that is developed and to produce the hundreds of millions of glass vials and syringes needed to hold and inject it and he said the government would call on the military s logistics skills to distribute any eventual vaccine as quickly as possible that means they better come up with a good vaccine because we are ready to deliver it he said this will eliminate any unnecessary delay and enable us to begin providing americans with a proven vaccine the day our scientists say we are ready we ve got it mr trump who during the 2016 campaign repeatedly questioned the use of vaccines also seemed to acknowledge for the first time that the antivaccine movement could hamper the effort to fully immunize the united states against the coronavirus we are looking for a full vaccine for everyone that wants to get it he said when pressed on the timing and whether it would be available by january to all americans or only to those judged to need it on an emergency basis not everybody s going to want to get it the president also insisted that even if the united states did not win the race for a vaccine chinese and british entries are also in clinical trials he believed the world would set aside profits and nationalistic instincts to share the most successful approach we have no ego said mr trump who only two months ago tried to persuade a german firm to move its vaccine research to the united states whoever gets it we think it s great and we re going to work with them and they are going to work with us even china would share its findings he said with confidence though if china s vaccine effort advances its phase 2 clinical trials will almost certainly take place inside china similarly the united states would most likely prioritize initial distribution to its own citizens as suggested by mr trump s reference to the military s role president emanuel macron of france said this week that he would call in executives of sanofi a major pharmaceutical firm after its chief executive told bloomberg news that the united states has the right to the largest preorder because it s invested in taking the risk on new vaccines in an interview dr slaoui called having a safe and effective vaccine in widespread distribution within 12 to 18 months of when work started at the beginning of the year to be a very aggressive timeline but said he was undaunted by mr trump s goal i would not have committed unless i thought it was achievable mr slaoui said on thursday adding that he told the president that when they met for the first time a day earlier and mr trump asked if the goal was realistic mr slaoui will serve as the chief adviser on the effort and gen gustave f perna a four star general who is in charge the army mat riel command will be the chief operating officer mr slaoui said he discussed the job with jared kushner the president s son in law and senior adviser who had been searching for a so called czar for therapeutics and vaccine development and dr deborah l birx the white house s coronavirus response coordinator general perna who runs the army s complex supply chain said that he was asked by gen mark a milley the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to help run the manufacturing logistics related to the vaccine development beyond the vaccine itself there are also substantial challenges in ensuring adequate capacity of the supplies needed to distribute and administer it starting with the special glass in which vaccine doses are transported mr slaoui and general perna met for the first time on wednesday and they have been in frequent contact since then the general said in a separate interview they will have offices in the department of health and human services where the secretary alex m azar ii helped develop operation warp speed at the president s request most questions about how the program will work remain unanswered including its cost whether the defense production act will be used to impel companies to produce a vaccine developed by a different firm or whether particular groups may get access to initial doses but public health experts said that the program was perhaps the only way to keep the united states on a brisk timeline in a health crisis as complex as the coronavirus pandemic there may be no other way to do this other than through the government said dr amesh adalja an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the johns hopkins university center for health security vaccine development has been plagued with economic difficulties that have gotten vaccine manufacturers out of the business dr stephen m hahn the commissioner of the food and drug administration said at a senate hearing on tuesday that his agency would evaluate about 10 vaccine candidates in early studies and then select four or five to progress into larger studies in humans dr slaoui said that the goal will be to get three or four vaccines to large late stage trials called phase 3 several experimental vaccines are already being tested in humans including the one being pursued by moderna dr anthony s fauci the government s top epidemiologist told lawmakers on tuesday that his institute the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases was heavily involved in the moderna project scientists hope that several of the vaccines will be successful and for different parts of the population but even if a vaccine candidate shows promise this year producing one for hundreds of millions of people in the united states alone will be daunting if there s only a small amount of vaccine a million or 100 000 doses there will be very difficult decisions about who gets the vaccine first said dan h barouch the director of the center for virology and vaccine research at beth israel deaconess medical center and a professor at harvard medical school who is also working with johnson johnson on its coronavirus vaccine is it high risk people different racial groups different socioeconomic groups those discussions will be difficult the pentagon will be heavily involved in the warp speed effort in the hope that it will facilitate fast distribution of a vaccine if one is deemed successful the department of defense is going to be putting resources that are unheard of in any industry setting in any private company setting behind the process development and manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine dr slaoui said general perna said he had been preparing to retire on july 1 after 37 years of active duty but agreed to be part of the effort and echoed mr trump in describing what he saw as his mission i believe that we re at war with this virus and when you re at war then you have to win he said but dr adalja said that for a vaccine to be ready by january everything would have to go perfect vaccine development doesn t always go as predicted he said there are a lot of hiccups in the production process we re going faster than we ever have with a vaccine but we have to be prepared for things to slow down once we get further along advertisement
