the intercept is a first look media company more than240 000 people worldwide have already died of covid 19 and before the pandemic finishes it could kill hundreds of thousands even millions more but the final toll is destined to be far higher than just those who die of covid 19 experts warn that deaths from secondary impacts poverty hunger diseases and violence exacerbated by the pandemic may dwarf the number of those who die of the novel coronavirus itself a new analysis by researchers from king s college london and australian national university under the aegis of the united nations university world institute for development economics research for example warns that the economic contraction caused by covid 19 could push an additional 500 million people about8 percent of the earth s population into poverty reversing 30 years of economic improvement we were surprised at the sheer scale of the potential poverty tsunami that could follow covid 19 in developing countries said andy sumner one of the study s authors not surprisingly such financial fallout has grim knock on effects i want to stress that we are not only facing a global health pandemic but also a global humanitarian catastrophe warned david beasley the executive director of the united nations world food program millions of civilians living in conflict scarred nations including many women and children face being pushed to the brink of starvation with the specter of famine a very real and dangerous possibility a new study by the wfp found that lockdowns and the economic recession caused by covid 19 may exacerbate an already dire worldwide hunger crisis almost doubling the number of people who could go hungry pushing a total of 265 million people to the brink of starvation by the end of the year meanwhile the world health organizationnotes that a diversion of resources could have especially devastating effects on the fight against malaria under a worst case scenario in which all insecticide treated bed net campaigns are suspended and there is a 75 reduction in access to effective antimalarial medicines fatalities from the mosquito borne illness could reach 769 000 double the number of deaths in 2018 effectively wiping out 20 years of gains in suppressing malaria mortality similarly a new analysis by researchers at imperial college london found that in low and middle income countries disruptions to health services could cause deaths from hiv tuberculosis and malaria to increase by up to 10 20 and 36 percent respectively over five years as covid 19 cases surge worldwide the survival of pregnant women and children is at great risk due to strained healthcare systems and the disruption of life saving health services said dr stefan peterson associate director and global chief of health at the united nations international children s emergency fund in fact researchers at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health warn for example that the impact of the pandemic to newborn child and adolescent health and nutrition services might lead to the deaths of 1 2 million children a 45 percent increase over existing child mortality levels the overall death toll among the young may actually be exponentially higher according to a recent report from the christian aid organization world vision an analysis of 24 countries with existing humanitarian crises from afghanistan to yemen found that as many as 30 million children s lives are at risk from other diseases like diphtheria whooping cough and tetanus if health care systems are swamped by the pandemic and resources are diverted from immunizations we are wrong if we think this is not a children s disease said andrew morley world vision s president and chief executive experience tells us that when epidemics overwhelm health systems the impact on children is deadly among youths girls will suffer most according to a recent analysis by plan international an aid organization that advocates for children s rights and equality for girls since women and girls undertake more than three quarters of unpaid care and in rural communities and low income countries spend up to 14 hours a day on such work girls will likely be at greater risk of infection but this is just one type of collateral damage covid 19 shutdowns will disrupt early learning formal education and livelihoods according to the report measures to curb the disease have worsened existing inequalities forcing girls out of school and placing them at heightened risk of violence in their home unhcr the united nations refugee agency notes that even before the covid 19 pandemic an estimated one in three women had experienced physical or sexual abuse confinement lockdowns and quarantines coupled with deteriorating socioeconomic conditions have now created a perfect storm these factors significantly increase the risks of intimate partner violence with refugees internally displaced and stateless persons among the most vulnerable according to the agency but the shadow pandemic of violence against girls and women extends far beyond refugees and displaced war victims with reports of domestic violence having increased by 30 in france while calls to help lines have jumped 30 in cyprus and 33 in singapore the united nations study forecasts that the greatest economic impact of covid 19 will be in sub saharan africa where cases are rapidly increasing and if projections prove accurate up to half of the new poor will live there the effects will be felt in infant and maternal mortality undernutrition malnourishment and educational achievement among other indicators alexandra lamarche senior advocate for west and central africa at refugees international explained that preventative measures aimed at countering covid 19 were also impediments to humanitarian aid leaving poor people without access to food we re going to see significant impacts on malnutrition rates she told the intercept and we re seeing all sorts of secondary impacts for example there s a polio outbreak in niger because they stopped vaccinating between hunger and disease poverty and violence the follow on effects of covid 19 threaten to be as wide ranging as they are lethal there are just so many different unexpected consequences said lamarche it s extremely disheartening and it s going to be exceptionally dire nick turse nickturse a combination of generic drugs appears to be more effective in fighting the coronavirus than gilead sciences remdesivir alec a koch backed group that drafts
