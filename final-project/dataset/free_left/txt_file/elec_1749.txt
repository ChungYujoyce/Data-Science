enough to earn a mandate for her presidency and a surge of voters to help democrats win congressional races emerging from a nine day absence from the trail mrs clinton seized on the momentum of her performance in the final presidential debate choosing ohio a battleground state where she has struggled the most against donald j trump as her first stop on a four day swing with new polls showing mrs clinton closing in on mr trump in the state her campaign is glimpsing the opportunity for a clean sweep of traditional swing states reminding voters of mr trump s refusal in wednesday s debate to say definitively he would accept the outcome on election day mrs clinton said that as secretary of state she had visited countries whose leaders jailed political opponents and invalidated elections they did not win we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship she said she also portrayed herself as a candidate who could attract independent undecided and even republican voters unhappy with mr trump s campaign i want to say something to people who may be reconsidering their support of my opponent she said i know you still may have questions for me i respect that i want to answer them i want to earn your vote her stop here marked the start of a rare multiday tour of swing states as the clinton campaign revved up its efforts to decisively defeat mr trump on nov 8 including releasing a powerful minute long ad featuring khizr khan the father of a muslim american soldier killed in iraq the ad featuring mr khan who was attacked by mr trump after he spoke at the democratic convention will run in ohio florida pennsylvania and north carolina as well as other crucial states with mrs clinton holding a healthy lead in most national polls democrats have turned their focus to trying to ensure victory by as large a margin as possible deploying michelle obama in arizona and president obama in florida the larger the victory the less mr trump and his supporters can claim foul play mrs clinton s allies said a month ago ohio seemed to be aligning as a trump stronghold as its large bloc of white working class voters responded to mr trump s economic populism and america first message but the state is now back in play with a poll from suffolk university in boston showing a tied race mrs clinton s afternoon rally at a community college in cleveland the heart of democratic strength in ohio was aimed at increasing early voting which began last week how the emergence of a 2005 recording of donald j trump bragging about sexual assault is playing out in the tightest house and senate races while early voting has traditionally been a democratic strength in ohio the data shows potential complications for mrs clinton on this front requests for early ballots are down 22 3 percent in cuyahoga county where cleveland is compared with the same period in 2012 requests are also off 12 7 percent in franklin county which includes columbus the capital according to data compiled by michael mcdonald a university of florida professor who studies voter turnout a decided advantage for mrs clinton here is the strength of democrats grass roots efforts the party has leased 93 offices statewide according to chris wyant the clinton campaign director in ohio mr trump s ohio director cut ties recently with the state s republican chairman matt borges over mr borges s sharply worded public doubts about mr trump they have an internal civil war on the republican side brian fallon mrs clinton s press secretary told reporters here he added that two weeks ago mr trump was slightly ahead in the state but ohio is really a symbol of the progress we ve made in the past two weeks since the first debate he said ohio is not essential to mrs clinton s road to the white house she could lose it and still romp through the electoral college given her dominance in other swing states like virginia pennsylvania and colorado according to polls mr trump spent the day hopscotching to rallies in north carolina and pennsylvania a state where mrs clinton has built a formidable lead while he projected a subdued confidence at a rally in fletcher n c he also seemed to prepare for at least the possibility of an election day loss i don t know what kind of shape i m in but i ll be happy and at least i will have known win lose or draw and i m almost sure if the people come out we re going to win i will be happy with myself he said at his rally in fletcher he offered a slightly more restrained version of his typically freewheeling speech largely hewing to his prepared remarks transcript n a gone were his complaints of a rigged and stolen election they have drawn condemnation by democrats and republicans alike and he did not as he has recently try to counter accusations from the 10 women who have come forward to accuse him of inappropriate sexual advances the trump campaign has said that it plans to increase mr trump s schedule in the final weeks potentially holding as many as six rallies a day mr trump explained that he wanted to have no regrets should he lose i don t want to think back if only i did one more rally i would have won north carolina by 500 votes instead of losing it by 200 votes later again seeming to acknowledge that he might not win the white house he grumbled what a waste of time if we don t pull this off mr trump s team increasingly views north carolina as a state that is critical to a victory in november along with others like florida ohio and pennsylvania mr trump s running mate gov mike pence of indiana visited the same town just last week at a rally later on friday in johnstown pa mr trump took the stage with a renewed vigor i just got caught in the rain he bellowed how does my hair look and he returned to his theme of a rigged system speaking to a crowd in the mill town mr trump cast himself as the champion of pennsylvania s working class the iron and steels forged in your mills formed the backbone of our nation he said promising to bring prosperity back to the region you were the leading steel producer in the united states did you know that in cleveland mrs clinton accused mr trump of buying chinese made steel for his high rise buildings i m going to let donald try to explain himself to the steelworker filing for unemployment she said seemingly energized by the more raucous pennsylvania crowd mr trump ended his rally with a call to victory we will win he said we will shock the world then mr trump who on the eve of a campaign trip to scotland admitted he did not really understand the nuances of the brexit vote ended with an ebullient rallying cry by predicting an upset victory his win in november he said would be brexit plus but a full day of events seemed to drain some of the energy from mr trump whose mood often rises on the strength of his crowds at his final rally of the day in newtown pa the republican nominee began well ahead of schedule spoke for just 30 minutes and wrapped up his speech at 7 31 p m exactly one minute after he was originally slated to take the stage advertisement
