lysol wipes and hand sanitizer he said i can remove every other waiting chair if that amount of traffic comes in he said of social distancing mandates to keep people at least six feet apart that said he doesn t expect crowds or even all of his four employees to return right away i don t think it ll be packed the transition back to normalcy will take a little time it shook people up underwood said of the pandemic underwood disagrees with critics of re opening parts of the state s economy those complaining about reopening small businesses so soon are either still getting paid by their companies or institutions while in the comfort of their own homes or are retired he said i don t think anybody that has gone through what i have gone through in my line of work trying to stay afloat during these pandemic times is complaining we as in small non essential businesses are at the bottom of the totem pole so no one cares he said he is among the many small businesses that applied for but did not receive low interest loan relief from the government underwood paid half the rent on his shop at the start of the month so i m not digging myself too big a hole and then after the shutdown i couldn t pay the second half like many other small businesses underwood has limited options i had a few dollars in reserve that i ve had to use he explained saying he didn t think he could pay the rent and keep a non operating business going for more than a month and a half we need to start making income as soon as possible he said people are willing to take the risk of contracting the coronavirus just to pay the bills those sentiments were echoed by marcia sanders a massage therapist who runs two therapeutic sites as a solo practitioner one in marietta the other in nearby hiram when you have no money coming in re opening is a relief sanders said of kemp s plan still the lost income doesn t sit well with her and sanders believes the process could have been handled differently from the start i just feel like we could have worn masks instead of shutting down said sanders who disinfects her massage tables and face rests between customers so i m hoping i m ok i wear a mask clients wear a mask i have everybody wash their hands it s a chance i take i know people need me like underwood sanders reports hitting a wall in applying for help from the u s small business administration my bank told me they ran out of money said sanders in business 17 years another small business in marietta isn t ready to reopen on friday according to a spokesperson for barbearia
