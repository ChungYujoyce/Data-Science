barack obama s signature as a speaker is his ability to stay on topic while most politicians try to cram everything plus a stash of kittens and a stray puppy to boot into their speeches potus is known for writing speeches that stray little and focus heavily on the thesis at hand last night in his speech supporting hillary clinton was the last big foreseeable speech of his career last night of all nights he should have really brought his mighty oratory skills to bear sadly however his speech was a bit meh not that it was bad mind you obama hit a lot of high points both shading clinton s opponent donald trump and highlighting how progressive and successful the democratic agenda was an especially important topic with all the ill informed bernie sanders dead enders in the audience who were convinced that clinton is basically a republican by most political speech standards obama was a 9 out of 10 but obama is a better speaker than most unlike most politicians he s an actual writer the author of a best selling memoir and he understands certain basics about speechifying most politicians don t keep it short keep it on topic don t be digressive and yet for some reason obama delivered a bill clinton esque performance meandering around his own record taking random digs at donald trump and hitting applause lines yes we can almost at random it was especially confusing in light of his wife s out of the park performance on monday night which stuck to his more classic formula of short well structured speeches that tell coherent stories michelle obama told an easy to remember tale of sacrifice and reward of watching her little girls cash in the hard work by women and people of color to make america truly a land of opportunity it s hard to put a thesis statement into barack obama s speech he roamed around hat tipping black lives matter and clinton s hard work but one never got the sense from him of clinton as a friend michelle obama sold clinton that way portraying her as an older woman she had grown close to and come to admire bill clinton had done it portraying his wife as she frankly as a human deserves to be seen as a kind hearted woman who loves her child and can set human male hearts a flutter but to barack obama the man who sat with her as they watched their hard work result in the death of the man who inflicted 9 11 on us no real warmth was detected it s hard for me to imagine going through that with someone and not feeling bound to them how our president a man who is a genius at making the incomprehensible seem downright folksy failed to convey that is a great mystery that said i don t think obama should pull himself off the trail or feel like a liability to clinton his comments about how they reconciled post primary offer an important example to bernie sanders holdouts who don t understand the basic facts of politics he is also as much as it pains me to say better at delivering sick burns in the direction of donald trump better than any other politician on the planet trump s impotent small fingered response already indicates that but that was a crowd that was fully ready to be united and scream its head off at the chance of electing the first female president and for some reason obama just fell a bit short of the task as he noted in the speech being the leader of the free world is hard work which is why we should want clinton in the job so perhaps he didn t have time to tell a better story still a shame most of us wanted to hear the real story of how these two former foes became friends obama could have told that story in style and made history while he did it his failure to do so is on him but we ll always have his wife michelle 2024 s se puede amanda marcotte is a politics writer for salon who covers american politics feminism and culture her new book troll nation how the right became trump worshipping monsters set on rat f cking liberals america and truth itself is out now she s based out of brooklyn and can be followed on twitter amandamarcotte copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
