 new york donald trump defended his admiration for russian president vladi mir putin at a forum here wednesday focused on national security issues even suggesting that putin is more worthy of his praise than president obama certainly in that system he s been a leader far more than our president has been a leader trump said we have a divided country the republican presidential nominee said that an alliance with russia would help defeat the islamic state and when asked to defend some of putin s aggressions on the world stage he asked do you want me to start naming some of the things obama does at the same time trump also said he appreciated some of the kind words putin has had for him well i think when he calls me brilliant i think i ll take the compliment okay trump and democratic rival hillary clinton made back to back appearances at an event that sounded the starting gun for the final stretch of the presidential race and offered a potential preview of what are expected to be rollicking debates in the weeks to come clinton offered herself as a model of absolute rock steadiness on foreign policy and trump promised to be a disruptive force for improvement saying that under obama even the military s generals have been reduced to rubble trump suggested he could replace some of the military brass clinton appeared guarded even stilted as she navigated tough questions about her use of a private email server as secretary of state and her vote for the iraq war in the senate but trump showed no such restraint with a series of controversial statements he reaffirmed his view that having men and women serve alongside one another is the root of the military s sexual assault problem he said recent intelligence briefings have convinced him that clinton and other obama administration officials did not heed the advice of experts and he praised putin noting among other things the russian president s 82 percent approval rating ahead of wednesday s forum trump delivered a speech in philadelphia in which he called for a robust expansion of u s military capabilities and an end to budget sequestration on defense spending as soon as i take office i will ask congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military it is so depleted we will rebuild our military trump said during the speech at the union league of philadelphia this will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs trump s address represented his most substantive and comprehensive plan on national security to date part of an ongoing effort to assuage doubts that he lacks a sufficient understanding of policy issues to assume the presidency reading from prepared remarks trump spoke about modernizing the military s equipment and increasing the size of the armed forces clinton who has also advocated ending the defense sequester spent the earlier part of her segment of the forum defending herself regarding the email controversy and her handling of classified material which she insisted she did responsibly and she acknowledged that her vote as a senator from new york to authorize the use of military force in iraq was a mistake but clinton said she had learned from the decision and chided trump for saying he had opposed the war from the outset despite statements to the contrary i have taken responsibility for my decision clinton said he refuses to take responsible for his support the forum broadcast by msnbc and nbc stations and hosted by matt lauer of the today show was billed as a discussion of the most important issues facing the nation s next commander in chief clinton and trump appeared separately before a live audience of active duty military personnel and veterans a group that traditionally skews republican at the intrepid sea air space museum in new york the event was hosted by the iraq and afghanistan veterans of america the forum was scheduled ahead of three standard debates between the two major party presidential nominees the first of which is scheduled for sept 26 at hofstra university in hempstead n y clinton and trump were asked early in their segments not to attack each other and both drew admonishments from lauer for ignoring his request clinton for example chided trump for proposing a ban on muslims entering the country saying that is not going to help us succeed in defeating isis and trump accused clinton of having a happy trigger a suggestion that she is too eager to insert the united states into international conflicts the united states s involvement in iraq was a prominent part of both segments clinton argued that the war was one area where she and trump shared positions i think that the decision to go to war in iraq was a mistake and i have said that my voting to give president bush that authority was from my perspective my mistake clinton said there was a mistake my opponent was for the war in iraq he says he wasn t you can go back and look at the record he supported it clinton vowed that if she is elected president we are not putting ground troops into iraq ever again as he has in the past trump insisted that he did not support president bush s invasion in 2003 despite evidence to the contrary the businessman also argued that taking iraq s oil would have prevented the rise of the islamic state terrorist group in the middle east i ve always said shouldn t be there but if we re going to get out take the oil he said if we would have taken the oil you wouldn t have isis because isis formed with the power and the wealth of that oil during his segment trump also defended a twitter message he posted three years ago that stated the estimated number of unreported sexual assaults in the military and then mused what did these geniuses expect when they put men women together well it is it is a correct tweet trump said when asked about the tweet by lauer there are many people that think that that s absolutely correct well well it s happening right and by the way since then it s gotten worse when asked what he had learned from his intelligence briefings since becoming the republican nominee trump said that obama and others have not done what our experts said to do and i was very very surprised he said in almost every instance and i could tell i m pretty good with the body language i could tell they were not happy our leaders did not follow what they were recommending trump said he was not a fan of the russian system of government but predicted continued good relations with putin saying i think i would have a very very good relationship with putin and i think i would have a very very good relationship with russia trump denied that mutual admiration between him and the russian leader would benefit russia in its dealings with the united states it s not going to get him anything trump said i m a negotiator during her segment clinton defended her handling of classified information insisting that she never sent or received any documents on her private email server that were properly marked as classified clinton was pressed with questions on the issue almost as soon as the forum began classified material has a header that says top secret secret confidential clinton said none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header the issue has bedeviled her campaign from the start and one of the questions about it came from a veteran who noted that if he had handled classified information in a way that was not permitted he would have been prosecuted and jailed i communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system clinton said i took it very seriously a poll released wednesday showed trump with a sizable lead among active duty personnel and veterans trump leads clinton by 19 points 55 percent to 36 percent among voters who are serving or have served in the u s military according to the nbc news surveymonkey tracking poll that s a somewhat larger margin that two other recent national polls of military veterans since the democratic convention trump led clinton by 14 points in a fox news poll and 11 points in a mcclatchy marist poll the demographics of military veterans align closely with trump s strongest sources of support more than 9 in 10 are men and about 8 in 10 are white in 2012 among military veterans republican mitt romney bested obama by about 20 points according to exit polls the run up to wednesday s forum featured intense jockeying between clinton and trump over which candidate is better suited to lead the military with each sharply questioning the other s temperament and judgment during a campaign stop tuesday in tampa clinton said trump had no clue about national security issues just minutes before the forum was to begin clinton tweeted donald trump has proven over and over again that he s unfit to be our commander in chief on tuesday trump announced that he has been endorsed by 88 retired senior military officials not to be outdone clinton released a list wednesday showing the support of 95 retired generals and admirals more than any recent
