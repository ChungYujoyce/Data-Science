advertisement supported by by patrick healy and matt flegenheimer hillary clinton s advisers are talking to donald j trump s ghostwriter of the art of the deal seeking insights about mr trump s deepest insecurities as they devise strategies to needle and undermine him in four weeks at the first presidential debate the most anticipated in a generation her team is also getting advice from psychology experts to help create a personality profile of mr trump to gauge how he may respond to attacks and deal with a woman as his sole adversary on the debate stage they are undertaking a forensic style analysis of mr trump s performances in the republican primary debates cataloging strengths and weaknesses as well as trigger points that caused him to lash out in less than presidential ways as mrs clinton pores over this voluminous research with her debate team most recently for several hours on friday and her aides continue searching for someone who can rattle her as a trump stand in during mock debates mr trump is taking the opposite tack though he spent hours with his debate team the last two sundays the sessions were more freewheeling than focused and he can barely conceal his disdain for laborious and theatrical practice sessions i believe you can prep too much for those things mr trump said in an interview last week it can be dangerous you can sound scripted or phony like you re trying to be someone you re not rarely are debate preparations as illuminating about the candidates as a debate itself but mrs clinton s and mr trump s strikingly different approaches to the sept 26 face off are more revealing about their egos and battlefield instincts than most other moments in the campaign mrs clinton a deeply competitive debater wants to crush mr trump on live television but not with an avalanche of policy details she is searching for ways to bait him into making blunders mr trump a supremely confident communicator wants viewers to see him as a truth telling political outsider and trusts that he can box in mrs clinton on her ethics and honesty he has been especially resistant to his advisers suggestions that he take part in mock debates with a clinton stand in at their first session devoted to the debate on aug 21 at mr trump s club in bedminster n j the conservative radio host laura ingraham was on hand to offer counsel and if mr trump was game to play mrs clinton said trump advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the debate preparations were supposed to be kept private he declined instead mr trump asked a battery of questions about debate topics mrs clinton s skills and possible moderators but people close to him said relatively little had been accomplished at that gathering and another in bedminster on sunday without ms ingraham mr trump was joined by roger ailes who was ousted as fox news chairman last month over accusations of sexual harassment mr trump in the interview said he saw little use in standing at lecterns and pretending to debate his opponent i know who i am and it got me here mr trump said boasting of success in his 11 primary debate appearances and in capturing the republican nomination over veteran politicians and polished debaters i don t want to present a false front i mean it s possible we ll do a mock debate but i don t see a real need mr trump s certitude i know how to handle hillary he said reflects his belief that the debates will be won or lost not on policy points and mastery of details which are mrs clinton s strengths but on the authenticity boldness and leadership that the nominees demonstrate onstage mr trump is certain that he holds advantages here saying mrs clinton is likely to come across as a typical politician spouting rehearsed lines for mrs clinton who can appear most at peace with a briefing book in her hand there is no such thing as too much preparation she met on friday with key members of her debate team the longtime democratic operative ron klain the washington lawyer karen dunn and her senior strategist joel benenson and delved into the campaign s extensive data on mr trump and the likely questions and themes at the debate according to two campaign advisers who requested anonymity to reveal internal campaign dynamics in compiling research to help mrs clinton prepare her advisers have cast a wide net they contacted tony schwartz the art of the deal co author to give them advice about mr trump this summer even though mr schwartz s 18 month immersion in mr trump s life and homes ended in the mid 1980s but clinton advisers said mr schwartz and other writers who had observed mr trump up close as well as unnamed psychology experts they had spoken to were critical to understanding how to get under mr trump s skin the upshot s presidential forecast updated daily these clinton advisers agree with mr trump s belief that the debate will not be remembered as pitting a policy expert against a washington outsider instead her campaign is preparing ways for her to unnerve mr trump and provoke him to rant and rave the clinton camp believes that mr trump is most insecure about his intelligence his net worth and his image as a successful businessman and those are the areas they are working with mrs clinton to target mr schwartz in an interview declined to comment about any conversations with the clinton campaign but he said mr trump would be vulnerable if mrs clinton proved to be calm deliberate and relentless in attacking mr trump s character volatility and readiness to be commander in chief trump has severe attention problems and simply cannot take in complex information he will be unable to practice for these debates said mr schwartz who was the subject of a new yorker profile last month that portrayed mr trump as a charlatan trump will bring nothing but his bluster to the debates he ll use sixth grade language he will repeat himself many times he won t complete sentences and he won t say anything of substance even so mr schwartz said clinton has to be careful she could get everything right and still potentially lose the debates if she comes off as too condescending too much of a know it all mrs clinton s advisers plan to have one person prepare extensively to play mr trump in a series of mock face offs in the days before the first debate which will be held at hofstra university on long island mrs clinton s team is also taking a hard look at her vulnerabilities even supporters have often questioned the clarity and wisdom of the campaign s responses to uproars over mrs clinton s private email server and donations to the clinton foundation there is hope that the debate stage will allow her a chance to at last address such questions with more brevity and less equivocation the least comfortable task though will most likely be girding for personal attacks from mr trump who has shown an eagerness to resuscitate clinton scandals real and imagined at virtually every opportunity allies have insisted that mrs clinton will not shy away from preparing for the most painful insults including a possible focus on her husband s infidelities she knows that it s coming said jennifer granholm a former michigan governor and a member of mrs clinton s transition planning team mr trump said in the interview that he would rather not attack mrs clinton on personal grounds including bill clinton s extramarital affairs if she hits me though you have to see what happens mr trump said it was this unpredictability that often made mr trump an elusive target for fellow republicans in the primary debates and some close to mrs clinton expressed concern that any false charges from mr trump could rankle her this is a special challenge for hillary who is deeply rooted in the fact based world said paul begala who helped prepare mr clinton for debates in 1992 and 1996 she is more wonk than pol so she might be especially frustrated by a steady stream of invective conspiracy theories and lies around the clinton campaign the question of whom to cast as mr trump has become something of a running parlor game mrs clinton s allies have floated several options representative joseph crowley of new york who is from queens where mr trump grew up james carville mr clinton s chief strategist in 1992 who has a gift for lacerating banter or mark cuban another billionaire businessman all three are viewed as unafraid to say some humiliating things to mrs clinton s face as mr trump may at least a few old clinton hands have suggested enlisting professional entertainers like jon stewart or alec baldwin mr trump s search so far seems to be less exhaustive he said his daughter ivanka could end up playing mrs clinton wouldn t she be great at that mr trump asked maybe
