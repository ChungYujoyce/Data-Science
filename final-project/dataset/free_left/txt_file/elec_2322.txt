 there will be plenty of time for policy and serious discussion one democratic strategist says this is the entertainment part of the event by darren goode 04 15 2015 05 41 am edt hillary clinton participates in a roundtable discussion tuesday with students and educators at kirkwood community college in monticello iowa hillary clinton s campaign rollout has been slow to fill a large blank space in the center of her quest for the white house what exactly she would do if she wins clinton has sketched out the broad policy strokes declaring in her campaign launch video that she wants to be the champion for everyday americans on issues ranging from health care to climate change she s been largely in lockstep with president barack obama and she used a roundtable discussion tuesday at a community college in iowa to outline four big fights she wants to take on including getting unaccountable money out of the political system using a constitutional amendment if necessary she also backed obama s proposal to offer students two free years of community college advertisement clinton promised tuesday that she will have more to come i will be rolling out very specific policies over the weeks and months ahead that i think are going to be at the core of not only a successful campaign but much more importantly getting our government to work again she told reporters but mainly clinton hasn t offered many clues about how her presidency would do more than serve as essentially obama s third term how would she try to fix flaws in obama s signature health care law would she crack down on wall street or the national security agency would she break with obama in pushing for fast track trade deals also on politico david nather answers to those and other questions can probably wait some in both parties say there will be plenty of time for policy and serious discussion veteran new york based democratic strategist hank sheinkopf said this is the entertainment part of the event it s a long time between now and november 2016 sen john mccain r ariz a former presidential nominee himself said clinton s take it slow approach is smart if she can get away it but sooner or later people are going to want answers for the democratic party s liberal elizabeth warren wing a major question for clinton will be how zealously her administration would police wall street whether banks remain too big to fail and whether the lack of prosecutions following the 2008 financial collapse is a black mark on obama s justice department greens are also pushing clinton to take a stand on the biggest environmental policy cliffhanger of obama s presidency whether to allow construction of the keystone xl oil pipeline from canada a project that five years ago she said her state department was inclined to support she s been more outspoken in defending the dodd frank financial regulation law which obama signed and in backing the president s net neutrality efforts but her campaign website still had no policy section as of late tuesday the spaces can t stay blank forever even her supporters acknowledge every presidential campaign by definition is about the future said veteran democratic strategist chris lehane a top political adviser to liberal billionaire activist tom steyer a central figure for liberal donors seeking to make climate change a premier campaign issue in 2016 assuming the republicans nominate someone who is credible neither of the candidates is going to be able to run a status quo type of a campaign also on politico andrew restuccia but on the opening day of her campaign her most prominent policy statement was a tweet from her campaign chairman former obama white house adviser john podesta who wrote that the top of the agenda would be helping working families succeed building small businesses tackling climate change clean energy those mesh with the themes of economic populism and helping the middle class that clinton has made clear would be at the heart of her campaign but they re not the main issues that have been crucial to her public image during her decades of political life which have encompassed education reform in arkansas her attempt at a national health care overhaul in the early 1990s her foreign policy focus as secretary of state her several books and her longtime role as a champion of women s rights then again clinton may not feel much pressure to fill in her platform quickly not only does she have an extensive track record and tremendous name recognition but she s standing alone in the democratic field at least until someone like former maryland gov martin o malley or former virginia sen jim webb jumps in in contrast the dozens of potential and declared republican contenders need to fight from day one to stand out from their rivals with segments of their party tad devine a longtime consultant to democratic presidential candidates agreed i don t think there s any need for her to lay out an entire platform for the future of government in the first 48 hours said devine who had just spent the weekend in vermont with another potential white house contender independent sen bernie sanders he added i don t think she s a blank slate like a lot of these guys are on the republican side also on politico jonathan topaz and ben schreckinger besides sheinkopf said exposing her positions now gives republicans fodder the more confusion republicans have the better it is for her the longer the confusion lasts the better for her in the meantime the gop is all too happy just to tar clinton with obama s policies at the end of the day hillary clinton can t say she s for middle class americans and the working poor when she s 100 percent behind the obama regulatory regime that s making it more expensive for them to keep the lights on keep their jobs and put food on the table republican national committee spokesman michael short said by email it becomes very easy to take the worst part of her predecessor s presidency and record and ascribe that to her platform said lanhee chen a top policy adviser to mitt romney s 2012 presidential campaign and whether that s fair or not that s perfectly reasonable in a political context unless she says what she s for for now chen said clinton s campaign is offering voters kind of an empty vessel and he suggested that one reason is that she doesn t know what she would do pointing to her failed health care efforts from two decades ago and the controversies over her handling of foreign policy he asked what exactly is it in her track record we are to look at as yes this is something that hillary clinton would do in 2016 also on politico adam b lerner one potential vulnerability for clinton is a policy area where she has some her deepest roots health care the subject of her ambitious attempt to get an overhaul enacted during the first term of her husband bill clinton like obamacare that plan aimed for universal coverage and would have included an employer mandate minimum benefit requirements and limits on out of pocket spending clinton has been a vocal champion of obama s version but she s also taken a mend it don t end it approach in recent weeks to pieces of the law they include obamacare s employer mandate which was delayed twice in implementation and the costs incurred by small business owners doug palmer rachana pradhan maggie severns zachary warmbrodt brian mahoney eric engleman and jason huffman contributed to this report during a speech last year clinton highlighted the problem of workers being shifted from full to part time hours by employers trying to avoid the coverage requirement that s helped feed gop accusations that the health care law is hurting workers part of the challenge is to clear away all the smoke and try to figure out what is working and what isn t clinton said according to a cnn report at the time what do we need to do to try to fix this because it would be a great tragedy in my opinion to take away what has now been provided on the economy clinton has been working hard to persuade the democratic left which wields more party influence than it did eight years ago that she cares about stagnating wages and the shrinking middle class but supporters and critics of the financial industry also want to see who comes aboard clinton s campaign to advise her on economic and regulatory issues that includes whether she pulls more people from her husband s administration which irritated liberals by supporting deregulation of wall street larry summers a key member of clinton s brain trust who has faced accusations of being too solicitous of wall street argued for a variety of surprisingly left leaning economic policies in a january report prepared for the liberal center for american progress which podesta founded the center is run by close clinton friend neera tanden the new york times reported in february that clinton s campaign had met with 200 policy experts to hone her position on inequality earlier this month clinton attended a meeting of union leaders and other progressives at the liberal roosevelt institute also on politico annie karni on tuesday her campaign announced the appointment of three senior policy advisers who will lead the development of her agenda they include a former senior fellow at cap who has a background in human rights and a former clinton senate aide who headed the children and families program at steyer s advocacy group clinton has also given brief nods lately to defenders of dodd frank in january clinton said on twitter that attacking financial reform is risky and wrong after the republican led house with support from 29 democrats passed a bill that would have delayed parts of the law better for congress to focus on jobs and wages for middle class families she wrote at the time but to the consternation of many democrats and labor activists clinton remains a big question mark on trade especially on obama s push for fast track authority to negotiate major trade deals with limited involvement by congress also on politico annie karni as a senator she voted in 2002 against giving fast track power to president george w bush even though bill clinton had repeatedly pushed for the same authority and had used it to secure the north american free trade agreement in 2007 while running for president hillary clinton promised union activists a timeout from new trade agreements but while serving as obama s secretary of state clinton argued multiple times in favor of the trans pacific partnership a 12 country deal that would become the largest free trade pact in u s history opponents have described it as nafta on steroids warning it could weaken labor and environmental standards there is no doubt that the trans pacific partnership and the fight over fast track is going to be part of the presidential election said neil sroka a spokesman for democracy for america the liberal group founded by former vermont gov howard dean similarly clinton will have to decide the extent to which she wants to align with teachers unions that can offer financial backing and support on the campaign trail american federation of teachers president randi weingarten is a longtime clinton acquaintance and supporter and the aft endorsed clinton early on the last time she ran for president the country s largest teachers union the national education association held off on its endorsement until after the primaries in 2008 but clinton has at times run afoul of union priorities including pushing for changes to the teaching profession in arkansas and later as a senator advocating federal funding for teach for america a nonprofit group whose work in low income communities had led to labor activists accusations that it s undermining experienced teachers also on politico josh gerstein still education is a policy area where clinton s record and the depth of her involvement could help her stand out dating back to her time working as a staff attorney for the children s defense fund in the 1970s she has spoken frequently on the topic in recent years both on the paid speaking circuit and while working on the clinton foundation s early childhood initiative too small to fail like many other lawmakers she voted for bush s no child left behind initiative in 2001 but she has since criticized the law and said it is underfunded on technology issues clinton backed the obama supported federal communications commission net neutrality rules at a silicon valley women s conference in february supporting the agency s decision to regulate broadband service like a utility so that companies like verizon and comcast can t pick and choose which internet services to speed up or slow down progressives champion the proposal one of the obama administration s biggest technology policy accomplishments of the past few years she s been far less specific on reining in the nsa s snooping on email and phone traffic podesta led the obama administration s 2014 review of big data the increasingly vast quantities of personal information that companies collect on americans and its privacy implications the review concluded among other things that congress should require law enforcement to get a warrant whenever it wants access to people s digital communications also on politico kendall breitman undoubtedly clinton would protect key areas of obama s environmental legacy including his proposed greenhouse gas restrictions for power plants and his efforts to forge an international climate deal late this year in paris but the next president will also have to make big decisions that could take energy policy beyond the obama mold among them should the u s lift the 40 year old ban on exporting crude oil should it expand federal regulations on fracking and widen offshore drilling along the east coast and in the arctic if you think it s important to reduce carbon pollution she has certainly demonstrated a commitment to that said carol browner who was obama s first white house climate adviser and led the environmental protection agency under president clinton the question is what s the next step doug palmer rachana
