2019 02 52bst donald trump has said he would be open to accepting damaging information on a 2020 election opponent from another country and would feel no obligation to inform the fbi later attempting to justify his stance with a tweet about overseas dignitaries that referred to the heir to the british throne as the prince of whales trump told abc news on wednesday i think you might want to listen there isn t anything wrong with listening f somebody called from a country norway and said we have information on your opponent oh i think i d want to hear it the news prompted 2020 democratic candidate elizabeth warren to repeat calls for trump s impeachment russia meddled in the 2016 us presidential election with the aim of helping elect trump according to an investigation by special counsel robert mueller in june 2016 donald trump jr trump s eldest son met a russian lawyer who offered dirt on hillary clinton mueller s report did not conclude there was a criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and the russians although there were contacts and trump did publicly call for russia to hack into information that would compromise clinton asked if he would accept information from a country such as russia or china or instead call in the fbi trump said i think maybe you do both he went on it s not an interference they have information i think i d take it if i thought there was something wrong i d go maybe to the fbi but when somebody comes up with oppo research right they come up with oppo research oh let s call the fbi the fbi doesn t have enough agents to take care of it when you go and talk honestly to congressman they all do it they always have and that s the way it is it s called oppo research with a crucial mis spelling trump on thursday morning then posted a pair of tweets the first saying i meet and talk to foreign governments every day i just met with the queen of england u k the prince of whales the p m of the united kingdom the p m of ireland the president of france and the president of poland we talked about everything should i immediately moments later the tweet was taken down and replaced with one with the correct spelling of prince charles s title but his message continued with a tweet saying call the fbi about these calls and meetings how ridiculous i would never be trusted again with that being said my full answer is rarely played by the fake news media they purposely leave out the part that matters meanwhile christopher wray the director of the fbi told congress last month that the agency would want to know about any election meddling by a foreign power but these comments were dismissed by trump when put to him by his interviewer abc anchor george stephanopoulos exclusive pres trump tells gstephanopoulos he wouldn t necessarily alert the fbi if approached by foreign figures with information on his 2020 opponent it s not an interference they have information i think i d take it https t co drwpfwsie7 pic twitter com 9o8xkt47ag the fbi director is wrong because frankly it doesn t happen like that in life trump said of wray whom he nominated to head the fbi in 2017 trump s comments immediately prompted renewed calls for his impeachment from some democrats elizabeth warren who is running for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination tweeted that the mueller report found a foreign government attacked our 2016 elections to support trump trump welcomed that help and trump obstructed the investigation now he said he d do it all over again it s time to impeach donald trump trump s comments came just a month after he pledged not to use information stolen by foreign adversaries in his 2020 re election campaign even as he wrongly insisted he had not used such information to his benefit in 2016 during a question and answer session with reporters in the oval office in may trump said he would certainly agree to that commitment i don t need it he said as he met the hungarian prime minister viktor orb n all i need is the opponents that i m looking at a small number of republicans such as congressman justin amash have also called for trump s impeachment trump has repeatedly claimed the mueller report cleared him of wrongdoing while criticizing its detailing of his attempts to obstruct any investigation of russia s election activity one of several trump advisors to be charged in relation to the investigation was michael flynn the president s former national security adviser who was convicted of lying to the fbi over his contacts with the russian ambassador to the us on thursday trump tweeted about flynn who is awaiting sentencing for lying to federal investigators about conversations he had with the russian ambassador during the presidential transition in 2016 trump wrote that flynn is a 33 year war hero who has served with distinction has not retained a good lawyer he has retained a great lawyer sidney powell best wishes and good luck to them both last year the new york times reported that trump s lawyer had raised the idea of the president pardoning flynn and paul manafort the former trump campaign manager also convicted in matters related to the investigation and his foreign business dealings for their crimes
