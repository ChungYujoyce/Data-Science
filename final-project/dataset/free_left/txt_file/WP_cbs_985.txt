watch cbsn live by kate gibson updated on october 29 2019 10 46 am moneywatch the tens of thousands of california residents harmed by last year s devastating wildfires are getting more time to file forcompensation from the utility companyblamed for the blazes after drawing criticism for the many fire victims who had not filed claims by last week s deadline pacific gas and electric pg e has agreed to a two month extension lawyers for the utility on monday said pg e had received approximately 70 000 claims and processed 45 000 with another 20 000 to 25 000 claims waiting to be processed i think we ought to be able to do 90 or more u s district judge james donato said in a court hearing on monday i think that should be realistic in a case like this at a hearing last week lawyers for victims said that less than half of those eligible had filed claims prompting criticism that pg e has done too little to reach out to victims left without a place to live one of those victims 22 year old jessie messenger moved to oregon to live with her then boyfriend and his relatives putting her out of reach of the mass mailings and tv and radio ads by pg e to publicize the compensation program i was mostly in oregon and i didn t care to really think about it said messenger who returned to northern california earlier this year the sentiment is shared by others trying to move on from a devastating event i ve talked to a handful who said they weren t going to file a claim that they just wanted to move on said julie lucito an insurance broker agent who lost her residence in paradise california and an investment home nearby along with most of her business i ve been working for free for pretty much of a year said lucito who has devoted herself to helping homeowners affected by wildfires with insurance issues such as maintaining liability coverage on their land in messenger s case it was only because her ex s grandparents reached out to her that she learned that she could file a claim with pg e for compensation from the november 2018 blaze that destroyed all her possessions including china and jewelry left by her mother who had died of breast cancer two years earlier while messenger has now filed a claim she has yet to receive any money whatever i get will be more than i have she told cbs moneywatch losing my mom at 19 was what i thought was going to be the extent of what would happen to me she added in relaying the deep emotional scar left by the experience of fleeing the flames with only a handful of clothes the fires that have started have caused a lot of anxiety said messenger of wildfires currently burning in northern california that have destroyed or damaged more than 100 structures pg e last thursday imposedelectrical blackouts after wind gustsfanned a wildfire in northern california prompting evacuations in a region north of san francisco lucito echoed the sentiment describing how seeing a field burning will get her heart racing and conjure up reminders of baby photos and other irreplaceable items lost there s good days and bad days she said some said they thought they couldn t pursue a claim due to pg e s bankruptcy or that they were not eligible as they already received money from their insurance company others thought they needed a lawyer i thought i wasn t a victim because i got out alive said elizabeth davis 91 who lost her mobile home in a wildfire that essentially wiped out the town of paradise nearly a year ago i never received any information that pg e has billions of dollars available i thought i was not qualified to make a claim she told the associated press pg edeclared bankruptcy in january saying it faced as much as 30 billion in liabilities for several massive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 linked to its equipment the fires killed 130 people and destroyed thousands of homes but the effort to compensate victims fell short it s not that people didn t have time but that people don t have the information and haven t been reached said mike danko an attorney who represents 6 000 victims of wildfires i have a few clients in fema camps and i don t want to say it but it s almost like zombies where they are walled off from the whole process and disoriented because they ve lost their homes and possessions and don t have the community in which they were living pg e the largest utility in the state said it mailed claim forms to 6 2 million potential victims and publicized the process online and in radio and television ads pg e strived to ensure that people had the necessary information to file claims on time a company spokesperson told cbs moneywatch in an email yet that didn t allay concerns by donato the federal judge charged with determining how much pg e sets aside to cover property and other losses in an earlier hearing last week donato expressed displeasure when told that no one had gone door to door at three fema trailer parks in northern california to make sure those eligible to seek payment had filed a claim pg e should have gone to each of those trailers and helped them fill out the forms donato said accordingto the website law360 u s bankruptcy judge dennis montali also chimed in calling the situation unacceptable and heartbreaking according to the industry publication and an attorney who attended monday s hearing montal will rule in early november whether to extend the deadline judge montali has said victims are the most important voice in the room i think he s likely to extend that deadline said sarah foss a legal analyst at debtwire regardless of what the court decides those harmed by the wildfires should still fill out a piece of paper stating so she added if you believe you are owed any money at all from a house car emotional distress or you had to move you should file a claim it s not necessary to write out a legal pleading donato in february is expected to rule on how much the utility needs to set aside for a trust fund to compensate victims pg e has earmarked 8 4 billion to compensate victims of the fire another 11 billion to insurers and 1 billion to public agencies separately the administrator of pg e s 105 million wildfire relief fund on monday reported receiving 13 572 claims 6 742 of them approved and 21 5 million paid to fire victims as of oct 25 the fund was established to provide immediate relief to victims amid the bankruptcy process regardless of what the utility ultimately pays out recovering from the wildfires is a long haul even for those who had insurance and some money in the bank we had 11 years left on our mortgage and now we have another 30 said lucito who has since purchased a new home with her husband whom she married not long after losing all her property it does t matter what happens as far as the settlement it effects us the rest of our lives said her husband stephen estes 64 who is postponing the retirement he d planned in two years at my age i don t have time to rebuild but estes is able to find a silver lining saying losing all their collective possessions helped the couple start out in an even more unified fashion before the fire it was hers mine and what we accumulated was ours now it s all ours he said the associated press contributed to this report first published on october 28 2019 2 58 pm 2019 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the know
