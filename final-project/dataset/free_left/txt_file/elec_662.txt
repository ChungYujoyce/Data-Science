g stavridis a retired four star navy admiral who served as the supreme allied commander at nato but had never held elected office ultimately mrs clinton who told pbs that she was afflicted with the responsibility gene avoided taking a chance with a less experienced vice presidential candidate and declined to push the historic nature of her candidacy by adding another woman or a minority to the ticket instead the campaign which had become concerned about its deficit with white men focused on mr kaine and agriculture secretary tom vilsack and looked more closely at gov john hickenlooper of

gifts he had received during his years as governor and lieutenant governor of virginia it s only fitting that hillary clinton would select an ethically challenged insider like tim kaine who s personally benefited from the rigged system said jason miller a spokesman for mr trump while many democrats swiftly praised the move some in the party s liberal wing expressed dismay claiming that mr kaine was out of step with it on some of its core issues like trade as we saw in donald trump s speech last night republicans will run hard against democrats on trade this year said stephanie taylor a
