they ve called each other names they ve mocked belittled skewered and slimed and now that oddest of couples donald trump and fox news is engaged in a tit for tat feud like none seen in the annals of modern american politics the greatest show on earth or at least in iowa if things go as promised trump won t be there thursday when fox hosts the final republican debate before monday s iowa presidential caucuses he says he s backing out because of a taunting statement from fox though his detractors accuse him of dodging a last showdown with his chief rival sen ted cruz tex instead trump has made plans to materialize elsewhere in iowa hosting a benefit for wounded veterans counterprogramming on a trumpian scale of swagger his threatened absence from the debate stage is a demonstration of trump s perception of his own self worth his verifiable status as a ratings generating gargantuan whose screen persona can translate into millions of advertising dollars in a sense it s an act of subversion by a candidate who has broken all the normal rules of modern campaigns but it s also a manifestation of trump s philosophy about getting what he wants when he wants it the best thing you can do is deal from strength and leverage is the biggest strength you can have trump wrote in his career defining and profile elevating 1987 bestseller trump the art of the deal leverage is having something the other guy wants fox a network that has reigned as a kingmaker in republican politics now seems faced with an adversary who is acting as if he s already the king and doesn t need it the sniping peaked this week when the billionaire developer appeared to taunt fox by polling his social media followers on whether he should appear at the debate he also stepped up his attacks on fox anchor megyn kelly whom he wanted to have removed as debate moderator the poll and the kelly criticism irked fox news chairman and chief executive roger ailes according to an executive at fox and the network chief personally crafted a statement in response we learned from a secret back channel that the ayatollah and putin both intend to treat donald trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president a nefarious source tells us that trump has his own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings according to the fox executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations ailes put together a tongue in cheek statement to take the heat off megyn on wednesday trump via twitter naturally said fox went too far it was the childishly written taunting pr statement by fox that made me not do the debate more so than lightweight reporter megynkelly while publicly feuding with trump the cable news behemoth also seemed to be at cross purposes with itself toggling between the competing goals of taking a hard line with the recalcitrant candidate and wooing him fox executives did not respond to multiple interview requests trump and fox have been poking at each other for months their needling and gnashing began face to face at the first republican presidential debate in august when kelly pressed trump about calling women fat pigs and other derogatory names trump parried back the next morning by huffing that kelly had blood coming out of her wherever critics said that was a reference to the anchor s menstrual cycle but the candidate said it was merely a reference to her demeanor the tangle soon devolved into long distance warfare a series of snippy news conferences and social media taunts periodically interrupted by detentes even as trump has pounded away at kelly retweeting claims that she is a bimbo and calling her average in everyway he has frequently appeared on fox news programs a defiant trump appeared on fox host bill o reilly s show wednesday night his 133rd appearance on the network since announcing his presidential run according to a fox tally when o reilly suggested that trump was making a mistake by skipping the debate the gop front runner said i think you re wrong trump s camp denied that the candidate was afraid to debate he loves debating he has participated in six debates said trump spokesman corey lewandowski he welcomes the opportunity to debate fox has claimed that the trump spokesman leveled a threat against kelly on saturday in a conversation with one of the network s executives lewandowski stated that megyn had a rough couple of days after that last debate and he would hate to have her go through that again a fox spokeswoman said in a statement we can t give in to terrorizations toward any of our employees when asked about the fox claim lewandowski said i didn t do anything of the sort i did not threaten anyone jill olmsted a journalism professor and media critic at american university said the cable channel s unnecessarily snarky comments mean that trump has won this round with fox big time they took the low road and made mr trump look like he is being targeted by fox she said i am quite surprised that grown up media spokespersons for a major media outlet didn t know better or at least weren t more practiced in holding their tempers when giving public comment but john carroll a communications professor at boston university said this may be a situation where donald trump was too clever by half it may have been a gambit to get concessions but when fox rightly told him to take a hike he was boxed in to save face he had almost no choice rush limbaugh the influential nationally syndicated radio host concluded that fox is underestimating trump i heard people on fox last night talking about this who does he think he is he can t control the media limbaugh said on his program wednesday i got news for you he is controlling the media and it s his objective he controls the media when he s not on it he controls the media when he is on it he controls the media when he s asleep nobody else has been able to do anything like this short of the kennedys and they re pikers compared to the way trump is doing this for the umpteenth time in this strange republican primary season trump has made the race all about one thing trump
