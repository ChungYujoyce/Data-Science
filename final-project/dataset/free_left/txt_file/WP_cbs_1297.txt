ted bundy targeted florida college students in one of his final attacks three of the women survived and share their terrifying ordeal and long road to recovery produced by lauren clark in the early morning hours of jan 15 1978 an assailant broke into the chi omega sorority house at florida state university and sexually assaulted and murdered two women he then made his way down the hall and attacked kathy kleiner and her roommate karen chandler in their room and later went a few blocks down and similarly bludgeoned dance student cheryl thomas although they were left gravely injured kathy karen and cheryl miraculously survived a month after the attacks ted bundy was arrested in the 1970s bundy is believed to have killed dozens of women across the western united states notorious serial killer ted bundy s murder spree ended when he was caught shortly after attacking several women at florida state university in ta the media was fascinated by the then suspected serial killer and bundy remains a fascination more than 30 years after he was executed but as the fsu survivors prove bundy is not the only interesting part of this story kathy kleiner in january of 1978 i was 20 years old i lived in the chi omega sorority house on the fsu campus in tallahassee kathy kleiner i was happy i was with my other friends and florida state was just a safe place to be when i moved into the sorority house my roommate was karen chandler karen chandler when i was at fsu it was very laid back it was just a great time karen chandler classes had been going on for about a week and everyone was moved into the house kathy kleiner saturday january 14th i walked home and i got in the sorority and there were kids talking about you know where they re going tonight what are they doing who they re dating what party and then i saw my books sitting on the trunk and i said you know i have a test on monday i m going to go ahead and stay home and study tonight my roommate karen came in at the same time and she had a sewing project she had to do so she sat in her bed next to mine karen chandler and we talked for a little while and then kathy was tired so i just went ahead and decided to go to bed it was maybe around midnight maybe a little bit before midnight kathy kleiner that night i heard our bedroom door slam open i was opening my eyes a little bit because it kind of brought me into consciousness and i m awake enough to know someone s there as i m opening my eyes more and focusing he raised his arm and he had something in his hand and i thought it was a pipe or a stick i didn t know what it was kathy kleiner he came down and hit me in the face it just felt like pins and needles and knives in my face kathy kleiner my roommate karen was now stirring and he went over and hit her i m still awake and i m moving so he came back to my side of the bed and as i see him raise his arm up this bright light shone into our room kathy kleiner and this light was a car from one of the sorority sisters coming home from a late date he got spooked and he left the room karen chandler the next thing i remember is feeling like i was being lifted downstairs and i remember asking if kathy was ok and them saying she s going to be ok you need to worry about yourself news reports while detectives tried to track a man who slipped into a sorority house have left most coeds here terrified kathy kleiner they put me on the stretcher and there was all this noise there were the lights from the police cars and the ambulance people talking and the radios squawking and i thought i was at a carnival because my mind went to somewhere i could understand news reports police say he simply walked in through an unlocked door they say he was armed with a heavy oak log kathy kleiner my name is kathy kleiner and i was attacked by ted bundy sheriff ken katsaris former leon county sheriff the early morning hours of january the 15th 1978 i got a call and the call basically said sheriff there s multiple murders and assaults on girls they told me it was at the chi omega house i was stunned sheriff ken katsaris before i could get myself settled into criminal investigator ken katsaris as my role as sheriff i had to get over my personal thoughts about these could be my own daughters sheriff ken katsaris i was there before kathy kleiner and karen chandler were brought out on gurneys i i said prayers for both of them as they passed me i didn t know if they were alive or deceased at the time they told me two were definitely deceased inside karen chandler i knew i woke up in intensive care i didn t have any idea for sure why i was there but i knew something bad had happened i had at least one skull fracture i think every bone in my face was broken and my jaw was broken i had a broken arm and i had a couple fingers on my hand that were crushed karen chandler maybe i had been in my room for a day or two and my parents were afraid of what was going to be on the tv so my dad said before we turn the tv i need to tell you something chokes up and he told me about lisa and margaret margaret bowman 21 and lisa levy 20 had been killed just down the hall from karen and kathy s room in the sorority house they had both been strangled beaten and sexually assaulted karen chandler crying i can t imagine how horrible that was for their parents and it was very hard because i really couldn t express my grief and my sorrow to their families kathy kleiner my jaw was broken in three places here here and here points to her jaw it was hanging on this joint the jaw what they did was put my jaw back together and wire it shut in the hospital kathy could remember nothing about the attack she says those memories have slowly come back to her over the years kathy kleiner i remember the detectives were in my room first off before my family even showed up asking me questions but i was not able at all to help the detectives it was just a big blur a big blur to me but it turned out the chi omega house had not been the only crime scene that night sheriff ken katsaris we were outside that evening when all of a sudden i get a radio communication from the sheriff s office that there is something going on at a duplex a young lady who lived there alone and the next door neighbor hearing some beating some sounds this is going on less than six blocks away i sent an investigator there and found cheryl thomas on the floor in blood and had been beaten badly cheryl thomas was a dance major at fsu like the chi omega victims she suffered severe head injuries and was taken to the hospital in a coma sheriff ken katsaris i thought could this be the same individual and i said how we ve got such a police presence how could that person go just a few blocks and strike again it was inconceivable sheriff ken katsaris i got a call from colorado about an escaped criminal named ted bundy i was familiar with the name they said do you know ted bundy i said i ve heard of him sheriff ken katsaris they said we don t know where he is and i wrote his name down on a legal pad in my car ted bundy it was the first name associated with the murders in tallahassee ted bundy was known to lure women away with his charm and then abduct them or pick them up at a bus stop and say can i give you a ride but i did not think that the method of operation of this case was anything near similar except for an attack on girls so i did not take that at that time as serious news reports theodore bundy the suspect in the rape murder cases of at least 36 young women in california bundy was on the fbi s 10 most wanted list nine weeks after the attack cheryl thomas when i woke up in the tallahassee hospital i couldn t really tell you who i was or where i was cheryl thomas i know i had head pain and my face was very swollen my mom and dad had to tell me what had happened because i really did not know i couldn t remember what happened and they had to slowly break the news to me cheryl you were attacked cheryl s jaw was broken in two places her shoulder dislocated and she had five skull fractures leaving her permanently deaf in her left ear cheryl thomas i felt very grateful because obviously if i had not had two neighbors next door to call that night when they heard me crying and a beating kind of sound i know i wouldn t i would not have survived as the news sunk in across the fsu community cheryl remained in the hospital karen recovered at her parents home nearby and kathy went home to south florida kathy kleiner i was flown down to miami with my family my parents took me to an oral surgeon and had to re break my jaw because it was not going to be lined up correctly so now i had to be wired shut for additional nine weeks it was so depressing when you have your mouth wired shut you have to always wear nail clippers on a necklace around your neck because if you ever start choking or anything you have to be able to cut the wires and be able to breathe as kathy and her fellow survivors healed sheriff katsaris looked for ways to put the person who did this to them away searching for clues in untraditional places sheriff ken katsaris i did a personal examination of margaret bowman and lisa levy when i examined both of the bodies i found what i think was the most significant piece of evidence and that was a bite mark and that bite would potentially be able to be compared to whoever we found to me it was almost like he was leaving whoever it was a signature karen chandler i think before tallahassee and fsu was a cocoon but that was sort of the shutting of a door in a way that was the end of we are safe kathy kleiner that type of evil that encompassed me that night i couldn t wrap my head around it tony cimino kathy kleiner s friend it just seemed surreal it didn t seem like it was possible the innocence at florida state was gone the university had asked the fraternities for volunteers and if a lady needed to go to the library or to campus or anywhere one of us would go and escort her to wherever she was going men started sleeping in the lobbies of the dormitories tony cimino there were police patrolling all the time for that month no one knew if they were sitting next to the person that committed the crime i mean if they couldn t tell you who did it how could they tell you who didn t do it as january 1978 stretched on police were stumped although they had the bitemark evidence they had no one to match it to sheriff ken katsaris within a few weeks after the sorority sisters were murdered we had information that a 12 year old kimberly leach disappeared from her school so we thought could it be possible but this was a 12 year old girl we re dealing with college students in a sorority kimberly leach disappeared from lake city over an hour away her body later found by a nearby park fear of the unknown attacker pervaded the area until news broke of an arrest in pensacola february 15 1978 one month after the fsu attacks kathy kleiner there was something on tv when the news came on news report police arrested this 31 year old man after a high speed chase wednesday morning in pensacola florida he claimed to be a florida state university law student pensacola police had pulled over a volkswagen beetle that was driving slowly the mysterious driver refused to give his name sheriff ken katsaris came to find out of course that the vehicle was stolen from a location nearby to the sorority house in that volkswagen they found dozens of ids and credit cards that had been stolen from around tallahassee in the weeks before sheriff ken katsaris then the identification came back it was ted bundy sheriff ken katsaris the moment i heard ted bundy i had the flashbacks of course of the phone call and that s exactly what we had we had ted bundy who came to our town news report if those who link him with dozens of sex slayings are right theodore robert bundy is one of the most savaged killers in history larry simpson retired assistant state attorney leon county mr bundy had been a very prolific serial killer for many many years larry simpson it is very unusual for mr bundy to leave a survivor ted bundy s murder spree out west ended when he went to prison in 1976 but at the end of 1977 he had escaped and made his way to florida immediately after his arrest he became a suspect in both the fsu and kimberly leach attacks larry simpson we know that he got here somewhere in the vicinity of january the 8th he rented a boarding room in a boarding house adjacent to the florida state university campus bundy was at home on a college campus around the time of his crimes out west bundy had attended college and even law school larry simpson when mr bundy was in school he took jobs working for political campaigns and apparently did an extraordinarily good job there was absolutely no indication that he was the serial killer that he ultimately turned out to be sheriff ken katsaris his charm his wit his intelligence his charisma everything about him made him different than all the other serial killers kathy kleiner the first photo i saw of ted bundy after they arrested him he didn t look like a serial killer he looked normal the survivors learned more about who ted bundy was and the brutality of the crimes he was suspected of committing karen chandler his history was a shock i think when i learned about those women it s just an immense sadness there are all these families that are devastated in the months after the attacks while the florida authorities were building their case the survivors slowly began to move forward with their lives for karen chandler that surprisingly meant moving back into the chi omega house karen chandler when i came back i think they gave me space they didn t it wasn t like they treated me as a special china doll that they couldn t talk to i felt like everyone treated me pretty much like they had treated me before so life just sort of continued on like i had never left cheryl the former dance student was now suffering from balance issues and didn t know what her future would look like cheryl thomas i knew i couldn t hear again but i asked the neurologist would i ever be able to dance again he said that s totally up to you so then i knew that i had an option of you know train my body all over again or i won t dance again i made my decision i was going to go back and get my degree cheryl moved to texas and studied ballet at another university but for kathy life took a different turn kathy kleiner life totally changed for me i did not go back to college i was married six months after the attack my parents thought i needed someone to take care of me and to be sure that nobody came in the middle of the night and attacked me again and i was ok with that but as much as they wanted to they couldn t put bundy behind them to bring him to justice they needed to come face to face with their attacker karen chandler we wanted more than anything to make sure if this was the guy that did it we want him locked up that he never has the opportunity to hurt another woman with every passing day the media grew increasingly fascinated with alleged serial killer ted bundy news report fbi agents and florida police are questioning a man by the name theodore robert bundy he will remain in pensacola under tight security until authorities can determine if he will be charged with the florida state university murders cheryl thomas i feel like they were so focused on ted bundy which i m sure ted bundy enjoyed the media that they forgot about the women as florida authorities investigated bundy they first questioned why hismethod of attackwould have changed sheriff ken katsaris he typically was organized he would plot pick up and then abduct the young lady and here it was obvious that he had gotten disorganized they developed a theory that bundy hadoriginallystalked and targeted cheryl thomas cheryl thomas there had been a guy that i d seen ride his bicycle by my house ted bundy looked similar so i sometimes wonder if maybe that was him larry simpson he had no doubt cased that place out and we believed that mr bundy went to cheryl thomas s residence and when he got there apparently there was a car that had broken down right in front and there was a man there working on the car he found that kinda got spooked he then went to the chi omega house and when his attack at the sorority was interrupted bundy returned to cheryl s sheriff ken katsaris you know i compared ted bundy to a killing machine like a shark because the shark is just feeding in a frenzy off of whatever is available just like the shark has the need to eat he had the need to murder their case intensified with an eyewitness who put bundy at the sorority house larry simpson one of the chi omega sisters nita neary came home that night after being out on a date she came in through the back door of the sorority house and she saw a man coming from the upstairs area down the stairway karen chandler that would have been unusual for nita to see a man because no men were allowed upstairs in the sorority house larry simpson she did not see him full face on but she saw a profile of him he opened the front door and immediately exited the sorority house neary identified bundy from a lineup and as the case came together investigators still had that key piece of evidence to analyze larry simpson we crafted a search warrant to use to search mr bundy s mouth and obtain models of his teeth to compare against the bite mark impression that was left sheriff ken katsaris the search warrant for his mouth probably was the first in the nation s history so i went to his cell one evening i told him he s coming with me and he went with me to my dentist s office the doors opened up he saw that we were in a dental office he immediately started screaming where s my attorney i want my attorney you can t do this he knew exactly what we were going to be doing once we read him the search warrant for his mouth he realized that we could use force he sat down in the dental chair he opened his mouth said do what you have to do ken you know i m not a violent person the state asked four dental experts to compare bundy s molds to the marks larry simpson all four of them concluded that mr bundy was the one that left the bite mark sheriff ken katsaris we were confident going to the grand jury with the evidence we had july 27 1978 six months after the fsu attacks news report there was an indictment last night in the aftermath of a brutal crime in tallahassee florida and what was unusual about the indictment was how it was delivered sheriff ken katsaris we had print media radio media television media and they were able to view the indictment reading that night sheriff katsaris i have copies of the indictment to give each of you sheriff katsaris step out mr bundy ted bundy what do we have here ken let s see oh it looks like an indictment all right why don t you read it to me let s read it let s go sheriff katsaris reading indictment theodore robert bundy you are charged indictment two counts burglary two counts murder in the first degree three counts attempted murder in the first degree sheriff ken katsaris he was obviously not very happy i did not let it deter me sheriff katsaris reading indictment said theodore robert bundy did make an assault upon karen chandler and or kathy kleiner not surprisingly the former law student took an active role in his defense larry simpson mr bundy took depositions from the witnesses in the case himself it s very unusual but mr bundy did have legal training karen chandler i think he was acting as the lawyer that he always wanted to be since i didn t remember anything about the attack i think that was helpful but my feeling at that time was i don t want to show him any fear because i don t want him to think that anything about him bothers me is under my skin scares me kathy kleiner he was sitting there looking at me and i looked at him and i didn t take my eyes off of him and he had this smirk on his face and it kind of made my stomach sick but also i knew i was walking out and he wasn t and that gave me some power karen chandler i felt like i had done my job i had answered his questions and i hope i gave him absolutely no satisfaction months passed as the case wound its way toward trial down in miami kathy kleiner struggled to put herself back out in the world kathy kleiner after i got attacked i was afraid of men it was something that i didn t want to have control me and i went to work at a lumber yard because i figured that s where i m going to see the most men and it worked that experience helped me a lot kathy would soon need that newfound confidence the survivors were set to testify against bundy but this time his life was in their hands kathy kleiner to know i was gonna have to testify i think i just needed to build up my resolve and know that this was going to happen and be prepared as much as i could for it we locked eyes once again and i stared at him karen chandler i think i always knew that i was going to have to testify in court if it went to trial july 7 1979 bundy s trial begins larry simpson there was a total media circus and it was the first major case that actually was broadcast live as it was actually going down in the courtroom news report only one camera fixed on a tripod tapes the courtroom proceedings as 20 television crews from around the country have been covering the trial larry simpson i think mr bundy was playin to the cameras sheriff ken katsaris he got a real kick out of it at trial bundy again took an active role on his defense team news report by participating in his own defense bundy and his attorneys hope to convince this jury that he was intelligent articulate and innocent a victim of circumstances larry simpson bundy had a lot of interaction with the judge he argued his own motions as good as a lawyer could i think young women packed the courtroom every day to see the star defendant news report young woman interviewed every time he turns around i kind of get that feeling oh no he s gonna get me next as lead prosecutor larry simpson felt pressure to make sure bundy was put away forever larry simpson the cases out west were not particularly strong cases we needed to finish the job in florida the survivors felt that pressure too as cheryl karen and kathy each took the stand cheryl thomas i felt it was important for the jury to see a real person who had been subjected to what ted bundy did cheryl thomas in court i had five skull fractures and multiple contusions on my head karen chandler it was just my mission to tell my story i just really didn t want to look at him didn t want to talk to him didn t want anything to do with him kathy kleiner the defense asked is this the man you saw attack you that night in your room at chi omega and i had to say i don t know because i never saw his face i wanted to help put the nail in the coffin to put him away to help the other girls who couldn t do it i couldn t help though the survivors couldn t identify bundy from that night someone else could sorority sister nita neary larry simpson do you recall the man that you saw at the door at the chi omega house on the morning of january 15 1978 nita neary yes i do larry simpson would you point him out for us please nita neary points to ted bundy larry simpson man in the dark suit with the red tie perhaps the prosecution s most damning evidence was that bite mark left on one of the victims larry simpson demonstrating with a dental mold against the bite mark photo this is a photograph of the bite mark and as you can see there s a ruler in place and this is what the forensic dentist did in court places the model right on the photograph and then he turned his head slightly and did it again it fits like a glove but bite mark analysis was a new and relatively uncertain science and the ever smiling bundy seemed confident as the trial came to a close kathy kleiner of course i was worried when it went to the jury but i knew in my heart and by the evidence that was there that he is the one that actually murdered my friends july 24 1979 18 months after the fsu attacks larry simpson the jury was out a little less than seven hours and returned a verdict the verdict was guilty as charged on all counts kathy kleiner he was convicted and now whatever sentence he got couldn t be bad enough as far as i was concerned larry simpson it is ironic that he ended up in florida because we were a very active death penalty state karen chandler he was sentenced to death on my birthday i don t believe the death penalty should be a willy nilly kind of thing but if he had gotten out there were women that were going to die i have no doubt in my mind following the fsu trial bundy was also found guilty of murdering 12 year old kimberly leach and received another death sentence cheryl thomas after the trial was over i felt that it was just going to be all over and no more in the news or anything but that didn t happen it was probably just crazy for me to think that as bundy sat on death row his notoriety only grew books and tv programs came out focusing on his good looks and charm instead of rejecting it kathy decided to embrace it kathy kleiner i read as much as i could about ted bundy watched all his movies because i think by learning about him it has helped me move forward because i wanted to just disassociate myself so that he wasn t part of me anymore in 1981 three years after the attacks kathy had a son michael kathy kleiner i didn t want him to know that i had been scared that i had been attacked i just wanted to be a normal mom with a normal kid one night i was putting him to bed and he looked up at me and he touched my face and he said mommy what happened to your face right there and i told him that a bad man came into my house one night and had hurt me michael deshields kathy s son you just don t grasp that at a young age you don t really get it but you kinda do and you just feel like you know i m not gonna let anybody hurt you michael deshields i felt that it was important to keep her safe she was such a loving person how could somebody do that to emotional sorry kathy kleiner and i think in his mind he always carried that that it could happen again and would i be there you know to help my mom for most of the 1980s ted bundy sat on florida s death row appealing his convictions in that time kathy kleiner went through a divorce and focused on her young son michael kathy kleiner i was a single mom for 5 years and he and i grew up together we were very very close michael deshields growing up my mom was the most loving caring affectionate happy person she never let what happened to her get to her kathy had grown accustomed to projecting a tough exterior but that softened in 1987 when an old high school friend came back into her life scott rubin kathy s husband over the years i thought about kathy now and then kathy s very special and you could tell she was very special back then kathy kleiner so i called him and came over one day for lunch on a weekend and basically never left scott rubin i felt energy from kathy right away when we first saw each other it was just her smile and she really looked in your eyes and but happy eyes all that together just was like boom scott rubin when kathy told me a little bit about the attack by ted bundy it just kind of blew me away she would cry about it i wanted to take away all her pain and you couldn t take away this pain in her family kathy found happiness and she leaned on them for support as bundy s appeals finally ran out sheriff ken katsaris at the end he was bargaining for his life he started confessing to murders he confessed to 30 murders and now he was trying to give information but it was vague kathy kleiner i ll tell you where more women are buried please don t kill me and i can imagine those being the last words that he heard from his victims please don t kill me january 24 1989 bundy s execution news report serial killer ted bundy scheduled to die in florida s electric chair at 7 o clock there was the atmosphere of a public hanging as hundreds of singing chanting death penalty supporters gathered bye bye ted bundy goodbye kathy kleiner when it happened we got a call we had tv on and at that point we saw the white flag that they hold and wave when someone has been electrocuted scott and i were sitting on our little sofa in my condo and i cried and i cried and i cried for all the victims that could not see this long after surviving ted bundy kathy is speaking publicly about her experiences hoping it might help others kathy kleiner i think by telling my story it has helped to heal me but i feel that it also helps people to hear that i have been through something so horrific and i ve come out the other side i want people to know no matter what they ve gone through that they too can do it there is no one way to heal from trauma karen and cheryl feel like they ve talked about ted bundy enough karen chandler i was a victim until i walked out of that hospital i was a survivor until he was executed we gotta come up with something that s after that it s not part of me anymore cheryl thomas i want to be more than cheryl thomas that was attacked by bundy i want to just be cheryl thomas i got married and i had two wonderful children i got my masters at gallaudet university and worked with the hearing impaired in dance karen chandler i ve had a 40 year marriage i have two wonderful self sustaining children i have three wonderful grandchildren i really don t think about bundy anymore kathy s journey takes her back to tallahassee for the first time in over 40 years she s come in part to thank former sheriff ken katsaris kathy kleiner he s someone i ve thought about over the years and someone who is a good memory ken katsaris kathy you re here i m seeing you again i can t believe it kathy kleiner thank you so much kathy kleiner i m looking forward to doing this this is something i needed to do together kathy and ken returned to the chi omega house kathy kleiner it s weird the sorority house looks so different it doesn t bother me like i thought it would it s ok to be here i m ok and i m with ken so he s giving me strength ken katsaris well thank you kathy kleiner through everything life goes on you have to keep it going larry simpson this case is about probably over 100 victims that lost their lives because of mr bundy as time moves forward the hope is that it will be the women not bundy who are remembered larry simpson he s not to be glorified he s to be damned cheryl thomas they were important people they were people just like me karen chandler living breathing people that had futures and they re gone and we ll only remember this inhuman thing for kathy and karen the sorority sisters they lost are always with them karen chandler i think about them occasionally when i m with my grandchildren or when i had children i wonder what their lives could ve been like what they would ve done kathy kleiner i feel that because i survived ted bundy and there were so many victims that didn t i don t want to take that that opportunity i was given and not do good with it i want to be sure that i keep going for them ted bundy confessed to at least 30 murders but it is believed he may have killed over 100 women in at least six states watch episodes from
