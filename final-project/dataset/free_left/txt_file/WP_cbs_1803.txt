thursday call with the governors and framed it as another reason to push for reopening the economy they want to get going with their lives because keeping closed is causing problems too you ve been seeing the same studies as i have and you ve been seeing the same news he said on the call according to audio obtained by cbs news the pressure to liberate comes as many regional pacts and individual state governors are building up plans and timelines to modify or lift their stay at home restrictions minnesota governor tim walz took one step in this direction friday andannouncedthe reopening golf courses and expansion of outdoor recreation activities albeit with social distancing requirements when asked about the tweets and protests walz said he tried to call mr trump and vice president mike pence about it but got no return i called to ask what are we doing differently about moving towards getting as many people back into the workforce without compromising the health of minnesotans or the providers and that will probably take longer than a two word tweet but i think there s responsibility to tell us that he said at apress conference on friday i d like to know what they think we could have done differently michigan governor gretchen whitmer was asked about mr trump s tweet about liberating michigan in a press briefing on friday reportscbs news campaign reporter jack turman she

joe biden after days of both president trump and his re election campaign ridiculing joe biden as soft on china biden responded on friday in a two minutevideo cbs news campaign reporter bo ericksonreports with ominous music edited underneath his remarks biden says the trump administration stood by as the covid 19 pandemic spread the uncomfortable truth is that this president left america exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic biden says he ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies and put his trust in china s leaders instead by getting rid of prediction tools and cutting cdc experts in china biden says america was left without accurate information biden said mr trump applauded chinese president xi jinping s response because he was more worried about protecting his trade deal with china than he was about the virus that had already come to america voters can likely expect more debate over china to come throughout the campaign as biden on the trail was criticized for sometimes downplaying competition from china president trump the trump campaign is signaling a return to rallies cbs news white house producer sara cookandcampaign reporter nicole sgangareport this coronavirus will pass and the president is looking forward to getting back out on the campaign trail and holding rallies we will get back to those rallies never fear the president is

warren continues to push for the next coronavirus relief package to require the government to collect and report demographic data about testing treatment and fatality rates of the virus generations of structural racism have left people of color more vulnerable to this virus you can t fix what you can t see she said on a call with reporters on friday without full information about whose being tested

establishment the line crescendoed with each beat and as sanders closed with the democratic establishment his supporters roared louder than for any other foe the opposition to the very party sanders was vying to be the nominee of epitomized his revolutionary platform but on friday cbs news campaign reporter cara kortereports the dnc sent a fundraising email to supporters friday written by sanders
