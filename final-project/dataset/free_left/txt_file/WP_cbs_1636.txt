 cbs news below is a transcript from the may 17 2015 episode of face the nation guests included ntsb member robert sumwalt sen bob casey jr gov scott walker rep devin nunes former defense secretary robert gates peggy noonan david ignatius and frank rich bob schieffer today on face the nation the parade of republican presidential candidates rolls on u s forces stage a daring raid in syria against isis and mystery of the amtrak derailment in philadelphia amtrak has ordered to make safety changes to the northeast corridor rails we will get the latest on the train accident that killed eight outside of philadelphia from the head ntsb investigator bob sumwalt and pennsylvania s senator bob casey plus another gabfest of 2016 republican candidates in iowa governor scott walker in less than two years we are going to have a republican president in the white house bob schieffer i talked with former secretary of defense robert gates and asked him what he thinks of the would be presidents so far robert gates most of these candidates have no experience in foreign policy bob schieffer and we ll talk to one of them wisconsin governor scott walker and we ll get latest on that u s attack against isis from the new chairman of the house intelligence committee devin nunes it s all ahead because this is face the nation good morning first the train investigators say they have asked the fbi to investigate the possibility of a projectile hitting amtrak 188 just before it derailed tuesday night so we begin with robert sumwalt who is a member of the national transportation safety board the point man on this investigation there is it possible that this thing that hit the train windshield that we now know about is it possible somebody shot at that train robert sumwalt ntsb bob we re certainly going to be looking at that as you pointed out we are going to have the fbi providing their technical assistance to help us analyze exactly what sort of fracture pattern may be on that windshield bob schieffer well is there any way that that could have been connected to the crash in some way robert sumwalt and you know that s a great point it could be completely coincidental or it could be causal and that s exactly what we intend to find out bob schieffer but it could have been somebody fired a shot at the train robert sumwalt you know i would like to downplay that part i ve i ve seen the fracture pattern it looks like something about the size of a of a grapefruit if you will and it did did not even penetrate the entire windshield bob schieffer well what is it i mean that could have that there was a connection what could it have been that it distracted the engineer or something of that sort robert sumwalt and certainly everything is on the table in that respect we re really looking at everything and this is just another piece of the investigation bob schieffer well the the engineer says he has no memory of anything does that make sense to you robert sumwalt it certainly does as we know people can be in an automobile crash and they will say i don t i don t even remember the crash i just woke up in the hospital and so that s that s typical in some some traumatic event like this bob schieffer but was he actually injured robert sumwalt yes sir he was injured bob schieffer and was it a head injury robert sumwalt the the media sources are reporting that he had a concussion and had staples so that s what the media reports are bob schieffer but as the investigator you don t know robert sumwalt well i i do but of course there is hipaa regulations that would prohibit even even me from releasing those those sorts of information so i ll just tell you what what the media sources are but yes he he did spend some time in the hospital bob schieffer and you are satisfied that he s cooperating now robert sumwalt yes sir we met with him on friday and he s he was very cooperative and provided us with information of what he did know bob schieffer do you think that this in any way is connected with amtrak being underfunded robert sumwalt well we re certainly not going to get at that at the ntsb getting into that political fray but we will say that we have long called for positive train control and we believe that positive train control if installed and operational it would have prevented this accident bob schieffer well why wasn t it robert sumwalt well that s a question that we intend to find out of course it s not required to be installed by the end of the year but we do want to know what the management decisions were at amtrak which those decisions were to install positive train control in certain parts of that track but not in others bob schieffer all right well mister investigator we want to thank you for joining us this morning we are going to go now to senator bob casey he is at the 30th street station in philadelphia he rides this train twice a week do you think senator that something should have been done that wasn t done and that s why we had this accident or was it just simply this train was speeding senator bob casey d pennsylvania well bob i think we ve got to wait for the results of the investigation to be certain but the little information we do know about speed and about the nature of the curve and and the the the basic facts that are on record right now i think indicate that we ve got to make sure that as your as mister sumwalt just said that we have positive train control in place so if you are a member of congress as i am and the law says as it does that by the end of the year positive train control has to be implemented and deployed we have to make sure that we do everything possible to support amtrak in completing that assignment bob schieffer well well explain senator bob casey they are committed to it yeah bob schieffer to those who may not know what is positive train control what does that mean senator bob casey it s the good it s a it s a technology that allows the the the train engineer if if if he or she is not slowing the train down appropriately it can override that human error if the train is moving too fast it s a it s among other things sensors and technology that allows allows that train to slow down when it should and to comply with the speed regulations in addition to sensing other problems on the on the tracks so it s remarkably effective technology we got to make sure that it s on every every model of the track bob schieffer do you think amtrak has do you think amtrak has done enough to ensure passenger safety or are there things that need to be done here senator bob casey well i think that an incident like this crosses us to question a lot of things once we have the facts and as you know ntsb will be providing more facts in a preliminary report and then down the road maybe as long as a year a full scale report we have to make sure that as that the congress reacts appropriately to that we should not the congress should not put amtrak in the position of of choosing between positive train control safety and fixing crumbling bridges we have to do both and we ve got to make sure they have the resources to do that we don t know the the connection between funding and this incident but regardless amtrak needs more funding i ve been advocating for years and at a minimum i think we should fund what the president proposed as opposed to what was done the other day in the house appropriations committee bob schieffer well do you think there will be a congressional investigation or will you let it go with this ntsb investigation senator bob casey i would guess that that the congress in its oversight role would have some sort of investigation beyond the routine beyond the routine appropriations debates but but that s really up to the the relevant committees in house and senate bob schieffer all right well thank you so much senator thank you senator bob casey thanks bob bob schieffer we turn now to campaign 2016 and with foreign policy on the front burner again we sought out robert gates secretary of defense for both president george w bush and president obama we ask him what he thought of the candidates so far on foreign policy begin vt robert gates i haven t been particularly impressed frankly by anybody at this point on either side of the aisle i m i m not seeing much courage when it comes to support of the trade agreements which are i think very important for this country i think the president s right on that i think that there s an awful lot of easy solutions to tough problems that are being bruited about so so i think we have to wait most of these candidates have no experience in foreign policy in fact very few do on the republican side have any experience or very little maybe two or three years in the senate but perhaps their views will be flushed out and and become more cogent as the campaign goes along but so far they re in early days and i think their views are probably largely unformed bob schieffer you worked for how many presidents robert gates eight bob schieffer eight presidents you ve worked for both bushs jeb bush is often kind of a stumbling star it seems to me obviously he has great fundraising potential here but over the last week he s had trouble answering the question about would he have gone into iraq knowing what he now knows first he said yes he would then he said well it s a hypothetical question then he said well actually no he wouldn t do you have any advice for him robert gates that s one question where i would have thought he would have had an answer before he got into the middle of this it was inevitable question that would be asked and and i think i think that the way to deal with it frankly is to say you don t make policy by going back and reliving old decisions one of the things that i admired about both president bush and second president bush and president obama was they didn t have second thoughts they made a decision and they moved on and and i think you know the same thing as a candidate you you say what you believe and then you move on end vt bob schieffer we will have more from bob gates later including his take on hillary clinton but now to wisconsin governor scott walker one of the republicans exploring a run in 2016 he s in iowa this morning governor welcome well you just heard secretary gates not exactly complimentary to the republican field thus far but does he have a point governor scott walker r wisconsin well i think foreign policy is going to be an important part along with talking about growth helping grow the economy and helping reform the federal government by taking power from washington and sending it back to the states but i talk to people all the time we re just in la crosse wisconsin yesterday at my state party convention last night at the iowa republican party event and i got to tell you one of the areas where people talked to me about is the safety and security of this country and our allies around the world so i do think it s going to be an important issue if i choose to get into this race it s something i m going to weigh on a very clear plan from what we should do going forward and how we should address the issues we face here in america and the issues we face around the world so i think there s a wide open door to lay out a very clear doctrine and i do think that if foreign policy plays an important role the contrast will be clear because everywhere just about everywhere that hillary clinton has played a role with this president under president obama that part of the world is largely a failure a mess because of the policies that we ve seen from obama and clinton bob schieffer well you you ve have just come back from israel but let me just ask you what would you list as your foreign policy credentials governor scott walker well i think as a governor it s really ultimately about leadership to me in my lifetime one of the best presidents when it comes to foreign policy was a governor from california in my lifetime one of the worst presidents when it comes to foreign policy was a freshman senator from illinois so i think it s not just about past experiences it s about leadership as a as a governor you have to put a cabinet in place and hopefully you pick people that are smarter than you on any given topic i think that s something that s required of a successful president is putting people in place be it secretary of defense national security advisor secretary of state and others and then having the good sense to listen to them and to others and the chain of command in the military consulting with the congress all those sorts of things i think are important of a president and i think successful governors in either party have to do that every single day consult with people in their cabinet and act the most beyond that as as a governor i have been to just recently in germany and spain and france earlier in the year was in united kingdom on trade related missions few years back in china and japan so that s probably the most that any governor of either party has is that experience in terms of trade relations and something i think it s very important not just to our states it s important to our country bob schieffer well you know jeb bush and you just heard what secretary gates said he was a governor but he had kind of a hard time it seems to me answering that question of would he have gone into iraq had he known what we all now know and he gave about four different answers by the end of the week he said well no he wouldn t have what do you have to say about that did that surprise you governor scott walker i tend to agree with secretary gates we should really be talking about the challenges we face going forward but but i did stand up and defend the president president bush that is as saying i think any president regardless of party probably would have made a similar decision to what president bush did at the time with the information he had available remember even secretary of state then senator clinton voted for measures supporting the iraq war i think it was a failure in many cases in the intelligence that was given to the president and to the congress at the time knowing what we know now i think it s safe many of us myself included to say we probably wouldn t have taken that tact but i give credit to the president for recognizing the challenges for being responsible for the surge listening to those in congress who were pushing for that that was highly successful and i also think it s important to learn from the fact that this president and the advisors he had like secretary clinton i think made a mistake by urging the country to pull back from our state in iraq and we have a place that s largely destabilized now because of their quick move on the last few years to get out of iraq that s something we need to learn from going forward we have a very destabilized region and we need to have a strong presence there bob schieffer let me ask you about something that you said previously you told a gathering that the most significant foreign policy decision of your lifetime was ronald reagan s ending of the 1981 air traffic controller strike you said it sent a message not only across america it sent a message around the world don t you think there may have been a few things while i agree that that was a significant development a few things maybe a little more important like the nixon s opening to china for example the decision to go after osama bin laden do you really think that was the most significant foreign policy statement of your lifetime governor scott walker well i think those were all important things don t get me wrong in that regard but this is not something i hold alone former secretary of state george shultz said that that was the most significant action during the the reagan administration i came of age during the the the reagan administration i was i think i believe just turned thirteen two days before his election in 1980 and for me looking at that kind of leadership he set the tone not just domestically with that action he sent a message around the world as as you just read off i think not only to our allies this is was someone who was serious that that could be trusted but in combination with our adversaries they sent a clear message not to mess with him you you d combine that clear leadership position he took early in his administration with the buildup in the military much like we need today to get back to a minimum at least to gates level budget for the department of defense you combine that to what he did in the eighties with the leadership he showed earlier on his term and that s why i believe in many regards we had one of the lowest levels of military engagement not because the president president reagan was afraid to engage but because our adversaries knew he would if needed and i think that made for a safer world that was peace through strength personified bob schieffer let me ask you quickly about the iran negotiations you re ready to stop the negotiations as i understand it what do you see as the alternative governor scott walker well i think if we re going to have negotiations we should have them on our terms not on theirs to me we need to dismantle the elicit nuclear infrastructure they have that has to be clear it s a real threat not just to israel i ve talked to leaders from the persian gulf states the sunni states who have very real concerns in that regard secondly they need to provide full disclosure transparency and immediate ability to inspect which i don t think we fully have right now under those the parameters of the supposed deal and third we need to make sure that they deal with others in the region that iran in many ways it s not much different than the country i remember as a kid when i tied yellow ribbons around the tree in front of our house when americans were held hostage people like my friend kevin hermening from wausau wisconsin who was the youngest marine held there i don t see a lot changing they need to learn to deal with others in the region i think you ve seen their influence in terms of shiite militias not only in iraq but obviously their involvement in syria now with the houthis in yemen those are the sorts of things we need to crackdown on bob schieffer okay all right and one final question when are you going to make the decision on whether or not to run governor scott walker my state budget will be completed by the end of june it s something i am focused on every day completing another budget with the fifth and sixth year or property tax relief on once that s complete at the end of june we ll announce our intentions to our state to our country and the world and we ll keep you posted bob schieffer all right well thank you so much governor nice to talk to you governor scott walker great to be with you too bob schieffer and we ll be back in one minute announcements bob schieffer and we re back now with the new chairman of the house intelligence committee california republican devin nunes he joins us for his first sunday show interview since becoming chairman we want to welcome you mister chairman let s just talk a little bit about this raid that took place over the weekend u s special forces went into syria apparently killed a fairly significant isis leader got out without any americans being killed flesh it out for us what do you know about that representative devin nunes intelligence committee chairman r california well many of us have been advocating this strategy for a long time we re using this tactic because it s just a better way to gather intelligence versus just air strikes so it takes guts for the administration and our military to put action like this together it was successful and we re happy that they got back and got back safely now over the coming weeks we ll know what they were actually able to gather there bob schieffer what do you i hear they may have gotten computers phones how significant will that be representative devin nunes well this target was known as the accountant for isis so hopefully one would assume there would be a lot of intelligence at his at his hideout bob schieffer he was the one as i understand it who was brokering sales of oil representative devin nunes of oil and so you would want to know what he s doing because you would you would want to know how they re bringing in money moving money and then spreading it out to the organization bob schieffer you are just coming to the to the chairmanship of this committee what s your first impression how are we doing in this fight against isis representative devin nunes well it s i think it s important for people to know first of that isis i describe as al qaeda 6 0 which was what ambassador crocker defined isis as so this is really the the sixth generation of al qaeda our the problem that we have now the the i think the american people need to understand and the administration needs to get a better grasp of is isis is not in just iraq and syria so if you want to if your strategy is to do degrade and ultimately defeat isis and you re not looking at the at the broader picture of places like north africa libya essentially what you have is a containment strategy not not an effort to degrade and defeat isis and i say that because you have many of the fighters we know are coming from north africa and if you don t stop that flow of fighters plus the flow of fighters from the west that are coming down in through turkey getting trained and then coming out to the west you re going to have an ever increasing terrorist threat for the united states and our allies bob schieffer well do you feel we re making progress here or are we losing representative devin nunes i think we are containing isis within the borders of iraq and syria outside of that we re not doing much bob schieffer on wednesday you sent a letter to the president warning that the five taliban who were released from gitmo as a prisoner exchange for bowe bergdahl last summer are due to be released from confinement in qatar are you concerned about that representative devin nunes yeah so what we explained to the president was on june first so we re what less than two weeks away from guys who we know what i said in the letters we know they are in communications with bad guys just like they were doing before when they were picked up on the battlefield and brought to guantanamo in the first place so many of us believe they never should have been released and we just sent a letter to the president to make sure that you work with the qataris we don t want these five guys going back to the battlefield engineering plans to kill american and nato and our nato allies bob schieffer well what do you know about them representative devin nunes we know that they have been back once they got to qatar that they have had been in constant communication with some of their old pals bob schieffer what about this whole issue of guantanamo do you think it ought to be closed down representative devin nunes no i have long been on the record saying that we need to leave guantanamo open i think one of the tragedies is is that we ve been relying more on drone strikes which is a very effective tool don t get me wrong and we need to have it in our arsenal but when you re when you go out and you vaporize our opponents it makes and you re not willing to bring them in bring them to places like guantanamo and get actionable intelligence from them it makes it harder to understand the enemy thus harder to defeat the enemy bob schieffer the big thing in congress right now the trade agreement that s pending where do you come down on that representative devin nunes look i believe it is it is imperative for us for our national security interests to quickly pass trade promotion authority because you can then move on to the trans pacific partnership and an agreement with our european allies if you can bring those trade agreements together you will have two thirds of the of the world s economy under the same trade agreement which allows for fair and free trade unlike what we have now bob schieffer all right mister chairman it s certainly nice to have you we hope you ll come back many times representative devin nunes thank you bob schieffer and we ll be right back announcements bob schieffer maybe you saw this even so you need to see it again mitt romney fought a boxing match with heavyweight champion evander holyfield i m serious look here he is entering the arena in salt lake city and yes that s mrs romney wearing batman hat leading the way once in the ring they stripped him of his robe and the usual shirt and tie and the announcer announced his record man his political record one win and one very big loss bob schieffer and then the fight began actually there was more dancing than fighting but romney did manage to get in a few jabs holyfield may or may not have realized he d been hit but he did remain upright romney threw in the towel during the second round it was all for charity and he put his shirt on and took a few political jabs saying if people wondered who could have negotiated such a mismatch it was obvious mitt romney the answer is john kerry of course and bob schieffer i m not sure about romney s future as a boxer but when a guy in my age demographic takes his shirt off in public and the ladies don t go ew i got to say he gets a high five from me so here you go governor back in a minute announcements bob schieffer some of our stations are leaving us now most of you we ll be right back with a lot more face the nation including more of our interview with former secretary of defense robert gates and our panel so stay with us announcements bob schieffer welcome back to face the nation we spoke friday to former secretary of defense bob gates at the college of william mary in williamsburg virginia where he is chancellor secretary gates best selling book duty memoirs of a secretary at war is now out in paperback and we ask among other things what he thought about the nuclear deal with iran begin vt robert gates former defense secretary duty well first of all getting the iranians to the negotiating table in the first place was a success for u s foreign policy they didn t come to the table at a goodwill they came to the table because their economy was being strangled and the leadership was afraid they might get overthrown so they are there because they have to be there i think that the agreement there re some specifics in the agreement that are very encouraging but i i have several concerns that i hope can be addressed in the negotiations between now and june the first is the timing of the lifting of the sanctions is it are they going to be lifted right away as long as the iranians agree to implement the agreement or will be they be phased over time based on performance which has been our position all along the second is verification unless we have sort of on demand inspection at all facilities including military facilities i think there is a great potential to cheat third i think that this the the idea of being able to have these snapback sanctions that sanctions could be re imposed once lifted is very unrealistic i think that the pursuit of the agreement is based on the president s hope that over a ten year period with the sanctions being lifted that the iranians will become a constructive stakeholder in the international community that that as their economy begins to grow again that that they will abandon their ideology their theology their revolutionary principles their meddling in various parts of the region and frankly i believe that s very unrealistic bob schieffer what if we can t get a deal with is the alternative robert gates well i don t think the alternative is war one alternative is better deal i think that you go back to the sanctions i think you reinforce the sanctions and you basically say here are the additional things we need for this agreement to work and to be worthwhile and an agreement that reassures our allies or at least doesn t scare them half to death if they choose not to come back to the negotiations but to race to a nuclear weapon well my guess is that will show that they intended to do that all along despite all their protestations that they have no interest in a nuclear weapon but i think i think that there is a potential for a better deal bob schieffer you worked very closely with hillary clinton when she was secretary of state you you two kind of bonded it seemed to me during the administration do you think she s qualified to be a president robert gates well i only ever dealt with secretary clinton on foreign policy matters and as i wrote in my book we never discussed domestic affairs and that probably was a good thing but i think that i think she was a good secretary of state i think she played a a critical role in in getting the much tougher sanctions on iran and getting particularly the russians and the chinese onboard to allow those more severe sanctions to to be put into place we agreed in terms of the afghan surge if anything she was tougher than i was on that she was ready to support mcchrystal s forty thousand request for forty thousand troops and only went along with the thirty thousand because i proposed it i think that we certainly agreed in terms of how to deal with the very first phases of of the arab spring and particularly disagreeing with president on how to handle mubarak so the first place we actually ever parted ways was on the intervention in libya which she supported and i opposed bob schieffer does it bother you this controversy that sprung up around her about having her own server on the e mails and deleting e mails and all of that business robert gates well i think it s a concern and i i never used e mail for official business when i was either well when i was director of cia e mail was still in its infancy but but as secretary of defense i mean i would use it for personal things but i never used e mail for business and i i just think it s it s a risky way to try and do business bob schieffer and and what about this controversy now over foreign governments contributing to the clinton foundation and this went on while she was secretary of state robert gates well i don t know the details i really only know what i read in the press and and so on but it and the question is did the foundation abide by the agreements that were made when secretary clinton became secretary the agreements that were made with president obama and his staff or the president elect and his staff were those were those agreements fulfilled i think that s the key and and it is a it is an issue of appearances at a minimum bob schieffer if it came down to it could you see yourself voting for hillary clinton robert gates well i think it s a little early to to start touring that besides i m not sure that having a having a republican endorse you is the best thing at this point bob schieffer the big argument in washington right now is over the trade bill and here we have republicans a lot of them lining up with the president on this and some in his own party are the most vehement critics of this bill where do you come out on all that robert gates i m totally supportive of these trade pacts i think that the president is exactly right they he needs this fast track authority this is important for not only our economic relationships with other countries and our own economic growth long term it s important in terms of our political relationships and our security relationships with other countries particularly in asia so i think that i think that this is it s profoundly mistaken to oppose these trade pacts and particularly in the way they ve been put forward bob schieffer we re now hearing in iraq new victories by isis can you envision united states having to send ground troops back into there robert gates actually i think sending large numbers of u s ground troops back into iraq would be a serious mistake but i do believe that the rules of engagement for our troops need to be more flexible i think we need to have more deeply embedded trainers with the iraqi kurdish and the iraqi security forces the sunni tribes with the kurds in the north i think we need to have forward air controllers and spotters we need to have special forces in there i think to be able to really get at isis we need and these these are relatively small numbers we have thirty three thousand plus in country already it seems to me a fraction of those if given broader rules of engagement could it play a more effective role i worry about the role of the iranians and the shia militias in iraq and so for us to be more deeply engaged but we re talking hundreds or maybe at most a thousand u s forces sending a big u s force back in would be a mistake and i don t know of anybody who really supports that bob schieffer you re still concerned by the dysfunction in washington do you see a way out of that robert gates it it really is simply a matter of leadership i mean there are a lot of structural changes that have taken place over the last thirty years or so that make i mean we ve always had tough politics in this country we ve always had polarized politics but my favorite example is the politics today are no worse than they were when the republicans controlled both houses of congress in 1947 and truman was a hated president and he still got the nato agreement nato treaty approved he restructured the national security organizations he got the marshall plan through people were still willing to reach across the aisle to do what was in the best interest of the country and i think what s missing now are the number the that band in the middle both center left and center right who are willing to reach across and and do deals and get things done and anybody who wants to compromise is accused of selling out or betraying their principles and that s not the way our system of government works constitution is a bundle of compromises the only way divided government meaning the three separate branches of government works is through compromise and you get these people men and women back there who basically say it s my way or the highway that s not the way the american system has ever been able to work bob schieffer secretary it s always fun to talk to you and wish you the best robert gates thanks a lot bob wish you the best too bob schieffer thank you end vt announcements bob schieffer back now for some analysis with some of my favorite people peggy noonan who is a columnist for the wall street journal and a cbs news contributor david ignatius is a washington post columnist and in new york this morning new york magazine columnist frank rich peggy let me just start with you this was a tough week for jeb bush peggy noonan wall street journal cbs news contributor yeah it definitely was he seemed consistently taken aback by the asking of a question anyone could have told you a year and two years ago was going to be a primary question of the primary time it was difficult for him in ways that are almost mysterious and because i think he showed such discomfort in his answers he sort of opened up the possibility that this will only be the beginning of many questions about things your brother did would you have you done them do you know what i mean so it was difficult however he deserves i think great credit in this he s going to the press every day he s taking questions he s being out there he s doing sit down interviews mrs clinton instead is doing sort of a silent movie of a campaign in which she doesn t feel she has to do those things i don t think that s a good way to go and will be problematic for her down the road bob schieffer well what do you think david i would guess at some point here hillary clinton is going to have to have a news conference david ignatius washington post she is i wrote this week playing a rope a dope campaign to remember muhammad ali the fighter letting presumably hoping to let the republicans punch themselves out swinging and swinging in by the time we get to the real campaign their arms will be tired i m not sure that s going to going to work i found it genuinely troubling that on an issue where she was involved in the takeoff of the trans pacific partnership trade deal she has been so silent as if she s really running scared from the liberal wing of her own party and and and not putting her her views out there i thought the president by contrast was really a strong voice for what he believes in and i think for clinton to be compelling she s going to have to have that same full throated expression of what she thinks bob schieffer what do you think frank rich a lot of focus on foreign policy so far in this campaign do you think that is going to go right on in to when we get into the final years of the campaign season i think we ll have for a couple of years frank rich new york magazine the final yeah the final decade it feels like already i feel look if we re at war which we re unlikely to be and i hope we won t be of course it would be enormous issue but short of that i m not sure i also feel if republicans want to distinguish themselves from hillary clinton it s probably not a good way to do it she is the most hawkish national democrat can be she was secretary of state which is a credential they don t have even if you d think she wasn t a great secretary of state it s hard to take that away from her she is the red phone at three o clock in the morning candidate and you have bunch of fresh faced youngish republicans for the most part who look like neophytes and no matter how hawkish they are they all sort of sound the same they re going to have to put themselves far to the right in sort of the neocon territory to distinguish themselves from her the one exception rand paul has already sort of cratered on his revolt on republican foreign policy so i don t see even the percentage for republicans and i think that public as a whole is much more interested in domestic issues particularly as always the economy bob schieffer well well peggy let s go back and talk a little bit about this republican field there are several dozen of them but as you heard bob gates say earlier today and he is basically a republican although he has worked for eight presidents peggy noonan sure bob schieffer he said he s not impressed with any of them so far peggy noonan yeah he he has a way the past few years of exhibiting a fabulous and dangerous candor mister gates and it s a kind of a delight to see i think there s there is one little distinction to be made here he looks at the republican field and in terms for president and and in terms of foreign policy he policy he says well i see pretty thin experience or knowledge more or less there is a distinction between the republican governors going for the presidency and the republican senators the republican senators are more immersed and have been more immersed their brain space has been filled more with foreign policy the governors are mostly young men who are in effect catching up their brain space the past eight years has been full of domestic issues and indistinct contracts and how the state is doing in in terms of its economic environment i do think however that the 2016 election will be both an economic and a foreign policy election it s a great clich of american politics that every presidential is about the economy this one i think will be half economy and half foreign policy because we all sense that the world is exploding every day so it will be important and the there are republicans who i think have some distance to go to make up for some gaps bob schieffer well david my sense of it is that no job being a senator being a governor being a business executive prepares one for being president of the united states david ignatius i think that s absolutely right we referred earlier in the broadcast to harry truman in one sense utterly unprepared to become president after franklin roosevelt and yet he by most accounts was a superb foreign policy leader this republican field with some exceptions i think marco rubio speaks powerfully with some real ideas about foreign policy generally they they don t have a lot of experience we ve learned watching barack obama learn on the job the dangers of that and i think the american public looking at this election and it s one thing hillary clinton really has going for i i wonder if people want to roll the dice again with a very inexperienced person i mean frank rich is right we re not at war but we are fighting a a very dangerous terrorist adversary in isis which is expanding congressman nunes is right it is becoming a global force so that will be a factor in in 2016 and people want somebody who they have confidence is going to be a good leader in them bob schieffer you know frank and you just did a piece about this in new york magazine about the situation in baltimore which is not about foreign policy in the least but it certainly seems to me to be an issue before the american people right now and this is this sort of racial divide that we have been reminded of for want of a better way to say it by these recent events involving the police and african americans frank rich well exactly and keep in mind where the conventions are taking place in 2016 and the republicans are in cleveland the democrats are in philadelphia both these cities have had police departments with african american police chiefs investigated by the justice department for abuses much in the way the baltimore department is now both these cities have enormous amount of poverty and unemployment which is much a piece of this as race we re going to see two conventions i think in a very tone deaf way i suspect in both cases partying there and it s sort of going to dramatize i think a big domestic problem we have you know cleveland is where the twelve year old tamir rice you know was was killed for carrying a toy gun there ve been similar cases in philadelphia all this is going to be front and center in 2016 it s not going away it s never going away even before recent years and i feel you know it s going to be much more short of war i think it s going to be a much bigger deal than the middle east bob schieffer do do you think this is something that goes beyond police relations with the black communities because i certainly do frank rich oh yeah bob schieffer i think what we are reminded of here and what we ve been seeing is that african americans can look at one set of facts and white people can look at the same set of facts and sometimes come up with entirely different conclusions and it seems to me that s what we need to be working on and thinking about right now and how how do you how do we bridge that gap frank what frank rich it s very very difficult no one has a real solution and we get into the stale debate about government versus private enterprise but clear and we talk about having a national discussion about race i don t think that cuts it i think the country as the president said is going to have to decide it really wants to address this it s this is you know fifty years of of riots in america often for the same causes of the same triggers and i think there s going to have to be a real mobilization and i hate to use this clich but it s going to take a leader imagine for instance if one republican candidate well we have fifteen to twenty republican candidates imagine if one of them doesn t even matter which one really decided in a real way to talk to black america not make a cameo appearance at howard university or turn up at one convention of the naacp or whatever really rolled up his or her sleeves and and made some kind of interesting leadership statement about digging into this but it s not even on the radar screen of one of our two major political parties bob schieffer let me go back to what s been happening here in washington the president had this rather unusual summit with with arab leaders and and of all things he invites six countries these are all allies of the united states and only two of them david chose to send their top guys king salman of saudi arabia sent his number two and number three and that was pretty much the rule what do you what do you make that have david ignatius well i think that there s no other way to look at the saudi refusal to send king salman after they had said that he would be coming as dissing the president i think presidents don t make that ask without the expectation that they will say yes i am told by people who attended the meetings at camp david that they were very positive that getting these people together the group that came are all pretty much of the same age they spoke informally sheiks and emirs raised their hands and interrupted and one person in the white house said to me you know one thing we ve learned is we should have done this a long time ago that these allies are important to us that they have been anxious about american leadership they needed to sit down with the president and hear the president explain what he s doing so i think that s one take away they re going to do this meeting again hopefully king salman if he s well and his health is an issue will be at the next one but no question the saudis gave a kind of qualified negative message in not sending him bob schieffer i think you make a very interesting point i mean it s like when the president asked somebody if they want to if he wants to serve in his cabinet they always find out beforehand if the president calls and asks you what will you say and you get people say in this case they asked the king to come and he didn t show up it s pretty hard to you know get past that peggy noonan it s not something that makes the white house look impressive as an organization at the moment it looks a little bit personal towards the president and and towards u s policy i think just as interesting the past few weeks as this meeting has been the trade authority drama in which the president and the left of his party have been having some tensions and there are plenty of republicans who will support him maybe enough maybe not enough it s been interesting to see the president be cuffed about and rebuffed publicly by some people he used to be able to rely on to obey at least politest david ignatius and push back bob schieffer and push back david ignatius
