people have signed a petition organized by rootsaction calling for a four way presidential debate in a moment we ll be joined by the green party s jill stein and her running mate ajamu baraka but first i want to turn to george farah the founder and executive director of open debates he spoke on democracy now a few years ago about how the democrats and republicans took control of the debate process george farah the league of women voters ran the presidential debate process from 1976 until 1984 and they were a very courageous and genuinely independent nonpartisan sponsor and whenever the candidates attempted to manipulate the presidential debates behind closed doors either to exclude a viable independent candidate or to sanitize the formats the league had the courage to challenge the republican and democratic nominees and if necessary go public in 1980 independent candidate john b anderson was polling about 12 percent in the polls the league insisted that anderson be allowed to participate because the vast majority of the american people wanted to see him but jimmy carter president jimmy carter refused to debate him the league went forward anyway and held a presidential debate with an empty chair showing that jimmy carter wasn t going to show up four years later when the republican and democratic nominees tried to get rid of difficult questions by vetoing 80 of the moderators that they had proposed to host the debates the league said this is unacceptable they held a press conference and attacked the campaigns for trying to get rid of difficult questions and lastly in 1988 was the first attempt by the republican and democratic campaigns to negotiate a detailed contract it was tame by comparison a mere 12 pages it talked about who could be in the audience and how the format would be structured but the league found that kind of lack of transparency and that kind of candidate control to be fundamentally outrageous and antithetical to our democratic process they released the contract and stated they refuse to be an accessory to the hoodwinking of the american people and refuse to implement it and today what do we have we have a private corporation that was created by the republican and democratic parties called the commission on presidential debates it seized control of the presidential debates precisely because the league was independent precisely because this women s organization had the guts to stand up to the candidates that the major party candidates had nominated amy goodman that was george farah founder and executive director of open debates speaking on democracy now in 2012 he s the author of no debate how the republican and democratic parties secretly control the presidential debates well joining us now is green party presidential nominee dr jill stein along with her running mate ajamu baraka a longtime human rights activist baraka is the founding executive director of the u s human rights network and coordinator of the u s based black left unity network s committee on international affairs we welcome you both to democracy now so september 26 that s the first presidential debate what are your plans dr jill stein dr jill stein our plans are to be in that debate because it s not just about whether our party will be included it s whether the american people will have a voice whether we will have a real discussion of the crisis of jobs of the climate of race of war these and the crisis of a generation an entire generation that s basically been hung out to dry that cannot get out of predatory student loan debt that doesn t have the jobs they need and doesn t have a climate future to look forward to so these are really the critical issues that people want to discuss we saw an incredible surge of a response last night when we had our first prime time tv and i want to note that while we ve come up to 6 and even 7 percent in the polls this has happened without any media coverage really whatsoever on you know in the mainstream media so it s absolutely remarkable that we ve not only doubled and tripled even more than that because we were invisible as of about two months ago in the polls suddenly we re up there so there s an enormous interest in what we re talking about amy goodman so let s go back to 2012 the debate then was at hofstra as it will be on september 26 you and your running mate then cheri honkala were arrested as you attempted to enter the site of the presidential debate at hofstra democracy now was there at the time of your arrest dr jill stein well we re here to stand our ground we re here to stand ground for the american people who have been systematically locked out of these debates for decades by the commission on presidential debates we think that this commission is entirely illegitimate that if if democracy truly prevailed there would be no such commission that the debates would still be run by the league of women voters that the debates would be open with the criteria that the league of women voters had always used which was that if you have done the work to get on the ballot if you are on the ballot and could actually win the electoral college by being on the ballot in enough states that you deserve to be in the election and you deserve to be heard and that the american people actually deserve to hear choices which are not bought and paid for by multinational corporations and wall street police officer 1 ladies and gentlemen you are obstructing the vehicle of pedestrians and traffic if you refuse to move you are subject to arrest remove them bring them back to arrest them please police officer 2 come on ma am police officer 3 would you step up please stand up please police officer 2 we ll help you come on thank you ma am police officer 3 thank you ladies police officer 2 watch the flag police officer 1 thank you ladies police officer 2 thank you police officer 3 come with us police officer 2 just come with us police officer 3 thank you you guys have to stay here all right everybody we re going to ask you to please move back dr jill stein well i d say this is what democracy looks like in the 21st century i m afraid it s going to take some some politics and courage here to get our democracy back so more to come amy goodman more to come you said so you re taken away dr jill stein from the hofstra campus where did you and cheri honkala where were you taken dr jill stein we were taken to a dark site where nobody knew where we were an unmarked facility that was basically being run by i think homeland security and the secret service and local police we were surrounded by according to cheri who counted them some 16 police and colleagues and handcuffed tightly to these metal chairs for about seven hours amy goodman seven hours dr jill stein seven hours until the debates were long over and everyone had gone home it was i think an incredible testimony to how fearful the political establishment was and is that people should learn that they actually have another choice in that race and all the more so in this race because we know that the current candidates of the democratic and republican parties are the most unpopular the most disliked and untrusted presidential candidates in history so people are clamoring for another choice and we you know we re building a campaign to get into the debates and we ll keep people posted as to what our actions will be coming up but we will not leave this just to the establishment to shut down political opposition which is what this commission is doing amy goodman do you plan to head to hofstra on september 26th dr jill stein absolutely whether we are in the debate or whether we are locked out of the debate you can be sure that we re going to be there and we re not going to be there alone we re going to be there with the american people who are demanding that we open up the debate and make it a real service to our democracy amy goodman you have sued dr jill stein we have two cases one of which has been dismissed the other one is still technically in effect we are not holding our breath that this is going to be favorably decided in a court of law but there s every reason for this to be decided in the court of public opinion where public opinion is very clear that people have had it not only with the rigged economy but the rigged political system and with the dialogue which is rigged by the democratic and republican parties this commission is a private corporation run by the two political parties the league of women voters called it a fraud being perpetrated on the american public we re not going to settle for that amy goodman earlier this year i spoke to libertarian presidential candidate gary johnson in his home state of new mexico he talked about the unfair nature of the presidential debate system as well gary johnson right now running for president of the united states as a libertarian there is no way that a third party wins there s no way that i have a chance of winning unless i m in the presidential debates there is the possibility of being at 15 percent in the polls though if i m in the polls that i could be in the presidential debates amy goodman you re part of a lawsuit going after the presidential debate commission gary johnson yes on the basis that on the basis of the sherman act that politics is a business that democrats and republicans collude with one another to exclude everybody else we think that the discovery phase of this lawsuit is going to provide national insight into just how rigged the system is i come back to the fact that 50 percent of americans right now declare themselves as independent where is that representation amy goodman that was former new mexico governor gary johnson who is running on the libertarian line for president we re talking to dr jill stein presidential nominee of the green party and when we come back from break you ll meet her running mate ajamu baraka new to the electoral scene the vice presidential nominee for the green party stay with us
