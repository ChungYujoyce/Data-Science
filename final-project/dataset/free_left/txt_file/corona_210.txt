millions of americans are out of work amid the coronavirus crisis and we still don t know the full picture more than 3 8 million people filed initial unemployment insurance claims during the week ending april 25 according to data released by the department of labor on thursday morning that brings the total number of people applying for benefits over the previous six weeks to more than 30 million it s a staggering number of people who have filed for unemployment since the coronavirus pandemic triggered nationwide shutdowns and a severe economic downturn weeks ago in late march the labor department registered 3 3 million jobless claims in a single week shattering previous records and each subsequent week the figures released are of a magnitude that would have seemed unimaginable months ago 6 9 million 6 6 million 5 2 million 4 4 million by comparison the previous record was 695 000 in 1982 preliminary unemployment numbers from the full month of april will be released on friday may 8 and provide a fuller picture of the damage the crisis has done to the american job market but the next unemployment report is sure to be ugly the us economy shrank by 4 8 percent in the first quarter of the year analysts and experts estimate the unemployment rate could reach 13 20 even 30 percent in the months to come as vox s matt yglesias recently noted there are caveats to thursday s jobless claims the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act or cares act the 2 2 trillion stimulus president donald trump signed into law in march expands the scope of people who can apply for and collect unemployment benefits people who are self employed freelancers and gig economy workers who were previously ineligible are now eligible still the situation might be worse than it seems unemployment insurance lines have been jammed in all over the country and a lot of people who want to apply haven t been able to in other words there are probably more laid off or furloughed people than are showing up in the data and what s showing up is already great depression level figures for unemployment this is in large part a deliberate maneuver by government officials the us has shut down parts of its economy in order to respond to the public health crisis represented by covid 19 when businesses lay off workers the expanded unemployment benefits help people stay afloat and also to compel them to stay home instead of encouraging them to rush out to find other work the hope is that this is temporary but what the federal government does next to intervene and how quickly the country can get the virus under control are important factors support vox s explanatory journalism every day at vox we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you and our audience around the world with information that has the power to save lives our mission has never been more vital than it is in this moment to empower you through understanding vox s work is reaching more people than ever but our distinctive brand of explanatory journalism takes resources particularly during a pandemic and an economic downturn your financial contribution will not constitute a donation but it will enable our staff to continue to offer free articles videos and podcasts at the quality and volume that this moment requires please consider making a contribution to vox today get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
