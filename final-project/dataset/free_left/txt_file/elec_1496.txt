trump vented his frustrations saturday in a swaggering unscripted campaign speech in moon township pennsylvania a 73 minute whirlwind of taunts insults and vulgarity and occasionally words of praise for the man he was there to support congressional candidate rick saccone the stakes for tuesday s special election couldn t be higher for the republican party despite pouring millions into a district that trump won by 20 points saccone is barely ahead of democratic candidate conor lamb in a race that republican lawmakers fear could augur a blue wave in november if the democrats were to prevail in western pennsylvania that would be quite an earthquake rep charlie dent said last week if a strong pro trump district like this goes the other way it would send a bad signal around the country in districts far more competitive than this one for trump it s not just republican control of the house that s in danger if democrats manage to retake the lower chamber it s also trump s presidency that would face an existential threat impeachment we have to defeat nancy pelosi and maxine waters a very low iq individual trump said you ever see her we will impeach him she s a low iq individual you can t help it she really is the underlying fear crept in again and again here s the thing we re dealing with people that want to obstruct they want to stop us from doing things trump said of democrats the task for everyone here tonight is to make sure that this great american comeback continues full speed ahead trump occasionally mentioned saccone calling him handsome and insulting his opponent as lamb the sham but for the most part the speech was a vehicle for trump to talk about trump don t forget this got us elected trump said of his casual seat of the pants speaking style if i came like a stiff

tough and should have been handled and everybody will say it too but that s o k because that s what we do we handle things he threatened to fight a trade war with the european union over his tariffs on steel and aluminum we re gonna tax mercedes benz we re gonna tax bmw he reiterated that drug dealers ought to get the death penalty criticized sanctuary cities for not cooperating with the justice department and called for an end to chain migration as is typical at any trump rally the president delighted in re litigating the 2016 election and also typically got key facts wrong women we love you we love you hey didn t we surprise them with women during the election remember women won t like donald trump i said have i really had that kind of a problem i don t think so trump claimed he got 52 percent of the women s vote which is only true if you exclude all non white voters exit polls show that trump won only 25 percent of hispanic women and just 4 percent of black women and of course no presidential public appearance would be complete without the usual attack on the fake media fake as hell cnn the worst so fake fake news trump ranted their ratings are lousy by the way compared to fox in one particularly bizarre stream of consciousness moment he referred to meet the press host chuck todd as a sleeping son of a bitch the freewheeling performance was the first of its kind since the resignations of white house aides hope hicks and gary cohn both of whom acted as checks on some of trump s worst impulses hicks as trump s communications director and longtime confidante served as a sounding board and security blanket cohn as trump s chief economic adviser made it his goal to tamp down trump s protectionist instincts with both exiting the trump presidency is entering a new phase
