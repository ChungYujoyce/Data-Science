the amazing coalition that helped bring about much needed change in our district newman wrote in a late night tweet she canceled her election night party as the number of coronavirus cases surged newman who came within 2 200 votes of ousting lipinski in 2018 crafted a formidable and well funded campaign operation for the rematch her turnout operation knocked over 100 000 doors and she nabbed early endorsements from nearly every high profile progressive including sen bernie sanders i vt and rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y that support helped newman tap a groundswell of grassroots donors from around the country she raised upwards of 1 6 million and was outspending lipinski by a two to one margin on the air a coalition of women s groups including emily s list and naral pro choice

appeared to be automated text messages to gop voters urging them to stop newman by pulling a democratic ballot newman may also have benefited from a decrease in turnout caused by fears over the rapid spread of the coronavirus lipinski a product of chicago s machine politics likely held an advantage with older voters who are disproportionately at risk for contracting the virus and perhaps more likely to stay home the district spans from the southwest side of chicago where lipinski s support is strong out to the western suburbs where newman s base resides lipinski has long been atop liberal target lists for positions he has held throughout his career he voted against the affordable care act supported the defense of marriage act and has voted to defund planned parenthood we desperately need positive change here newman told reporters in a call last week what i hear in all 350 of my meet and greets we ve had over the last year is the same thing we need a real democrat with a real plan yet lipinski pitched himself as in line with the district s voters and cast newman as too extreme citing her support for medicare for all and the green new deal we should remain focused on what s important he told reporters in an interview last week in the capitol what really holds us all together as democrats the type of agenda that we have had in the house with our majority in this congress newman s campaign message relied less on touting her liberal policy positions and more on painting lipinski as ineffective she stressed her plans to make health care affordable better transportation in the district and reduce gun violence the district leans heavily democratic but lipinski was likely able to hang onto it in part because of his ties to the chicago political machine he won the seat in 2004 after his father then rep bill lipinski announced a surprise retirement a few months before the election and persuaded local democratic committeemen to place his son on the ballot in his place
