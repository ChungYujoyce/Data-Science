empty bleachers and a hostile student body greeted trump vice presidential nominee mike pence in virginia on saturday at one of the most religiously conservative schools in the country purcellville va mike pence definitely chose the wrong place to give a stump speech trump s vp nominee railed against hillary clinton in northern virginia on saturday afternoon but he chose to do it at an evangelical christian college with a history of anti trump sentiment students protested outside while inside students stood in silent protest until they were ejected mid speech the protests and poor attendance at the speech at patrick henry college illustrate the challenges that trump has appealing to evangelical christians especially younger ones who are turned off by his tone his campaign ideas and his personal history and are not at all assauged by his choice of pence for his running mate the phc student body as a whole is very anti trump a lot of them say i don t like him but i m going to turn up my nose and vote for him because i like hillary even less but overall there is a severe disgust with trump said sebastian lopez a junior studying political theory at the school who was protesting the speech holding a sign for hours outside in the blazing mid day sun i don t think that mike pence is a bad person but i think he has made an alliance with someone who is completely unacceptable from a libertarian conservative or progressive standpoint added christian mcguire a junior at patrick henry college studying american politics who was also demonstrating against pence mcguire estimated 75 percent of the student body opposed trump pence s visit is not the first misstep by the trump campaign in virginia donald trump flubbed his speech in northern virginia earlier this month when he lectured the affluent locals in the audience as if they were the rust belt you re doing lousy over here he remarked and then listed factory closures in far flung areas of the state that were hours away as well as a plant that closed in north carolina patrick henry college is located in loudoun county the affluent swing district an hour from washington d c that voted for bush twice and then obama twice it s as close to a must win county as it gets so it fell to indiana gov mike pence again to sweep up after his boss s mistakes i m a christian a conservative and a republican in that order said pence playing to the audience but locals weren t interested in hearing what he had to say when marco rubio visited in february during the republican primaries students and local residents crammed into the room filling the bleachers the gymnasium floor and the balconies above to get a glimpse of the presidential candidate the road outside the college was jam packed parking was a nightmare an enthusiastic students for rubio group existed during the primaries to this day there is no pro trump group on campus there are certainly students who support trump though most are not enthusiastic he was rarely the first choice in such a crowded primary field said tim kocher a spokesman for the patrick henry college republicans i believe trump has a solid base of support around 15 20 but many students simply have not made up their minds as far as the presidential race goes when pence visited saturday the room was half empty a whole set of retractable bleachers sat empty and discarded near the stage no admiring crowds leaned over the balcony to get a better look at the politician parking was a breeze this lackluster turnout took place at a school which in fall 2015 registered just 294 students yet had about as many white house interns during the bush administration as georgetown university with its nearly 18 000 students i m a b list republican celebrity pence said self deprecatingly as he thanked attendees for showing up on a beautiful cloudless saturday afternoon it was funny because it was kind of sad and it was sad because it was kind of true pence also spoke as if he did not quite understand whose ticket he was on we believe in free trade he said as if trump had not run a campaign slamming international trade the governor also slammed hillary clinton s plan to tax the rich as if the republican nominee had not taken aim at wall street during his populist run for the white house americans are tired of politicians who divide our country to unite their support he said as if trump had not run a campaign that regularly disparaged muslims foreigners and women as if to bolster this point a group of protesters critical of trump s rhetoric on islam revealed their t shirts during pence s speech engaging in a silent protest of the republican ticket as they were slowly escorted out even the students who supported the trump pence ticket seemed to be doing so with an air of resignation buoyed only by the threat they believe hillary clinton poses to the country sarah roberts a student at the college who attended the speech told the daily beast i haven t done the research to be like woo hoo but he s better than the alternative our options are a little limited so we re going to have to choose between worse and worse said another student carrying a trump pence sign it s a very conservative school one of the most conservative schools in the nation a lot of people don t really believe he s very conservative meanwhile outside patrick henry college nearly 20 students and alumni from the predominantly conservative school demonstrated against pence and trump to make the point that the christian college did not support the republican ticket i don t want my school and therefore my name associated with trump said erin lester an alumni of the school it s known for being a conservative school and i don t want people to assume that because it s a conservative school that we re trump s dupes basically the protests for the swing area of loudoun county continued out in the street outside patrick henry college s main entrance where students held signs reading phc is not trump country immigrants make america great and for christ and liberty not bigotry and idiocy some locals passed honking in support eventually a car drove by and its angry occupant flipped the bird yelling trump god bless you the student protesters shouted back
