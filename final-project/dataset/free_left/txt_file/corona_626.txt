strong in his opposition to the way that trade deals have favored the interests of wall street and big pharma over workers and main street he saw right from the start the risks of opening up imports from china on world trade organization terms and voted against changes in us tariffs that would allow that what sanders alone has been able to articulate is something that most american workers understand and climate activists get right away china s competitiveness is driven by burning coal to the point that its emissions cancel out everyone else s efforts to tackle climate change the current status quo is not fair it destroys american productive capacity and it is definitely not green who benefits offshoring american companies often through global corporate structures that avoid paying taxes have benefited from the opening to china and so has wall street deals deals deals they have profited on the backs of american workers as sanders has never ceased to point out this should not be confused with fortress nationalism intoxicated by china s apparent successes we have allowed its leaders to define the debate about globalism and nationalism in fact regaining innovation driven manufacturing in america will entail a new globalism cooperating with partners whether in europe or bangalore or guangzho but driven by a common purpose in greening the economy not the tax avoiding exploitative capitalism of offshoring and financialization this isn t just about us it s about workers and citizens everywhere if china itself cannot shift to a different model of growth and development china s workers along with ours will succumb to the catastrophe of unstoppable climate change the importance of this approach is becoming even more obvious this week as we see how the trade policy of the past 30 years has radically weakened our ability to respond to a crisis like coronavirus when american manufacturing capacity is at an all time low and there are thousands of essential goods that aren t manufactured here at all it makes us vulnerable to huge supply chain shocks while sanders has consistently attacked trade deals that sell workers out and benefit big corporate interests he unlike trump also sees that protectionism indiscriminate hikes in tariff barriers is not the solution activist domestic industrial social and economic policies are the route to
