 jeb bush was mere seconds into his speech wednesday informing the world that he s his own man and not his brother or his dad when he did something reminiscent of both he flubbed his line we definitely no longer inspire fear in our enemies the nominal front runner for the republican presidential nomination said at the start of his ballyhooed address the problem is perhaps best demonstrated by this administration s approach to iraq whoa he s going there right into the failure that pretty much destroyed his brother s presidency bush continued reading from his text as if for the first time we ve had 35 years of experience with iran he went on then realized his earlier mistake excuse me iran thirty five years experience with iran s rulers dr freud would have been amused bush leads in the early gop 2016 polls because his name is bush but that name could bring about his downfall as well because his brother s tenure is remembered for misery in iraq and economic collapse try though he did to differentiate himself from george h w bush and george w bush john ellis bush s delivery gave him away when he addressed the chicago council on global affairs luncheon at the fairmont he combined his father s awkward oratory with his brother s mangled syntax and malapropisms like his brother he said nucular instead of nuclear and he hunched over the lectern with both hands on it but instead of exuding folksiness as his brother does he oozed discomfort a top priority he explained is reforming a broken immigration system and turning it into an economic a catalytic converter for sustained economic growth presumably he was reaching for catalyst but instead came up with an automotive emissions control device as we grow our presence by growing our ability to produce oil and gas bush went on we also make it possible to lessen the dependency that russia now has on top of europe russia s dependency on top of europe it was in addition to being backward a delightful echo of his brother s belief that it is hard to put food on your family at another point discussing nato s aggressive stance in the baltics jeb explained that i don t know what the effect has been because you know it s really kind of hard to be out on the road and i m just a gladiator these days so i don t follow every little detail asked about the weakening of nation states in the middle east he admitted i don t have a solution i mean i i i ve read articles you know about whether the 1915 kind of breakout of the middle east and how that no longer is a viable deal bush eschewing teleprompter read his speech quickly and during the question time that followed leaned forward in a chair jacket buttoned and legs spread swigging water with marco rubio s gusto the former florida governor recited his foreign policy credentials such as opening a bank office in venezuela he touted a latin american free trade agreement and noted that where columba and i live is going to be right in the center of the universe of that free trade agreement he can see cuba from his house even the money line of his speech that he s his own man received a distracting grace note when he said i love my brother i love my dad i actually love my mother as well hope that s okay it s unclear who had suggested otherwise i grew up politically i guess in the 80s asserted bush who turned 27 in 1980 bush mimicked some of his big brother s bravado using phrases such as enemies of freedom and tighten the noose and take them out and he defended the surge in iraq but what brought him closest to his kin were the random oddities in his speech he declared that whoever created the terminology bric would have to change the name without explaining that bric referred to emerging economies brazil russia india and china at another point he had trouble coming up with the english name for plan colombia and explained sometimes my mind switches and i apologize he propounded the curious theory that the more tepid the economic growth the less likely nato members are to defend themselves militarily he said that with president obama s pivot to asia the rest of the world wonders am i the pivotee and he described the islamic state leader as the guy that s the supreme leader whatever his new title is head of the caliphate bush admitted that his foreign policy was still in the training phase look the more i get into this stuff there are some things where you just go you know holy schnikes if he keeps talking like this americans may say the same of him twitter milbank read more from dana milbank s archive follow him on twitter or subscribe to his updates on facebook read more jennifer rubin jeb bush dazzles off script paul waldman how to know if jeb bush is really his own man we are a participant in the amazon services llc associates program an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon com and affiliated sites
