advertisement supported by by patrick healy and amy chozick join us for live updates of the republican debate hillary clinton and senator bernie sanders clashed vividly over immigration reform health care and cuba during a contentious debate wednesday as the two democrats appealed to hispanic voters and tried to outdo each other in assailing donald j trump mrs clinton bruised by her surprise loss in the michigan primary a day earlier was on the attack throughout the debate as she sought to undercut mr sanders s momentum before the next round of primaries aiming her remarks at viewers watching on univision a spanish language sponsor of the debate mrs clinton threw his past support for fidel castro and president daniel ortega of nicaragua in mr sanders s face and repeatedly criticized him for opposing a 2007 bill that would have created a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the country illegally we had republican support mrs clinton said we had a president willing to sign it i voted for that bill senator sanders voted against it she refused to let up when mr sanders explained that he thought the guest worker provisions in the bill were akin to slavery mrs clinton argued that she senator edward m kennedy and hispanic groups would never have supported such a bill her broadsides finally became too much for mr sanders when she accused him of supporting vigilantes known as minutemen on the border no i do not support vigilantes that is a horrific statement an unfair statement to make mr sanders said madam secretary i will match my record against yours any day of the week in their final debate before primaries in florida ohio and other states on tuesday the two democrats were a study in contrasts as they made stark appeals to the demographic groups they have come to prize mrs clinton repeatedly aligned herself with the needs and concerns of immigrant families and stuck to her promise to knock down barriers in employment and housing hoping these priorities would inspire hispanics and african americans and deliver her landslide victories in florida and north carolina mr sanders s rallying cries against the rigged economy and establishment politics were aimed at liberals young people working class white voters and independents who could be decisive for him in ohio illinois and missouri his top targets next week he appeared confident to the point of cocky at times claiming at one point that mrs clinton had borrowed from his proposals to make public colleges free thank you for copying a very good idea he said he chortled when mrs clinton accused him of not supporting clean energy ideas and he muttered come on when mrs clinton refused to stop speaking he also showed he could throw a punch such as when mrs clinton questioned the cost of his medicare for all plan saying if it sounds too good to be true it probably is what secretary clinton is saying is that the united states should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesn t guarantee health care to all of our people mr sanders said drawing a stern look from his opponent i do believe in universal coverage she fired back remember i fought for it 25 years ago the debate in miami came just three days after the candidates last face off in flint mich and one day after mr sanders was declared the winner of that state s primary his unexpected victory infused his campaign with excitement and fund raising momentum he was on track to raise 5 million in online donations in the ensuing 24 hours mr sanders s success in michigan seemed to energize him wednesday in countering mrs clinton s attacks on immigration secretary clinton prevailed upon the governor of new york eliot spitzer who wanted to do the right thing and provide driver s licenses to those who were undocumented mr sanders said she said don t do it and new york state still does not do it he also noted that he had supported allowing children from war torn central american countries to enter the united states and asserted that mrs clinton s view was send them back that is something that is not fair about what i said mrs clinton said i did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country on their own very often many of them not making it and when they got here they needed as i have argued for legal counsel due process to make a decision both candidates who consistently praise president obama on most issues vowed to end the mass deportations of his administration they both flatly promised not to deport children mrs clinton projected steeliness throughout the debate and did not seem fazed by her loss in michigan taking comfort in her accumulation of more of the delegates needed to win the democratic nomination she has a steadily growing delegate lead over mr sanders in spite of his successes because her margins of victory have been greater yet she was careful to show that she was not taking the nomination for granted even pushing back against a question about whether she had gotten ahead of herself in assuming she had all but beaten mr sanders i m continuing to work hard for every single vote across our country mrs clinton said i was pleased that i got 100 000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates according to the associated press donald j trump and hillary clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party s nomination for president each candidate sought to be perceived as the more formidable challenger to mr trump the republican front runner mrs clinton argued that mr trump was promoting un american views and promised to take every opportunity to criticize him later she mocked his centerpiece proposal to build a very tall wall right a beautiful tall wall mr sanders argued that he could convince democratic party leaders and elected officials that bernie sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat donald trump but mrs clinton and mr sanders both sidestepped a direct question about whether they thought mr trump was a racist given his hostile comments about mexicans and muslims and his initial reluctance to disavow the support of the former ku klux klan leader david duke mr sanders said he was confident that americans would not elect mr trump and pointed out that mr trump had been a leading skeptic of whether mr obama was born in the united states and eligible to be president mr sanders noted that no one had challenged him over the fact that his own father was born in poland nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate mr sanders said maybe that has to do with the color of my skin both democrats saw the debate as an opportunity to reach latino voters not only in florida but also in arizona california illinois and other states with large hispanic populations asked whether he stood by his positive statements in the past about mr castro and mr ortega mr sanders sought to put the remarks in context but did not disavow them mrs clinton pounced i just couldn t disagree more she said if the values are that you oppress people you disappear people you imprison people even kill people for expressing their opinions for expressing freedom of speech that is not the kind of revolution of values that i ever want to see anywhere mrs clinton was introspective when asked why many americans do not trust her obviously it s painful for me to hear that she said i am not a natural politician in case you haven t noticed like my husband or president obama she added i just have to do the best i can and hope that people see that i am fighting for them many of the questions to mrs clinton were provocatively worded especially those from jorge ramos of univision after playing a video in which the mother of an american killed in benghazi libya questioned whether mrs clinton had told the truth about the attacks there mr ramos bluntly asked did you lie to them mrs clinton was taken aback she s wrong she s absolutely wrong she said when we had information we made it public but then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it mr ramos also pressed mrs clinton on whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted on charges related to her use of a private email server as secretary of state at first she ignored the question but when the moderators followed up she dismissed it curtly oh for goodness that is not going to happen she said i am not even answering that question advertisement
