 several key nuances were lost in donald trump s boasts about his fundraising haul on tuesday nearly 24 hours after the debate ap photo while the gop nominee raised big money after debate he may not be able to use much of it by kenneth p vogel 09 29 2016 05 16 am edt waukesha wis donald trump s campaign was desperate to change the subject after his shaky debate performance on monday and it found just the story to do it a record fundraising surge that trump says was powered by small donors proving he actually got a boost from the debate but a closer examination of the claims around trump s fundraising surge which the campaign says yielded 18 million in the 24 hours after the debate through online donations and a big donor phone bank suggests the haul might not be quite as significant to trump as he and his campaign have made it out to be advertisement based on the information voluntarily released by the campaign it s unclear how much of the windfall will go to campaign versus the republican national committee or how much of the total came in pledges as opposed to actual cash nor is it clear how much came from the small donors about whom trump boasts some of those answers won t be revealed until the middle of october when the campaign and its joint fundraising committees with the rnc will be required to file financial reports with the federal election commission but other details including the amount raised from small donors in the 24 hours after the debate may never be independently verifiable thanks to the nuances of campaign finance reporting requirements those nuances were lost in trump s boasts about the fundraising haul during a tuesday evening speech in melbourne florida nearly 24 hours after the debate by yousef saba today we had something where i understand through largely small donors and some others we had the biggest day we ve ever had trump told the crowd in a humid airplane hangar because of the success last night of the debate they raised almost 18 million today can you believe it 18 million that s a lot 18 million in one day think of that and that was largely because of last night trump carried the theme through wednesday night boasting to a raucous crowd at the waukesha county expo center about the 54 million he d put into his campaign and adding but we re being helped by the small donors and yesterday because of the tremendous success of the debate we raised almost 18 million in one day if trump s post debate fundraising haul is anywhere near 18 million it would be a major boost for a campaign that has lagged behind that of hillary clinton in fundraising and advertising in fact trump s campaign has said it plans to spend the cash infusion on a planned 140 million ad buy and it would stand as the biggest single day fundraising haul by far of trump s campaign though it s not possible to track such tallies precisely but it s become an increasing political tactic to embellish selective details about fundraising especially small donor fundraising to enhance the appearance of grass roots momentum at critical moments of a campaign clinton used the tactic during her unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign and again after her party s nominating convention in july her campaign boasted that in the 24 hours after she accepted the democratic presidential nomination it raised 8 7 million which at the time stood among the biggest single day fundraising tallies a trump campaign source said that only 5 million of the 18 million haul came in online donations made directly to the campaign which tend to be the types of donations most driven by organic grass roots energy online donations also usually are smaller and can be more useful in the long term since the donors who give them can continue to contribute without hitting the cap on donations of 2 700 for the primary election and 2 700 for the general election 2016 by kenneth p vogel and alex isenstadt the remaining 13 million came through phone call solicitations made as part of a campaign call day in which about 100 major donors and campaign insiders including trump s children and his vice presidential running mate mike pence made telephone solicitations from the campaign s headquarters in manhattan s trump tower those donations would most likely be larger since they would come from donors who either had a track record of writing big checks or who knew the person making the call the campaign source said that the call day donations were about equally split between the campaign and a joint fundraising committee called trump victory that includes the trump campaign the rnc and about a dozen state party committees trump victory can accept checks as large as 449 500 making it easier to bring in huge sums of cash quickly but no matter how large the check to trump victory only 2 700 can go to the trump campaign with the rest going to the rnc and the state parties steve mnuchin the trump campaign s finance chairman would not say how much of tuesday s haul would end up in the campaign s coffers but he pointed out that having a well funded rnc also helps the campaign from our standpoint we were raising money for the joint fundraising committee and the campaign it s all very important because it s all going to support either the ground campaign or more media said mnuchin 2016 by kenneth p vogel he participated in the call day and issued a statement afterward declaring that with this kind of energy and generous support behind us we are going to have president donald j trump in the white house mnuchin would not comment however on how much of the money raised during the call day was in the form of pledges versus actual cash donations we have a very high collectability rate on any pledges we get he said we are at close to 100 percent but a leading republican fundraiser said that with call days there s often a difference between pledged and collected contributions so finance professionals are always skeptical when a call day is included in any explanation additionally gop finance professionals have raised concerns about the return on investment from trump s small dollar fundraising operation which is run largely through a san antonio based web design firm with no previous political experience that has been paid 12 5 million by the trump campaign the online fundraising effort has relied on heavy spending to rent email lists and place digital ads soliciting small donations sometimes producing duplicative or poorly targeted results and on wednesday trump s campaign sent three very similar emails from his son eric trump boasting that the campaign was on path now to shatter a 48 hour fundraising record and you could help us do it friend missing out on the latest scoops sign
