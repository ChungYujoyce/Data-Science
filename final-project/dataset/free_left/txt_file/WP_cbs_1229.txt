watch cbsn live by grace segers may 4 2020 2 45 pm cbs news two of the most progressive members of congress are introducing legislation on monday to mobilize the federal government to purchase or manufacture more personal protective equipment ppe as lawmakers ponder next steps in responding to the continued fallout of the coronavirus pandemic senator bernie sanders and congressman ro khanna are unveiling the emergency medical supplies procurement act which would provide an additional 75 billion to the federal emergency management agency the money would allow the trump administration to manufacture or purchase ppe such as hospital gowns and masks ventilators testing reagents and compounds approved medication treatments and any other necessary medical supplies or hospital infrastructure it s incomprehensible to most americans why our country can t produce masks why we can t produce swabs khanna said in an interview with cbs news referring to the shortfall in ppe in hospitals across the country the greatest economy in the world should be able to produce these things khanna who is a member of the white house s bipartisan legislative task force to reopen the government said he was able to speak to vice president mike pence and president trump about his ideas he said this bill was not partisan but an act of good faith that provides the president with significant funds if the president has 75 billion he can easily produce the masks and the gloves and the sanitizers that are necessary to keep people safe khanna said mr trump has sparred with some governors claiming some states have requested more ppe and ventilators than they need the legislation proposed by sanders and khanna would require the president to respond to state requests for health care requests as quickly as possible using authorities provided by the defense production act dpa national emergencies act and stafford act khanna said this legislation would alleviate the pressure on states he pointed to california governor gavin newsom negotiating a 1 billion deal to purchase masks from china the dpa allows the president to compel corporations to produce items needed to aid the country s response to the pandemic congress already allocated 1 billion to the dpa in previous coronavirus relief legislation but sanders and khanna argue this is not enough to compensate for supply shortages it is unacceptable that the president still has not utilized the defense production act to aggressively demand that the private sector manufacture the equipment and products that our medical personnel patients and frontline workers desperately need sanders told cbs news sanders expressed frustration that the u s is testing fewer than 200 000 people per day as well as shortfalls in ppe and ventilators across the country trump s inaction is literally sacrificing the lives of medical professionals and patients throughout this country since trump has failed to act congress has got to step in to address this crisis sanders said the text of the legislation says the president shall fulfill to the greatest extent possible and with due urgency according to need all requests from states for critical health care resources that are required to support medical providers treat patients or promote the general well being in response to or to recover from the outbreak of covid 19 the legislation also seeks to prevent mr trump s family or members of his administration from personally benefiting from this funding by including oversight and accountability provisions the text of the legislation says no funds will be made available to any person who is a federal elected official or serving in a senior executive service position or to any entity that is controlled in whole or in part by a federal elected official or serving in a senior executive service position the bill also requires the secretary of health and human services and the administrator of the fema to submit a weekly report on the requests by states and the implementation of resources to state and local governments the united states is the richest country in the world there is no excuse for our medical professionals and essential workers not to have the masks gloves gowns and tests they need to keep safe treat their patients and stop the spread of this deadly pandemic sanders said states and cities should not be forced to bid against each other for scarce and overpriced medical equipment it is unclear when the next round of coronavirus relief legislation will be negotiated and finalized the
