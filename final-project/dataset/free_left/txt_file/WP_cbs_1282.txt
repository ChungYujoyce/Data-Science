o keefeasked him on monday during an interview aboard his campaign bus in waterloo iowa here are some highlights from his answer 1a and 1b he said would be german chancellor angela merkel or french president emmanuel macron who in many ways i think is emerging as a kind of successor generation leader in central europe i think we need to shore that up and have that conversation his second world leader would be iranian president hassan rouhani we need to engage with iran he said now i wouldn t do it without some kind of sense that there was momentum but if our respective diplomatic relationships could produce even the smallest incremental trust building measure i think that would justify a conversation about how we could cause tensions in that region to go down rather than up asked if that means he d be willing to lift sanctions on rouhani and other world leaders he said i think we could find a way if the focus of u s policy were to de escalate rather than ratchet up tension number 3 nayib bukele the president of el salvador someone who represents a part of the country the world central america where we have a lot at stake and fourth would be chinese president xi jinping the china challenge is going to be one of the dominant issues for the united states in my lifetime buttigieg said adding later that i think we need to have a very frank conversation about ways
