from homelessness and extreme poverty to become first generation college students the donors are longtime supporters of bay area nonprofit students rising above sra and the money is intended to eliminate student debt for the graduates of the scholarship program these donors are also passionate about tackling the issue of student debt on a recent zoom call sra ceo elizabeth devaney shared the news with the program s alumni and read a short letter from the donors people lent us a hand and now we are able to extend a hand to these young people not to change who they are but to reveal who they are the letter reads we believe it is important to leave the world a better place than we came into it to that end we have decided to pay off all student loans for the 400 rising star alumni to date i am one of the 400 alumni who will benefit when i was accepted into the program the summer before my senior year of high school sra advisers stepped in to guide me through the college admissions process while i was in college sra was a pivotal support system and at times played the role that my parents refugees from afghanistan were unable to because they were still adjusting to a new life in america i was 10 years old in 2003 when my family immigrated to the u s from a young age i knew i wanted to be a journalist i was inspired by my father a polio survivor and former radio reporter in kabul reporting on the taliban s human rights abuses in 1996 nearly cost my father his life a grenade thrown into the terrace of my childhood home and meant to silence my father instead killed my grandfather my dad who now lives vicariously through my work still has pieces of shrapnel from that grenade on his leg and back once in america my parents constantly stressed the importance of school watching my mother work a minimum wage job while attempting to learn english motivated me to pursue higher education when i had to decide between staying with my family in california and moving 3 000 miles to george washington university in washington d c sra stepped in to help me make an emotional and business decision sra s advisers booked flights home on holidays answered my questions about registering for classes and prepared me for internship interviews in addition to paying for portions of my tuition sra also purchased basic necessities like a laptop and printer bed sheets and winter clothes it s the same role sra has played for hundreds of other students including lorna contreras when contreras first heard about sra in 2004 she was a high school senior cleaning homes in the bay area in the classroom she found a safe haven from the realities of her life in sra she found a second pillar to her family during her third year at st mary s college of california where she was studying politics contreras said her father once captured as a prisoner of war while fighting for indigenous rights in guatemala had a complete mental breakdown which left him with frontal lobe dementia that s when i was going to drop out of school contreras said adding i thought school isn t important right now and i m just going to start working because there s no income at the house but sra brought in all the ammunition contreras said and challenged her to not give up on school she graduated with a politics degree and a minor in spanish contreras has roughly 15 000 left in student loans after going on to complete a masters in psychology in 2013 contreras now sra s director of student programs said she s thankful for the opportunity to pass down that hope and belief to future sra students the desire to give back to the community is one of many reasons dr zachary tabb chose to become a pediatrician in 2003 growing up with a single mother who worked three jobs and often relied on collecting recyclable items or sewing quilts ambitions for college kind of felt like that was something other people did tabb said then a last minute decision to apply for sra changed the trajectory of his life tabb who grew up in las gatos and never met his father because his parents divorced before he was born said he often reflects upon his impoverished upbringing there s almost a self fulfilling prophecy that you can t break free of the cycle of poverty tabb said i really think that is a generational consequence he added after finishing his undergraduate degree tabb spent more than two years as a peace corps volunteer in uganda and became interested in medicine he graduated from medical school from brown university with over 160 000 in loans and currently works as the resident pediatrician at the baylor college of medicine in houston tabb said he was absolutely shocked to hear that the weight of his student loans will soon be lifted these contributions this kind of compassion tabb said has indescribable effects and breaks the cycle of poverty every student who sra serves in the nine san francisco bay area counties comes from low to moderate income levels and more than 60 live below the federal poverty line the organization also leverages a network of over 250 partner companies to provide students with summer internships which results in nearly 80 of graduates landing jobs within a year sra which is now 20 years old began with about 10 to 15 students each year and has grown to help about 65 to 70 students a year the majority of sra students graduate with an average of 7 000 in debt a figure that is much lower than the national average of nearly 40 000 devaney said she credits the organization s focus on financial literacy for helping keep the averages down but many sra students still rack up debt due to postgraduate studies for devaney the award to the alumni comes at an important time as the world battles the coronavirus public health pandemic she said sra students who are inured to characteristics like grit and determination and resilience can now step up and lead devaney said the most valuable takeaway from anonymous donors helping students with college loans is that it helps restore faith in humanity there are those who are out there rooting for us devaney said this is something that is going to help change lives and i guarantee you the students will pass it on first published on may 19 2020 12 03 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the know get the latest breaking news delivered straight to
