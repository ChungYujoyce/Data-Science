 all of the attention on control of congress the individual races and president donald trump s campaign activity has obscured a much bigger story at play in american politics we re on the cusp of the house changing hands for a third time in the last 12 years 2006 2010 2018 another way to look at it this could very well be the fourth straight change midterm election where at least one chamber of congress flips 2006 2010 2014 2018 we haven t seen this level of volatility since after world war ii when control of the house changed hands several times in the 1940s and 1950s and like after world war ii and the great depression this country is in the midst of a political realignment that has created this volatility the contested 2000 presidential election 9 11 the iraq war the great recession obama trump we don t know if democrats will win control of congress in tonight s election although they re the strong favorites to regain the house but we do know how volatile and divided our politics have become and whichever party wins tonight will have just won a battle and not the war in these politically volatile times for all of tonight s central questions which party controls congress does trump get rebuked or rewarded just how big is that gender gap this might be the most fascinating one of all what was the better political bet in 2018 playing to the base or to the middle trump and gop strategists made it all about that base just see sean hannity and rush limbaugh at last night s rally with trump in missouri but democrats especially in the senate races in red purple states like arizona indiana missouri montana and tennessee focused their messages on the middle of the electorate maybe the best example of this base versus middle divide is the 50 50 senate race in arizona between democrat kyrsten sinema whose message was aimed at the middle and republican martha mcsally who was playing more to the trump base in this traditional gop state be sure to see how independents break in arizona and nationally if democrats are winning them by more than 10 points our nbc marist poll of arizona had sinema up more than 20 points among indies it s hard to see how they aren t going to win across the country on the other hand if those independent margins are smaller and if gop turnout and enthusiasm are through the roof then that base approach will have been the smarter play one of the hallmarks of trump s two years in office is how he s focused almost exclusively on his base the 40 percent to 45 percent of voters who approve of his job at the expense of the rest of the electorate including the middle does the middle still exist in american politics or is it all about that base we ll find out tonight here s a related question on our mind which democrats will have more success the dems in red purple states who played more to the middle like sinema in arizona claire mccaskill in missouri and phil bredesen in tennessee or the dems in red purple states who made bolder appeals to their base stacey abrams in georgia andrew gillum in florida and beto o rourke in texas as for the battle for the house we re re upping our road map how democrats get to the net 23 seats they need to win control of congress first thing s first democrats aren t playing defense very many places and they can probably afford to and expect to lose a few seats here are six they currently hold and are most likely to lose in order of final poll closing time all times et nh 1 8pm open previously held by carol shea porter d eddie edwards r v chris pappas d seat went 48 46 for

senate don t forget about the gubernatorial contests as well as the races for state legislature currently republicans hold 33 governorships democrats hold 16 and there s one independent bill walker in alaska who dropped out of his race this election cycle features 36 gubernatorial contests giving democrats the chance to pull even with republicans in governorships particularly in key presidential battleground states like florida iowa michigan nevada ohio and wisconsin nbc s alex seitz wald voters may reject president donald trump and the nationalist vision for america he s championed in the closing weeks of the race or they could signal assent by returning republicans to power in both chambers of congress trump is not on the ballot but the president has explicitly sought to make this election a referendum on his agenda as he campaigns for republicans across the country i need you to vote for a republican house and a republican senate so we can continue this incredible movement
