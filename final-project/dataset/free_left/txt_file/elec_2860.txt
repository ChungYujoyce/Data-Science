advertisement supported by by jess bidgood and alan blinder northport ala sheila hayes has followed every twist and turn in the allegations against roy s moore the republican senate candidate who has been accused of sexual misconduct involving teenage girls but ms hayes a community college instructor and a democrat felt a jolt of unease when she watched the lawyer gloria allred speak at a news conference where a woman accused mr moore of misconduct i like gloria allred but when i saw her on tv i sort of cringed because i knew what people in alabama would say said ms hayes who was wearing a button for mr moore s democratic opponent doug jones she said she believed the women in short order ms allred who has represented women in prominent sexual harassment cases for decades became a character in the scrappy contest that will be decided dec 12 as mr moore has tried to deny the allegations and undermine his accusers he and his supporters have vilified ms allred they have raised doubts about the evidence she has presented and have played on some voters entrenched mistrust of out of state figures by targeting a lawyer known for stepping into the limelight i think she has provided a convenient excuse for republicans to look the other way and that s unfortunate elizabeth beshears a republican communications consultant said because roy s camp has turned this conversation into being about gloria allred she added the stories of the accusers are getting buried for mr moore a former state supreme court chief justice who was effectively removed from the bench twice over debates about the ten commandments and same sex marriage the tactics are those of political preservation in the closing weeks of a race he was favored to win but the contest to fill the seat that jeff sessions held before he became united states attorney general was upended when nine women accused mr moore of unwanted advances or sexual assault one woman beverly young nelson made her claim at a news conference in new york alongside ms allred mr moore s campaign began attacking ms allred before the news conference even began when the campaign chairman bill armistead called her a sensationalist leading a witch hunt in the weeks since mr moore has used his twitter account to point to ms allred s refusal thus far to allow an independent party to review a yearbook belonging to ms nelson which she and ms allred said contains an inscription written by mr moore around the time of the alleged assault in the 1970s good morning alabama mr moore wrote friday in what has become almost a daily ritual day 17 of attorney gloria allred s refusal to turn over her fake yearbook for third party examination in making ms allred a foil political strategists said mr moore s campaign had made a calculation tied to a fundamental of alabama politics voters recoil when they sense someone from out of state is seeking to push them one way or another i don t know that you could say she s toxic but she has a reputation of being a self promoter and a lawyer who shows up with high visibility clients said john d saxon an employment and discrimination lawyer in birmingham who was the chairman of bill clinton s presidential campaigns in alabama the same way people in alabama don t want outsiders telling them how to vote there s a resentment for that kind of person and frankly for that kind of lawyer sometimes indeed mr moore s overarching strategy besides stoking conservative anger on issues like transgender rights seems to clash with other national figures including mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader who called on him to drop out of the race late this week after a character from jimmy kimmel s late night show disrupted a church campaign event for mr moore the candidate urged mr kimmel to come to alabama himself despite d c and hollywood elites bigotry towards southerners jimmy we ll save you a seat on the front pew mr moore wrote on twitter but ms allred has been the target of the campaign s ire for longer ms allred 76 has never shied away from controversy and became one of the country s best known lawyers by taking on high profile cases relating to abortion gender based discrimination and sexual harassment beginning in the 1970s in a telephone interview ms allred brushed aside criticisms of her involvement in alabama and her influence on the senate race democrats and the democratic party don t tell me who i should have as a client and what my strategy should be nor are republicans permitted to tell me she said i mean they can opine but i don t take my directions from any party or any person the only person i serve is my client i m a civil rights attorney i m a women s rights attorney ms allred said rights for women and minorities are often not popular those who advocate for them are sometimes castigated most of the complaints about ms nelson s allegations come back to the yearbook that spawned a mix of amateur analyses and conspiracy theories mr moore and his allies have repeatedly questioned the veracity of the inscription claiming there are discrepancies between mr moore s alleged signature and other words that follow in the inscription ms allred who has refused repeated requests by the new york times and other news organizations to examine ms nelson s yearbook said that she would only release it to congressional investigators if a hearing is convened about the allegations against mr moore a hearing she said would offer a dignified venue where there is testimony that accompanies the examination of all of the evidence pressed over whether she could guarantee the authenticity of the yearbook ms allred did not answer directly she would not comment about whether she had commissioned her own review of the yearbook the most important witnesses in all of this are beverly and roy moore ms allred said why won t he subject himself to cross examination and testimony under oath glen browder an emeritus professor at jacksonville state university and a former democratic congressman from alabama said mr moore and his supporters have seized on ms allred and the yearbook to bolster their arguments that allegations against mr moore are an unfair attack other experts said many voters had already made up their minds the distrust of the allegations was already there said joseph smith the chairman of the political science department at the university of alabama and some women in alabama are simply grateful ms allred has taken up the cause when i see gloria allred and she s beside someone it verifies their creditably said sheila gilbert the chairwoman of the calhoun county democratic party as the lingering questions about the yearbook have become fodder for conservative outlets including breitbart news where the executive chairman stephen k bannon is a vocal supporter of mr moore they have also begun to exasperate some supporters of mr jones frankly i think it should be produced said u w clemon a retired federal judge who supports mr jones any corroboration that will put to rest a claim that he does not know this woman would be very helpful for julie lowe 56 a bartender the doubts about ms allred whom she finds fishy were enough to cut through her confusion over the allegations against mr moore i think it s kind of trying to sabotage him ms lowe an independent voter said he ll most likely get my vote ms allred for her part said that the attacks reflect attitudes about accusations of sexual misconduct and that she did not regret the approach she has taken is it popular in some places for some people in alabama to care about women over the denial of a powerful man she said maybe not o k but beverly is now empowered the women are empowered there s no going back now
