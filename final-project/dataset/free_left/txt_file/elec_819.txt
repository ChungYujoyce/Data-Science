 2016 joe biden s decision whether to run for president may rest more on his wife than anyone else by edward isaac dovere 09 09 2015 05 10 am edt getty a month ago vice president joe biden was sitting in his office in the west wing talking to an old friend who d come to visit jill wants me to run he said advertisement monday in pittsburgh when a man in a crowd of steelworkers called out to him to run biden called back i ve got to talk to my wife about that for joe biden the decision whether to run for president pivots more than anything else on one person jill people tight in the biden circle were surprised how much he suddenly made it about her even as an offhand joke both joe and jill are working to detangle a mess of emotion and grief and dreams and very real sense of hillary clinton s vulnerability one minute he s talking about how ridiculously he thinks clinton s handling her campaign the next his voice is cracking his eyes drifting off as he thinks about the death of his son earlier this summer less in the public eye jill biden s just as torn up some days she s the vice president s rock some days she s in even worse shape beau biden was her adopted son but he was her son as if she d been there the day he was born and every day since hillary clinton emails by gabriel debenedetti whatever the final decision about running for president is she ll be the one to make it with the vice president not be told about the decision not direct the decision they ll make it together she s been a no but she s also spent 40 years in love with a man who s dreamed about being president every day they ve been together she knows how much this means to him this isn t the usual reluctant spouse of a presidential candidate clich even most of the people who talk to the vice president regularly haven t talked to jill biden for months and they say they don t know where her mind is and wouldn t dare guess from their conversations with biden they don t think the vice president has any kind of final decision from her himself or that either is anywhere close to getting to one anyone saying they know what she s thinking is speculating said her communications director james gleeson but he acknowledged that the potential run is very much on her mind she has always believed that her husband would make an excellent president gleeson said she will continue to support the vice president in his career as he has always supported dr biden in hers on wednesday in michigan she ll get a taste of what running would be like as the vice president continues his own flirtation exploration trips around the country she ll get her own chance to test out her sea legs traveling with president barack obama to michigan for an event on her signature issue community college and a chance to be out on the stump in a state that just might prove critical in both a primary and general election race she ll get a lot of time out and about with the president touring the michigan technical education center and speaking ahead of him at macomb community college in the afternoon the trip s been planned for weeks part of a multiday messaging swing that the president s doing around community colleges and workforce training jill biden usually doesn t come up much at the white house but there s some amusement in the building that this trip came together right in the middle of the biden maybe for president boomlet iran deal by nahal toosi dr biden is a tremendous tremendous asset to this effort said white house domestic policy adviser cecilia mu oz in a call with reporters discussing the trip just as an email to supporters went out from obama in which he called biden my favorite community college instructor she s already started the new semester back teaching at northern virginia community college unlike the vice president who s been feeling out a wide circle of advisers political friends and potential supporters jill biden s barely talked to anyone about what she s thinking she s had a few preliminary conversations with staff and close advisers about what a presidential run would mean for her but that s about it she s worried about making sure the vice president s in good enough shape she s worried about making sure their grandchildren are all right that s part of what s been so hard for the vice president as he s been trying to sort through his own mixed thoughts if she says run is she saying it because she knows he wants it if she says don t run is she saying it to be protective of him if she says she can handle it can she really handle it does she really think he can they re tap dancing around each other feeling each other out people who ve talked to them say she got on the road after beau biden s death more quickly than the vice president did heading to alabama to christen the uss gabrielle giffords and taking an eight day trip through asia to promote women s empowerment in korea vietnam and laos on that trip was her former chief of staff cathy russell now the state department ambassador at large for global women s issues who in the super tight knit biden circle is married to former obama national security adviser tom donilon the brother in law of mike donilon the biden adviser most deeply involved in the presidential deliberations who s the one most actively in favor of jumping in the bidens are always talking about each other in public and in private he sees her as the cornerstone of the family the one he respects for holding them all together while he was a u s senator riding amtrak back and forth to wilmington and running around the country campaigning he s deferential to her when he talks about whether he can handle the race he s talking about that as a question that he s not answering alone they re trying to find the answer together wednesday isn t the first time jill biden has done the community college tour with obama most recently she was with him and the vice president in tennessee in january to announce the white house s free tuition proposal and she spent the 2012 reelection year doing a five state community college to career bus tour this trip is different and as soon as it was planned with all the political chatter going people involved knew it was going to be read for hints and tea leaves sometimes a trip with the president to a swing state to talk up a base issue is just that nothing more gleeson said dr biden is back in the classroom and back out on the road on behalf of the administration he said to lift up the importance of community colleges to america s
