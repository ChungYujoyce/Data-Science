the evolving counterintelligence challenges facing the u s priestap now a centennial fellow with georgetown university s walsh school of foreign service explains how nation state adversaries are extending their reach beyond traditional espionage channels to target diplomatic military business and academic sectors to collect intelligence on u s targets priestap explains why the lack of immediacy that is characteristic of gradual espionage efforts means some of the damage it can cause is undetected and tells morell why the academic sector may be particularly vulnerable to the theft of secrets here are some of the highlights the full transcript is below intelligence matters bill priestap correspondent michael morell producer olivia gazis jamie benson michael morell bill welcome to intelligence matters it is great to see you and it s great to have you on the show bill priestap thank you for having me on michael morell i think this is a very important episode because we re going to talk about a topic about which many people don t have a good understanding and it s an important topic and it s the counterintelligence threat to our country but before we get to that i want to ask you a few questions about your background and about your career okay bill priestap okay michael morell you spent 21 years at the fbi how did you end up there bill priestap actually michael before i answer that if i may for your listeners i just want them to know that you know as much about or actually you know more about national security than anybody i ve ever met and so it s a real pleasure to be here today and talking to you michael morell well thanks i would challenge your predicate about me knowing more but it s great to have you here bill priestap how did i end up at the fbi i wish i could say i was one of those young people who knew exactly what they wanted to do when they grew up i was not one of those kids instead the only thing i knew for certain is that i love sports but i actually michael morell where d you grow up where d you grow up bill priestap i grew up in michigan michael morell okay you re not a michigan fan are you bill priestap i am michael morell oh no bill laugh i m an ohio state fan this is never going to work bill priestap now that i did not know about you michael laughter i question my judgment on getting on here but the long and short of it is i wasn t a particularly good athlete but again i so love sports so what did i do after graduating from college i went into coaching and i was a high school and col lege football coach that said i also wasn t sure that i wanted to spend the rest of my working life in sports and so i also went back to school and i earned a law degree and a masters in business in effect i was just trying to keep my options open i was at the university of michigan with the football program when michael morell oh this is getting laugh worse actually bill priestap when i met an fbi agent and the fbi agent absolutely loved his job and it basically enticed me to start looking into the fbi and the more i looked into it the more intrigued i became of it and the other thing i did is i went to the head football coach at the time it was a man by the name of lloyd carr and i let him know that i was having some second thoughts about making a career in the field of athletics and to my surprise he encouraged me to pursue the fbi and i thank him for that to this day the only thing i ll say though is that the year after i left michigan they won the national championship in football laugh and so i never got to be a part of that national championship effort but in the end i think it all worked out for me michael morell can you walk us bill through your career your initial training the different issues on which you worked the responsibilities you had as an officer as an agent i guess is what you guys would call it bill priestap sure so let me start with training i like all fbi agents began my career at the fbi academy in quantico virginia and what do they do there they teach you how to be an agent and so i learned all kinds of things from a variety of investigative techniques how to interview and interrogate people how to drive fast and safely how to shoot a gun how to collect evidence so on and so forth a whole variety of things i found the environment just really really stimulating i love to learn and i was being exposed to things that i had no experience in it s also a pretty secluded place and they keep you really busy and so you re able to really focus on why you re there and again just by and large it was a wonderful learning experience for me i want to make clear i didn t find it fun at the time laugh but when i looked back on it i find it extremely extremely valuable michael morell so your early assignments bill priestap yep so i guess i basically break my career into thirds and the first third of my career was spent on what a lot of people think of as the traditional fbi investigation so for me that was you know violent crime and organized crime matters and my first office was chicago and that was a wonderful experience as well in that i got exposed to a side of society if you think of it as the underbelly of society that i hadn t really been exposed to thus far and so i learned an awful lot michael morell were you there with congressman mike rogers bill priestap i was not he was there just before me but interestingly he s from my home town and so i ve known him for years and a wonderful man michael morell yeah absolutely bill priestap after 9 11 i was moved over to counterterrorism along with many many other fbi personnel and so the middle third of my career was primarily spent working al qaeda issues from chicago i had gone to fbi headquarters and then on up to new york city where again i worked those counterterrorism matters my first managerial role there i actually had what they call a taskforce squad i won t get into the numbers but it included people from 20 plus different federal state and local organizations michael morell is this the joint terrorism taskforce bill priestap yeah so i had one of the squads on the joint terrorism taskforce but what it really taught me it s hard enough to manage and affect your own people your own organization s people but boy when you re having to be responsible for people from a lot of different organizations let s just say it was a steep learning curve but again another great challenging experience that i look back on very fondly and then t he last third of my career is when i got into the counterintelligence field and i spent my years working that topic both in new york city and in washington d c michael morell so bill how tough is it to get a job at the bureau are there many more applicants than there are positions how difficult bill priestap let me start off with it can t be too tough laugh because i got in i don t know exactly what the numbers are but in things i ve read i ve read that somewhere between like 5 and 6 of applicants end up getting accepted so the long and short of it is there s a lot more applicants that apply to the organization than actually get accepted michael morell and what makes an applicant stand out what s the difference between a successful applicant and one that s not successful bill priestap no i thank you for asking that because i m asked that by a variety of young people today who are interested in the organization and the first thing i tell them is that they have to excel in whatever it is they re doing so the fbi wants to attract people from all walks of life so it isn t that there s one career or background prior to joining the fbi you know that the fbi is looking for people or applicants to have so again whatever you choose to do please do it well but then secondly if you have a skill that a lot of other people don t have you become even more valuable so sometimes that s speaking a language and which again maybe not a lot of others have today of course a lot of the computer skills that a lot of the young people are developing are so in demand but that includes in demand from organizations like the fbi michael morell because of cybercrime bill priestap oh absolutely but again so sometimes they re after specific and unique skills and that you know can be a mathematical skill or scientific skill it could be a whole variety of things but the other thing that the fbi is always looking for in applicants is a track record of exercising sound judgment and i can remember applying and dealing with the fbi s applicant coordinator and she was assuring me you know that hey if the fbi only hired perfect people they wouldn t exist in other words there aren t any perfect people but by and large have you exercised sound judgment you know through your lifetime in effect and if you ve done that well you re going to be of interest michael morell bill what would you want people to know about the men and women who work at the fbi bill priestap well obviously i m no longer a part of the organization but i can still say i m immensely proud to have had the opportunity to work with the men and women at the fbi that i worked with some of the smartest people that i have ever come across worked at the fbi and helped me on countless matters i like to think of my cohorts at the fbi they re the type of people you d want as a friend they re smart they re trustworthy they re hardworking probably most importantly they re absolutely dedicated to upholding the fbi s mission which is to protect the american people and uphold the constitution michael morell bill what would you say to those americans who think that the fbi is a political organization serving the partisan interest of one party or another bill priestap michael i would just tell them that that was not my experience i was there for 21 years and on not one occasion can i remember somebody s political affiliation coming up in a conversation people don t ask about others political affiliation and people don t advertise what their political affiliation is and i d also emphasize that fbi employees take extremely seriously the obligation to be objective collectors of facts with the key word or one of the key words in that of course meaning objective and if your coworkers ever think you re not being objective in a given investigation operation what have you they will call you out in a millisecond the culture just is not going to tolerate partisanship period michael morell okay bill let s spend the rest of our time talking about the counterintelligence threat so when you use the words counterintelligence threat what do you mean bill priestap what i mean or think of is certain foreign nations efforts to take advantage of or undermine the u s primarily through intelligence or intelligence like activities michael morell and talk a little bit more about that some examples maybe bill priestap yeah so i guess i d start with that at its core i think of counterintelligence being about nation states jockeying or jostling for influence and power in the world and so if you think of it is as just kind of an ongoing never ending competition amongst nations certain nations are doing a variety of things to try to get a leg up on other nations and it really runs the gamut of what those activities can be it can include things like espionage but it can also include things like economic espionage or malign influence it s really a whole gamut of activities michael morell so bill i ve heard you say that the counterintelligence threat has evolved significantly over time walk us through that what was it historically what is it now and why has that evolution occurred bill priestap sure so let me start i guess with what a lot of people refer to as the traditional counterintelligence threat and a lot of people think of that as meaning in effect spy versus spy one nation s spy is trying to get advantage over a nation and obviously the opposite going on as well well what foreign nations intelligence services or spies are after are the non public intentions plans and capabilities of the government that they re focused on and what they figure is if they can get those non public intentions plans and capabilities and share them with their government their government will have a leg up on our government on the world stage well that threat hasn t gone away and i d argue it s as prevalent today as it s ever been in our nation s history but what has happened is foreign nations have decided that hey for us to get the advantages that we want over the u s we just can t rely on our spies our trained intelligence services and the people they recruit we ve got to engage in a whole variety of other activities with a whole variety of other people to achieve a whole variety of other objectives so let me really quickly start with the objectives if in the past on the traditional threat it was about obtaining our state secrets well today the goal is again to gain advantage in any way possible so certainly a military sense a diplomatic sense but also an economic sense a technological sense a scientific sense an information space sense in some cases even an academic sense so the objectives of the adversary have greatly expanded well because the objectives have expanded the people the nation states utilize has expanded in kind and so instead of just using spies in the people they recruit today our adversaries are using people from all walks of life businessmen and attorneys scientists professors students journalists you name it whoever might be able to get access to the things the foreign nations want and then that broad range of people are engaging in a far broader range of activities then again just trying to obtain our state secrets and so it s not just traditional espionage that they re engaging in they re engaging in economic espionage and proliferation activities and malign influence activities and so on and so forth michael morell so bill who are the primary adversaries in this space to the extent that you can talk about it bill priestap sure so i agree with what the last couple of dnis have kind of termed the big four which is china russia iran and north korea and they re not the only adversaries but to me they re the big ones michael morell and how has that changed over time bill priestap oh i think it s changed and it will continue to change over time and if you just think back to the cold war now obviously i was not in government then but it was my understanding that an inordinate amount of the united states intelligence community resources at that time were focused on the soviet union where today frankly we don t have the benefit of being able to utilize an inordinate amount of our resources focused on one country so instead we re focused on a variety of countries michael morell but you mention russia china iran north korea is one of those more worrisome than the other is one of those more effective than the other how do you think about that bill priestap so i guess i think about it this way they re all really worrisome but they are worrisome differently because they excel and focus in different manners in just one kind of side example but north korea what i ve been reading of late they ve really become like expert but new age bank ro bbers targeting financial institutions to obtain in effect moneys and at least some media reports say to advance some of their weapon systems michael morell a lot of ransomware bill priestap yes michael morell cyberattacks bill priestap and like activities but as a result it s an area the north korean government has decided to focus and they ve gotten particularly good at it where others might focus more in different areas and they get very darn good in the areas they re focusing but please make no mistake they are all worrisome to me michael morell bill i d love to have you give us a couple of specific examples of the threats we ve be en talking about and i know that you can only talk about cases that have been made public through indictment or prosecution and maybe we could break those examples down into the traditional threat that you talked about and then maybe the new threat or nontraditional threat so maybe the first traditional would china s hacking of the office of personnel management database fall into that category bill priestap so yes and it s my understanding that some government officials have alluded to the fact that it s china and the chinese state apparatus behind that attack so if we assume that s the case you have a state actor engaging in an operation certainly in my mind to obtain state secrets now in this case it s not the intentions plans and capabilities of the u s government but it was information personal background information about actually in some estimates tens of millions of u s government employees and so obviously that would provide whomever obtained that information an awful lot of insight into u s government workers and i d argue those are state secrets so michael to answer your question that absolutely is an example of what i refer to as the traditional counterintelligence threat michael morell there s also been i think three recent arrests of u s citizens for spying for china including a cia officer and it seems almost that that s becoming more frequent than our arrests and prosecutions of people spying for russia seems the chinese are being very aggressive in that area is that your sense bill priestap yeah i guess i think of it this way that they re certainly getting more aggressive in that area and in that the examples you just mentioned that is kind of the textbook definition of the traditional counterintelligence threat meaning state intelligence services trying to recruit americans to provide state secrets to a foreign nation michael morell so bill some examples of the nontraditional i ve heard you talk about a couple of them over the years and i was hoping you could share a bit about number one the charges brought against iranians in march of 2018 for a widespread hacking campaign bill priestap yes so the department of justice indicted if i recall correctly i think it was around nine iranian citizens who were affiliated with a company based in iran and what these individuals allegedly did they engaged in a long at least months long if not couple years long cyber hacking campaign and th ey targeted it was upwards of hundred plus u s universities a hundred plus universities in tens of foreign countries i want to say and please don t hold me to these numbers but it was something like 40 u s and foreign private sector meaning corporations they targeted as well they targeted the united nations they targeted the department of labor if i recall correctly they targeted government databases of two u s states i mean just wide ranging cyber targeting and there was one estimate i read that they obtained i think it was just from the universities alone over 31 terabytes of information that they obtained from the universities to include as you can imagine gobs of intellectual property meaning sensitive research that those universities were working on it s my understanding that some of the hacking was done on behalf of iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps but that not all of that hacking was done for that and so to me it s almost a perfect hybrid example of both their traditional and nontraditional counterintelligence threat michael morell and then there was in january 2019 multiple charges against huawei bill priestap sure and once again department of justice announced in an indictment in i know it was early 2019 against huawei i don t believe again either this case or in the iranian example those cases have been adjudicated and so all the information in the indictment at this time is simply allegations but it s my understanding that at least one of the indictments involving huawei charged huawei with i think it was theft of trade secret conspiracy among other things and basically it appears that huawei was trying to obtain trade secrets from t mobile usa and it s actually a fascinating case i read the indictment when it came out and it appears that t mobile had this robot that basically tested cellphones and helped improve cellphones before cellphones would be sold to the public and basically the robot would detect problems with the cellphone so they could be corrected so that when the phone was sold it was a better product and then t mobile didn t have as many phones returned to it and of course saved a lot of money because fewer customers were returning defective phones so the bottom line is that this robot was really valuable technology to t mobile well huawei s a chinese company it s the largest telecommunications equipment maker in the world and one of the things it does it makes cell phones so they wanted basically the phone testing robot as well so they first tried to legitimately obtain it they tried to buy it from t mobile t mobile wouldn t sell it to them they then tried to lease it from t mobile t mobile wouldn t lease it once they knew they couldn t legitimately obtain the technology behind the robot they engaged in a months long campaign to steal whatever information they could about the robot because they wanted to recreate it in china for their use they had some access to t mobile usa s lab at least according to the indictment and so they would surreptitiously take measurements of it take photographs send it back to china but at the end they still couldn t obtain everything they wanted about this robot and so what a huawei employee did is he truly broke off an arm of the robot and this robot was located in t mobile s lab he breaks off the arm puts it into his bag and leaves laugh t mobile of course learned about it a couple hours later michael morell the arm was missing laugh bill priestap and confronted the employee but by that time he had gotten it back to wherever he was staying taking photographs of it taking measurements of it sent all that stuff back to china but again just the aggressive brazen relentless nature of the theft is concerning michael morell so bill you see the counterintelligence threat as a very serious threat to our nation bill priestap i do michael morell why bill priestap i guess it all comes down to i see foreign nations chipping away at the united states on a regular basis and let me start with saying that i can t quantify the costs to the u s associated with this threat and please keep in mind that economic espionage is just a piece of the overall threat i ve seen u s governments that say that economic espionage alone costs the u s hundreds of billions of dollars michael morell annually bill priestap i m sorry annually so if you add economic espionage with all the other things that are going on again incalculable damage to the u s and what i guess i hope your listeners will keep in mind is that since 1991 when the soviet union fell the u s has been the sole superpower on the face of the earth what i m trying to get at we have a huge bullseye on our back and if we think for a second that governments in china russia iran north korea that they wake up in the morning and think isn t it terrific that the u s is so prosperous and is the sole superpower well at least in my experience that is not what they wake up doing they wake up trying to say what can they do to take advantage of undermine us what i m trying to again say is we have foreign nations gunning for us and our role in the world every minute of every day michael morell and you ve argued bill that as a society that we have tended to underestimate the counterintelligence threat as say compared to terrorism why bill priestap yes and i believe we do continue to underestimate it in my mind it s because of two main reasons and it s because the threat is nonviolent usually and gradual in nature and let me start with nonviolent whether it s terrorism or gun violence but when we as human beings in effect see blood in the streets see the victims of those activities as human beings we have a visceral reaction to that and want to do everything in our power to ensure it doesn t happen again for whatever reason because counterintelligence again isn t a violent threat usually when we hear about it whether it s in espionage or economic espionage or again malign influence there just isn t that same human reaction that outcry that boy we must prevent you know these type of things from ever happening again and related to that is again the gradual nature of it when someone suffers from an act of violence there s immediate negative impact yet when somebody suffers from a counterintelligence threat let s say a foreign adversary steals cutting edge technology from a u s company today that u s company doesn t feel immediate impact and it s because the information stolen has to be taken back to a foreign nation it has to be studied it has to be understood and only then can it be utilized and it has to be utilized slowly kind of over time so even if it s used to compete in the open market with the u s company it was stolen from it doesn t immediately cut into that u s company s profits but it doesn t mean long term that it can t cut into those profits in a major major way but the long and short of it is the immediacy of impact is not felt it s a very very gradual threat michael morell so bill does this mean that we both as a government and as a private sector uninvest in what we need to do to protect ourselves against the counterintelligence threat bill priestap well i certainly think we can do more and that would include spending more and i often think of this as like an addict meaning like how an addict needs to recover and whether it s alcohol drugs and you name it from what i ve read for an addict to begin to recover they have to first admit that they have a problem and i m just not convinced that enough people in american society have admitted or acknowledged that we have a grave problem on our hands in regards to the nation state or the counterintelligence threat but to me it begins with acknowledging that fact michael morell do you think there s enough knowledge of it within the u s government i mean clearly at the fbi and cia and the intelligence community people get what you re saying bill priestap i think michael that there s more acknowledgement of the gravity of the threat than at any time that i saw in my career so we re absolutely going in the right direction michael morell what about in congress bill priestap in congress absolute acknowledgement michael morell what about the private sector bill priestap far greater awareness in my experience than there was previously but still not to the level that needs to be so think of the larger the more sophisticated more complex an organization it is the greater their understanding but i worry there s so much innovation coming out of smaller companies more startup new companies and to me many of them are not as knowledgeable or if they are knowledgeable about it they re not doing things to take the threat into account michael morell and do you think that the government has a responsibility to help educate the private sector bill priestap absolutely and i know a lot of government components or organizations are already doing that but there s certainly more that can be done michael morell in fact bill evanina s group at the office of the director of national intelligence is actually very aggressive at this bill s an fbi agent bill priestap yep exactly one of the organizations that s doing everything it possibly can to get the word out michael morell and bill if you were in an auditorium with a group of ceos and you were talking to them about this what would you say to them cl early you would talk to them about the threat and the threat to them right but what would you tell them they need to do about it how would you help them think about that bill priestap i guess first i d let them know that this threat isn t some flash in the pan in other words this is a new normal that s going to exist for decades and decades meaning the threat isn t going away and if anything it s likely to only get worse so first and foremost they ve got to take that into account secondly and it s easy for me to sit here and say this because i m not in their shoes but especially for the big public organizations you know that have all the quarterly earnings reports and whatnot i would try to impress upon them that our competitors our nation state competitors and some of the companies that they re competing with that receive support from the foreign governments they re making long term long range decisions to try to position their companies for that longer term success and so i d try to convince our executives that as much as possible while still trying to abide by all the things they have to do with quarterly reports and earnings and whatnot to really try to plan for and position their organizations for long term success so that their organizations can continue to succeed even when the ceos are no longer affiliated in other words they ve retired with the companies michael morell what about college presidents a little bit of a tougher audience in talking to them about the counterintelligence threat bill priestap yeah and i m really glad you ask this because i ve had a number of questions with people in academia about this very topic and there s an esteemed academic actually he s retired from academia now but he s a good friend of mine and he told me a long time ago but his words really stick in my head and he said bill academics their ethos is to share knowledge for the good of mankind and so when you re trying to tell them that maybe they shouldn t do that that can be very very difficult for them to accept well first i want to say that people in academia in my opinion they have as worthy a profession as there is i mean again think of the ethos of trying to improve mankind through the sharing of knowledge but what i d want them to know is that some of the people they re sharing knowledge with are not using what they re learning for the good of mankind even if they tell you that they re going to use it for the good of mankind and what i m talking about is when somebody might take knowledge and utilize it to repress their own people or take given research to improve their military and other intelligence capabilities so again i love what academics are in business to do but not everybody approaches it in my experience in such a pure way michael morell bill thank you so much for taking the time to be with us this has been a fantastic conversation thank you bill priestap my pleasure thank you end of
