watch cbsn live by sophie lewis december 11 2019 5 20 pm cbs news grab a scarf and some gloves and prepare to watch one of the year s best meteor showers the geminids peak this friday december 13 marking the final meteor shower of the decade unlike most meteor showers the origin of the geminids stems from an asteroid rather than a comet the geminid meteor shower occurs every year when the asteroid 3200 phaethon named after the greek myth of pha thon son of the sun god helio passes by the sun leaving behind a dusty trail for earth to pass through according to nasa it s considered one of the best and most reliable annual meteor showers the geminids first appeared in the mid 1800s but were not exciting or noteworthy at the time only producing about 10 20 meteors per hour now 120 bright and fast yellow meteors can be seen per hour under perfect conditions the geminids appear to radiate from the constellation gemini the twins however the constellation is not the source of the meteors and not the only point viewers can look to when searching for them the geminids can be seen at night or early morning across the globe but are strongest in the northern hemisphere the shower is active and impressive all week but will peak the night of friday december 13 into the morning of saturday december 14 unfortunately december s full moon also known as the cold moon occurs just one night prior to the meteor shower which means visibility will be more difficult than usual the moonlight will overpower some of the fainter meteor trails but stronger ones should still be visible according to the american meteor society ams about 20 geminid meteors will be visible per hour compared the 60 or more that could be seen on a night with a less full moon but the dependable shower will definitely still be worth viewing since most of the meteors you will see under such conditions will be bright they will be more colorful and impressive than usual ams said for best viewing allow your eyes about thirty minutes to adjust to the darkness after going outside geminid meteors can be seen in any part of the sky so the direction you face will not change your experience of the shower lie back in a lounge chair away from heavy light pollution and watch the sky for at least an hour according to ams meteor activity waxes and wanes throughout the night be patient and don t forget your blanket first published on december 11 2019 5 20 pm 2019 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the know get the latest breaking news delivered straight to your inbox copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
