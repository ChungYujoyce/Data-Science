for the better part of a decade millions tuned in for a dose of tv bliss with the series downton abbey an english period drama about the upper class crawleys and their working class servants by the time the series ended in 2016 every actor in the cast had become a star which was a challenge for creator julian fellowes when it came time to shoot the downton abbey movie they were doing shows on broadway and movies and series in hollywood and plays in london and god knows what fellowes said and i think that was a logistical nightmare fans will find all their favorite characters upstairs and down preparing and plotting for a royal visit michelle dockery also known as lady mary told correspondent elizabeth palmer over tea that some fans more than fully embrace the imaginary world of downton it s almost like they act around you like you are royalty she said that s what i find very amusing at times they see us and they think we are the characters it comes with the territory of being with a show that is this enormous and that people believe in or want to believe in ground zero of the fantasy is the building which stars as downton abbey highclere castle outside london recently its owner the 8th earl of carnarvon and his wife lady carnarvon were judging a downton themed costume contest where commoners channel their inner aristocrat here public passion is fueling private enterprise for a fee visitors can tour the magnificent rooms and the castle grounds where the crawley family drama unfolds i dare say that the silhouette of highclere is perhaps now more famous than that of buckingham palace said palmer it has become very famous throughout the whole world said lady carnarvon but i wouldn t want to myself in front of her majesty the queen actually word is the queen is a fan as are millions of americans like these who spotted hugh bonneville the actor who plays lord grantham at highclere the appeal of downton abbey bonneville told us is universal i go back to when i first read the first script and these characters popped off the page at me they were engaging and they were vivid and more to the point i wanted to know what happened next it was a page turner but not everyone was initially sold on the show the notion of costume drama certainly in britain was being written off said bonneville we couldn t even get anyone to interview us that didn t last long soon the series was a triumph and its characters household names lesley nicol who plays the cook mrs patmore said the series had changed her life oh blimey in so many ways i don t know how long you ve got but personally professionally ways i couldn t possibly have thought could happen the fact that i support a charity in china which would never have happened if 160 million people in china didn t watch downton abbey allen leech made his name as tom branson the ex chauffeur who marries into the crawley family palmer said you must ask yourself why it has been such a blockbuster success yeah and i still just struggle to find an answer for that leech replied even julian himself struggles to find an answer he says you know it s like lightning in a bottle if he could bottle it he d sell it you know part of the answer is that julian fellowes script created a refuge from our turbulent times a reassuring world where everyone has a place from the lord of the manor to carson the butler played by jim carter it s uncynical carter said there are no men with guns there s no violence it s about romance it s also harks back nostalgically to a time when things felt more settled that s not to say the movie doesn t innovate there are a few new faces including jim carter s real life wife imelda staunton when asked how intimidating it was for her to join the cast s family staunton said to be fair when i arrived it felt very familiar because i have been living with carson for quite some time her character maud bagshaw gets to cross swords with maggie smith s violet crawley you know with maggie if any of us had the lines that she has none of us could deliver them like she does staunton said downton abbey the movie has a bigger budget than the tv series and it shows but it seems money was never the magic ingredient a lot of it is luck said fellowes you luck out and you get the right combinations all down the line and people keep coming back for more and i really think it s as simple as that to watch a trailer for downton abbey click on the video player below for more info story produced by mikaela bufano watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
