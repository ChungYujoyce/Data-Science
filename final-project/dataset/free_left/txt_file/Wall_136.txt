an anti malaria drug whose effectiveness is currently being tested i m not a doctor trump said even as he encouraged people to make use of it if it does work it would be a shame we did not do it early he added reporters asked dr anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases whether he agreed that people should use the drug before its efficacy had been determined even though it can cause significant side effects but trump prevented him from answering trump is still settling scores from the impeachment inquiry and he s doing it out in the open late
