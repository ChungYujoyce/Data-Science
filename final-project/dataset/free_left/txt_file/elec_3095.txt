twitter applied its new manipulated media label for the first time on sunday to a deceptively edited video of former vice president joe biden the video was shared by white house social media director dan scavino and retweeted by president trump the video was the first test of a new policy the social media company implemented march 5 to label tweets that contain manipulated or synthetic media ranging from edited videos to more sophisticated examples known as deepfakes that can fabricate events that never happened in this case the altered video of biden who has surged to the front of the democratic presidential race to face trump in november is based on a speech he gave saturday in kansas city mo it was then shared on twitter by scavino only edited to make it appear as if biden inadvertently endorsed trump for reelection the version of the video shared by scavino showed biden stumbling on a line during a speech then saying excuse me we can only reelect donald trump the other man behind trump s twitter account but the edited video deleted the second part of the former vice president s sentence the whole thing said excuse me we can only reelect donald trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here it s got to be a positive campaign twitter applied the label to scavino s tweet at about 5 p m sunday about 18 hours after scavino shared the video the video had at least 5 million views and more than 21 000 retweets as of sunday evening scavino said on twitter that the tweet was not manipulated and he retweeted another user who said the company was setting a dangerous precedent by labeling the tweet twitter s rollout of the label was not without technical glitches however the label was not showing up when people searched for scavino s tweet though twitter spokeswoman katie rosborough said it was appearing in individuals timelines she added the company is working on a fix the misleading label is one way social media companies are trying to crack down on false and misleading information in 2020 following a 2016 election in which they were widely blamed for allowing incorrect information to circulate on their platforms influencing the election and providing russian trolls and bots with entry into the u s political system but the companies are not acting in tandem and their policies are inconsistent facebook too added a warning to the video on monday morning after it was debunked by one of the company s fact checking partners fact checkers rated this video as partly false so we are reducing its distribution and showing warning labels with more context for people who see it try to share it or already have facebook spokeswoman brittany uter said in a statement as we announced last year the same applies if a politician shares the video if it was otherwise fact checked when shared by others on facebook the company added the label after the biden campaign blasted its handling of falsehoods on sunday night facebook s malfeasance when it comes to trafficking in blatantly false information is a national crisis in this respect biden campaign manager greg schultz said it is also an unconscionable act of putting profit above not just our country but every country facebook won t say it but it is apparent to all who have examined their conduct and policies they care first and foremost about money and to that end are willing to serve as one of the world s most effective mediums for the spread of vile lies twitter s new policy prohibits sharing synthetic or manipulated media that could cause harm but as in this instance the company may apply labels to tweets to help people understand their authenticity or to provide additional context it s rare for twitter to take action against tweets shared by trump even though there have previously been complaints that the president s tweets violate the company s policy twitter has previously taken action against the president s tweets for copyright violations receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy
