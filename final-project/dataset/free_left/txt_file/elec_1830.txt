 off message democrats are freaking out but not hillary clinton s pollster and strategist joel benenson he tells glenn thrush in an interview for politico s off message podcast by glenn thrush 03 14 2016 05 21 am edt updated 03 14 2016 02 54 pm edt politico s glenn thrush speaks with joel benenson about hillary clinton the 2016 elections and more bridget mulcahy joel benenson is a world class worrier but he isn t especially worried about donald trump in the fall trump isn t freaking out just republicans these days democrats panicked by the manhattan mogul s seemingly unstoppable rise in the primaries see him as an ocher ogre capable of undoing president barack obama s legacy and undermining the civility supporting american democracy advertisement trump phobia has infected many people in hillary clinton s extended orbit especially her notoriously jelly kneed donors and they are dutifully fretting over trump s dark alley debate style his promise to napalm the clintons with personal attacks and above all his magical realism appeal to angry rust belt whites benenson the clinton campaign s bearded principal pollster and chief strategist can t even bring himself to pay lip service to trump whom he sees as a one man democratic turnout machine and a turn off switch to moderates in both parties his analysis of the 2016 landscape leads him to the conclusion that trump has virtually no path to the presidency he won t say the same thing about bernie sanders and presents clinton with renewed opportunities in purple states especially north carolina and arizona indeed when i interviewed him for politico s off message podcast on friday the usually easygoing benenson was in a tense and testy mood bracing for an uncertain battle against sanders on tuesday lashing the vermont senator for impugning clinton s character but when i mentioned trump specifically the developer s claim he could swipe new hampshire new jersey new york pennsylvania ohio and the lot from the democrats his charlie brown cloud lifted instantly it s not real a grinning benenson said of trump s repeated claim he can defeat clinton or sanders by wrestling away swing state voters i don t see any state that democrats have won five out of six times or six out of six times that trump you know at face value poses a threat in i just don t see it said benenson who was the top pollster in obama s two successful presidential campaigns what s the evidence of it the evidence of it they ve turned out a lot of people i think he s broken 50 percent in only one state right if you look at the states that democrats have won in five out of the last six presidential contests it adds up to 257 electoral votes it means you only need 13 more to get to 270 if we perform that way other obama alumni including 2008 campaign manager david plouffe are basically on the same page although they think trump s unpredictability coupled with clinton s innate caution as a candidate could cause unexpected problems benenson said he hasn t polled extensively on trump yet but he thinks trump has so antagonized minority voters and turned off moderate whites with his harsh rhetoric and chaotic rallies that clinton might exceed obama s 2012 total of 332 electoral college votes north carolina which obama won narrowly in 08 and lost by 2 percentage points four years later would likely be target no 1 in a clinton trump showdown that s going to be a very problematic state for republicans he said now we played there in 2012 but not a lot the president didn t go into the state we let romney outspend us 5 to 1 off message by politico staff it would be nice to have the luxury of focusing exclusively on trump or better still concocting a game plan against ted cruz the clinton camp s preferred opponent but there s the small matter of clearing aside sanders who has a front runner s online fundraising operation and a terrier with teeth in your leg competitive tenacity that could keep him in the fight until the convention a couple of weeks ago clinton s team was very confident she was close to wrapping up the nomination but when i asked benenson to look ahead to tuesday s big five state contest he hit the basic talking points she was ahead by 215 pledged delegates a bigger lead in that category than obama ever enjoyed in 08 and he demurred when i asked whether clinton would emerge with a substantial net delegate gain for the night substantial he said there are a lot of delegates like i said if there are 867 out there i don t know how we ll be measuring substantial by the end of the night and i can t forecast it because some of these states are closer than others like everybody else benenson was a bit blindsided by sanders stunning win in michigan last week brooklyn s data team predicted a 5 point clinton win public pollsters had sanders losing by three or four times that margin moreover it s no secret that he has struggled along with the candidate herself to sharpen clinton s sprawling competence and policy mastery platform into a compact inspirational bumper sticker message to compete with sanders anti wall street crusade reports of friction between him and the clintons have been overstated he told me you know she s been on the road more and i m here more in new york and brooklyn said benenson the highest ranking member of clinton s team who hadn t worked with her on previous campaigns but i think we ve gotten to know each other more we talk very frankly she knows i speak my mind i m somebody who does and i think that works for her i like it when we re doing debate prep and there s a lot of back and forth and you re hearing her talk she s often the one who comes up with the best things because they come from what she s believed for a long time and i think it s a pretty powerful place to be i think this is a woman who knows who she is knows why she s doing this benenson is protective of clinton and has not surprisingly cultivated a not inconsiderable disdain for sanders and his sharp elbowed team he s been in the free media been leveling very and the whole campaign has been leveling very explicit attacks on secretary clinton he s tried to impugn her character he said his voice rising to a near shout he does it all the time he does it you know in a way that has given him enough wiggle room to say no no i m not being negative but of course he is his whole campaign 2016 by daniel strauss and natasha korecki sanders criticisms of benenson s former boss obama are especially galling walk into the pollster s 33rd floor office in midtown manhattan and you ll find a minimuseum full of first rate 08 ephemera the conference room is festooned with obama wins newspaper headlines and a cardboard cutout of the 44th president stares back at you benevolently as you sit on the waiting room couch the things he says about barack obama it actually pisses me off because it s disingenuous benenson said flashing real anger don t stand on a stage in front of television cameras with millions of people when you re running in a democratic primary and say he s a friend of yours and you work with him you know i d like to remind everybody what he said when barack obama was under attack by republicans running for reelection in 2012 when he called obama weak a disappointment to millions of people and said he didn t have the backbone to stand up to republicans he said suggesting sanders is more comfortable slamming his allies than the common enemy i haven t heard him say a word about george bush have you even heard him mention george bush s name on the campaign trail the contempt in many ways is born of familiarity benenson like sanders is an overachieving outer borough working class jew who was drawn to progressive political causes early in life both had peripatetic young adulthoods that didn t portend powerful futures on the national stage sanders college hopped abandoning his native brooklyn for bucolic vermont where he earned a living as a carpenter writer filmmaker and freelance gadfly before winning the burlington mayor s race as a socialist benenson who looks a decade younger than his 63 years took an even more circuitous path he dropped out of queens college just short of graduation to work in avant garde theater then to pay his rent he accepted an uncle s offer to help run a beer distributorship in crown heights in brooklyn and that s where he spent the night of the 1977 new york city blackout staked out at the front door a shotgun borrowed from his girlfriend s brother loaded on his lap then he wanted to become a yankees beat reporter which eventually led to a successful career as a political scribe for the new york daily news he is a rarity in the media suspicious world of the clintons many of his oldest friends are reporters adam nagourney of the times roger simon of politico serge kovaleski the timesman whose disability trump mocked at a rally and obama message man david axelrod who made his name at the chicago tribune by doug palmer like sanders who was arrested for participating in a civil rights demonstration as a student in 1960s chicago benenson had his own brush with protest and the police in 1970 a day after the kent state shootings a 17 year old benenson was in his words detained after joining a group of anti vietnam war protesters who blocked the heavily trafficked long island expressway but their paths diverged in ways that say much about the character of each man and of each campaign while sanders spent most of his teens and 20s as an activist for socialist and student organizations benenson was attracted to mainstream democratic politics his hero was bobby kennedy and he casts the new york senator s 1968 campaign as the hybrid of idealism and pragmatism currently embodied by his 2016 boss in our interview benenson started to talk about kennedy matter of factly but he broke down as he described watching tv coverage of martin luther king s assassination in his mother s laurelton living room he remembers the image of kennedy jumping on top of a parked car to address a seething african american crowd in indianapolis what we need in the united states is not division kennedy said what we need in the united states is not hatred what we need in the united states is not violence or lawlessness but love and wisdom and compassion toward one another that benenson said was powerful missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020 politico llc
