advertisement supported by by jeremy w peters fargo n d north dakota is not accustomed to being one of the way stations on the path to the white house given its meager number of delegates and its tiny remote media markets it is rare for a presidential campaign to give this state the time of day but here was senator ted cruz on saturday addressing the state s republican convention and leading the crowd of several thousand to a standing ovation with a thunderous appeal to north dakota s sudden relevance it is entirely possible the men and women gathered here will decide this entire primary will decide this nomination he said mr cruz also dispatched carly fiorina a former rival who has endorsed him to warm up the crowd before he spoke ben carson worked the convention floor on behalf of donald j trump shaking hands and posing for pictures gov john kasich of ohio sent gordon humphrey the former two term republican senator from new hampshire to do his bidding the rules for how republican delegates are selected could end up turning votes for one candidate into delegates who will support another candidate at the convention north dakota s sudden appearance in the spotlight is one of the most unmistakable signs yet that the party could be headed to its first contested national convention in 40 years where the state s 28 delegates barely 1 percent of the overall total could make a difference in who wins the nomination because of the unusual way north dakota selects its delegates to the national convention it may not be immediately clear which candidate made the biggest impression here the state s republicans do not hold a primary or caucuses instead the party activists who streamed into fargo this weekend will elect a slate of 25 delegates on sunday those delegates plus three unelected ones do not have to publicly declare their intentions before they vote at the national convention in july and they are free to change their minds at any time state party conventions like the one here in fargo this weekend are dress rehearsals of sorts for the national convention which will be held in cleveland assuming no candidate clinches the nomination by winning a majority of delegates before the convention all the herding arm twisting and wooing of delegates that is expected to unfold there is now beginning on a smaller scale a coalition of republicans is banking on a scenario in which donald j trump fails to reach the 1 237 delegates required to secure the party s nomination before its july convention creating a potential opening for another nominee as the delegates vote on the convention floor if campaign placards stickers and other paraphernalia served as a sort of unscientific straw poll mr cruz was outpacing his rivals save for a kasich sticker here and a trump sign there the hockey arena where north dakota republicans gathered on saturday was cruz country many here said they admired mr cruz s willingness to irk the republican establishment anyone who can get shot on the senate floor and it wouldn t be a crime you ve got to vote for someone like that said terry schantz a rancher from glen ullin n d mr schantz was referring to a comment by one of mr cruz s fellow republican senators lindsey graham of south carolina that mr cruz was so loathed by his colleagues that one of them could kill him and no other senator would care still some cautioned that mr cruz should not become cocky there s something called north dakota nice said ed schafer a former governor and an agriculture secretary under george w bush people wearing those red stickers aren t necessarily voting for him they re saying welcome to north dakota an interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 republican nomination process could unfold mr cruz was the only candidate to appear in person mr trump had asked the north dakota republican party if he could address the convention on video but was told he could not republican officials said both he and mr kasich spent saturday campaigning in wisconsin which holds its primaries on tuesday the importance of just a few delegates is evident in the fights that are already breaking out in some states between the trump and cruz campaigns on friday mr trump s campaign director in tennessee accused the republican party of trying to steal delegates from the real estate mogul who won the state s primary on march 1 mr trump is entitled to most of tennessee s 58 delegates but a wrinkle in the rules there allows the state party s executive committee to pick 14 of those delegates alarming trump supporters who are concerned party leaders are filling those slots with people backing other candidates a similar situation is playing out in louisiana where mr cruz s campaign could end up with more delegates than mr trump who won the state s primary because of rules that allow certain delegates flexibility in casting their votes the trump campaign said it planned to file a formal complaint with the republican national committee on the grounds that it was excluded from a meeting at which state party officials discussed how delegates would be allocated and in a sign of the discord even a place as serene as north dakota was not moving ahead in a unanimous fashion when state party officials released their list of favored delegates on saturday people immediately rose from the crowd to offer competing slates ensuring a contested vote on sunday advertisement
