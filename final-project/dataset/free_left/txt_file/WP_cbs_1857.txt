the following is a transcript of an interview with national security adviser robert o brien that aired sunday february 23 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan that s the president at a friday rally in las vegas claiming that reports of russia interfering in his favor was democratic disinformation when we were in las vegas saturday i spoke with the white house national security adviser robert o brien who was in our washington studio i asked him if he had assured the president that this particular us intelligence finding was real he strongly disputed it national security adviser robert o brien well i have not seen the finding i think what he s referring to and what folks are talking about is a briefing that took place last week at the house intelligence committee that was leaked to the press and i i have not seen that report i get this second hand but from republican congressmen that were in the committee there was no intelligence behind it i haven t seen any intelligence to support the reports that were leaked out of the house margaret brennan but the white house was briefed on february 14th were you not in that briefing when the president was informed o brien well there s no briefing that i ve received that the president has received that says that president putin is doing anything to try and influence the elections in favor of president trump we just haven t seen that intelligence if it s out there i haven t seen it i d be surprised if i haven t seen it the leaders of our the ic have not seen it so i again i don t know where this is coming from i ve heard these rumors and these leaks from adam schiff s committee but i i have not seen them myself and i ve seen no intelligence along those lines margaret brennan but just to clarify are you saying that joseph maguire the former acting director of national intelligence did not inform you about the u s intelligence committee s community s findings o brien no i look i think you know and again i i don t want to get into private conversations in a in a presidential daily brief but i i don t think admiral maguire was necessarily informed of what was going to happen at that hearing in the house either and and again there s nothing that he s given up no information admiral maguire gave us gina haspel has given us director haspel ambassador grenell the new acting dni that comports with what was leaked out of that house intel committee so i haven t seen it the leaders of the intelligence community that i ve spoken with haven t seen anything that comports with what was leaked out but again those leaks i don t know if that s what the briefers told the house committee i mean those were simply margaret brennan but well that that s contradicted by reports that the director of national intelligence maguire did brief white house officials but more broadly the fbi director at the beginning of the month chris wray testified that russia continues to try to influence the elections mainly through social media manipulation so this pattern of behavior has continued russia is undeterred are you denying that that is happening o brien no no what i look i what i ve heard from the fbi you know well what i ve heard is that russia would like bernie sanders to to win the democrat nomination they d probably like him to be president understandably because he wants to to spend money on social programs and probably would have to take it out of the military so that would make sense and and look the russians have always tried to interfere with elections because they want to divide americans they want to undermine our democracy but the idea that they want to they want to influence the election and somehow cause the president to win i just don t see it but look i think there are a number of countries china russia north korea iran that would like to influence our elections to to get the candidate that they feel would be best for their country margaret brennan so you are saying that it is not in fact the u s intelligence community s assessment that russia has a preference for president trump o brien i i have not seen that and and again why would they have a preference for president trump who is rebuilding our military who is giving the ukrainians lethal aid to fight russian troops so that doesn t make sense now look we want good relations with russia we d like to have great relations with russia i haven t seen any intelligence that there s any active measures by the russians to try and get the president re elected and and we ve got a simple message for the russians or any other country that wants to to meddle in our elections whoever they re behind stay out of our democratic elections and and we re doing everything we can we re working with state and local officials we re going in many cases margaret brennan but you o brien to paper ballots to make sure that that you know governments with ill intent can t hack secretary of state websites can t get involved in our elections change results and we re going to work on election security very very hard through across the interagency in the federal government and also with our state and local partners margaret brennan why not have the intelligence community testify in public about what they are seeing so that the public can arm themselves so that they can understand what is disinformation and what is fact o brien look i margaret brennan why not declassify some of those o brien i d i d have no problem with that and and but that s not my decision and the intelligence community is is very concerned and careful about sources and methods and i understand that but i i would personally have no problem with margaret brennan but back in 20 back in 2016 in october of 2016 when russia was doing this disinformation campaign the obama administration did declassify information at that time so there is a precedent why doesn t the trump administration do that o brien i think if there s intelligence that we can declassify that that we can get out there all the better because again we weren t in office in 2016 when when the last election meddling took place and the administration did very little about it and and they you know everyone admits that that very little was done about it we re in office now and we re doing everything we can across the interagency and and with our state and federal and local partners to to ensure that that american ballots are secure that that are our our ballot machines are secure that tabulations are secure that that state secretary of state websites are secure we want to make sure that this is a free and fair election that americans select their next president not some foreign country and and we re gonna do and the president s been deadly serious about that margaret brennan why was joseph maguire pushed out why did he leave are you 100 percent sure it had nothing to do with this congressional briefing o brien yeah i i i look i i was there so i first of all joe maguire wasn t pushed out joe maguire s term he was an acting he was he was serving under the vacancy act he was acting and his term i believe was ending march 11th or march 12th like two weeks from now 00 07 31 so we re looking for a a nominee that can be a terrific candidate who can be nominated for this position we needed someone who was senate confirmed who could serve in the meantime and we turned to a great ambassador rick grenell our ambassador to germany and and he s stepping in on a temporary basis to to serve in the role of acting dni we ll get a nominee out to the senate as soon as possible and and look i m urging and the president s urging that the senate will move quickly that we can get a a full time confirmed dni in place long before the election and this is an opportunity for the senate to show that they can come together get the business of the people done and get a a a dni confirmed and in place i think that d be great but joe maguire wasn t pushed out we d love to see joe maguire stay involved in the government joe joe had a a great relationship with the president i had a great relationship with him we have a lot of respect for joe maguire so so the premise of your question that he was pushed out just isn t true joe maguire was always planning on leaving within the next couple of weeks so you know he he did a great job i had a really great relationship with him 00 08 32 and i have a tremendous amount of respect for him as does the president margaret brennan to be clear rick grenell does not have an intelligence background i want to quickly ask you though about afghanistan if the taliban does not make good on its promise to pull back on violence to sign this deal at the end of the month is the president positioned to stop the troop withdrawal o brien the president made it very clear the last time we were close to signing a deal with the taliban and they they engaged in some malign activity they they had a vehicle borne ied that killed a number of people including one american and the president pulled back from signing the deal we re hopeful that that we can get to a a place where the afghans can talk with each other and negotiate some sort of resolution a political resolution of the conflict we ve been there 19 years it s time for us to stop bringing our our sons and daughters home through dover air force base and dignified transfers we ve got to get out of of the war in afghanistan but we re gonna do it in a way that protects american interests so if the taliban does not live up to their agreement on the reduction of violence plan then we ll take a very care careful look at it and i think it d be unlikely that we d we d sign a peace treaty but we re not going to reduce troops to a level below what is necessary to protect american interests and our partners in afghanistan i can assure you of that margaret brennan all right ambassador o brien thank you for joining us o brien always great to be here margaret margaret brennan the trump appointed official overseeing us election security shelby pierson reported to congress that russia was interfering in the election and has shown a preference for president trump but sources tell our major garrett there was bipartisan push back on her assertions and questions about the strength of the evidence congress has requested to see the underlying intelligence to back up that assessment which as you heard the national security advisor said he had not seen cbs stands by major s reporting the president was told
