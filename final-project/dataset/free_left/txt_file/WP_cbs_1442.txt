the following is a transcript of an interview with dr anthony fauci that aired sunday february 16 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan joining us now is dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at nih dr fauci it s good to have you here dr anthony fauci good to be with you margaret brennan we were just hearing about the state department sending planes to help evacuate some of these americans who were on that cruise ship debora said more than 40 now what can you tell us in terms of the americans have been exposed and infected dr fauci well 40 of them have gotten infected they are not going to go anywhere they re going to be in hospitals in japan people who have symptoms will not be able to get on the evacuation plane others are going to be evacuated starting imminently to air force bases in the united states if people on the plane start to develop symptoms they ll be segregated within the plane so there s a very firm plan with this 747 that is going to take these passengers now who have been there if you want to stay in japan your last chance would be to get on the plane and leave or you stay there when you come back to the united states importantly they re still subjected to a 14 day quarantine and the reason for that is that the degree of transmissibility on that cruise ship is essentially akin to being in a hot spot a lot of transmissibility on that cruise ship margaret brennan so for the americans who are infected what does that actually mean what is the state of their health dr fauci yeah well it varies i mean you could be infected and have minimal symptoms but you still have the possibility of transmitting it to someone else margaret brennan ok dr fauci or you could be infected and have some significant lung disease that would require hospitalization and perhaps even some serious intervention margaret brennan now malaysian health authorities have also said there was an 83 year old american woman who had been on a different cruise ship which ended up docking in cambodia she landed in malaysia and then tested positive this kind of spread does this indicate this is becoming a pandemic dr fauci well a pandemic is when you have multiple countries throughout the world that have what s called sustained transmission from person to person to person multiple generations right now there are 24 countries in which there were over five hundred cases several of them are starting to get to the second and third transmission so technically speaking the who wouldn t be calling this a global pandemic but it certainly is on the verge of that happening reasonably soon unless containment is more successful than it is right now margaret brennan as debora said there are experts landing in china this week dr fauci right margaret brennan americans will be among them dr fauci right margaret brennan is there anyone from your team and and what is the difference dr fauci yeah margaret brennan if say the cdc had been allowed in dr fauci right margaret brennan versus the who dr fauci you know margaret to be honest with you we really should not be talking about that because the sensitivity of coming out ahead of the chinese of making any kind of announcement but you re correct there certainly margaret brennan but the chinese ambassador was on this program last week and he indicated americans were on that list dr fauci well then if he says it then they re on that list yes margaret brennan but but what is the difference there why would it be more beneficial to have dr fauci well for two reasons margaret brennan your agency be able to send people have cdc officials there dr fauci well the reason is because first of all this our cdc are the best epidemiologists in the world they can be helpful to the chinese as well as get information firsthand eyes ears and boots on the ground so it really is to be helpful as part of the who group margaret brennan because the who has been criticized perhaps being too careful around the chinese government in their part of the u n agency they receive international funding china has tremendous power over them is that criticism fair dr fauci you know i don t know if it s fair or not but certainly it s been spoken about i mean clearly the director of who dr tedros is really an outstanding person and under very difficult circumstances i think he s doing a very good job margaret brennan the president has said at least twice so far that the virus could tick down in these warmer months ahead he indicated dr fauci right margaret brennan president xi told him that dr fauci right margaret brennan is that how the virus actually works dr fauci this virus we don t know but it is not unreasonable to say that influenza for example which peaks in the winter you would certainly expect it by march april and may to taper down as well as typical common cold coronaviruses that s not an unreasonable statement however we do not know what this particular virus is gonna do so so we would think it would be a stretch to assume that it s going to disappear with the warm weather we don t know that it s completely unknown margaret brennan you said recently that you could have some kind of vaccine within a year or so dr fauci right right margaret brennan how do you speed up that timeline and how do you fix the problem you said you have which is finding a manufacturer dr fauci right well first of all margaret that one year timeline would be the world s indoor record of ever getting a vaccine out at least to be able to early deploy you can t do any better than that if you go any faster you ll be cutting dangerous corners margaret brennan and no manufacturer yet dr fauci oh yeah manufacturers once you get a vaccine that you know works the difficulty is having companies take that risk of hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to scale up to make it available margaret brennan all right so you re still looking for a partner on that dr fauci i think we re gonna get them margaret brennan ok dr fauci because i m seeing interest on the part of pharmaceutical companies that we did not see with sars and other outbreaks margaret brennan dr fauci thank you
