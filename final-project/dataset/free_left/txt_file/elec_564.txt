feinstein is one of the few senate democrats facing a progressive primary challenger in 2018 california s dianne feinstein first elected in 1992 is one of the most powerful democrats in the senate but she s also one of the few with a credible primary challenger who came within 6 points of securing the nomination at the california democratic party convention in february where delegates handed feinstein a startling rebuke by declining to endorse her the challenger 51 year old state sen kevin de le n stands out in a very crowded field of relatively unknown candidates in the june 5 democratic primary still his attempt to beat feinstein is a race with david and goliath like odds california political science experts say feinstein is an institution she was elected to the san francisco board of supervisors in 1969 and became san francisco mayor 10 years later now she s ranking member of the powerful senate judiciary committee and at age 84 the oldest us senator she s seeking her sixth term but because of california s top two primary system as long as de l on can slide into second place along feinstein he ll be challenging her all the way until november speaking for some california progressives who believe that a powerful senator from a deep blue state should be a louder voice in opposition to trump s agenda california has been the epicenter of the trump resistance movement and feinstein is a frequent target among progressive groups for not taking a hard enough line against the president her comments that she believed trump can be a good president if he was open to change caught plenty of flak but progressives disagreements with her go deeper they run the gamut from her opposition to a single payer health care bill to her support of the controversial foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa and her past vote in favor of the iraq war and in some ways feinstein seems to be feeling the heat in recent months she s moved left on the death penalty saying she now opposes capital punishment after supporting it for many years and even running on the issue in early senate campaigns feinstein is saddled with the perception of being out of date said david mermin a longtime political strategist in california people won t say age but she s the oldest member of the senate he added so when voters do think about people who have been in office for a long time they don t say they re old they say they re out of date the california democratic party convention showed at least some segment of state democrats agreed a lot of democrats gave us a lot of wind behind our sails with the belief that it is time for a change de le n told me in his state senate office in sacramento recently it s time to have a voice that s reflective of today s california not the california of a quarter century ago de le n is presenting himself as that alternative more progressive policy wise and more willing to openly be a thorn in trump s side but on the whole feinstein will be hard to beat she s reasonably well liked and has a war chest of more than 10 million to blanket california s airwaves with plus despite whatever california democratic party delegates might be feeling national democrats have no interest in a primary defeat against feinstein she s a safe reliable seat and an important person in the national party plus as the top democrat on the senate judiciary she s an important part of protecting special counsel robert mueller s investigation into possible russian collusion with the trump campaign he s got a real campaign but i haven t seen a wholesale of democrats overwhelmingly abandoning feinstein said mermin de le n grew up in san diego as the son of a single immigrant mother he worked in the state for years as a labor organizer before entering california state politics in 2006 in sacramento he started in the state assembly and then moved to the state senate becoming president pro tempore of the chamber in 2014 throughout the years he helped advance a number of piece of legislation focused on combating climate change cutting tax loopholes and promoting gun control de le n also was instrumental in passing a single payer bill in california which ultimately was stopped by fellow democratic lawmakers due to a lack of funding he supports the current federal bills for single payer as well de le n is term limited and resigned to run for us senate this year he said he was motivated by president donald trump s rise to do his part to attempt to bring the california resistance to dc it is true that i am termed out at the end of this year but there wasn t a lot of thinking into 2018 he said we need a strong voice on the front lines not on the sidelines to deal with someone like donald trump but the fact remains that in california de le n and his fellow state lawmakers have been able to enact a progressive agenda something that liberal democrats can only dream about doing in republican controlled gridlocked washington and he doesn t talk about dc and the politicians and journalists that populate it glowingly washington dc gets caught up in itself it s a very insular town that is really into itself he said victory or a sign of great achievement is a sign of how many times you ve been on the news media as opposed to a work product so the question remains why does he want to go to washington where things move much more slowly and it is arguably a lot more difficult to pull off what he s already been able to achieve in california i ve always believed it s not about moving more to the left or more to the right but it s about moving forward with commonsense measures policies that truly improve the human condition for all americans regardless of who you are he said there s no denying feinstein is a centrist democrat and despite california s super liberal reputation she s been able to win elections year after year i think she s viewed as someone who is very widely respected by people within a wide range of ideologies said california democratic political consultant erica walters with voters she s viewed as someone that gets it done for california in addition to capturing democrats feinstein is able to pick up a portion of the state s independent voters those blocs have delivered her resounding victories in past years the last time she ran in 2012 she won nearly 7 3 million votes clinching more than 62 percent of the vote while feinstein has scooped up the endorsements of former president barack obama fellow california sen kamala harris and house minority leader nancy pelosi de le n has the support of the climate action group 350 org prominent democratic billionaire tom steyer and key labor groups but gaining the support of the activist base does not a successful primary challenge make according to mermin he definitely has a lot of support among the activist base of the party he said but that activist base i don t think it s the majority of the democratic party de le n meanwhile says the media has stuck him with the progressive label but he s only too happy to highlight where he d like to work with republicans on issues including immigration and climate change he admits he is a progressive but insists these are issues he s been fighting for his whole life and ones that apply to all people living in the us no matter what political party they belong to when we talk about health care and medicare for all it s not about a democratic or republican issue health care is health care and having access to quality health care benefits all individuals he said i think what people try to do especially political pundits is trivialize and marginalize democratic activists in short of being successful or in short of coming up with majorities in the legislative branch in congress work toward negotiating with republican colleagues in saying this is a win win situation he argues he knows that he s facing an incredibly tough fight to get there de le n doesn t have a lot of money or name recognition but right now he s focused on taking small steps to november our immediate goal is to go from 32 candidates to two candidates de le n said if we re successful in achieving that then we have a different ballgame first things first i don t want to get ahead of myself get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
