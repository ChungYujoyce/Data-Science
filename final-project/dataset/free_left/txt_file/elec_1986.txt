pressure on members of the electoral college to select someone other than donald trump has grown dramatically and noisily in recent weeks causing some to waver but yielding little evidence that trump will fall short when electors convene in most state capitals monday to cast their votes carole joyce of arizona expected her role as a gop elector to be pretty simple she would meet the others in phoenix and carry out a vote for trump who won the most votes in her state and whom she personally supported but then came the mail and the emails and the phone calls first hundreds then thousands of voters worrying that trump s impulsive nature would lead the country into another war honestly it had an impact said joyce a 72 year old republican state committee member i ve seen enough funerals i m tired of hearing bagpipes but i signed a loyalty pledge and that matters such is the life these days for many of the 538men and women who are scheduled to meet monday across the country to carry out what has traditionally been a perfunctory vote after most every presidential election the role of elector has intensified this year in the wake of a bitter election in which trump lost the popular vote to democrat hillary clinton by a margin of nearly 3million votes and the revelation of a secret cia assessment that russia interfered to help trump get elected amid the uncertainty caused by russian influence 10 electors nine democrats and one republican asked for an intelligence briefing to get more information about moscow s role their request was endorsed by john podesta clinton s campaign manager the administration should brief members of the electoral college on the extent and manner of russia s interference in our election before they vote on dec 19 podesta wrote thursday in a washington post op ed the office of the director of national intelligence said friday evening that it would not brief the electors because it is engaged in a presidentially ordered review of the russian interference once the review is complete in the coming weeks the intelligence community stands ready to brief congress and may release findings the odni said in a statement posted to its website meanwhile joyce and the other 305republican electors who are supposed to cast their votes for trump have been subject to intense campaigns orchestrated by anti trump forces to convince them that they alone can block the reality television star from the white house others have targeted democratic electors who are supposed to cast votes for clinton to persuade them to switch to a more conventional republican who could also draw enough support from gop electors to swoop into office while there is little sign the efforts will prove successful the push has unleashed intense pressure on individual electors who have now been thrust into a sometimes uncomfortable spotlight joyce has received emails from benjamin franklin and john jay and a christmas card that read please in the name of god don t vote for trump the rancor about the role of electors started early in the campaign in august baoky vu a gop activist in atlanta said he planned to resign from the job because he was so morally opposed to trump he planned to defer his voting responsibility to someone more willing an alternate who would be put in place monday after the election vu started getting phone calls and emails asking him not to resign he was asked instead to consider joining a coalition of electors hoping to vote against trump he declined i don t think we should drag this election out any longer vu said and can you imagine if the electors overturned the results if we attempt to change them in any way you ve got these far right elements that are just going to go haywire mark hersch a 60 year old chicago based marketing strategist joined a group known as the hamilton electors who have been organizing efforts to contact electors and change their minds before the election hersch said the most political activism he had ever undertaken was planting a yard sign he said he believes the goal to deny trump seems reachable if not probable rather than persuade an entire country he and his allies must find 37republicans willing to vote for someone else a tipping point at which the responsibility of picking the president would shift to the u s house of representatives no one knows for sure how many are considering alternate votes estimates vary from one to 25 the gop controlled house could vote for trump anyway but those trying to flip voters say there is still value in taking a stand hersch said he was inspired to continue to flip electors by the movie 300 which depicts an ancient spartan army s stand against a persian force that outnumbered it 1 000 to 1 i would like to think we would be successful but if not we need to do all we could to prevent this man from being president he said then he modified a line from the movie prepare your breakfast and eat hearty for tonight we will go to battle this isn t 300 but 538 that battle has intensified as electors draw closer to their convening monday joyce was getting 15letters a day and 300emails in the days after nov 8 but those numbers quickly increased to 50and 3 000 some of them have been form letters others handwritten the letters came from washington state and from china stuffed with copies of the u s constitution or alexander hamilton s writing in federalist paper no 68 which states that the meeting of the electoral college affords a moral certainty that the office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications on thursday joyce received so many letters that the letter carrier just gave her a u s postal service bucket filled to the brim i m sorry this is happening to you joyce recalled the letter carrier saying while some electors have complained of harassment joyce shrugged off the mail and placed it all on a sofa decorated with american flag pillows this is america she said in a phone interview people have a right to say what they want she said most of the messages were thoughtful on friday she said her emails became more positive the messages were from republicans thanking her for taking trump to the finish line of an arduous process how refreshing she said although some democrats who have in the past five presidential elections lost twoin which they won the popular vote and even trump himself have questioned the necessity of the electoral college many opposing trump have said this election proves just how important it is norman eisen a former ambassador to the czech republic who has served as legal counsel to the obama administration began calling electors to explain that their job is not necessarily to certify the results but to have a reasonable discussion over whether the public made the right decision for instance eisen who focused on government ethics in obama s white house noted that trump could be violating a clause in the constitution that prevents presidents from receiving gifts and funds from foreign governments it is unclear whether his businesses do because he has not publicly disclosed his tax returns in massachusetts republican operative and attorney r j lyman said he didn t want to harass anyone so he used his connections to find electors who were willing to chat about the lessons he learned in american history class and at the dinner table he became one of the few people in the country more willing to talk about hamilton the man than about hamilton an american musical the electoral college he said he tells them was not intended to be a rubber stamp otherwise he said the founding fathers would have tasked the responsibility to a clerk or simply used the popular vote as a way of choosing a president i m reminding them of their duty to think about their choice in a way that s consistent with their conscience and the constitution lyman said so far lyman said he has identified 20 electors who might be willing to vote other than their party pledge he couldn t name more than one publicly but insisted that more were out there earlier this month chris suprun of texas became the first republican elector in a red state that voted for trump to declare in a dec 5 new york times column that he would not cast his electoral vote for trump suprun voted for sen ted cruz of texas in the primary and said he left behind his wallet on election day and thus did not vote in the general nonetheless suprun said he was willing to vote for trump in the electoral college until the candidate claimed with no evidence that millions of clinton supporters voted illegally suprun s public stance has elicited death threats and hate mail he said as of yesterday people are calling to say get your ass together or we re coming for you said suprun who was the sole republican elector to ask for an intelligence briefing on russia they are doing it with their own phone number not even blocking the number that s not been surprising look at what trump says himself vinz koller a democratic elector from monterey county calif said he read suprun s column and started thinking about his own role in the college it inspired him to support a new theory if he could persuade other democrats to abandon their clinton votes perhaps he and republicans could agree on a more conventional choice a la ohio governor and failed gop candidate john kasich to vote for instead of trump the plan seemed unlikely he said but trump s candidacy unsettled him so much that he felt he needed to try anything california is one of 29 states that mandate electors vote for the candidate who won the state so koller sued to continue his plan frankly this is hard and not something i do lightly he said i ve been working in partisan politics a long time and i don t like voting against my candidate but i never thought that the country might be unstable until now on thursday evening he found himself in the library of congress strolling through its stacks koller sought a librarian with one request can i see the original federalist papers he looked to see federalist no 68 written by hamilton to describe the need for the electoral college we have been getting a civic lesson we weren t prepared to get koller said they gave us the fail safe emergency brake in case the people got it wrong and here we are 200 years later it s the last shot we have ellen nakashima contributed to this report ellen nakashima contributed to this report correct an earlier version of this report incorrectly said that norman eisen served as legal counsel to the bush administration he has served in that capacity for the obama administration
