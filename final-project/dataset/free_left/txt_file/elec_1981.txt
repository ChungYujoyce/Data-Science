advertisement supported by letter from washington by albert r hunt bloomberg view there is talk among republicans and some trepidation among democrats that donald j trump could benefit from a silent vote although these voters aren t captured by polls the privacy of a voting booth or a mail in ballot will allow them to vent their anger and resentments the theory holds that in some circles it s not respectable to publicly support the inflammatory candidate but it s easier in private this is a variation of the so called bradley effect in several instances over recent decades white candidates have outperformed polls when running against a black opponent something similar was at work in the british referendum on exiting the european union to the surprise of financial markets and bettors the leave camp won the june vote which was interpreted as an expression of discontent with the elites similarly in the american presidential election former house speaker newt gingrich a trump supporter claimed that the average citizen will not tell pollsters the truth a silent or secret trump vote would be a big deal hillary clinton is up by several points in the latest surveys not a comfortable margin there are however reasons to question whether mr trump will outperform the polls this wasn t the case in the primaries the republican nominee underperformed the final polls in about as many states as those where he outperformed in iowa ann selzer the pollster for the des moines register and bloomberg politics lost her unblemished record when she showed mr trump with a small lead he narrowly lost to senator ted cruz of texas sure that all was within a margin of error and iowa s contest is a caucus where turnout is low and a week later in new hampshire the final polls suggested mr trump would win by about 15 points he won by 20 that trend was erratic in one of his most important closing victories in indiana he finished well ahead of the final surveys but in south carolina and michigan though he won he underperformed the last polls in wisconsin the closing polls suggested mr cruz would beat mr trump by about seven points the texan won by 13 the bradley effect gets its name from the 1982 california governor s race when the democratic nominee mayor tom bradley of los angeles who was black was running ahead of his white republican opponent when mr bradley ended up losing there was speculation that some voters didn t want to admit to polltakers that they wouldn t support a black candidate mr trump has aroused racial feelings more than any national candidate since george wallace 40 years ago but a lot has changed in 1982 there had not been a black governor anywhere since reconstruction and of course a black man has won the last two presidential elections carrying california twice by landslides the brexit vote did shock the establishment because the final polls pointed to a victory for the remain camp yet only a few weeks earlier most of the surveys showed a win for brexit in the interim a pro european union member of parliament jo cox was assassinated some analysts speculate that the tragedy created a short term backlash against the exit movement that dissipated by election day the american presidential contest should be a change election which ordinarily would work to the advantage of the republican candidate in the last eight weeks in 1980 ronald reagan surged at the end demonstrating that he was up to the job it s doubtful mr trump has that capacity so he needs a silent vote to offset his high negatives even if this hidden strength adds a few points for mr trump the democrats have a powerful offset the clinton campaign can rely on better data and analytics as well as a get out the vote operation that president obama had in 2012 that may be worth at least two points advertisement
