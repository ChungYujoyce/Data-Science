 2016 following his iowa script texas senator reaps support as carson appears to fade by katie glueck 12 09 2015 05 16 am est ted cruz is ascendant in iowa largely on the strength of support from evangelical voters and the deep infrastructure he s built in that community getty greenville s c he s locking down pastors in every county has held a rally to celebrate religious liberty and is methodically courting christian grass roots leaders ted cruz has taken his evangelicals focused iowa playbook to south carolina and conservative leaders in the state say that it s starting to work advertisement ted cruz has done perhaps the best job in the state frankly unaligned south carolina sen tim scott said of the texas senator s organization going on to add it s not going to help my friends who are serving with me but the truth is the truth he s done a really good job laying the foundation for a really long time cruz is ascendant in iowa largely on the strength of support from evangelical voters and the deep infrastructure he s built in that community on monday he beat donald trump in one poll there and he has racked up a number of high profile endorsements in that state including from hard line conservative rep steve king r iowa the south carolina field looks to be more challenging as trump remains strong and sen marco rubio boosted by a campaign staff with deep ties to the state generates enthusiasm among establishment voters and religious conservatives alike polls from november the most recent available had cruz either third behind trump and ben carson or fourth behind trump carson and rubio and few in the palmetto state think carson is doing that well anymore now there are signs that the same christian conservatives focused approach cruz used to surge in iowa largely at carson s expense is also making him a formidable candidate in south carolina a state in which 65 percent of republican primary voters in 2012 identified themselves in exit polls as born again or evangelical christians evangelicals are particularly concentrated here in the deeply religious upstate region it seems the evangelicals are coalescing said david lane an influential unaligned evangelical leader who hosted cruz on monday at a private pastors and pews event in greenville speaking of cruz s support both in iowa and south carolina it does seem cruz has got the momentum and 60 days out that s a good thing to have 2016 by darren goode he noted that cruz is organized in all of south carolina s 46 counties just as he is in all of iowa s 99 he s organized in every county in the first four voting states he s cooking with gas lane added cruz is ramping up his south carolina efforts with his campaign s ranks there expected to double in coming weeks to about a dozen full time staffers on monday he visited one of his two campaign headquarters in the state here in greenville to join a phone bank he quoted scripture and prayed with a woman on the phone as vonnie gleason a volunteer in her 50s looked on with tears in her eyes his words are so much from the heart gleason said he was praying with her like she was his best friend that ability to connect with christians gives cruz a real good chance because of all the conservative christians here said linda mccarthy of greenville one of the dozens of supporters who crowded into cruz s campaign office to be photographed with the senator and his father rafael cruz a pastor who is an important surrogate in the evangelical community that s why linda hill another supporter in attendance sees a path for cruz in the state even as she grudgingly acknowledged that trump continues to lead for now i just believe in my heart of hearts he s going to come from behind and be the candidate for the republicans she said of cruz i pray so i just can t imagine voting for trump by burgess everett a big part of cruz s strategy in south carolina and nationally is to emerge as the consensus choice of evangelicals and other conservative christians to that end in south carolina mike gonzalez is leading an initiative to recruit in each county a pastor who will then be tasked with turning out more christians for cruz that echoes an approach cruz has already taken in iowa where efforts are underway to tap a pastor in all 99 counties and as in iowa cruz hosted a religious liberty rally in greenville last month at which he showcased christians who have faced business and legal troubles for taking stances that they say conflict with their faith particularly concerning gay marriage as far as getting pastors endorsed we re lining them up every day said gonzalez senior pastor at a church in columbia i would say across the state we probably have 100 or more who have already endorsed we re looking at some strong leadership pastors with large churches across the state cruz does not have a monopoly on christian leaders several people interviewed at his headquarters said that at their churches many are torn between cruz and rubio and gop veterans say rubio would have sufficient appeal with evangelicals to make them a part of the broader coalition he is seeking to build sen cruz is counting on evangelicals showing up in droves on feb 20 sen rubio is running a much more traditional republican campaign in south carolina looking to be strong in all lanes said a state party official who is neutral and so requested anonymity in order to speak freely sen cruz must win evangelicals to win south carolina sen rubio must place but so far the official said cruz s strategic efforts to engage the evangelical community appear to be paying off i like marco rubio and i would be comfortable with him as the nominee said tony beam an influential christian radio host based in greenville who decided to back cruz after a private meeting in washington last spring the reason i selected cruz is because cruz has done more to spotlight issues related to religious liberty cruz s recruitment efforts in the state are aided by ladonna ryggs his state director who is well known and well respected in south carolina republican activist circles several of his other hires in the state are considered tea party leaders keep the promise a cluster of super pacs backing cruz also has its biggest field operation in south carolina run by dan tripp an operative from the state who was previously scott walker s state director here we always viewed cruz as our biggest competitor because he was so well organized on the ground we knew the scott walker campaign had to match or beat what cruz was doing tripp said all campaigns have strengths and weaknesses but i don t see the level of grass roots organization that the cruz universe has cruz started the process of engaging those leaders and with the broader effort of building a deeply organized infrastructure in the state earlier than anyone else suggested scott the senator who has hosted many of the republican presidential candidates at town halls and had cruz at one event on monday his trampoline is working because he had that strong ground game scott said of cruz s building support rubio s trying to catch up and trump s doing a pretty good job of putting it together by nick gass he added that marco rubio has a strong force and donald trump is piecing it together pretty quickly a rubio spokesman didn t respond to requests to comment on cruz and the south carolina race asked about the strength of cruz s palmetto state ground game walter whetsell an unaligned republican strategist who had aided rick perry s presidential bid immediately ticked off two gop operatives who had just gone to work with cruz and said that the texas senator has a fairly natural base here but whetsell said that cruz could also merely be the flavor of the month for cruz this sort of natural connection to evangelicals makes him fairly formidable here whetsell said but it s just because he is going up that wave right now you can look back in the past that s a wave that perry rode for awhile a wave mike huckabee rode for a while rick santorum was riding it maybe it s just cruz s turn cruz is a beneficiary of the previous candidate to ride a wave of evangelical support carson polls nationally and republicans in the state anecdotally say as carson has stumbled over foreign policy cruz has picked off some of his support by burgess everett rubio however has been seeking to raise questions about cruz s national security bona fides a message that if it sticks could take off in south carolina a particularly hawkish pro military state cruz voted for a measure that reined in the national security agency s ability to collect bulk telephonic metadata and has opposed some defense spending measures because of other unrelated provisions included in the bills cruz has been pushing back hard with tough talk on isil and stressing a willingness to do whatever is necessary to defeat the radical group as well as seeking to portray his nsa vote as within the conservative mainstream in some cases he may align a bit too much with sen rand paul on some national security issues said the state party official of cruz that s really the story over the next three or four weeks will he pay a price for it but for now said the official momentum with evangelicals is with sen ted cruz missing out on the latest scoops
