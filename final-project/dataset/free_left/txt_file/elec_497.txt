the candidates agree on universal background checks and an assault weapons ban there s less agreement on other proposals in response to recent mass shootings supporters of stricter gun laws have voiced a simple mantra do something on tuesday the top 12 democratic presidential candidates spoke on the debate stage about what they would do president donald trump for his part doesn t seem interested in much he has supported a federal red flag law which would allow police to take away someone s guns if there s some proof of a risk of violence a red flag but on other measures from universal background checks to an assault weapons ban trump and republican lawmakers have resisted instead talking up questionable connections between violence mental illness and violent media democratic candidates however have taken more comprehensive stances on guns for the most part they re sticking to common democratic themes like universal background checks an assault weapons ban which is typically paired with a ban on high capacity magazines and federally funded research into gun violence but the campaigns plans do include some new ideas here and there including red flag laws which campaigns ranging from cory booker s to john delaney s back and requiring a license to buy and own a gun which booker in particular brought to the presidential stage but others like elizabeth warren and pete buttigieg also support as i ve argued before even the most ambitious of the candidates gun control proposals don t go far enough to seriously dent gun violence america leads the developed world in gun violence with gun death rates nearly four times that of switzerland five times that of canada 35 times that of the united kingdom and 53 times that of japan the core problem is the us simply has way too many guns and too much access to firearms letting just about anyone obtain a weapon to carry out a mass shooting or more typical types of gun violence whether suicides or homicides but none of the democratic proposals do anything to swiftly address that core problem and significantly reduce the number of guns in the us still the research suggests that stricter gun laws particularly licensing would reduce gun deaths so the democratic proposals would make some progress even if they wouldn t be enough to bring down america s rate of gun deaths to that of its developed peers most democratic candidates at least mention gun violence on their campaign websites and other networks like medium but a few including booker warren and joe biden go into a lot of detail the democratic candidates are in general agreement on at least two proposals universal background checks and an assault weapons ban when it comes to other issues there s a bit less agreement or at least less attention the big common proposal is universal background checks under federal law licensed gun dealers have to run a background check looking at factors like criminal record and mental health history to sell someone a firearm but unlicensed sellers think a family member or perhaps someone over the internet or at a gun show don t have to run a check universal background checks attempt to stamp out the unlicensed sellers by requiring a background check for all or nearly all gun transactions an assault weapons ban has also received more attention with the rise of extremely deadly mass shootings as the shooters have used weapons like ar 15s and wasr 10s a variant of an ak 47 to carry out the attacks there are questions about how it would be implemented and enforced but the idea is to ban military style semiautomatic rifles some democratic candidates frame this as bringing back a previous federal assault weapons ban which was enacted in 1994 but expired in 2004 that kept existing weapons in circulation but tried to restrict future sales others want to go further requiring that gun owners actually turn in the banned weapons through a mandatory buyback program beyond those two proposals candidates have also supported red flag laws which could allow a family member neighbor close friend teacher or cop to report an extreme risk of violence to the courts the court could then order the seizure of a person s weapons the candidates also favor closing loopholes in existing gun laws that includes the boyfriend loophole which lets people get a gun even if they have a protective order against them due to a dating relationship and the charleston loophole which allows a small number of people to obtain a gun without completing a background check if the check takes too long this is how the self described white supremacist who killed nine people at a predominantly black church in charleston south carolina in 2015 got his gun there s also a lot of support for federally funded research into gun violence as well as the repeal of special legal protections for gun companies some candidates have moved to the left by calling for gun licensing which would require a license to purchase and own a firearm typically obtaining a license would involve a background check but also a more extensive vetting process that can require submitting fingerprints and a photo interviews with law enforcement and a gun safety training course some would pair this proposal as is done in for example massachusetts with mandatory registration of firearms this in theory allows police to pull up a database of weapons to seize if someone loses a license several candidates including booker warren buttigieg and andrew yang support a federal system that would require all gun owners get a license to buy and own firearms others including biden and michael bennet have been more cautious and even critical toward the idea otherwise there s been little significant movement from the typical democratic mantras of universal background checks and an assault weapons ban the democratic proposals on guns show how stuck the debate over this issue has been for decades in 1993 and 1994 a democratic controlled congress passed federal background checks and a 10 year assault weapons ban in the 25 years since the debate has largely been relegated to more background checks and an assault weapons ban as the party has moved left on everything from single payer health care to the green new deal to taxes on the wealthy it hasn t really moved on guns one reason is that democrats philosophy on gun policy has remained largely the same to prevent certain kinds of people from getting guns and at most prohibit only a small fraction of firearms but america s problem is much broader it simply has too many guns regardless of whether they re in a good guy s hands or a bad guy s hands the us has far more guns than any other country in the world more guns than people according to the small arms survey that makes it easy to get a firearm legally or not leading to more gun deaths research compiled by the harvard school of public health s injury control research center backs this up after controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime places with more guns have more gun deaths not just homicides but also suicides domestic violence violence against police and mass shootings another way to look at this everywhere in the world people get into arguments every country has residents who are dangerous to themselves or others because of mental illness every country has bigots and extremists but in america it s uniquely easy for a person to obtain a gun letting otherwise tense but nonlethal conflicts escalate into deadly violence yes stronger gun laws can help a 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries published in epidemiologic reviews found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives but the types of gun control laws matter some of the recent research on universal background checks has been mixed and studies on the last assault weapons ban found it ineffective for reducing overall levels of gun violence in part because the great majority of gun deaths involves handguns not assault weapons but studies on licensing have been very consistent in significantly reducing gun deaths in urban counties connecticut and missouri including for suicides one reason licensing might work is that it addresses america s core gun problem on its face licensing might seem like an extension of the background check model since the idea is still to filter between qualified and unqualified people but a licensing process can go way further while a background check is more often than not quick and hassle free gun licensing in for example massachusetts is a weeks or months long process that requires submitting a photograph and fingerprints passing a training course and going through one or more interviews all involving law enforcement that adds significant barriers for even a would be gun owner who has no ill intent or bad history the end impact is you decrease gun ownership overall cassandra crifasi a researcher and gun owner at the johns hopkins center for gun policy and research previously told me discussing massachusetts s laws lots of folks think well it s probably not worth going through all these hoops to buy firearms so i m not going to buy one and then you have fewer firearms around and less exposure this however could only be a start the kind of thing that ensures fewer people get guns now and in the future but in a country that already has so many firearms something also needs to be done to take out a lot of guns more quickly that could require rethinking the second amendment possibly by appointing judges who interpret it differently an inversion of the nra s campaign to portray gun ownership as an individual right it might even mean beginning an effort to repeal the amendment a project that could admittedly take decades but has gotten less serious consideration and support than packing the supreme court or even abolishing the senate significant change could involve imposing bigger hurdles to owning a gun requiring that people provide a stronger justification besides self defense or recreation to obtain a license it could mean banning more types of guns perhaps all semiautomatic weapons or all handguns and coupling that with an australian style mandatory buyback program which the research supports if the key difference between america and other countries is how many more guns the us has then something has to be done to quickly reduce the number of firearms here democrats aren t there yet until that changes there will be little voice in the presidential stage to the kinds of policies that could get american gun violence down to the levels of the
