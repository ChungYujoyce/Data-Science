his administration such as assisting in the financial recovery after the great recession and spearheading the response to the h1n1 pandemic he also called for biden s platform to go further to the left on certain issues such as providing a public health insurance option for all americans and expanding green initiatives to combat climate change beyond the endorsement mr obama took the unusual step of criticizing his successor and congressional republicans though he didn t call out mr trump by name one thing everybody has learned by now is that the republicans occupying the white house and running the u s senate are not interested in progress they re interested in power mr obama said citing efforts to roll back the affordable care act his signature legislative achievement as well as environmental regulations and international agreements put in place urging voters to get involved in the upcoming election he said it won t be easy the other side has a massive war chest the other side has a propaganda network with little regard for the truth he himself pledged to hit the campaign trail to help biden as soon as i can read more about the endorsementherefromcbs news ed o keefe

to support him said trump 2020 campaign manager brad parscale in a statement even bernie sanders beat him to it obama was right in the first place biden is a bad candidate who will embarrass himself

presidential candidate for the libertarian party dan fishman thelibertarian executive director toldcbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarrothat amash has not been in contact with the party recently but that if amash runs it d likely be with the libertarian party it d be a natural fit he said considering the way that we are aligned justin amash has been in the republican party but he certainly represents the vision of a much less powerful federal government which is aligned with the libertarian vision if he were going to run in a party i would imagine that he would run in the libertarian party fishman added that due to how the delegate system works within the party it would not be too late for amash to declare and secure the party s nomination at their may conventions
