compassion and caring that we need from our president and which joe biden has been exemplifying throughout his entire life clinton said she also had some digs at president trump while boosting biden saying think of what it would mean if we had a real president not just somebody who plays one on tv for his part biden floated several compliments clinton s way too and said at one point that he wished they were instead talking about getting her re elected clinton s endorsement tuesday could also provide an opportunity to smooth over any remaining tension between the competitive pair read more hereabout biden and clinton s relationship regarding the 2016 election and how her loss then is affecting his own campaign strategy on how to take on mr trump in november president donald trump

democrat establishment than joe biden and hillary clinton together campaign manager brad parscale said in a statement both of them carry the baggage of decades in the washington swamp and both of them schemed to keep the democrat nomination from bernie sanders president trump beat her once and now he ll beat her chosen candidate meanwhile vice president pence s visit to mayo clinic in rochester minnesota meant to highlight the clinic s partnership with the state to help battle the coronavirus was quickly overshadowed by videos and photos of pence touring the facility without a mask in a tweet mayo clinic said it had informed pence that all visitors and patients must wear a face mask but within an hour that tweet was deleted according to pool reports healthcare workers lined the halls and applause could be heard as the vp walked into the blood and plasma donation center where patients were donating plasma cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidarsays the pool notes indicated pence was the only one seen without a mask in the building as he thanked workers vice president pence told reporters that he and everyone around him is tested for the coronavirus on a regular basis pence said he is following cdc guidelines which indicate that the mask is good for preventing the spread of the virus by those who have it and since i don t have the coronavirus i thought it d be a good opportunity for me to be here to be able to speak to these researchers these incredible healthcare personnel and look them in the eye and say thank you afterwards pence held a roundtable with mayo clinic employees and minnesota governor tim walz i just want to say how much we appreciate governor tim walz pence said at the beginning of his remarks last week walz announced a partnership with mayo clinic and the university of minnesota to significantly expand coronavirus testing in the state to about 20 000 per day pence added that his visit to minnesota today was to celebrate a whole of america approach that minnesota is undertaking the mayo clinic has not yet said why its initial tweet saying pence had been informed about the mask wearing policy was taken down veepstakes stacey abrams in her second of six media live appearances tuesday former georgia gubernatorial candidate and former georgia house minority leader stacey abrams joined former labor secretary robert reich to talk about voter suppression and her ambitions to be vice president cbs news campaign reporter cara kortenotes this was an interesting conversation because during the democratic primary reich praised senators sanders and warren for their progressive policies in his conversation with abrams this afternoon reich applauded medicare for all and universal basic income and even asked abrams what her response was to the young and progressive voters who are not excited by a biden nomination abrams without hesitation voiced her support for biden joe biden is a man not only of integrity but if you look at the policies he has espoused the ones he s adopted the way he s framed this campaign and his plan for leadership it s first and foremost that he s not going to take anyone for granted he s not going to take communities of color for granted he s not going to take young people for granted she said and in a possible swipe at sanders and warren s more transformative platforms abrams added biden s not going to take progressives for granted but we also need someone who can get in there on day one and start navigating those spaces and getting not just the ideas out there but the policies in place another interesting exchange took place when reich quoted john adams george washington s vice president on the vice presidency which he disparaged as the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived reich said that when he worked in the clinton cabinet he had seen al gore frustrated in his role i think people often mistake position for power and they look at titles rather than access and i look for opportunities to not just build up but to dig deep roots my interest in serving is that i believe that joe biden will be a transformative president for us abrams said abrams who has been frank in her desire to be vice president continued to hype her resume today even citing college experience she had in relation to fighting climate change i interned for the epa for two summers working on the issues of environmental justice i wrote my thesis in college on environmental racism and how we need to address the poorest and least resilient who face environmental challenges she said finally abrams commented on today s primary in ohio and new york s decision yesterday to cancel its primary she praised ohio governor mike dewine for swiftly moving the primary but said more could have been done in preparation like including paid for postage in the mailed ballots she chastised the new york board of elections decision and said we may know the end of the story but no one gets to stop us from reading it abrams made the point that cancelling the primary sends a signal that it s the safest decision to not hold an election abrams said that s the wrong message to be sending elizabeth warren elizabeth warren on tuesday announced plans to team up with representative alexandria ocasio cortez on a bill to stop large companies and hedge funds from overtaking smaller ones suffering financially from the covid 19 crisis as we fight to save livelihoods and lives during the coronavirus pandemic giant corporations and private equity vultures are just waiting for a chance to gobble up struggling small businesses and increase their power through predatory mergers warren said in a statement cbs news campaign reporter zak hudaksays the pandemic anti monopoly act would impose a moratorium on mergers and acquisitions involving companies with over 100 million in revenue private equity companies hedge funds and companies with holding a patent for a product used during the crisis although antitrust agencies are tasked with defending open and fair markets by stopping anti competitive mergers their inability to aggressively take on concentration before the crisis began has further limited the federal government s ability to respond effectively to the pandemic the forthcoming bill would also waive waiting periods and deadlines binding antitrust agencies and order the federal trade commission to establish a legal presumption against mergers and acquisitions that hinder the government s response such measures are likely to face strong opposition particularly in the republican controlled senate but warren plans to push for them in the next coronavirus relief package warren also continued a push to include an essential workers bill of rights in the next coronavirus package that would add a set of protections and benefits for those on the front lines of the crisis she and representative ro khanna along with five dozen other lawmakers sent their proposal to the senate and house leaders frontline workers including health care workers transit workers farm workers grocery workers domestic workers and delivery workers are risking their lives to keep america running congress has a responsibility to protect them and their families warren said in a statement life after 2020 kirsten gillibrand the senate s most vocal champion for believing women in their allegations of sexual assault is standing with vice president joe biden in the wake of tara reade s allegation senator kirsten gillibrand who led the fight against then minnesota senator al franken to resign from the senate told just the newstuesday that she stood by biden cbs news campaign reporter cara korteaskedgillibrand about
