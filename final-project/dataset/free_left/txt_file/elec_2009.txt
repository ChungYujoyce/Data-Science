 look at how much african american communities are suffering from democratic control fifty eight percent of your youth is unemployed what the hell do you have to lose donald trump rally in dimondale mich aug 19 2016 he s trump saying how in the world can we abide a 58 percent unemployment rate among african american youth trump campaign manager kellyanne conway interview on abc s this week aug 21 2016 regular readers of the fact checker know we have written about this figure in some of our round up fact checks of trump s speeches but trump continues to use it and his new campaign manager has nowadopted it as a talking point since we haven t explored it in depth we decided to take amore thorough look at what this figure means and explain exactly why it doesn t hold water the official bureau of labor statistics unemployment rate for black youth is 19 2 percent about one third of the rate trump uses atrump campaign official previously told us that they calculated the 58 percent using this data setfrom the bureau of labor statistics calculating the number of people classified as unemployed and not in the labor force as a percentage of the total civilian population unemployed refers to people who are available for work and actively looking for a job but don t have one not in the labor force refers to people who are not looking for jobs because they have given up looking or are not interested such as students students working part time while going to school are counted in the employed category that means trump is counting students who are not looking for work as a part of the unemployed population technically those students don t have jobs but that does not fit the definition of unemployed and is especially problematic for this age group because the number of people who aren t looking for jobs includes people who are in school full time consider a 16 year old high school sophomore who is going to school full time and engaged in extracurricular activities when not in school the student doesn t have a job but isn t looking for one counting the student as unemployed defined as a person who s looking for a job but can t find one doesn t tell you anything about the labor market no economist i would think would feel comfortable using that because it s counting people who may have no interest in having a job said adam millsap research fellow for the state and local policy project at george mason university s mercatus center the bls did not come up with the definition of unemployed out of thin air it actually reflects aninternationally embraced definitionset by the international labor organization in 1982 if you apply trump s definition to white youth 49 percent are unemployed that s five times the official bls unemployment rate 10 percent for white youth asians fare worse than blacks using trump s fuzzy math the bls youth unemployment rate for asians is 9 6 percent lower than the rate for white youth but under trump s calculation the asian youth unemployment rate jumps to 63 6 percent seven times the official rate and even worse than the 58 percent figure for black youth see how the calculations for asian black and white youth compare in this graphic below thanks to millsap for helping us with the calculation the difference in asian youth rates may reflect a cultural factor millsap said fewer asian youths may bein the labor force because they are more devoted to school and work less even part time but their bls unemployment rate may belower because asian youth are more successful at finding a job if they look for one a campaign officialpreviously told the fact checker that its calculation is a more comprehensive reflection of disengagement from the labor force than the unemployment rate as it includes those who are not finding work because they are discouraged from previous attempts at employment but the campaign did not respond to our latest inquiry specifically for this fact check for an explanation of why the campaign includes those who are not interested in looking for work i e students if trump really is interested in the rate of disengagement among black youth there is an academically accepted measure hecan use it scalled neet which stands for neither employed nor in education or training this measure factors out students altogether and measures the share of disconnected youth aged 16 to 24 pew research center s drew desilver who has written about youth unemployment and neets calculated a 2015 neet rate among black youth 16 to 24 at 20 9 percent of the total civilian non institutional population compared with 14 7 percent among white youth of the same age range youth unemployment is higher among blacks than whites regardless of the method you use but trump s figure doesn t show how it s a persistent problem for black youth compared with white youth and fails to accurately reflect the state of the labor market for black youth 16 to 24 years old pertrump s math a 24 year old college graduate who is actively looking for a job but can t find one is in the same situation as a 16 year old high school sophomore who is in school full time and going to band practice or playing on a school sports team when not in class and pertrump s math more asian youth are unemployed than black youth even though asian youth have a lower official bls unemployment rate than whites or blacks so trump ends up using a calculation for black youth that greatly exaggerates the actual number of people who can t find a job even though they are trying while minimizing their rate in the context of asian youth we previously awarded four pinocchios to trump s absurd calculation that the real unemployment rate is 42 percent about eight times higher than the official bls rate he applies the same junk analysis for the black youth unemployment rate whichdefies internationally accepted measures of unemployment while ignoring an actual measure of disengaged youth that could prove his point we awardtrump four more pinocchios about our rating scale send us facts to check by filling out this form sign up for the fact checker weekly newsletter receive the most important pandemic developments
