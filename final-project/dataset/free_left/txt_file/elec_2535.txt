advertisement supported by the importance of owning an ugly moral choice by linda hirshman ms hirshman is the author most recently of reckoning the epic battle against sexual abuse and harassment let s be clear i believe tara reade i believed anita hill too remember the buttons i wore one what s the constant here joe biden then the bumbling head of the senate judiciary committee during the clarence thomas confirmation hearings now the presumptive democratic presidential nominee long before ms reade before the reports of the rubbing and the sniffing i interviewed an adviser to ms hill who said she d tried to warn mr biden of what was happening in the thomas hearings how unchecked republicans were smearing an upright woman s character but the united states senate was still very much a boys club back then the adviser told me and there was no getting through to him democratic primary voters knew all about mr biden s membership in that boys club when there was still time to pick someone else alas so what s a girl to do now discounting ms reade s accusation and one after another denigrating her corroborating witnesses calling for endless new evidence avowing that you hear her is nonsense we are now up to four corroborating witnesses including one contemporary corroborating witness unearthed by rich mchugh who was ronan farrow s producer at nbc news during the harvey weinstein metoo reporting and one larry king live tape so stop playing gotcha with the female supporters of mr biden or the metoo movement making them lie to the camera or perhaps to themselves about doubting her to justify their votes i ll take one for the team i believe ms reade and i ll vote for mr biden this fall i won t say it will be easy i have been writing on and agitating for women s equality since the feminine mystique came out in 1963 i know how supposedly liberal men abused the sexual revolution in every imaginable way i am unimpressed by their lip service to feminism their harvard degrees or their donations to feminist causes in 1998 i was one of a few establishment feminists to argue on behalf of monica lewinsky when the unofficial representative of the movement gloria steinem threw her under the bus in the pages of the new york times to protect bill clinton i maintained my position until two decades and a metoo movement later ms steinem issued a non apology for the essay so i hate hate hate to say the following suck it up and make the utilitarian bargain all major democratic party figures have indicated they re not budging on the presumptive nominee and the transaction costs of replacing him would be suicidal barring some miracle it s going to be mr biden so what is the greatest good or the greatest harm mr biden and the democrats he may carry with him into government are likely to do more good for women and the nation than his competition the worst president in the history of the republic compared with the good mr biden can do the cost of dismissing tara reade and worse weakening the voices of future survivors is worth it and don t call me an amoral realist utilitarianism is not a moral abdication it is a moral stance utilitarianism arose from the industrial revolution a time of terrible economic inequality and abuse it was intended to make a moral claim for the equality of all creatures who can feel pain and experience pleasure weigh it don t a few extra cents for each worker matter more than the marginal dollar for the boss weigh it won t the good for all the americans who will benefit from replacing donald trump with joe biden including the masses of women who will get some crumbs count for more than the harm done to the victims of abuse utilitarian morality requires that i turn my face away from the people i propose to sell out monica lewinsky tara reade this is agonizingly hard for me to do pretending not to believe the complainants which is what is taking place with ms reade or that they re loose nobodies which is what much of the media did to ms lewinsky is just an escape from the hard work of moral analysis and it adds to the harm how is feminism advanced by casting a reasonably credible complainant as a liar better to just own up to what you are doing sacrificing ms reade for the good of the many contemplating the act makes me feel a little like gloria steinem circa 1998 i was so sure i d never do what she did and i still think saving mr clinton for two years at the cost to ms lewinsky was a terrible move denigrating ms lewinsky denied all women s vulnerability to powerful men and replacing mr clinton with another democratic centrist al gore would have been a perfectly acceptable outcome but it also makes me remember why ms steinem did it the other side at the time embodied by the special counsel kenneth starr was so awful mr starr s censorious republican party seemed to pose much more of a threat to women s interests than mr clinton s libertinism did today the trump pence ticket looks even worse mr trump credibly accused of rape and a confessed grabber of women s genitalia and mr pence who will not dine alone with a woman other than his wife whom he calls mother combine both mr starr s and mr clinton s belief systems offering voters in one ticket the full spectrum of misogyny mr biden that relic of the good old boy senate years seems positively benign by comparison but even that probably would not be enough to make me abandon the claims of justice and vote for him in face of credible accusations of sexual assault fortunately for my sanity there s more once again philosophy offers an answer to my quest for justice philosophers for at least three centuries have known that there can be no call to justice in a situation of extreme scarcity david hume who originated the analysis suggested that nobody can be expected to behave justly when trying to survive a shipwreck the great modern philosopher john rawls called moderate scarcity or the absence of extreme scarcity one of the circumstances of justice the trump administration and the republican party that he represents are unassailably the political equivalent of hume s shipwreck offering only hatred rejecting facts refusing accountability they represent the wreckage of the american ship of state we knew that before 70 000 americans died of covid 19 in a spectacle of villainy and incompetence but when you are faced with a distasteful moral choice it can be useful to be reminded of the immensity of the stakes in making that choice it may not be just but i m swimming away from mr trump s sinking ship as hard as i can if i have to i ll vote for mr biden i hope i m not going to drown anyway linda hirshman is the author most recently of reckoning the epic battle against sexual
