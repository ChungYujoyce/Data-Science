joining us today it is great to have you on the show jim sciutto really appreciate the opportunity michael morell so jim your book the shadow war inside russia and china s secret operations to defeat america that was published a couple months ago so congratulations on that jim sciutto thank you michael morell and i want to spend a lot of time talking about it but before we do that i want to ask you about your service at the u s embassy in beijing you re a career journalist so how did you end up working for the u s ambassador to beijing jim sciutto this was one of those opportunities that came my way unsolicited but when it came i just felt couldn t turn down the opportunity just too much of a learning opportunity and i ll tell you i was at the white house correspondents dinner this was in 2011 happened to be the night of the bin laden raid no connection but i found myself seated next to the incoming ambassador to china gary locke and i d had a history of interest in studying china and so he and i ended up talking the whole evening about china and then that led to a dinner and a lunch and a dinner and then in those conversations he came around to saying he could bring one person with him to china and he was looking for someone kind of outside the box not a typical person from inside government and asked me if i d be interested and i hadn t thought in those terms but i thought here was an opportunity to be inside the u s china relationship at a critical time my next question was to my wife and she was willing and then once she was we decided to go michael morell yeah so what did you learn about the relationship about the u s government from being on the inside as opposed to being on the outside looking in jim sciutto well i think from the outside particularly as a journalist you can have an impression at times that folks if they don t know everything they know so much right you have these enormous resources of intelligence and you know just the reach of the state department and access to information and they do know a lot but at the end of the day you have people working with incomplete information making the best decisions they can you know that better than me and trying to figure out how to make things happen so that was helpful you know as i cover and for most of my career i ve covered government and the intelligence agencies state department et cetera so it gives you a sense of how they operate you know they re doing their best right like all of us they re doing their best with imperfect information don t always make the right decisions sometimes you know make wrong decisions michael morell sure jim sciutto but they do their best to get to the right place michael morell so did you have access to intelligence jim sciutto i did i had a security clearance you know top secret sci i did which was listen that was a privilege michael morell yeah and what was your sense as a journalist right of seeing that how much value did it add to your understanding vice what was available in open sources jim sciutto first of all it s a privilege to do that it s something you respect as you know you learn a lot but again you realize that it doesn t tell you everything that you have tremendous resources information and then you have analysts doing their best to connect the dots and it doesn t necessarily give you a perfect answer and this is something when i cover intelligence a whole host of stories i always try to make this point on the air that you know intelligence is not some sort of magic silver bullet it s not a crystal ball right michael morell right jim sciutto it is a lot of information and folks make decisions and in those reports again as you know better than me oftentimes they ll say here s what we know here s what we don t know and here s our best guess michael morell okay the book which i think is terrific and i think everybody should read it why did you write it why did you choose to focus on this particular topic jim sciutto i ll tell you as a journalist through 20 25 some odd years of covering china and russia and being on the ground in places where the u s interacts with china and russia it struck me that we look at this relationship in you know one front at a time as it were at least we in the public sphere and journalists and don t connect dots as to how this whole relationship is coming together and that folks know about the election interference they might know a bit about russia s annexation of crimea so on or china s manufacture of islands in the south china sea they hear about you know russian bombers buzzing alaska or ships et cetera and look at them in general and don t connect the dots that actually this is a strategy for confronting the u s for trying to level the playing field with the u s undermine the u s where it can beyond that what was interesting to me was that china and russia two very different countries two different histories geographies languages you name it seem to have struck upon a very similar way of countering the u s and in fact it s not a secret strategy it s written in their documents you know we ve come to call the russian approach the gerasimov doctrine this kind of hybrid warfare approach to countering the u s chinese have a different name for it winning without fighting you know confronting the u s getting what you want undermining where you can but below the threshold of a shooting war and that s the shadow war michael morell yeah so that s the definition of a shadow war jim sciutto yes michael morell okay so have we seen shadow wars before in history or is this a relatively new concept and if it s new why now jim sciutto it s my impression that it is relatively new i mean shadow war tactics individually are not entirely new there have been influence operations through the years going back to soviet times there s been election interference there have been you know small conflicts short of all out war with the intention of territorial gain all that kind of stuff what struck me is that you know bringing these all together particularly with technologies is new part of it s a product of a single superpower kind of world is that russia and china know they can t beat us head to head in a shooting conflict so here s a way you know ultimately it s asymmetric warfare right michael morell right right right right jim sciutto from two very formidable adversaries but ultimately it s asymmetric and it s aided by new technologies you know the russians of course have interfered in past elections cyber capabilities super charged that right then there are other elements of this which i think a lot of americans just aren t aware about and one that i m particularly fascinated with is the space element is that you know we ve become more dependent on space people are generally aware of that but they don t know that russia and china have space weapons deployed right now with the intention of being able to blind us weaken our capabilities militarily and even in the civilian sphere in the event of a all out war but even short of that michael morell yeah so maybe we ve seen elements of shadow wars before but now it s come together as an actual strategy maybe that s what s new jim sciutto yes yes exactly michael morell so you just said something really important is that most americans don t understand this right why not jim sciutto because frankly our leaders aren t talking about it that way right they re not connecting the dots for them and that s at the very top it s even on capitol hill you hear pieces of this i mean the president s certainly talking about a trade aspect of this the president talks about the theft of private sector and national security secrets which is i got a whole chapter in the book on that too that is part of the shadow war again it s a way to level the playing field steal our most sensitive secrets but connecting it into a bigger picture is something that you just don t see now if you talk to folks in the intelligence agencies in the national security sphere they re beginning to think in this way the national defense strategy they talk a lot about these capabilities but the american people don t hear it sufficiently you know you asked me earlier why i wrote the book one is seeing these patterns and trying to draw attention to them but the other piece is just i m an american you know i spent a lot of time in these countries covering these countries and i do it driven by a sense of public service that i feel i don t do with any political motivation whatsoever if you read the book you see that i spread the blame around a bit for the slowness among american leaders officials et cetera to see this happening it s not a political issue it s an american issue michael morell okay so china and russia the two antagonists what i d love to do is take them one at a time and so let s start with china how is china specifically waging a shadow war what tools are they using what battlefields are they choosing jim sciutto okay let s take it through one theft of our deepest secrets it s certainly true in the private sector sphere i mean this is one of the essential issues of the trade war right is that u s companies when they operate in china first of all they don t have the same access that we give chinese companies but also chinese companies up and steal their intellectual property they do it every day sometimes that s part of the agreement sometimes they just up and steal it beyond that china is waging a very successful cyber campaign to steal our national security secrets i focus on just one man in the book a guy named su bin who over the course of four years with two partners in china stole hundreds of gigabytes of data on three of america s most advanced military aircraft the f 35 the f 22 and the c 17 and folks in the pentagon will know that china s flying three planes that look a lot like the f 35 the f 22 and the c 17 michael morell they look a lot like it yes they do jim sciutto and you know this better than me michael morell yeah yeah jim sciutto and i interview in the book bob anderson who used to be in charge of the fbi s counterintelligence efforts and i asked him what percentage of chinese operations like this is the fbi aware of and he said if we re lucky one in ten 10 michael morell wow jim sciutto so for every su bin you made the point and they caught su bin granted after four years he s currently in prison they did catch him but he did a lotta damage before then for every su bin there are nine others who that we might not know about michael morell yeah okay so thousands jim sciutto yeah so that s one front theft space china has today floating at low earth orbit medium earth orbit and up to geostationary orbit satellites that china claims are maintenance satellites or friendly objects in space but that u s space command and i spent a lot of time at space command for the purpose of this book views as at a minimum dual use technologies but satellites that are weapons in effect that can either blind our satellites with directed energy weapons i always tell people there are already lasers in space they could ram them old school just blow them into smithereens but china also in the last couple of years u s space command discovered them testing and deploying a satellite with a grappling arm that has the capability of lifting another satellite out of orbit now the chinese say well we have got repair our satellite what better way to fix it laugh u s is not so certain of that and they ve seen china test this capability right up to geostationary orbit that s 22 000 miles up to do that requires tremendous technology situational awareness in space et cetera the u s is concerned about space and china knows we have a tremendous advantage in space particularly militarily so that s a good place to try to take us down then submarine technology china making big advances russia as well but china has diesel electric submarines that are very quiet one of them popped up in the midst of a u s carrier group couple of years ago scared the bejesus out of them because when you don t know where a sub is that allows that power to project nuclear power right up to your shoreline and then the final point i ll make is old school 19th century as president obama called it territorial acquisition although china putting a new twist on it in the south china sea just up and manufactured you know a territory which has since been militarized michael morell right so what s the motivation on the part of the chinese what are they trying to achieve here jim sciutto big picture long term to up and surpass the u s as the most dominant global superpower it s been in their documents in their strategies going back to 1949 michael pillsbury wrote a book about this the hundred year marathon and they write about it so this is about retaining or getting back what they see michael morell getting back right jim sciutto as their rightful place at the top of the world the middle kingdom at the back of you know the middle of the universe so that s part of it michael morell with every other country being its vassal jim sciutto exactly and there s a lot of history there s a lot of politics and nationalism behind that a sense of our position having been stolen away by the west and we re going to get it back rightfully that s a piece of it on the other side to at least make it a fight with the u s in the event of going to war you know u s intelligence officials will say china doesn t want to go to war and you ll hear that about russia too but if they do they want to be able to play on a level playing field and those go together you know and they call the strategy winning without fighting ideally they get what they want below the threshold of a shooting war again that s the art of the shadow war but if they have got go to a shooting war they want to be ready to fight michael morell is there a domestic political aspect to this jim sciutto in china michael morell yeah jim sciutto absolutely you know i always say that china is not a democracy but it has domestic politics that factors into the whole trade war right now and that you know china is as loath not to be seen as backing down to the u s as the u s is michael morell absolutely absolutely jim sciutto to china so this idea that xi s suddenly going to buckle you know i think we should be skeptical of but big picture again particularly when you speak to the chinese today and i spent a lot of time there i love the country so many good friends there there is not far below the surface a lot of pride and a lot of nationalism this is our time you know and again the people share this sense that they had their rightful decision taken away i will say that generationally it s concerning because when i was in china when i would go to universities and meet with students what struck me is the students were more nationalistic than their teachers because the students have only lived in a world where china is on the rise and that should be concerning michael morell yeah you know this long term aspect that you talked about i had dinner one night with four chinese intelligence officers and they were talking about good and bad millennia so they were talking about this good 1 000 years this bad 1 000 years right and we re focused on quarters jim sciutto yeah michael morell right jim sciutto yup michael morell so jim one of the chapters in your book focuses on the south china sea and i think you give a really good excellent history of the issue how would you summarize what happened there for americans who might not necessarily have followed it jim sciutto okay so just for background south china sea it s right in the middle of the most important shipping lanes in the world 40 of world commerce goes through there but also on top of what is perceived to be enormous natural resources it s hundreds of miles from the chinese coast they claim it as their own historically and then you have half a dozen other countries who claim it who are much closer by the way michael morell it s great to actually see a map of their view jim sciutto it is exactly michael morell of the south china sea right jim sciutto well you got vietnam you have malaysia indonesia philippines treaty ally the philippines by the way who all say that it s their territorial waters and it is worth if you re at home just google a map of this because it s pretty darn far away from the chinese coast and historically they have a map you might hear referred to as the nine dash line where a few decades ago they just drew a line that kind of encompassed it on kind of dodgy historical basis anyway you have a bunch of rocks down there they re above the surface of the water at low tide kind of thing that starting in 2014 though these areas were disputed china just goes in there starts building islands they start dredging up the dirt and piling the dirt on top adding thousands and thousands of acres of land over the course of just a few months claiming them as their own and then over time adding things like long runways and hardened hangars and surface to air missile sites i had the opportunity and i tell the story in the book of flying on a u s surveillance plane over the south china sea in may 2015 a p 8 as it was flying over these islands which is part of the u s strategy here listen we consider this international airspace therefore we re going to keep flying over it and we watched from up there as they were building this stuff there were 20 30 some odd dredgers in each of those islands and they were making fast progress now china gave an assurance to president obama they would not militarize and they broke that assurance and now china has what the navy sometimes refers to as a few unsinkable aircraft carriers in the south china sea michael morell okay so let s shift to russia i m going to ask you the same set of questions okay so how are they waging the shadow war what tools are they using what battlefields are they choosing jim sciutto okay so battlefields very similar to china s so one certainly in cyberspace election interference being the most prominent but not the only one and that s something that they did quite effectively in 2016 attempted again in 2018 and there is no question it s not a question of if but how much russia attempts to interfere in 2020 when you talk to anybody in that space michael morell it s going on right now jim sciutto and it s happening as we speak and talk a lot about this in the book that some of this is election focused but a lot of it is permanent in that it s every day you know their intention is not just to influence the election itself but to influence the political conversation in the u s and seek any division and exacerbate that division that s why they love to occupy spaces like black lives matter gun control even take a knee and michael hayden i interviewed him for the book he has a great story in there and he s written about this more extensively about you know it was obvious to u s intelligence when russia started to get into the take a knee space you know of course the protests in the nfl taking a knee during the national anthem because they were often miswriting the hashtag instead of take a knee they were saying take the knee and michael hayden makes the point you know that articles are often the toughest thing to get right in foreign languages and that s how they knew that those were was an easy way to spot that those were russian trolls who were putting them in so it s an ongoing influence game influence campaign by russia in cyberspace russia also has weapons in space today and the u s has watched them they shadow sensitive u s commercial and surveillance satellites circling them like a u boat circling you know a freighter during world war ii they circle them up in space testing these capabilities both with the possibility of ramming and destroying satellites or blinding them with directed energy weapons et cetera submarines i got to take a trip on a u s nuclear submarine under the arctic where they were doing and they do these every couple of years the icex exercises michael morell being a journalist is cool right jim sciutto you know it s funny and particularly you know if you eat this stuff up like me it s funny i was on that sub under the arctic on my birthday last year and a lot of my colleagues were like oh it s a shame you had to spend your birthday and i was like you kiddin me it was the best place i could imagine and they made me a cake but practicing up there in these exercises tracking russian subs in what is a new frontier in this a new great game over influence in the arctic and what the commanders will say is that russian subs are getting quieter and harder to detect and like with china although russia s capabilities are more advanced a submarine that s quieter and harder to detect could pop up off your coastline and in the event of war launch nuclear missiles so there s a military competition there s a cyber competition there s a space competition and then finally there s old school 19th century land acquisition ukraine you know they up and stole a piece crimea in 2014 they still occupy large parts of eastern ukraine as well michael morell first land grab in europe since world war ii jim sciutto exactly and i tell folks all the time because i think people think of the ukraine as a million miles away i was like it s in europe you know it was seeking closer cooperation with the e u and you know if russia can do that there where do they do it next and that s the concern michael morell so their motivations right how does that compare to china s motivations jim sciutto so big picture russia and it struck me as interesting driven by the same sense of regaining its rightful place in the world although the theft of its rightful place is more recent they go back to 1991 the collapse of the soviet union their perception you hear this a lot from putin that they were taken advantage of by the west et cetera so getting back to being relevant again in the world that s one piece you also have a sense that they re zero sum game players any chance they get to stick their thumb in the u s eye is a win for them there s a little bit of that so i think those two factors what struck me is a connection between china and russia in this sense is that chinese leaders study the fall of the soviet union intensely because that s a cautionary tale for them you know the ccp the chinese communist party they re like we re not going to be those guys we have got to watch that we don t collapse the way they did michael morell so there was one chapter on russia that i found particularly interesting and that s a chapter on estonia what happened in estonia in 2007 jim sciutto so this is the first chapter in the book and i look at this something as the first salvo in the shadow war i mean of course there were signs before but in estonia in 2007 russia launched really the first and the largest nation on nation cyberattack it was a cyberattack intended to really shut down and cut off estonia estonia is this remarkable country right on russia s border couple million people there but extremely technologically advanced i always remind people skype started in estonia they got a pretty good track record but they ve also been way ahead of the curve on doing things digitally they voted digitally first they banked digitally you know very dependent on this so around 2007 really ahead of the game for us they re more dependent on these things than we were and russia launched a giant ddos attack in effect they took over thousands tens of thousands of computers in more than 100 countries created these big botnets that basically flooded estonia with requests for information shut down their news government websites banking websites et cetera while on the ground they had kind of manufactured riots you know with ethnic russians you know sort of expressing themselves that kind of thing scared the bejesus out of the estonians because i spoke to folks spoke to the defense minister who was in charge at the time their concern was was this the preface to a land attack you know and they had a lot of reason to be concerned about that but even short of that it was enough where eventually estonia just to get back on its feet had to turn off the switch and cut the country off and it was a warning sign many years before for instance the interference in the 2016 election many years before these kinds of attacks that we ve come to see more often north korea s attack on sony and elsewhere but at a scale and with a skill that really was a warning of how far russia was willing to go and how powerful cyber capabilities could be michael morell so would you call it kind of the first shot in this shadow war jim sciutto i do i do and i don t want to be too you know exaggerate because there were aggressive acts prior to that and aggressive statements by putin but in terms of a nation on nation attack yes in many ways the first one michael morell so that s just a great transition i think to american awareness of the shadow war right you said earlier that you think we were slow to see this slow to realize it as a government as a country why jim sciutto i had the benefit in this book of speaking to a lot of current and former officials who were directly involved in the administrations republican and democrat as this was happening jim clapper michael hayden current head of strategic command john hyten ash carter former defense secretary john scarlett used to head the mi6 and what they said self critically in fact was that they fell victim to mirroring with both russia and china mirroring in that looking at russia and china and saying that they want what we want welcome them into the international system they will liberalize they will democratize they will see russia will see if you invite them into a partnership agreement with nato that this is good for all of us when in reality they looked at that system and those organizations as skewed to our will and inherently skewed to our interests and there was a lot of contradictory evidence through the years even as leaders again both parties and officials kept to that assumption they had trouble kind of jettisoning that assumption and they re doing so now ash carter also makes the point that by the way we had 9 11 and we had two wars going on which and your resources were focused elsewhere michael morell exactly exactly so jim now that we do recognize it right how would you characterize the american response so far jim sciutto it s coming together it s not there yet they re discussing strategies at the military national security level you have the agencies and the departments beginning to respond i spent time in the nsa for this and you know they are aggressively defending against cyberattacks and under the trump administration you had a step forward the president enabling cyber command to be little more forward leaning in terms of offensive measures you know planting cyber weapons that you could turn on in effect in the event of the need for retaliatory action so you have some moves in cyberspace still a debate underway about how to respond to the space threat there are reasonable concerns about if you weaponize as well do you create a new space arms race and will that make things even worse but certainly space command is thinking in defensive terms about hardening satellites i spoke to officials who talked about kind of sending up the equivalent of carrier escorts with satellites to allow them to defend against these weapons so cyberspace with submarines there is an effort to bring more advanced submarines online more quickly to respond to this to operate in places where you didn t have to for a while but now by the way russia and china are back there i mean i remind people one consequence of the syria war is now russia again has a naval base in the mediterranean they re operating in the mediterranean so you have steps at that level but what still hasn t happened is our leaders articulating a strategy across the board but also i think making americans aware of the nature of this conflict at this point and at each level if you talk to the sub commanders if you talk to the guys flying the spy planes you talk to folks in the nsa ops center they will say to win this you need a whole of government response and that requires presidential leadership and that s something that they haven t heard yet and it s not obama administration officials who are saying that it s the folks on the front line who are saying it michael morell right right right how do you think we re doing on managing that and to what extent do you think the politics of russian interference is getting in the way of us doing what we need to do to stop the political influence jim sciutto enormously because we could just say it it s a matter of public record you have a president commander in chief who denies at times that the interference even took place or at a minimum that it s important you know we re an environment now where facts are partisan things and even national security issues have become extremely partisan things because we know that the president his senior officials are told not to bring up election interference with him he makes it an automatic association with his victory but that then gets to resources being directed at defense and you see that not just with the president but if you look at the u s senate you know why is it so hard to get election security measures through at this time because even that question has been politicized and that s a problem and again you know when you talk to the folks who are fighting it on a daily basis or even when you talk to city lawmakers of both parties who are briefed on the threat they will tell you there s no doubt it happened it s happening it s important and they re getting better at it and yet those things have had doubts cast upon them for political reasons and that weakens the american response michael morell so did you give any consideration to adding iran to this piece or is it more contained geographically and therefore you jim sciutto it did i did consider adding both iran and north korea because both of them use shadow war tactics you know it s asymmetric warfare so by nature smaller adversaries they really have no choice it s logical it makes sense it s good strategy and you know north korean and iran have directed energy weapons they don t quite have the capabilities of russia and china but in terms of dazzling satellites or blinding satellites what happened in the persian gulf in the last month or so clear shadow war yeah michael morell shadow war right absolutely jim sciutto i mean like the plausible deniability on these explosives placed on the ships that kind of thing and as i was watching it i was like man you know that s right on the mark i mean the reason i focused on russia and china is one because when i ask the intel folks consistently what are your top threats they will always put russia and china at the top partly just because of size and their nuclear powers doesn t mean iran and north korea can t do damage so that s part of it and the other piece that struck me is just that these are two very different countries and yet they ve struck on this similar approach for dealing with and undermining the u s michael morell they figured something out here jim sciutto yup they did michael morell so a couple of final questions jim number one in both the introduction and conclusion of the book you draw a parallel between the shadow war today and american s foreign policy in the 1930s talk about that jim sciutto here s the thing is that if we time traveled ourselves back to the 1930s before you know 1939 invasion of poland before japan s invasion of china in 1937 you had saber rattling by these countries you know at the time that was often dismissed say listen we can talk to them we can find common ground let s not get too caught up in this well and then this was a key point that always stuck in my mind give them a little and then they won t want more right like give them the eastern stretches of europe and they re not going to want to come this way you know let japan make trouble in china that s as far as it s going to go now i don t want to say you know that this is the equivalent that we re facing world war iii here necessarily but it does strike me that that kind of aggression if it s not countered then is encouraged and that s the concern and don t take my word for it that s the concern of the folks who are on the front lines of this even if it s smaller bore than a full on war because if you give a signal that it s okay to occupy ukraine in the first invasion since world war ii what are you saying about estonia a nato ally if you give ground in the south china sea have you sent a signal about taiwan when i ask folks in the pentagon with both china and russia what are the two next possible flashpoints that are at the top of their mind they ll say taiwan in asia and estonia you know so it may not be on the same scale but the lesson is the same that you know granting aggression doesn t normally end too well michael morell so that s the second question so you end each chapter with a section called lesson right why did you do that jim sciutto and i m far from a teacher or a professor i do feel that in this environment in this news environment information environment people are kind of inundated with stuff and stories and information and warnings et cetera and i just wanted at the end of each chapter to just in a couple pages bring it down to say here s what the smart people are telling me about what we ve learned from this front or this war and the next wave forward and i try to tie that in at the end in a final chapter where i ask the smart people i said okay give me ten steps for how to respond to this and those steps are not crazy ideas they re not even that difficult at the end of the day things like clear leadership and setting clear red lines but i just thought that that was an you know to make this stick i wanted to tell folks the way forward michael morell the book is the shadow war inside russia and china s secret operations to defeat america the author is jim sciutto jim thanks for being with us jim sciutto it was great to talk to you it s a real honor thank you end of transcript first published on august 21 2019 6 39 am 2019 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the
