democratic candidates felt blindsided and current benedict students have shared mixed reviews about the president s participation in the criminal justice forum the weekend longevent co hosted by benedict and the 20 20 bipartisan justice center will focus on the next steps that should be taken to improve criminal justice reform after the passage ofthe first step actlast year cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchellspoke with a dozen hbcu students and alumni across four southern states who also expressed varying sentiments to news of the president s visit some are calling the move disrespectful and political while others feel the visit should be expected considering trump s approval ratings among african american voters others argue that it s still a significant event whenever a sitting u s president visits an hbcu campus still others say the forum is an opportunity to browbeat the president with concerns and requests on criminal justice and federal funding for hbcus with the backdrop of an hbcu that has played a key role in the fight for civil rights and the overall empowerment of african american students many will be watching to see how the critical issue of criminal justice is handled one benedict alumni who is a pastor in florida says classmates are concerned because they don t know what the president might say or how students will respond national urban league president marc morial tells cbs news that even though the president signed bipartisan legislation to reform criminal justice he s hoping this isn t just a political photo op at an african american college i m not going to take bipartisan criminal justice legislation away from him but it doesn t balance out against many of the policies particularly the judicial appointments the lack of diversity in the cabinet and of the white house staff that deeply concern us says morial while we always celebrate when a president goes to a historically black college it doesn t take away from the damage that many of his policies are causing david sheppard senior vp general counsel and cos for the thurgood marshall college fund says that the trump administration has been responsive to concerns raised by tmcf and other organizations that represent the interests of hbcus and minority serving institutions sheppard cites thehbcu capital finance programas an example of legislation that has positively impacted some hbcus there have been some positive things that have happened during the trump administration relative to engagement with hbcus says sheppard the fact that the president s willing to come to one of our campuses to talk about an important issue in america today i think is significant and hopefully it s an opportunity for it to be an open forum on that issue or other issues that impact our schools marc morial is married to cbs this morning saturday co host michelle miller joe biden joe biden s supporters are making money moves reportscbs news campaign reporter bo erickson since president trump s re election campaign directed millions of dollars aimed at disrupting biden s rise to the democratic nomination the former vice president returned middling fundraising

amendment to overturn citizens united and end the era of unbridled spending by super pacs the key words here are as president since these are principles biden has been pushing even before he launched his third presidential bid last year in an interview withpbs he even took credit for convincing bernie sanders to speak out against super pacs in the 2016 democratic primary contest what to watch for a group of wealthy and well connected biden backerswere already mulling starting a super pac to boost their top choice is this their greenlight the super pac as of now is not fully baked but moving in that direction according to a supporter involved former biden 08 communications director larry rasky who has been organizing a potential super pac sent a statement saying we intend to fight back against the lies and distortions we re seeing now from trump his allies the russians and the republican party while other candidates have groups supporting their efforts no other democrat has to fight

also have a responsibility to intervene when there is advertising that will contribute to voter suppression asked if he would support the breakup of big tech buttigieg remarked yes i believe that the breakup of big companies is a remedy that should be on the table he added the ftc and other federal bodies should be empowered to protect consumers and protect individuals and when there are anti

splanto work towards ending the deadly opioid epidemic and address substance use disorders o rourke toldcbs news campaign reporter tim perry we re going to make sure that anyone with a substance use disorder gets the help that they need are not treated as a problem for the criminal justice system but an opportunity for the public health system in this country the plan lays out four goals ending the stigma around substance use disorder supporting the access to healthcare and various forms of treatment targeting the supply chain which would include putting pressure on china to stem the flow of fentanyl into the u s and ensure that those in recovery have economic stability and opportunity bernie sanders at 4 20 p m bernie sanders campaign released amarijuana legalization policy besides the legalization of pot via executive order in the first 100 days of his administration the plan is tailored to appeal to african american communities with ideas like a 10 billion usda grant program to start urban and rural growing operations this program is one of four multi billion dollar grant initiatives to help underserved or neglected communities benefit from the marijuana industry sanders would pay for those programs with a tax on the legal marijuana sales one senior adviser toldcbs news campaign reporter cara kortethat the effort to legalize marijuana is a direct attempt to solve a corrupt racist criminal justice system the plan will also expunge the criminal records of marijuana offenders and implement clemency reform by creating an independent clemency board outside the justice department and instead in the white house it would eliminate barriers to public benefits for people who have interacted with the criminal justice system and the plan would eliminate drug testing requirements from future benefits and ensure people cannot be removed from public housing for marijuana use the campaign would also take revenue from the tax to invest money into communities hit hardest by the war on drugs finally in line with sanders lifelong pursuit of breaking up large corporations the plan aims to get ahead of what it has coined big marijuana the plan states that just as big tobacco intentionally deceived consumers and marketed towards children the marijuana industry if left unchecked could do the same the sanders plan would incentivize marijuana businesses to be structured like nonprofits and prohibit marketing to young people it would also ban tobacco cigarette corporations from participating in the marijuana industry elizabeth warren one of elizabeth warren
