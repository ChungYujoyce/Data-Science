the following is a transcript of an interview with former fda commissioner scott gottlieb by cbs news margaret brennan that aired sunday april 12 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan former fda commissioner dr scott gottlieb has been helping us on face the nation educate our viewers since we began devoting our broadcast to covid 19 coverage and he joins us from his home in connecticut once again this morning thank you for your help doctor i want to ask both the governor and the mayor said before they even consider what dr fauci said which is a rolling reopening in in their areas that they need surveillance they need testing they need things that they say they do not have in place right now who s leading that effort whose job is that dr scott gottlieb well unfortunately i think it s going to be the states leading the effort i the feds are going to backstop the states but the feds are pretty tapped out as well and and didn t have a lot of resources to put against this to give you sort of a basis for comparison you re gonna be hearing testing tracing treating as sort of the mantra going forward and the tracing part of that that s actually doing contact tracing when you identify people who have the infection you want to trace who their contacts are to give you sort of a reference in wuhan in china they had 1 800 teams of five people each doing contact tracing at the height of that epidemic so about 9 000 people right now cdc has about 600 people deployed across the country the states are supplementing that but the states need to increase their resources now the feds are gonna have a hard time pulsing their resources in the throes of this crisis so i think it s going to be up to the states and a lot of it s going to be on the governors in massachusetts you saw baker make a move to hire 1 000 people to do that contact tracing work other governors are going to have to follow that lead margaret brennan well the difference between china and the united states is protection of civil liberties here so how do you do something like surveillance which is an uncomfortable world word for a lot of people here is it something like an app like apple and google proposed this week dr gottlieb well that app that s a platform that that google and apple are are fashioning it s basically like a pipeline for public health authorities in states or localities to try to use it if they want to do electronic contact tracing i think a lot of people are going to be concerned about that but remember contact tracing is sort of the bread and butter of public health work we do this when we have outbreaks of multi drug resistant tuberculosis or measles where when you identify people who have an infection you want to identify people who they were in contact with isolate them and get them tested as well that s how you can control outbreaks i think one of the concerns that we need to address right now is what happens when you identify someone who has the infection you re gonna want them to self isolate for a period of time while they re infectious but people may be reluctant to do that and they may be reluctant to have governments enforce that self isolation say you have to stay at home for two weeks and so i think businesses need to think about how they provide compensation basically paid leave for people who are forced to self isolate because they have the infection and the government might actually want to pay those people to give them an incentive to step forward because if it s seen as punitive if it s seen that when you get covid 19 you re going to be forced to self isolate for two weeks you re going to miss work and you re going to be out of money then people aren t going to want to step forward margaret brennan yeah dr gottlieb and get diagnosed and you don t want to create a disincentive to diagnosis margaret brennan doctor stay with us i have to take a commercial break here but i ll be back in a moment with you and stay with us commercial break margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we want to pick up where we left off with former fda commissioner dr scott gottlieb we were talking about the projection by dr fauci that you could have a rolling reopening of the economy by next month what parts of this country have the systems in place or the ability to open up that soon dr gottlieb well look i don t think anyone s optimized really right now we re not going to have the testing in place we re not going to have the public health employees hired to do the effective contact tracing so you know there s no question we re going to be opening at some at some risk i think that s inevitable there s a lot of pressure right now from the business community on not just the administration but governors as well to start reopening the economy so i think inevitably we re going to see a slow reopening of business activities through may with some risk but there s always going to be risk and if you ask public health officials like me what the optimal amount of testing is the answer we ll give is more but we re not going to be where we want to be so i think you re going to see a gradual reopening where businesses where governors and mayors say well businesses can reopen but you can only bring back 50 percent of your employees that are on any one shift so you force the employers to break up the shifts maybe you tell people over the age of 65 to stay home a little longer you tell businesses you can t have meetings more than 10 people you can t have conferences so there ll be measures put in place to try to limit interactions at the workplace but allow some work to get on margaret brennan the fda has said it it may approve a serology test that s the the test for the antibodies in your blood in sometime in the next few weeks what does that do to your timeline and how widely available would that be dr gottlieb well it may be widely available but i think it s of marginal utility and impact for these kinds of discussions what serology tells you is if you have circulating antibodies in your blood if you ve been exposed to the virus and you ve developed some level of immunity but i think when we actually do serology on the population we re gonna find the actual level of exposure across the population is very low somewhere between maybe 2 or 5 percent and i d put on the low end of that range that s certainly the modelling the data coming out of europe where they have anywhere from 2 to 5 percent of their populations exposed if you look in certain professions healthcare workers police people who work on grocery checkout lines flight attendants tsa agents people who come in contact with a lot of people as part of their work the rates may be higher maybe on the order of 10 percent that have been exposed and developed some immunity so you can make decisions in those professions to preferentially return certain people or put certain people on the frontlines right away but on the whole we re gonna find that a very small percentage of this population certainly in the single digits have actually been exposed to this infection so the perception that there s 30 or 40 percent that have been exposed and develop immunity it s not going to be the case margaret brennan we know that this is a global pandemic the president has said that he is reviewing u s funding to the world health organization the u s gives about 100 million a year to it they re leading the response around the world what changes do you think need to be made dr gottlieb well look i don t think this is a time to defund a w h o given the fact that i think this is going to become epidemic in the southern hemisphere in parts of the world that don t have resources to deal with with this kind of a global issue but the president raised a lot of valid concerns china was not truthful with the world at the outset of this had they been more truthful with the world which would have enabled them to be more truthful with themselves they might have actually been able to contain this entirely and there is some growing evidence to suggest that as late as january 20th they were still saying that there was no human to human transmission and the w h o is validating those claims on january 14 sort of enabling the obfuscation from china i think going forward the w h o needs to commit to an after action report that specifically examines what china did or didn t tell the world and how that stymied the global response to this i also think they need to embrace taiwan s role in the global health community and allow them to attend the world health assembly right now they ve frozen china out the w h o has at sort of the behest of china and that s hampered the global response because china s been a very important partner to give you just one more anecdote china didn t share the viral strains margaret brennan right dr gottlieb and the w h o should have made them do that had they share those early on we could have developed a diagnostic test earlier validated earlier margaret brennan well we will see what the president decides to do in the coming days dr gottlieb as always thank you
