advertisement supported by party conventions are in jeopardy campaigning is on hold and local candidates are playing the role of good samaritan instead of traditional politician by jonathan martin reid j epstein and maggie haberman from the white house to the county courthouse the coronavirus pandemic has drastically upended the 2020 elections many democratic leaders now doubt their national party convention will take place as planned in july while president trump s determination to hold the republican convention could collide with life and death realities both mr trump and former vice president joseph r biden jr are wary of holding public events too soon and may not engage in full fledged campaigning until the summer and hundreds of congressional statewide and local candidates who are always overshadowed in presidential years are turning to the role of good samaritan aiding with groceries and hiring people newly out of work in an effort to stay visible without being insensitive to the crisis the virus has fundamentally transformed political life in america affecting how candidates communicate with voters raise money from donors and confront their opponents this is for now the country s first virtual campaign as the risk of disease physically separates candidates from the people they seek to represent and pushes officeseekers from mr biden on down to appeal to homebound voters and contributors through balky web videos even when more traditional electioneering resumes the nature of this race will be profoundly different the outbreak which has already claimed more than 2 000 lives in the united states and well over three million jobs has thrust the public health threat and economic downturn to the forefront in races up and down the ballot this year incumbents at every level starting with mr trump will be judged on how they prepared for and steered the country through a crisis that has turned the life of nearly every voter upside down this is the question that is going to dominate the election how did you perform in the great crisis said representative tom cole republican of oklahoma who has canceled fund raisers and instead scheduled tele town hall events with guests like the provost at the university of oklahoma health sciences center the duration of the election season itself is likely to shrink significantly the presidential campaign which typically dominates news coverage for much of the year could look more like one of britain s six week general election sprints should the two major american candidates return to the stump before the fall they will most likely be crowded out by the grim accounting of the country s worst pandemic in over a century regional disparities in how the virus is spreading could mean that officeseekers may be able to campaign in parts of the country that are less hard hit and if the social distancing measures in place mitigate the outbreak the contenders could return to the parade and banquet circuit sooner than some anticipate but until the spread of the virus slows there is likely to be little interest in the presidential race and even less in state and local races representative sean casten democrat of illinois has culled his campaign s phone bank list to voters 60 or older rather than ask them policy questions or trumpet his accomplishments mr casten s volunteers ask if they need any health and safety information and provide a list of senior only hours at local supermarkets nobody wants to talk about my thoughts on carbon pricing said mr casten who was a renewable energy executive before he was elected to congress in 2018 at the moment there effectively is no campaign of any consequence to voters who are consumed with their family s safety and well being every issue in my district is impacted by this said representative elise stefanik a republican who represents much of new york s vast north country this is going to be an economic issue it s going to be a higher ed issue it s going to be a border issue the long sweep of american history is filled with presidential elections that took place during times of war and upheaval but there is little modern precedent for a campaign unfolding against a backdrop of such widespread national fear the closest comparison may be the new york mayoral race in 2001 when the sept 11 terrorist attacks loomed over the city s general election in presidential politics the vietnam war assassinations and civil rights struggles shaped the 1968 campaign and seemed to reveal a country coming apart but some historians believe the closest comparison to this year the last time the entire nation was consumed by a single issue may be 1944 when the threat of nazi germany and imperial japan fully mobilized american citizens behind the war effort that was the last time there was this sort of disruption in our daily lives and change in rituals said doris kearns goodwin the presidential scholar noting that millions were deployed in arms and those who remained home lived with rationed goods but at least people then could go to work be part of the effort to win the war sensing opportunity mr trump has sought to portray himself as a wartime leader in daily televised news briefings it has given him a bump in the polls with his approval ratings creeping up toward 50 percent as independents and some democrats rally behind him while mr biden the likely democratic nominee is largely drowned out by the president and even gov andrew m cuomo of new york it s a defining moment said henry barbour a republican national committee member from mississippi adding of mr trump the more he reassures americans gives them the facts and delivers results the harder it will be for joe biden a race that turns entirely on the response to the current health and economic crises could also render other traditional campaign markers less important if they happen at all while mr trump is loudly insisting his convention will go on in charlotte n c in late august it remains to be seen whether the democratic governor roy cooper would allow such a large gathering in his state s most populous city democratic officials are even more skeptical about their convention hundreds of local and state conventions have already been canceled or become mail in telephone or online events there s talk among some democrats of conducting the national convention online or through the mail with some operatives and fund raisers discussing a one night television event that could replicate a star studded awards show the d n c is going to have to start considering that this convention will have to be held in other ways said ken martin the democratic chairman in minnesota who is also the president of an organization of state democratic leaders for now democrats are using a barrage of ads to try to remind voters of mr trump s initial dismissal of the virus s severity but it s been difficult to broadly divert attention from the threat of the moment some in the party however believe the president will ultimately be held to account for his slow response the unfolding damage to the economy and will suffer from the new light the crisis will cast on domestic issues in the fall the administration s court case to repeal the a c a takes on a very different meaning said guy cecil who runs a democratic super pac referring to the legal effort to strike down obamacare in its entirety but the larger question for mr trump may be whether he can sustain the appearance of a wartime leader able to summon americans to sacrifice updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities the president has already displayed impatience and pique that could damage his re election chances lashing out at governors refusing to take any responsibility for the coronavirus crisis and suggesting americans can return to life as usual in a way that experts say could exacerbate the spread of the virus his campaign is already discussing the possibility of a rally style event in one of the less affected states in late april although one adviser said those discussions are preliminary while they would have preferred to use the months before mr biden formally claims the nomination to define the former vice president to their advantage republicans generally believe this crisis has done little to diminish mr trump s prospects his campaign continues to raise money online at a brisk pace but republican officials privately conceded it has been harder to raise money without events featuring the president fund raising has been even more difficult for other candidates on the ballot who often rely more on big dollar in person events rather than internet solicitations corry bliss a republican strategist said he expects fund raising totals for federal candidates from the first three months of the year to be down about 20 percent from what they would have been without the pandemic

ms homrich a former home depot executive began sorting through dozens of emails from people seeking campaign staff work which in the age of virus means calling or writing people from one s own home hiral tipirneni a former emergency room doctor running for congress in arizona said she spends just as much time explaining the details of the pandemic in phone calls video chats and during facebook live sessions as she does asking people to vote for her in november they have medical questions ms tipirneni said it s a scary time and whatever i can do to alleviate some of those fears it s a moral
