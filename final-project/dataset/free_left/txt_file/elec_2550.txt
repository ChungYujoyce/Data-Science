on thursday night both hillary clinton and donald trump spoke at the alfred e smith memorial foundation dinner in new york city it s an annual charity event with high powered political and media figures that s usually lighthearted and fun weeks before the last presidential election mitt romney and barack obama put in funny self deprecating performances there this was not that donald trump spoke first and his speech was deeply strange he began with a riff that delivered properly could have come off as lighthearted but with his actual delivery sounded embittered and angry trump and a special hello to all of you in this room who have known and loved me for many many years the politicians they have had me to their homes they have introduced me to their children i have become their best friends in many instances they have asked for my endorsements and they always wanted my money they even called me really a dear dear friend but then suddenly decided when i ran for president as a republican voice rises that i ve always been a no good rotten disgusting scoundrel and then totally forgot about me trump went on to make some slight movements in the direction of self deprecating jokes while never quite landing one though he did manage to deliver a good joke about his wife melania s plagiarized convention speech prefacing it by saying this one is going to get me in trouble trump you know the president told me to stop whining but i really have to say the media is even more biased this year than ever before you want the proof michelle obama gives a speech and everyone loves it it s fantastic they think she is absolutely great my wife melania gives the exact same speech and people get on her case and i don t get and i don t get it i don t know why but eventually he started saying things that were barely even jokes but were mainly attack lines from his campaign trump hillary is so corrupt she got kicked off the watergate commission how corrupt do you have to be to get kicked off the watergate commission booing pretty corrupt note this is not true hillary is and has been in politics since the 1970s what is her pitch the economy is busted the government is corrupt washington is failing vote for me i have been working on these problems for 30 years i can fix it she says further jokes included here s an example of the reaction from one attendee i don t know why i m watching this alsmithdinner but i m so glad i caught this part i flat out just died pic twitter com pfuigrskmn clinton went up right after trump and delivered a speech that while more self deprecating and better delivered than the gop nominee s did take potshot after potshot at him she repeatedly joked about trump s talk of a rigged election saying for instance come to think of it it s amazing i m appearing after donald i did not think he would be okay with a peaceful transition of power and she took shots at his sexism overall the crowd seemed uneasy with both performances and it was clear that there was no love lost between the two candidates in this very nasty election year when clinton mentioned how it had been a long long campaign viewers likely agreed and yearned for its promised end get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
