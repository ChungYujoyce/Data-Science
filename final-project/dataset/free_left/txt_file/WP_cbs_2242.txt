watch cbsn live by caitlin conant may 8 2020 7 07 pm cbs news california governor gavin newsom signed an executive order on friday to ensure every registered voter in the state is automatically mailed a ballot ahead of the november general election mail in ballot is important newsom said but he added that theexecutive order is not an exclusive substitute to physical locations secretary of state alex padilla who is pushing for a 50 statevote by mail planahead of the general election said this order makes california the first state in the nation to respond to covid 19 by taking this action of sending every voter a ballot in the mail in advance of the november election padilla said the state will not force voters to choose between protecting their health and exercising their right to vote padilla also said postage for those mail in ballots will be prepaid so voters don t have to scramble last minute for a stamp i think that is huge padilla said there is no safer physically healthier way to exercise your right to vote than from the safety and convenience of your own home he added padilla also insisted this is not a vote by mail only election but the republican national committee issued a statement highlighting what it described as voter fraud that could result from vote by mail while we have always supported absentee voting california is a case study in why automatically sending this many ballots is a problem the rnc statement said just last year a court found that l a county had 1 5 millionineligiblevoters on their registration lists meaning there were 112 more registered voters than adults living in the county we are weighing our legal options to ensure the integrity of the election trump campaign communications director tim murtaugh made a similar argument calling it a thinly veiled political tactic by newsom to undermine election security there s a vast difference between people voting absentee by mail because they can t be at the polls on election day versus mailing everyone a ballot murtaugh said sending everyone a ballot even those who didn t request one is a wide open opportunity for fraud cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidarreports local counties have until the end of this month to provide the state with clarity on their plans for in person voting requirements newsom said if those plans are not in by may 30 a second executive order might be needed to resolve issues california already allows vote by mail but voters have to specifically make a request for the ballot this executive order makes it so that every voter is automatically mailed a ballot without having to make that request during the march 3 2020 presidential primary more than 75 of california voters received a vote by mail ballot under this executive order every registered voter who is currently living in california will receive a ballot 29 days prior to election day military and voters living abroad will be mailed their ballots 45 days before
