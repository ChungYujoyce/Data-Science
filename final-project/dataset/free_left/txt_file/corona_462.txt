advertisement supported by the president who has watched the economy plunge amid social distancing measures says restrictions will be reassessed by maggie haberman and david e sanger president trump on sunday night said that the government would reassess the recommended period for keeping businesses shut and millions of workers at home after this week amid millions of job losses caused by the efforts to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself mr trump tweeted in all capital letters shortly before midnight at the end of the 15 day period we will make a decision as to which way we want to go officials have said that the initial 15 day period for social distancing limiting close contact between people by banning gatherings closing schools and offices encouraging remote work and urging people to maintain a six foot distance from one another is vital to slowing the spread of the virus for which more than 30 000 people in the united states have tested positive the 15 day period would end monday dr anthony fauci an infectious diseases expert and a member of the white house coronavirus task force has said in interviews that he believed that it would take several more weeks until people can start going about their lives in a more normal fashion other infectious disease experts suggest even harsher measures than social distancing are required to truly beat back the outbreaks in the united states but at the white house in recent days there has been a growing sentiment that medical experts were allowed to set policy that has hurt the economy and there has been a push to find ways to let people start returning to work some republican lawmakers have also pleaded with the white house to find ways to restart the economy as financial markets continue to slide and job losses for april could be in the millions vice president mike pence indicated on sunday at a white house briefing about the virus that the centers for disease control and prevention would issue new guidelines on monday allowing some people who have been exposed to the coronavirus to resume working outside their homes if they wear masks the move could set the stage for states with relatively low numbers of cases to begin to unfreeze their economies while large states like california and new york where there are more cases and where state officials have ordered nonessential businesses to close for the time being could continue remaining in a holding pattern while some business owners are eager to end the more draconian measures that have been put in place others would rather endure the pain at once rather than face repeated disruptive orders to stop activities mr trump s tweet cast doubt on his confidence in the path to fighting the virus that he so reluctantly approved for two months he largely dismissed the warnings that the virus would reach american shores for fear of causing economic disruption predicting that cases would go down from a handful to zero in a few days only when the disruption came anyway in the form of a historic stock market sell off was he convinced to act but there could be consequences to ending the measures too quickly the recent rise of imported cases in hong kong after there had been an easing of the spread of the virus is something of an object lesson about how difficult it is for any territory to keep the virus out in a tweet on monday morning thomas bossert the former homeland security adviser who for weeks has been vocal about the need for the u s government to take stricter measures said sadly the numbers now suggest the u s is poised to take the lead in coronavirus cases it s reasonable to plan for the us to top the list of countries with the most cases in approximately 1 week this does not make social intervention futile it makes it imperative whatever the president chooses to do there will be businesses still fearful to reopen and employees fearful of going to work as new cases of people infected with the virus are still being diagnosed by the thousands each day and the president is facing potential pushback from the public health experts in his administration after being slow to publicly react to the spread of the virus the trump administration swung in the other direction at the end of february entrusting the health experts whose counsel had not been heeded in the preceding weeks and letting them help set the policies that hundreds of millions of people would be urged to follow but mr trump has become frustrated with dr fauci s blunt approach at the briefing lectern which often contradicts things the president has just said according to two people familiar with the dynamic mr trump knows that dr fauci is seen as credible with a large swath of the public and with journalists and so he has given him more leeway to contradict him than he has other officials but the president has also resisted portraying the virus as an existential threat in a way that the public health experts have in an interview with science magazine that was posted online on sunday evening dr fauci responded to a question about how he had managed not to get fired by saying that to mr trump s credit even though we disagree on some things he listens he goes his own way dr fauci continued he has his own style but on substantive issues he does listen to what i say updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities but he also said there was a limit to what he could do when mr trump said things that were not true during those briefings i can t jump in front of the microphone and push him down mr fauci said of mr trump s erroneous statements ok he said it let s try and get it corrected for the next time in an interview with fox business network the treasury secretary steven mnuchin stressed that the u s economy was still functioning i ve seen a bunch of fake news over the last couple of days about a complete shutdown of the economy he said the president has not made that decision later in another fox interview mr mnuchin said the cure can t be worse than the disease the president s interest in potentially easing some of the social behavior guidelines met with pushback from one of his close allies senator lindsey graham republican of south carolina president trump s best decision was stopping travel from china early on mr graham tweeted on monday i hope we will not undercut that decision by suggesting we back off aggressive containment policies within the united states david mcintosh the president of the anti tax club for growth suggested friday that the damage to the economy was severe we need to act to contain the virus but at the same time more people would be hurt and have terrible health and life consequences if they don t reopen the economy mr mcintosh said they have to put an end to the social distancing some time in the near future to restore economic activity carl hulse contributed reporting advertisement
