the divorce between britain and the european union started in june 2016 closure doesn t appear to be coming anytime soon they say that breaking up is hard to do it s one thing to declare i m out of here it s something else entirely to disentangle finances and come up with custody arrangements if divorce between two people is seldom tidy imagine the complications when the split is effectively between a country and a continent the united kingdom is learning this the hard way british voters decided to exit or brexit the european union ending a long marriage that was in june of 2016 more than three years later you might say that the u k is still sleeping on the couch this past thursday the deadline to leave passed without resolution yet there is a certain uniquely british theatricality to brexit a mix of colorful characters conflicts threats promises but still no clear exit strategy john bercow in parliament order order he may demand it but order has been in short supply lately at the palace of westminster john bercow in parliament be a good boy young man be a good boy thought partisan politics was an exclusively american issue take a look at the mother of parliaments boris johnson in parliament i have to say mr speaker i have never heard such humbug in all my life you d be forgiven for thinking you d walked into a street fight with considerably nicer upholstery barry sheerman in parliament this prime minister to talk about morals and morality is a disgrace john bercow order it falls to the speaker john bercow to preside john bercow calm unlike nancy pelosi this speaker doesn t usually vote his job keeping well order in theory anyway john bercow order jon wertheim can we get you a gavel they make those would that make your job easier john bercow i m not sure it would and its very un british to have a gavel in the chamber although there is a general requirement of brevity most people doubtless myself included think that we are being briefer than we are laugh and most people are in favor of brevity as long as it is someone else s the dividing lines the united kingdom s decision to exit the european union the 28 country political and trading bloc this issue has not only engulfed the doorsteps of parliament but the country as a whole brexit will impact every bit of the economy from roaming charges to auto parts from cattle to cod paul joy whose family has been fishing for centuries cannot wait to leave the european union and its limits on his catch paul joy it s as bad as we ve ever seen it s been decimated over a period of time i can remember the days fishing when we just had to go out there and fish and there was no such things as quotas we had abundant fish stocks before we entered europe to understand the current scrap over brexit it helps to understand an ancient dispute the battle of hastings which certainly isn t lost on these guys who reenact it every year in 1066 william the conqueror defeated the anglo saxon king harald and the norman conquest changed england forever becoming an important plot point in britain s complicated relationship with europe fool you re talking to a fool sir i am not a great political theorizer or a historian in the great tradition of shakespeare the fool knows of whence he speaks fool as long as there has been an england there has been an opinion upon europe on a clear day you can look out across the english channel here and see the french port of calais only 20 miles away but if you really want a sense of just how close the united kingdom sits to mainland europe consider these sheer magnificent white cliffs of dover they represent the original split between this country and that continent hard proof that the united kingdom and europe were once quite literally attached this geological brexit came tens of thousands of years ago during an ice age since then the cliffs serve as a fortress protecting against invasion and also serve as a reminder that this is truly an island jon wertheim this ambivalence toward europe here what do you attribute that to matthew parris the ambivalence towards continental europe in britain is very very deep rooted and very long standing indeed matthew parris was a conservative member of parliament in the 1980s for the last 20 years he s been a columnist for the times of london matthew parris i mean i could laugh go back to elizabeth i the spanish armada i could go back to catholicism the catholic plots henry viii i could go back to the first world war the second world war it was after the second world war that winston churchill encouraged the creation of a european bloc so as never to repeat the horrors of the first half of the 20th century winston churchill call it maybe the united states of europe in 1973 britain joined what became known as the european union a single market with no customs no tariffs and effectively no borders it s a trading treasure says gina miller a prominent london businesswoman jon wertheim you re saying the same way food and cars and medicine goes from kansas to missouri that s the kind of seamless relationship you have with 27 other countries gina miller it is and we have you know if you look at that whole population we have a market on our doorstep of over half a billion people jon wertheim the combined population gina miller the combined population of the eu member states jon wertheim and people too right poles can come here to work and brits can go to paris and berlin gina miller yeah we ha we ve had freedom of movement has been really crucial to our economy because we ve been able to plug the gap when it s come to certain skills unified countries in europe can compete with the u s and china but this borderless britain so appealing to miller is precisely what enrages the so called brexiteers such as nigel farage an aggressively polarizing figure nicknamed the godfather of brexit jon wertheim for years you ve had a slogan i want my country back where did it go and where do you want it to go nigel farage well you know if you have foreign judges if you have foreign parliaments if e u law is superior to your law you can t even control your own borders you can t even catch your own fish in your territorial waters it s not you know you re not a country by posing in front of a billboard featuring middle east migrants farage played on fears of mass immigration inflaming tensions and his campaign to leave europe picked up traction with more mainstream politicians by the summer of 2016 british membership of the eu was put to a referendum enter boris johnson stage right reliably rumpled and strenuously self parodying johnson was ending his tenure as london s mayor and seeking to feed his national political ambitions brexit provided nourishment boris johnson can we go forward to victory on june the 23rd yes we can johnson became the frontman for british citizens nostalgic for empire and feeling left behind in a changing world matthew parris i think the brexit people knew very well what they were playing to they they adopted a very effective slogan quite early on which was take back control and it was devilishly effective jon wertheim we re regaining what was once rightfully ours matthew parris make america great again laugh a result that surprised even johnson the vote passed 52 to 48 in favor of leave so it was the door to 10 downing street became the revolving variety the prime minister david cameron resigned over the brexit result theresa may came in only to resign herself when she couldn t get brexit done she was replaced by boris johnson last july brexit brought delays and uncertainty and grim projections that the british economy would shrink significantly as a result of leaving acting as a private citizen fed up with it all gina miller demanded that parliament have a voice on such a critical issue so she filed a lawsuit jon wertheim you took the government to the supreme court the highest court in this country not once but twice you are a busy woman laugh why did you undertake this gina miller it sounds maybe a flippant thing to say but nobody else was going to do it and i m sorry you have to consult and debate with parliament before we leave the eu miller won her cases pushing parliament to center stage which in turn helped mint an unlikely star in the never ending brexit caper john bercow in parliament let me say to people bellowing from a sedentary position stop it john bercow speaker of parliament john bercow in parliament the house must calm itself zen restraint patience for centuries the speaker has been a neutral arbiter pinned to the sidelines not this speaker consistently ruling against the brexiteers he s put himself squarely in the center of the action his supporters say that he has modernized the role brexiteers say bercow oversteps as though the referee has suddenly become the captain of the opposing team bernard jenkin in parliament it is becoming remarkable how often you please one lot and not the other lot john bercow what i say about that is that you should always view with some suspicion and reserve people who when they re losing or think that they re getting a rough deal moan about the referee and i think these moaning minnies ought to cease moaning but do they bother me do i lose sleep am i going to find that my hair turns even whiter as a result of the rancorous demonstrations of discontent by some of these characters no i couldn t give a flying flamingo about their protests geoffrey cox in parliament this parliament is as dead as dead can be jon wertheim that was the attorney general john bercow yes well he s entitled to his view but he suffers from the notable disadvantage of being wrong bercow may have emerged as a most unlikely cult figure but he has leaned in to his celebrity john bercow jon welcome to the state apartments of speaker s house moments after a critical session last week he invited us to his modest apartment deep inside the palace of westminster surrounded by ghosts of speakers past john bercow now here we come into what is called the corner room and for a man once slurred by a government minister as a sanctimonious dwarf bercow rather gamely was quick to bring up the topic of his height john bercow i m not the shortest speaker in uk history three predecessors he insists were smaller and then he delivers the punchline john bercow although i do have to admit that this was true only after all three of them had been beheaded laugh jon wertheim they d all had their heads cut off so john bercow yes jon wertheim that s why they they lost six inches john bercow that s right after ten years in office speaker bercow retired this week with his head intact if only barely as for boris johnson he d long promised that brexit would happen by october 31st vowing that he would rather be found dead in a ditch than face another delay boris johnson there will be no further pointless delay guess what october 31st has come and gone a new election has been called for next month and the uk remains in brexit limbo jon wertheim what does that say about the state of the u k right now gina miller i think we ve lost our minds basically laugh jon wertheim lost your minds gina miller i mean on the world stage we were seen as being pragmatic sensible stiff upper lip soft power we are the people who do that so we have damaged our reputation on the world stage jon wertheim it seems so off brand for this country gina miller it is completely off brand but i think it s a moment of madness jon wertheim to paraphrase a brexit tabloid headline i saw today what the hell happens now laugh john bercow what the hell happens now well the truth of the matter is i don t know and i think anybody who predicts with alacrity the outcome of the brexit saga is either an extraordinarily sophisticated person laugh or a rank fool produced by michael h gavshon associate producer cristina gallotto copyright 2020
