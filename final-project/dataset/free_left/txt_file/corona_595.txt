please read our updated privacy notice and terms of use effective on december 19 2019 the mythical american curtain raiser to adulthood the four or so years of finding yourself freedom and higher learning is having a reckoning may 1 the date when most colleges ask that the students to whom they ve offered admission declare their intentions for the fall has come and gone with many students and their parents unsure of what they should do facing the prospect of mass deferrals many schools are granting families extra mull time because nobody not the schools not the families not public health experts or politicians knows whether it will be safe or wise or legal to be on campus in september the financial wreckage from that uncertainty could be massive already the university of michigan anticipates losses of 400 million to 1 billion this year across its three campuses california s university system suffered 558 million in costs due to the coronavirus in march alone meanwhile the number of students pursuing a college degree could be the smallest in two decades according to an april survey of 1 100 high school seniors and current college students by simpsonscarborough which specializes in higher education research domestic undergraduate enrollment for four year institutions could decline by 20 percent one out of ten high school seniors report that they no longer plan to attend a four year institution a quarter of current college students say they wouldn t return or it is too soon to tell and 12 percent of high school seniors are thinking they ll take a gap year as opposed to the normal 3 percent and this is still with the possibility of campuses being open in the fall if college remains purely an online pursuit come september those numbers will almost definitely grow even before the pandemic college seemed on an unsustainable path tuition was rising as was student debt many state schools never recovered the taxpayer funding lost during the great recession the richest schools have become unimaginably richer hoarding their endowments while educating a tiny lucky elite while the student masses seeking the credentialing necessary to step behind the picket fence of a middle class life commute to nonresidential schools often while working full time those are also the kids most likely to drop out under financial strain and everybody is under financial strain right now the thin membrane of space in their budgets that allows them to study suddenly gone the pandemic has not only exacerbated college s underlying economic instability but has at least for now upended the form of the university itself as student life is reduced to a pixelated screen and the college experience is stripped of its self realizations and rites of passage its a cappella groups and keggers hookups and hacky sack the question now is whether and to what extent those changes will persist beyond the current crisis will this mass experiment with online education turn more students on to lower cost online degrees or will it only make the in person experience of college life seem all the more valuable the pandemic is a monkey wrench dropped into the middle of our cobbled together public private higher education machine freezing it up and just possibly breaking it i ll definitely defer most international students do not get financial aid and so the cost benefit analysis of paying 35 000 per semester to take classes on zoom is just not worth it especially with the global economy at the moment most of the foreign currencies have devalued very very heavily against the dollar which makes it more expensive for us maria paz rios junior duke university i applied early decision to emory if the first semester is going to be online i m going to take a semester off because it wouldn t be as gratifying if i was doing it from my bedroom i ve been living in a city my entire life and i was looking forward to meeting people from all over the world you can t really learn from them as much when you re just all on a tile on the screen evan covey incoming freshman emory university our track season was taken away from us a week before our first meet we didn t even get the chance to step on the track i text with my coach every other day and i ll take videos of myself running and she ll tell me what i can do better but you definitely don t get that detailed coaching if this fall semester is done virtually i will take a leave of absence from school ana lamoso junior babson college i don t think i am getting really what i pay for some professors aren t even teaching live professors are just saying watch the old lectures from last year and take notes off that i have heard one story of somebody wanting to just move to australia if it goes online to take a year off as much as i would love to be a part of that if i were to not go next year i would be screwed i d have to go for another year or two just to get back on track with my major lauren abbott junior university of washington i think that people are starting to get the hang of online learning so it wouldn t be a huge deal if we still had to stay home it would however be a problem for my financial aid because i am relying partially on work study but if they end up having in person classes i will still go i want to graduate more than anything and i m not going to let this pandemic get in the way of that i m going to school as a backup plan i really want to be an actor but i want to have a degree in something that i can fall back on daniel ward junior university of new mexico i tested positive march 25 i had been abroad in spain i think i got it on my flight home i wasn t wearing a mask and the guy behind me was coughing the whole flight because i had such a close experience with the virus i don t think it s possible to try to reopen in the fall to a great degree and if we were to be online and they were to require us to pay full tuition i wouldn t enroll it just financially doesn t make any sense to me the backbone of the college experience is the social element elizabeth wells junior brown university dr kat cohen founder of elite admissions counseling service ivywise financially colleges need to be open their operating budgets depend on tuition revenue and schools need students on campus to be spending money in the bookstore or the dining hall or on sporting events so there are a few different scenarios floating around right now for fall instruction one is a hybrid of virtual and in person this seems to be the most popular scenario where colleges have larger classes being virtual and smaller classes in person in large spaces where they can better socially distance we heard of a college considering turning an on campus ballroom into a large classroom where students can be better spread out they re also looking at adjusting the residential model dorms are pretty small and they re densely populated we ve heard of schools that are considering buying up local hotels or even casino spaces in order to give students single rooms so they can better spread out there are scenarios floating around where schools just bring their freshmen to campus so they can have the full experience and then have the upperclassmen live off campus there s also been the idea that schools will bring the incoming freshmen and the seniors and have the sophomores and juniors go virtual for the year the other scenario we re hearing is a fully virtual fall which is obviously not very appealing students at more than 25 schools are already suing their colleges for their spring tuition money and campus fees back if colleges end up being virtual this fall and losing their tuition revenue we re going to see a lot more of them close current high school juniors are worried about what the admissions process will look like in the fall and colleges really want to put high school students minds at ease so the admissions process is going to look a little different the admissions process is already what we call holistic grades and test scores are still the most important elements but with limited testing and many students receiving pass fail grades this spring i think we re going to see a big shift toward what i would call softer application elements like essays activities and recommendations the test optional movement has been gaining momentum for a while and i think this is the shift that needed to happen to expand this effort i ll tell you what we re doing right now with our students we re advising them to continue to enthusiastically engage with their virtual learning so they can enhance the recommendation letters recommendations are going to be another one of those soft factors that colleges are going to be relying on for the admissions process for fall and even into next year it s important for students to take a step back and find things to fill their time that are going to engage their core interests and make them happy maybe what they didn t have time for during the school year colleges really want to see how students adapt to this unusual time and while they re not expecting students to be creating vaccines or writing novels they want to see them getting creative so maybe they re very interested in art history and pursuing this with online virtual tours of street art around the world and writing a blog about it they re reading more about their areas of interest and reading more books in general outside of school they re helping out more in the home i mean there are other things they could be doing that are valuable some of the tougher conversations are with the athletes because they may or may not be able to play their sport our international students are the most unsure if they re going to be able to attend in the fall even if school is open but we re also talking to families where the student is on a wait list and all they want to do is get off the wait list they don t care if school is online and for the families who can afford it and the student has gotten into their top choice school they are for the most part saying they ll take whatever is offered to them because they are so happy about getting into that first choice school they re thinking well the first year might not be the same but you know the second third and fourth year it s going to be great as told to anna silman carol christ chancellor university of california berkeley pandora s box has already opened there is a fair amount of delivery at varying levels of success of curriculum remotely but what will be different now is that every college and university will have had some experience with remote learning and can choose how and when it s appropriate to use it i think we re going to see a lot more hybrid instruction that might be able to overcome some of the barriers distance or room size have imposed on classes but i don t think there s going to be one megauniversity that successfully embraces this partnership with a tech company and everybody else is out of business because there s a social dimension to the college experience that s really ingrained in our culture kids and their families are still going to want to spend time going to college in a particular place there are going to be some institutions that are not going to be able to make it and i m worried about what will happen with international enrollments because i think that our institutions should be global institutions and i worry that there s going to be a real chilling effect on that philip j hanlon president dartmouth college you can t understate the importance of the psychological shift that s gone on within the faculty in traditional colleges and universities historically online was not what we did it wasn t that it was bad it s just what we did was different now online is a capability that we have i think that this covid pandemic is going to speed up the diversification of our educational models but if there s anything that this pandemic has highlighted for us at dartmouth it is how much our students miss being in residence i imagine that a kind of passive learning experience could be developed in conjunction with google or microsoft and be widely disseminated but i don t think it will achieve the same kind of mental growth and quality of mind development if you think about it the age old way i would notice someone was falling behind is i would be lecturing in class and i would look for the puzzled deer in headlights look on joe s face that s why i think that the residential in person experience is going to remain the gold standard i think that in the next year or two life overall is going to get smaller there will be less travel less mobility less ambition less wealth more concern for health life at college will grow smaller too social life will be more circumscribed and cautious the demand for smaller classes will rise both for the safety they provide and for the close connection with the professor and other students fewer students will want to leave home for college they ll be going to school closer to where they grew up pursuing a fancy degree will mean much less than it does now those small colleges that can make it through this year may find themselves in very high demand next year mark edmundson professor of english university of virginia after the second world war through the baby boom there were just not enough seats in the primary schools so there were what were called double sessions half the school would come in the morning half the school would come in the afternoon i think that could be where we re heading in higher education unless there is some miracle vaccine so any given college they would say to half of their students you ll be here for six weeks then you will go out and the other half will come and during the six weeks when you re home you will go to school remotely robert zemsky professor of education university of pennsylvania graduate school of education many of the faculty are really onboard with if we have to be online in the fall coming up with the best way what we could offer that s better than just lecture based teaching is there more peering into different groups of students and what they re working on and giving feedback it appears that what s happening is kind of a creative surge it s exciting a lot of students i ve talked to are thinking through deferring if it s online but i mean if you defer what are you going to do are you just at home in your parents house or is there some better model maybe you could rent a house with a bunch of other students in your year somewhere that s really cheap you socially distance from everyone else you do online classes and you try and help solve the problem melissa franklin professor of physics harvard university there are roughly a quarter of a million students at cuny many of them the first in their family to go to college they might live in apartments with their families and sometimes don t have their own rooms they take a subway an hour and a half to get to class they might not have wi fi one student told me sorry professor i m in the bathroom it s so loud in the house because everybody is home cuny is not a residential college but going to campus is the only place for many of the students to learn it used to be that our libraries are packed these students are going through it there are a lot who are going to drop out and work meanwhile summer school enrollment is up at baruch and that is online maybe people who would otherwise be going away to school are just going to get some credits from cuny shelly eversley chair of black and latinx studies baruch college the city university of new york i had spent four years thinking about how i was going to put my senior thesis work up in the gallery that s the reason i chose wesleyan because when i was a junior on college tours i stumbled upon the studio art theses and was so impressed by the work and the turnout and the community and then to have that just become a non reality it was really heartbreaking josh rabineau senior wesleyan university i had just nabbed my dream internship at instagram and i was supposed to be a small town girl in the big city and blah blah blah the story is more complicated because i immigrated from china so most of my family is still back there i spent most of winter quarter worrying about my family but i just thought that was completely separate from my life and when those two started to converge i was like oh no and then my internship was canceled i also realize that i m like so fucking privileged i feel so guilty feeling so bad for myself especially when i look at like my family in wuhan like my grandparents they hadn t left their apartment since chinese new year like i m going to be fine jessica liu senior northwestern university i think this experience has really shown us how much value college has i m not talking about the actual classes but the whole opportunities you have around it we take it for granted but once you re stuck in your home with no other choice you start thinking about all of the things you could have done with it clubs labs talking with teachers asking for mentorship stuff like that that you didn t i think people undervalue that just because college is kind of like the obvious next step for many people daniela rios senior boston university i m terribly terribly sad a lot of my undergrad was grinding working really hard to just try to get as many opportunities as i could from being at mit this was the first semester where i was able to really just relax i had my job lined up i fulfilled all my degree requirements it was the last semester to just really make those connections with people what i really gained from being there is always being surrounded by these people with this energy of trying new things and building new things now that i m like here alone it s a lot harder to have that energy isak romero senior mit i know there s so many other problems going on in the world right now but my graduation going online was devastating honestly i felt like i m going to go through this huge transition in my life without any closure i know i m graduating on sunday but there s nothing really marking that so it s hard to come to terms with i m a pr major two months ago i felt like i was going into an insanely stable job market it was going to be on me to pick where i wanted to work as opposed to like a company finally offering me something and now it s the complete opposite it s kind of just a scary reality going forward to enter this job market as a new graduate chloe citron senior syracuse university this article appears in the may 11 2020 issue ofnew york magazine subscribe now good new out of new york katie miller the highest profile trump administration member to have contracted coronavirus is doing better a real sign of the times georgia s governor bids for the rnc amid talk that charlotte might not host after all there needs to be something for democrats to panic about and right now this is it in early april jason furman a top economist in the obama administration and now a professor at harvard was speaking via zoom to a large bipartisan group of top officials from both parties the economy had just been shut down unemployment was spiking and some policymakers were predicting an era worse than the great depression the economic carnage seemed likely to doom president donald trump s chances at reelection furman tapped to give the opening presentation looked into his screen of poorly lit boxes of frightened wonks and made a startling claim we are about to see the best economic data we ve seen in the history of this country he said the former cabinet secretaries and federal reserve chairs in the zoom boxes were confused though some of the republicans may have been newly relieved and some of the democrats suddenly concerned everyone looked puzzled and thought i had misspoken furman said in an interview instead of forecasting a prolonged depression level economic catastrophe furman laid out a detailed case for why the months preceding the november election could offer trump the chance to brag truthfully about the most explosive monthly employment numbers and gdp growth ever risk public health or else president donald trump on monday morning threatened to move august s republican national convention out of north carolina unless there are guarantees the state will let everyone attend i love the great state of north carolina so much so that i insisted on having the republican national convention in charlotte at the end of august unfortunately democrat governor roycoopernc is still in shutdown mood unable to guarantee that by august we will be allowed full attendance in the arena he began in a string of four tweets the rncis scheduled to be held in charlotte on aug 24 27 less than a week after democrats are set to wrap up their rescheduled convention in milwaukee it s not clear where the republican convention might be moved or how easily that could be done on relatively short notice and this is only part of why the way too late european travel ban was a complete disaster the europe restrictions followed six weeks later but unleashed chaos in ways that surpassed even that of the muslim ban current and former officials said key agencies including the departments of homeland security and transportation had no meaningful input in the nature of the europe restrictions or how and when they would be executed an administration official said officials from both agencies were present at meetings where the ban was discussed the administration scrambled to round up contractors to conduct temperature checks on tens of thousands of passengers officials said the magnitude of the mobilization was unprecedented even so the contractors were overrun by the rush of travelers that trump had helped unleash even the most basic screening steps seemed to backfire the cdc failed to distribute a new paper questionnaire in time for it to be shared with airlines in advance meaning passengers had to fill it out upon arrival as a result travelers found themselves reaching around one another for slips of paper and pencils risking transmission as the bottlenecks got worse maybe his physical is still being audited it s been more than six months since president donald trumpclaimed to have started his annual physicalat walter reed hospital but
