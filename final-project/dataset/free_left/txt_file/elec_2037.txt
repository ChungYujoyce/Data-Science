 on her worst day hillary clinton will be an infinitely better candidate and president than the republican candidate on his best day bernie sanders i ll be honest i don t like hillary clinton personally there s plenty to admire about the former secretary of state she s incredibly bright broadly experienced and undeniably competent politically though she represents a broken system a system of capitulation and obfuscation there s no point in denying that i don t consider myself a democrat though i vote for democats almost without exception gore vidal once said that there is only one party in the united states the property party and it has two right wings republican and democrat i tend to agree with that now more than ever and i suspect most people of the left do as well i ve felt the bern for months and i ve felt it publicly if you ve read any of my pieces on sanders and clinton you know exactly where i stand bernie is the most authentic politician i ve encountered at any level of government i had no illusions about his prospects of winning this race it was always a long shot nor was i confused about sanders ability to change government if he was miraculously elected everything about our system is resistant to change a sanders administration would doubtless have been a disappointment for progressives given the systemic constraints but a sanders presidency would have been an enormous achievement a signal of sorts his campaign win or lose is itself a muted miracle and a reason for optimism we now know a genuinely progressive movement is possible in this country but here s the truth hillary clinton is going to be the nominee primary voters should still express their will and vote for bernie so long as they can and sanders should campaign until the convention but this race is effectively over the math is clear yes sanders is in a comparable position to obama during the 2008 race but this isn t 2008 and he doesn t have nearly the institutional support that obama had progressives don t want to hear that and i get it i really do but it s true nevertheless to win sanders would need to secure roughly 72 percent of the remaining delegates with paltry support among crucial demographics demographics that catapulted obama past clinton in 2008 it s not going to happen and even when sanders has won primaries or caucuses he hasn t won by large enough margins to alter the delegate math that leaves us with a regrettable but near certain choice in november hillary clinton or donald trump if that s how it unfolds i m voting for hillary clinton this really isn t a choice at all trump is a leering huckster a first rate con artist peddling hate to dunces a trump presidency would be a victory for every noxious and regressive force in our body politic we also have no idea who he is or what he would do in office that s positively terrifying despite the hand wringing among progressives president obama moved the country forward his triumphs were slow going and piecemeal but that s his way and it worked the unemployment rate is 4 9 percent 13 7 million new jobs have been added over the last 69 months more americans have health insurance coverage than ever same sex marriage has been legalized the american auto industry was rescued from oblivion two liberal seats on the supreme court were protected u s cuba relations have opened up we have a peaceful nuclear deal with iran we re gradually shifting away from our reliance on fossil fuels and the country has enjoyed eight years of a dignified scandal free administration hillary clinton if nothing else will preserve this progress she isn t leading a revolution and she s not going to usurp wall street s power everyone understands that but neither will trump worse still there s no reason to suppose trump can do the job he has no experience no platform no ideas and no respect for the office he can t be trusted on anything of import to progressives when you consider what s at stake no one on the left should prefer trump to clinton this a point that sanders himself concedes and it s why he ll surely endorse clinton if she is in fact the nominee a recent wall street journal nbc news poll found that a third of sanders supporters said they wouldn t vote for clinton if she becomes the democratic nominee i don t believe that will hold but consider for a second what might happen if it does to begin with it would likely hand the white house to donald trump even if you reject clinton s positions on foreign policy and a host of domestic issues as i do she is still preferable to trump and if you re a progressive the fact remains clinton reflects your values far more than trump if you care about the supreme court which is a conservative judge or two away from denying women autonomy over their own bodies the choice is obvious if you care about raising the minimum wage or reforming the criminal justice system or addressing climate change or protecting voting rights the choice is equally obvious our democracy such as it is can sustain a competent clinton administration nothing much will change but it won t descend into chaos either progressives will have to wait for an elizabeth warren or some other candidate to emerge in the meantime though we re staring a potential trump administration in the face no one knows what the hell trump is he s practically an abstraction what we know is that he s uncorked all the racial and cultural bile this country has to offer and he s threatening to dump it at 1600 pennsylvania avenue he must be stopped sanders has proven that democratic voters and the country more generally will respond to a fdr style populist someone unafraid to say what we all know about our corporate oligarchy clinton isn t that candidate but she will hold the line far better than donald trump or ted cruz sanders gave birth to a progressive revolt in this country and he moved the democratic party to the left it falls to his supporters to continue that movement beyond this campaign to keep the pressure on clinton and other elected officials in november however there will be two names on that ballot and one is infinitely better than the other that s the reality unpleasant though it is all the grumbling about voting against a candidate rather than for one or about the dolefulness of choosing the lesser of two evils is perfectly understandable but it doesn t change a thing politics is often about what s possible not what s ideal and this november is no different trump is a combustible menace don t think for one second that he can t win a general election he absolutely can win and sanders supporters staying home in protest will make it all the more likely if that happens our country becomes an international punch line the progressive movement dies in its infancy and much of what obama has accomplished will be put in jeopardy and if none of that persuades you recall what happened in 2000 make no mistake ralph nader cost al gore the presidency that year al gore was a deeply flawed candidate but imagine how different the world might look had he won that year if the bernie or bust crowd has itsway in november what might we say about clinton 10years from now and how much damage real and symbolic will donald trump or ted cruz have done think about that before you surrender to your purism sean illing is a usaf veteran
