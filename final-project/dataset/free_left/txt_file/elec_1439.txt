basking in sky high approval ratings and enjoying a respite from the media spotlight as she laid the groundwork for a second presidential run then carlos danger happened anthony d weiner the husband of mrs clinton s closest aide huma abedin was running for mayor of new york when news broke that he had continued to exchange lewd messages with women online after the practice cost him his congressional seat this time he used the embarrassing spanish inspired moniker the tawdry story line and ms abedin s closeness to mrs clinton made the events explode far beyond new york dragging mrs clinton s name into messy headlines about penis pictures mr weiner s descriptions of his sexual appetites and his online paramour named sydney leathers now with mrs clinton seemingly on the cusp of winning the white house mr weiner who once described himself as a perpetually horny middle aged man has pulled her into another drama federal investigators looking into his sexual messaging with an underage girl stumbled upon thousands of emails potentially pertinent to the f b i inquiry into mrs clinton s private email server the f b i recently uncovered new emails potentially related to the investigation into hillary clinton s private email server the jolting development highlighted not only the intersecting lives of mrs clinton ms abedin and mr weiner but also the pattern that has characterized the clintons relationships with the sometimes oddly behaving inhabitants of their insular world even amid accusations of sexual or financial impropriety the clintons first instinct is to hunker down and protect those in their orbit sometimes leading to more ugly eruptions later and eventually to messy public breakups on friday several of mrs clinton s friends and allies suggested she distance herself from ms abedin a painful prospect given that mrs clinton has described ms abedin as a surrogate daughter and has relied on her more than anyone else during her nearly two year pursuit of the white house the two women s closeness has both intimidated those in the clinton circle of status conscious advisers and caused envy even as mrs clinton learned on friday that the f b i s interest in her email server which she thought had ended in july had reignited ms abedin was by her side as she prepared to make a statement to the news media in des moines pressed by a reporter there about the emails having been discovered during the investigation into mr weiner s sexting mrs clinton dismissed the reports as rumors we of course stand by her her campaign chairman john d podesta said on saturday when asked whether ms abedin would step down from the campaign mrs clinton has always been circumspect about mr weiner and her feelings toward him she has steadfastly supported ms abedin 40 as the younger woman stood by her husband despite the public ridicule and career damage that resulted from his behavior the clintons have never publicly criticized mr weiner it was only two months ago that ms abedin announced that she was separating from her husband after she learned that the new york post planned to publish a story reporting that mr weiner had sent a picture of his crotch to a woman online as he lay next to the couple s 4 year old son in bed mrs clinton was vacationing in the hamptons at the time and stayed away from the story privately aides to mrs clinton suggested on friday that ms abedin would remain alongside mrs clinton for the final breakneck stretch of the campaign but some senior democrats are now wondering whether if mrs clinton is elected she will be able to bring ms abedin along with her for what was once widely expected to be a senior role in the white house mrs clinton s loyalty to ms abedin and vice versa stems from the decades they have spent working closely together beginning when ms abedin was a 19 year old intern to the first lady in the 1990s at the state department ms abedin served as deputy chief of staff to mrs clinton emails released by the state department captured the closeness of their relationship a jet lagged mrs clinton once emailed ms abedin at 12 21 a m to take her up on an offer to come over to mrs clinton s house for a chat just knock on the door to the bedroom if it s closed she wrote ms abedin s loyalty and strong identification with both clintons was conspicuous at the state department at a staff meeting in early 2009 she was going through a list of requests from the president when others in the room looked at her in puzzlement ms abedin clarified not president obama our president bill clinton ms abedin s high profile and proximity to mrs clinton also brought her scrutiny senator charles e grassley republican of iowa and chairman of the judiciary committee has questioned ms abedin s arrangement to earn income privately while she worked for mrs clinton at the state department in addition to being on mrs clinton s personal payroll ms abedin received money from the clinton foundation and teneo a consulting firm co founded by douglas j band a former senior aide to mr clinton and some of ms abedin s emails on mrs clinton s private server led to accusations that foundation donors had received special access to the state department through it all mrs clinton and her longtime adviser philippe reines have fiercely protected ms abedin mrs clinton played a part in introducing ms abedin and mr weiner then a brash and outspoken democratic congressman from new york in august 2001 the young congressman asked ms abedin then an aide to mrs clinton in the senate if she would go out for a drink standing behind mrs clinton ms abedin waved her arms at her boss and shook her head no of course all you young people should go out mrs clinton said mr weiner eventually won ms abedin s affections in january 2007 when he sat between mrs clinton and her rival then senator barack obama at president george w bush s state of the union address i appreciate you looking out for my boss ms abedin texted him they went out for coffee and were married in july 2010 mr clinton performed the ceremony 12 photos view slide show ms abedin and mrs clinton s personal lives have in some ways taken parallel tracks with each woman choosing to forgive her husband s humiliating transgressions others close to mrs clinton have not been as understanding on a campaign conference call the day that mr weiner admitted he had continued to engage in online liaisons mr reines berated him yelling that he would reach through the phone and rip out his throat adding an expletive on saturday ms abedin was working from the campaign s brooklyn headquarters rather than traveling with mrs clinton on a campaign swing in florida mr reines who is not officially on the campaign s staff was however accompanying mrs clinton some advisers to the clintons were exasperated earlier this year to learn that mr weiner and ms abedin were bringing about another distraction the couple had permitted a behind the scenes documentary about mr weiner s circuslike mayoral bid to be made resurrecting the sexting stories once again but deciding how to handle the current situation could be especially difficult cutting out employees who prove politically damaging may seem like politics 101 but for the clintons it has never been easy particularly when it comes to their oldest and most loyal aides ms abedin and mr band both started as white house interns spent their formative years working for the clintons and ultimately brought unwelcome headlines to their bosses before the email news broke on friday mrs clinton s campaign was answering questions about mr band s private consulting firm teneo and its ties to the clinton foundation i think voters first of all understand that hillary clinton is the candidate that s on the ballot not doug band her campaign manager robby mook told reporters on friday it remained to be seen whether he would soon need to say the same of ms abedin
