texting norah o donnell we would like to hear from you too text 212 217 1107 cbs evening news tell us about zonie s closet and what you set out to achieve when you opened it denice benefiel i felt that we needed a small cheers bar if you will in the gay community and that s what we have done we re like a small family here most people that are just starting out in the drag business they start at zonie s closet we give them that opportunity we have a stage for them an open mic night for them so they can get started in this business most entertainers that live in this city they have been right here in this bar and it does feel like family when you re here that s what we intended to do when we started out and i just hope that we can continue to do that i ve owned it for 12 years and put my heart and soul into it and i m basically watching it go down the tubes after all of my hard work it has never paid me what i was paid in the real world but it gave me the ability to work for myself and make my own decisions it s all i have i used everything that i did have to put into it cbs evening news what has your experience been like applying for a payment protection program loan i first applied for the ppp loan through jpmorgan chase i was only really eligible for a couple thousand dollars because i only have a few employees that s still not going to keep my business afloat the very first day the site was available was literally a few weeks after the loans were even announced once it was up it continued to crash we finally got the application through about three or four days before they said the money was already gone and we obviously didn t make the cut off you hear about all of these huge businesses and big corporations that got money and a lot of small business owners like myself we didn t receive any money i was told that i probably should go apply at a smaller bank for the second round cbs evening news did you already have a second business account at a smaller bank i set up an account at a very small bank called state bank of lizton when i bought the building and only when i called and explained the problems i was having with chase did i learn it was a business account not a personal account i applied a second time through them they ve been a great help in this i just spoke with my banker on friday and was informed we will be receiving the ppp loan probably sometime this week for 2 300 cbs evening news you would think that a larger financial institution is better situated or better resourced to help small business owners but your experience doesn t demonstrate that at all yes absolutely it seems like the bigger banks help the accounts that had the most money with them already i understand they re going to get some kind of preferential treatment but this is supposed to be a small business loan it was supposed to be for small businesses not businesses that are getting millions and millions of dollars in returns every year cbs evening news does receiving a loan or knowing that the loan is imminent change your expectations for keeping zonie s closet going it is absolutely not going to help me pass through we re going to do everything we possibly can but this is a drop in the bucket that s all it is we re so far in the hole now we don t really know what to do cbs evening news what will the 2 300 enable you to do 75 of that has to be used for payroll i trust my employees and i want to keep them so it will allow me to pay my employees for maybe a few weeks the rest that s left over will allow me to pay one utility bill possibly two cbs evening news what about other federal or state help stimulus check unemployment an economic injury disaster loan from the small business administration i ve been denied unemployment i don t know if that s going to go through or not i was denied by the state and the federal program pua pandemic unemployment assistance i haven t heard anything from them i have still not received a stimulus check every single day that i check it says payment status not available and of course there s nobody to call i still have rent to pay i still have utilities to pay i have my home life i have to pay for i ve used most of my savings we re going to be the last type of business to open back up i m going to probably lose my business and do something else cbs evening news has this experience shaken your faith do you feel that the institutions that are supposed to help american citizens failed you i absolutely do feel that they failed me they have failed small businesses across america when you own a small business people think that you have a lot of money that you re rich or well off i m not rich by any means that s what my business does it just pays the bills and as far as shaking my faith it absolutely has because we re the backbone of america and i just i don t know benefiel chokes up cbs evening news if zonie s closet had to close what would you do next i really don t know i m 50 years old how do you start over i would probably go back to school i have a few classes to take to get my rn degree i had been in health care before at least i d still have a job i d still be in contact with people and helping people cbs evening news how was business before the shutdown things did not taper off before the shutdown we got shut down on march 16 we were open the weekend before and we were slammed because people just weren t taking this seriously at all i had been watching the virus in china since january and i was like this is a bad deal i had a meeting with my employees that day and planned to close before the governor announced it cbs evening news do you think customer demographics will change when you reopen i think our clientele would change after our clientele is mostly 30 and above and i think we would probably end up switching to a much younger clientele they don t have the same fear of the virus my older clientele i don t think they re coming back being a drag bar it s a very small community we re one of only two bars that do drag consistently i think that we will still get some business cbs evening news will social distancing guidelines change the way you conduct business in a bar i think we re going to try to gear a lot of our business outside because we have a patio we haven t quite figured out how we re going to separate people we have a very small venue our space is maybe 1 600 square feet so if we were to talk about social distancing with the parameters they ve put out there right now that means i could have seven people in my business i just don t know what we re going to do with such a small space video edited by josh carney watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network
