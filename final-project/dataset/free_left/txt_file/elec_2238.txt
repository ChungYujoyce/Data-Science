 2016 every time you turn around he s said something new it s impossible for us to keep up one gop lawmaker complains by kyle cheney and john bresnahan 06 14 2016 05 18 am edt updated 06 14 2016 01 38 pm edt donald trump s anti terrorism speech has republican lawmakers on edge getty donald trump s combative anti terrorism speech monday flouted the typical post tragedy script and left republican insiders fretting that the business mogul is unprepared to play a crucial presidential role national healer some wondered whether he failed to harness a moment to elevate himself and pass what one republican called the desk test the ability to picture trump in the oval office in a time of crisis and on capitol hill his renewed call for a ban on muslim immigration drew quick condemnations from gop lawmakers even as they struggled to stand by their presumptive nominee advertisement it was the latest display of the party s conundrum of how to deal with their unpredictable standard bearer whose views they often don t share many republicans appeared downright fatigued by the almost daily exercise of trump saying something provocative or worse and them having to answer questions about it several lawmakers opted to remain silent apparently hoping this latest controversy would wash away with the next news cycle but for others trump s response to the deadliest mass shooting in american history prompted renewed doubts about whether he carries the kind of sensitivity or understanding of a president s role as tom rath a veteran new hampshire republican strategist put it a day after a gunman who pledged loyalty to the islamic state mowed down 49 people at a nightclub in orlando trump spent monday morning skewering the obama administration s handling of terrorism and even suggested president barack obama might sympathize with islamic extremists he followed that by reissuing his call for a temporary ban on muslim immigration to the united states but expanding it to include regions he deems to be hotbeds of terrorism and suggesting american muslims were turning a blind eye to potential terrorists within their communities the speed with which trump moved as well as the immediate reaction by democrats and the media forced republicans to develop a response in trump s wake while this disconnect often happens between a presidential nominee and the party leadership in congress it s far worse with trump than in previous cycles trump s media driven campaign helps him get his message out but it leaves every other republican scrambling to figure out how to live in a trump centric world trump just blows up everything we want to do said a senior gop lawmaker speaking on the condition of anonymity every time you turn around he s said something new it s impossible for us to keep up 2016 by louis nelson the proposed ban on muslim immigrants had already been rejected by speaker paul ryan r wis and the overwhelming majority of republicans in congress but house majority leader kevin mccarthy r calif said again he wouldn t support it and that he had no interest in seeing it get a vote you don t ban somebody on race or religion mccarthy said i don t see that coming to the floor ryan concurred on wednesday saying at a news conference that he doesn t believe trump s idea is reflective of our principles not just as a party but as a country and i think the smarter way to go in all respects is to have a security test not a religious test mccarthy like other republicans also rejected trump s suggestion that obama should resign over the orlando shooting though he did criticize the president for not being forceful enough i think there s a lot of answers that need to be known before we do anything mccarthy said we have talked for so long about the challenge of terrorism the president has talked about containing them but they need to be defeated hill republicans expressed concern over everything from the tone of trump s remarks to their substantive impact i think you have to be a little careful with the rhetoric rep michael mccaul r texas chairman of the house homeland security committee said of trump s renewed call for a ban on muslim immigrants you don t want to inflame or help the recruiting efforts many republicans earlier in the day had expressed hope that trump would scrap the red meat in favor of a unifying posture that might help him shed the controversies that dogged him in recent weeks from ripping an american born judge as biased because of his mexican heritage to bad headlines surrounding trump university the response to orlando they hoped could be the first step in his effort to appeal to moderate republicans and disaffected democrats wary of a trump presidency by bianca padr ocasio instead trump delivered a meandering address in which he raised the specter of thousands of murderous muslims streaming into the united states because of lax screening procedures less than two hours after hillary clinton delivered a speech that didn t mention trump at all he panned her leadership and suggested a clinton presidency would all but welcome terrorists onto u s shores saying nothing would have been better said one member of the republican national committee every senate candidate will be forced to answer for trump s bizarre response his lack of empathy is jarring in fact democratic senate candidates around the country blasted out press releases calling on their republican rivals to reject trump s maligning of obama s allegiance donald trump s comments today were appalling divisive and deeply offensive said democratic pennsylvania senate challenger katie mcginty i call on senator pat toomey to join me in strongly denouncing donald trump s offensive remarks immediately on the whole though hill republicans were muted in response to trump s remarks texas sen john cornyn refused to respond to questions about the gop standard bearer s handling of the response to the orlando attacks there you go again asking about trump he said alaska sen dan sullivan said he had no thoughts on trump s call for obama s resignation and reiterated his critique of trump s immigration ban it s not a good one he said mississippi sen roger wicker who s helming the gop effort to keep control of the senate also declined to comment i m not gonna make a career out of responding to every comment and every tweet he told reporters after a leadership meeting trump s defenders highlighted less inflammatory aspects of his speech or turned it into an indictment of the obama administration for refusing to describe recent attacks as motivated by radical islam a prominent theme in trump s remarks the one thing i agree with trump on is you ve got to define the enemy to defeat it and this administration just won t mccaul said the reluctance on the part of the administration is always sort of baffling to me white house by sarah wheaton i would ask the president for a strategy added sen deb fischer r neb who struggled to conceal an eye roll when asked about trump s comments we ve never seen one from obama and i don t know how you expect to go forward with any kind of plans to complete a mission unless you have guidance from a commander in chief pete hoekstra a former michigan congressman and chairman of the house intelligence committee said trump s speech is about selling more of the american dream what he believes and what i believe is that radical islam is a threat to the american way of life he said and this is not just about providing national security this is about protecting the american citizen this is about protecting the values of the west hoekstra a former john kasich supporter said trump has helped give voice to his efforts to highlight the danger of radical islam to america and he supports trump s call for restrictions on immigration too burgess everett and seung min kim contributed to this report missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and
