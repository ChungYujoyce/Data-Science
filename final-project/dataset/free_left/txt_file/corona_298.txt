advertisement supported by congress and the white house are nearing an economic rescue package stocks plunged again thursday despite the fed offering at least 1 5 trillion worth of short term loans to banks read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here transcript bagpipe music there are moments that seem bizarre moments of fear preparation and moments of emptiness these are scenes from the world living with coronavirus it has spread across cultures languages and even out to sea and despite these global differences a number of shared experiences have emerged there is grief over the dead in iran hospital staff mourn a doctor s death from the virus in china a quarantined building collapses and a firefighter breaks down after pulling bodies from the rubble in italy a man mourns the death of his sister to try and save lives authorities take precautions they disinfect public areas and screen populations this is just crazy around the world people are afraid and on edge unbelievable in northern ireland routine construction work at an apple store is mistaken for virus related activity in japan tempers flare when a man sneezes on a train one italian takes the fear and adds humor this is a circle to keep people at a safe distance in fact lots of people use humor to cope with the uncertainty or the stigma of being sick in australia a run on toilet paper leads to lessons in self defense he s going to show you how to deal with people stealing your toilet paper there is also defiance a conviction that life must go on despite the virus across rooftops in china quarantined neighbors socialize from a rooftop in italy a theater group performs poetry for an area where movement is restricted on a quarantined cruise ship there s songwriting to pass the time in an apartment in china too but perhaps some of the most striking moments from the pandemic are those where little happens the empty streets unbelievable no traffic the quiet airports the places of worship without worshippers stores without goods this is how it is across the globe as we prepare grieve and wait for the next chapter of the coronavirus congress on thursday neared a deal with the white house on a sweeping economic rescue package to respond to the coronavirus pandemic after a day of intense negotiations between speaker nancy pelosi and treasury secretary steven mnuchin ms pelosi told reporters that we ve resolved most of our differences and that the house would vote on friday on the measure one way or another it would then go to the senate which called off a recess that had been scheduled for next week the legislation democratic aides said will include enhanced unemployment benefits free virus testing and aid for food assistance programs the package also ensures 14 days of paid sick leave as well as tax credits to help small and medium size businesses fulfill that mandate language was still being drafted for provisions related to family and medical leave according to a democratic aide as aides worked through the night to prepare the bill the fast moving measure reflects a sense of urgency in washington to enact a fiscal stimulus in the face of a pandemic that has wreaked havoc on the financial markets which have proven impervious to other interventions the negotiations hit snags as republicans balked at the sweeping proposal to provide paid sick leave something senate republicans had already blocked when democrats sought earlier in the week to bring up a separate bill mr mnuchin in a frantic attempt to keep talks on track spoke by phone at least seven times with ms pelosi negotiating additional changes to the house legislation so it could have a chance of winning the support of mr trump and senate republicans ian shepherdson the chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics warned that even a large stimulus package might not stop the fall in markets and that the worst may still lie ahead what stops the fear is evidence that the rate of increase of infections is slowing believable evidence he said everywhere you would look for reassurance for leadership for policy action for reliable information all are absent sophie gr goire trudeau the wife of prime minister justin trudeau of canada has tested positive for the coronavirus the prime minister s office said in a statement on thursday night she is feeling well is taking all the recommended precautions and her symptoms remain mild the statement said earlier in the day mr trudeau announced that he ms gr goire trudeau and their three children had voluntarily isolated themselves at the prime minister s residence in ottawa as they awaited the test result mr trudeau continues to perform most of his official duties although his meetings have become conference calls and he was absent from the house of commons he spoke with several world leaders during the day including president trump on the advice of physicians mr trudeau will continue to work from home for the next 14 days the statement said although he shows no symptoms and physicians are not testing him for the virus earlier in the day the government said that ms gr goire trudeau felt ill after returning from a trip to britain doctors decided to test for the coronavirus on wednesday after she developed a mild fever which has since passed mr trudeau will make a speech to canadians about the coronavirus pandemic on friday following a conference call with the country s provincial leaders the church of jesus christ of latter day saints announced on thursday that it was suspending all public gatherings around the world the church is the first major religious tradition to issue such a global edict the measure means that the church s more than 16 million members will not meet for worship services or other activities until further notice local leaders are determining how to provide the sacrament rituals to members at least once a month church leaders urged members to use technology to conduct necessary meetings remotely and promised further guidance we encourage members in their ministering efforts to care for one another the church s top leaders wrote in a statement to members we bear our witness of the lord s love during this time of uncertainty the church previously suspended sunday services for three months during the worldwide flu pandemic of 1918 said matthew grow managing director of the church s history department also on thursday the roman catholic archdiocese of washington suspended all public mass until further notice and the episcopal diocese of maryland said it

were among the day s biggest losers adam silver the n b a commissioner said on thursday that the league s suspension of games because of the coronavirus would probably last at least 30 days mr silver who was being interviewed on tnt s inside the n b a said it was also possible that the rest of the season would be canceled the n b a announced on wednesday that the season would be suspended after rudy gobert a center for the utah jazz tested positive for the coronavirus earlier in the week mr gobert had made light of concerns about the virus which mr silver referred to as a huge mistake mr gobert has since apologized on social media charles barkley one of the hosts of inside the n b a did not appear in the studio joining instead by phone he said he was self quarantining for 48 hours after not feeling well after a flight from new york to atlanta he said he had been tested for the coronavirus but had not received the results i m just kind of in limbo right now mr barkley said in england the premier league said it would go ahead with its scheduled slate of soccer matches this weekend bucking a global trend that on thursday saw leagues and competitions around the world cancel

baseball halted spring training and postponed the start of the season by at least two weeks and the n h l paused its season with the stanley cup playoffs scheduled to begin in about a month transcript test test test ok just got to donald s is it ok to lock my bike here yeah sure you want to bring it inside if you don t think it s exposed ok hello hi there we just rather than shaking hands bumped elbows yes the w h o elbow bump you want to sit down should i wash my hands yeah you probably should as much for your protection as for mine it depends on what you put your hands on i wanted to ask you we heard you yesterday sanitizing the studio what do you do when you come home i wash my hands i know the inside of my house is clean because the only people in here are my girlfriend and myself and we re both still healthy but people who live upstairs and this is a two apartment building we have agreed that we will tell each other if any of us has a fever or a cough and we keep some alcohol wipes in the front hall to wipe down the doorknob light switch and other surfaces we might both touch just to make sure that there s no possibility of us passing it back and forth to each other i know it sounds kooky but this is actually the way the disease gets transmitted you don t have to be a crazy germaphobe or actually at a time like this it helps to be a crazy germaphobe just by instinct and here i ll wash my hands in front of you so that you know that my hands are clean but the danger with somebody else is of course that they re coughing but i m not i m fine i ve never been in someone s home in these circumstances from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily today now that the coronavirus has gone from an epidemic to a pandemic and both infections and deaths from the disease are surging across the world and the united states we return to times science reporter donald g mcneil jr who has covered the story from the start to understand how to navigate this new reality it s friday march 13 hey donald hey how are you good welcome back and thank you for letting us into your home i know we ve been hearing a lot from you lately so let us know if we re beginning to exhaust your generosity ok so far so good so far key word donald when we first started talking to you about the coronavirus about two weeks ago you gave us an overview of what it was where it was headed since then a lot has changed given the evolution of the situation we have questions related to this new phase of the epidemic now that it s very much in our lives i m working from home you re working from home so let s start with questions about precautions for people who don t have the virus which presumably is the vast majority of us at the moment and how we can protect ourselves from getting the virus what kind of activities should be avoided right now you have to be aware not only of people around you who are coughing but you also have to be aware that every basically every hard surface you touch might potentially have virus on it unless you know it s been cleaned since the last person that you don t know was there might have been on it let me tick through a couple of what we imagine from conversations with everybody on the daily team at the times to be the kinds of scenarios i think people want to better understand how to approach a bit of a lightning round here is it dangerous at this moment to keep going to work look some people are going to have to go to work doctors have to go to work but it s not so much the danger the reason the government s asking people not to go to work is because it creates what they call social distancing the less interactions there are between people the less exchange of virus there is if you slow down the virus you change what is sometimes called r naught and if you get people to be more distant from each other the virus is transmitted less can you translate that phrase r naught yeah it s called the reproductive number of the virus it s if i m sick how many people am i going to infect you never know the real r naught or the real fatality rate or anything about a disease until it s completely gone through the world so we re never going to know the real answers to these things for at least a year or two because they re going to be different in africa than they are in new york they re going to be different anywhere but if you create more distance between people so that i infect hopefully no people you ve substantially slowed my part of transmitting the virus and if you do that across the entire population you really slow down the movement of that virus in the population when a lot of people are infected and a lot of people have pneumonia a lot of people all need to get to the hospital at the same time a lot of those people need to get on oxygen or on ventilators and eventually you run out of ventilators then you re making the triage decisions that they re now making in northern italy which is to say ok this is donald mcneil 66 years old i ve got a choice between saving him or a 25 year old mother of two goodbye mr mcneil sorry there isn t any time for your family to say goodbye to you because we can t have visitors but that s it see you later sheesh which is the right thing to do that s the right decision for a doctor to make but those are really tough decisions for doctors let me return to our lightning round that has not yet turned into a lightning round sorry based on some of what you just said i m intuiting where this may be headed but take the bus or the subway at this moment is that wise i don t think it s terribly wise i did it yesterday to get home i ride the subway standing up with my face close to the vent i have one glove on my hand one gardening glove and i use that if i have to hold onto a rail the other hand i make sure never touches a surface and i use that for my phone mostly i keep it in my pocket and i won t get into a crowded car i ll let the train go by but if you don t have to take the subway if you don t have to take the subway don t staying on this theme lots of people are curious about plane travel i would avoid plane travel if i could help it i have friends who were about to fly to kentucky to visit their son and i said you know what why don t you drive you know where all the surfaces inside your car have been you don t know where all the surfaces inside that plane or that airport have been i know it s going to be 11 hours instead of two hours but i d say do it and that s what they re doing how about trips to familiar retail establishments a grocery store a restaurant well you have to have food so go to the grocery store be super careful about the handle of the cart and remember that every box you touch has been placed on that shelf by somebody who might have coughed into their hand now restaurants i did eat in a restaurant a couple of nights ago we looked for one that was really pretty empty and we sat at the bar which had just been wiped down but as this pandemic progresses i ll worry more and i ll probably avoid going into restaurants the gym yeah the gym i go to a gym i play squash which means all i have to touch in common with the other player is the ball and i know my partner i would be real reluctant to start grabbing a bunch of weights not knowing who else had touched them grabbing a bunch of handles on machines not knowing who had touched them i would be reluctant to play basketball with a dozen other guys because you can t have 10 guys handling the same ball if one of them is spewing virus a virus is going to get on the ball and then everybody s got it on their hands how about movies concerts things that might be open air but where people are sitting quite close to each other open air is safer than enclosed but even in open air venues if you re sitting on a seat the handles of the seat might have virus on them the railings when you walk down to your seat might have virus on them the ticket taker as he takes your ticket and hands it back to you i know it s paranoid sounding but these are all the ways that virus can be transmitted in large gatherings it s not just the coughing it s the many surfaces that get touched in general i m hearing you say that going out and interacting with other people poses risks so i wonder if you can help us understand the calculations behind your thinking in these particular categories does it have to do with the lifespan of the virus does it have to do with recommendations around social distancing what is the underlying logic yes they re related to all these things but i think people get way too obsessive about numbers about exactly how many hours or days does the virus live on a surface exactly how many feet do you have to stand away from somebody else i mean you can t run around through life with a tape measure trying to figure out is 3 feet safe enough is 6 feet safe enough but stay away from people who are coughing stay away from people who look feverish and if you have to communicate with somebody keep your distance that s what i d say just generally keep your distance you ve talked about social distancing how do you socially distance yourself from your family from your children from your partner your spouse your boyfriend your girlfriend does that really work you can t my girlfriend and i still kiss each other we just trust each other enough to believe we re not infected it s impossible to socially distance yourself from your children they re going to come up and hug you that s why the whole idea of home quarantine home isolation rather is virtually impossible donald there s a strong sense that very young people and people in their teens 20s early 30s are at a much lower risk level for the coronavirus and i think that s been borne out correct me if i m wrong so do all the recommendations that we keep hearing apply as stringently to the young yes unless you re totally selfish what you mean do you have a parent do you have a grandparent do you want to be the vector that carries that disease to them do you know anybody and love anybody who s older and might be frail you don t want your last memory of that person being that you gave them the virus that killed them you ll kick yourself for the rest of your life if you did that people who were hospitalized in china started at age 30 and went up to 70s and 80s yes on average the outcomes are better but if you want something to worry about you might be the person who doesn t have a good outcome you re spreading a disease to your friends your social circle that s something you ought to feel guilty about it s not something you ought to feel indifferent about people have to take this seriously we ll be right back we ve been talking about precautions for people who don t have the virus and want to keep it that way i want to turn now to what happens if you think you might have the virus based on your reporting and based on the publicly available information what are the first signs of illness that have been reported and that people therefore could be looking out for what the chinese found in the large study of the first 45 000 cases is that it s not like a cold fever is the number one sign high fever a dry cough and then after that fatigue runny nose was only 4 of cases and those people might have had flu or a cold at the same time but there s something i wanted to say that was important i described in our first interview that 80 of all cases were mild and the other 20 were either severe or critical and that stuck in too many people s minds as if oh 80 of cases are practically nothing you don t even have it maybe it s asymptomatic no that s wrong the chinese study that was based on everything was either mild severe or critical mild included everything from barely any symptoms to pneumonia but pneumonia not needing hospitalization or oxygen once you stepped over into needing oxygen then you were severe once you were in organ failure you were critical so if people think this is a mild disease get over that idea i m sorry if i contributed to the spread of that idea i should have been much more careful in describing the whole range of symptoms that came under the term mild right in other words mild doesn t necessarily mean mild nothing like what we mean by a mild cold when is it recommended that no matter how mild or severe the symptoms are a person be tested is there a threshold i don t know if the authorities have set a threshold yet i know what happens in pandemics is that ultimately you have to assume that a lot of people have the disease and that really when you reach the point where almost everybody has it you end up stopping even bothering to test them you ultimately are going to assume that everybody has it because it s the most popular virus going around if you have no trouble breathing if you have got a fever that you can handle at home then stay home and take care of it although that s not the way the chinese handled it the chinese said if you think you have symptoms and i hope we get to this point the chinese said if you think you have symptoms if you think you re getting sick get directed to a fever clinic where somebody who is in protective gear can see you and they will see you and sort out whether you have bacterial pneumonia or flu or whether you have coronavirus and if you have coronavirus you re going to go into isolation with a lot of other people who have coronavirus even if you have a very mild case you re going to go in with all the other mild cases because they know cases can crash it s a pretty common phenomenon that people are going along ok with some breathing difficulty and then in the second week they crash their oxygen saturation drops and they need oxygen and in those cases in the isolation centers in china when you might be in a gymnasium with 1 000 other people when you crashed they recognized it right there there was no wait and they would move you to a hospital this is a bit of an ethics question but let s say you get into a cab and you re on your way to get tested for the coronavirus or you hitch a ride with a friend should it be disclosed that you think you might have the virus should basically anyone you come in contact with be aware of your status yes you re carrying a potentially lethal disease so you ve got to warn other people there s no ethical question about this unfortunately this has been the story of i don t know how many pandemics how many people have lied about having a sexually transmitted disease especially in the five minutes right before they thought they were going to get lucky and if they disclosed what they had they were going to ruin the moment unfortunately that s how a whole lot of sexually transmitted diseases including h i v get passed on it takes a lot of courage to be that ethical and i hope during this epidemic people will and the test itself it remains somewhat scarce but to the degree you know it can you describe the test is it a saliva swab the point is to get a sample of where the virus is so there are different ways of getting that swab typically for a while they were doing nasopharyngeal swabs which is basically pushing a q tip so far up your nose that it feels like it s going into your brain but i ve seen swabs that were just taken from the back of the throat and i know that there are some times when people are coughing hard they try to get them to cough up sputum so they can test that you want to get a sample that s got virus from where the cells are infected originally it attaches deep in the lungs so you re trying to get a sample from there but once it moves up into your nose and throat maybe you can get a sample from there so it s very dangerous for the person who s trying to get the q tip in or the sputum sample out to be standing right in front of them as they do that they have to be really protected in order to do that safely how long do the results generally seem to be taking for these tests i was told that in china when they had the on the spot labs and the fever clinics they could give you an answer in as little as four hours but that s ideal there were others of seven hours other times they had to send it off someplace overnight until recently we ve been having to send every sample to atlanta so that s several days right to the c d c yes to the c d c which is the least efficient version of this it would seem it s the least efficient version but for a while it was the only accurate version and a positive wasn t considered a positive until the c d c had confirmed it we ve got to solve this testing problem we ve got to have it so that tests are literally right there because you ve got to diagnose people and then isolate them so they don t go home and give the virus to the family and they don t go back to work and give the virus to their coworkers and we are not at that phase just yet are we right now we re not even talking about that phase that s how they did it in china right now we re still talking about home isolation and the w h o the chinese and the south koreans would say that doesn t work that s too dangerous there s no way you can isolate at home without infecting your family the final phase of questions donald are what happens when a person has been diagnosed with the virus you ve told us that there really is no cure for the coronavirus it s going to run its course are there useful over the counter medicines that would help somebody get through this virus this is kind of crazy because i don t think it s safe to think of it as something you can happily stay home with and treat like oh i ve got the flu you ve got to be aware that there is the possibility of crashing you ve got to have a number you can call the state should be aware that you re a patient that you re in home quarantine and there should be somebody checking in on you each day or you should be checking in with somebody so that they say how high is your fever how fast are you breathing how long can a person expect to be sick once diagnosed mild cases typically resolved themselves in two weeks people who were on ventilators and in severe situations were usually three to six weeks that s a long time yeah that s a long time it s a long time for one of your ventilators to be in use even the severe and the critical cases most of the time they ended in good outcomes but for some people death took several weeks too people didn t just immediately crash and die it would be a somewhat slow process donald once you have this virus does it confer immunity on getting the coronavirus again in the next couple weeks next couple of years forever nobody knows about forever virtually all doctors assume that having recovered from this confers immunity because that s the norm when you recover from a disease you normally have immunity at least for a while once a person recovers from the virus is there permanent damage do we know some people who have gone into severe pneumonia or a r d s adult respiratory distress syndrome yes will have permanent damage they ll live but they ll have permanently damaged lungs that can definitely happen and what do we know about how the virus long term affects people who i think would be justifiably quite anxious at this moment pregnant women the small numbers of women that have been studied in china who were pregnant during this relatively short time period there was a study that came out just a couple of days ago nine women all delivered healthy babies something like six of the women were delivered by cesarean which doctors may have chosen to do just for the extra safety of knowing that the baby wasn t going to be infected in the birth canal but some of the babies were born naturally too and all the babies were healthy that s reassuring that s good news it s a very small sample but it s good news from what we know from the small sample it s really different from some other diseases finally donald we want to tackle a few questions that we ve observed from friends family and from the internet that may be in the territory of rumor or half baked theories but that are gaining some currency so basically a true or false section here first off are there multiple strains of the coronavirus and are some more dangerous than others no there are slightly different variants of the coronavirus really variances by a couple of nucleotides there is no evidence that one is more infectious than the other or one is more lethal than the other not so far anyway next this is a seasonal virus and it will more or less be gone in a few months that would be lovely but we don t know that this is a new virus we ve never seen it in summertime so we don t know how it s going to behave in summertime respiratory viruses like influenza tend to disappear in the summer we don t know what this virus is going to do in the summer so it s not a good idea to make predictions that s just wishful thinking on the part of people who say oh it s all going to disappear in the summertime and the last of these true of false questions donald are the media we hear this a lot blowing the scale of this out of proportion given the relatively small number of infections compared with the overall populations in any given country look i ask myself this question every day because i m the media in this case normally i get to blame the other jackals of the press for blowing things out of proportion but this time not this time it s on my shoulders i d like to think there s nothing to worry about i never worried about ebola coming to new york i never worried much about sars spreading in new york i worried in the beginning about h1n1 flu in 2009 but then as the mortality data got clearer i stopped worrying i knew we d mostly get it but i knew it would be mostly not a problem this one same as i said two plus weeks ago really flips me out this one reminds me of 1918 a dangerous virus that transmits easily between people yes 80 of the cases are mild but as i described mild is a term that the chinese use describing all the way up to pneumonia that s not mild we don t know what the fatality rate is it got as high in some weeks in wuhan as 5 that was during the chaos period in wuhan we don t know what it is in italy now and we won t know until it s all over what the total fatality rate is going to be i d love to be told i was wrong i was an alarmist i should eat my hat but we ll see so far i ve been right about every scary thing i said about this disease i ve been worried ever since i looked at the numbers about how fast the epidemic was doubling in china and how fast people were going to hospitals i sat down and wrote down on a piece of paper about how fast this could double and i came into work the next day and said this is going to go pandemic originally nobody believed me and i had to call 12 different experts and count which ones believed me and which ones didn t believe me it came out basically eight to two to two eight thought it had the potential to go pandemic two thought it was overblown and two didn t want to comment didn t want to take a guess it sounds like you re saying so far we haven t blown it out of proportion and you have been a relatively successful prognosticator of this virus so that s why we re going to keep talking to you about it i want to tell you how much i appreciate you giving us your time and your wisdom thank you thank you for inviting me over the coming weeks we ll be answering your questions about the coronavirus and how to navigate the pandemic you can send us your questions by voicemail at 646 598 6012 be sure to tell us your name and where you re calling from we ll be right

from home closed all its offices to the public and said it would begin holding smaller events and virtual fund raisers according to an internal campaign memo released thursday mr biden s main rival in the democratic primary senator bernie sanders of vermont took similar precautions mr sanders s campaign said that it had asked all staff members to work from home and that it would no longer hold large events or door to door canvasses focusing on digital outreach instead mr biden who has a famously tactile campaigning style acknowledged in a speech on thursday the need for radical changes in our personal behaviors that could affect deeply ingrained behavior like handshakes and hugs the candidates shift away from big events is likely to hurt mr sanders who is trying against lengthening

state announced on thursday that schools in those states would close for several weeks updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore

as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep

said on thursday that the government would suspend flights from the united states and europe for 30 days in an effort to slow down the spread of the new coronavirus in the south american nation mr fern ndez also announced strict quarantine protocols for people who arrive in argentina after having traveled to places with a significant number of cases including china south korea iran japan europe and the united states argentina had 31 confirmed coronavirus cases as of thursday including one fatality it was not immediately clear when the flights would stop but the measure appeared certain to leave thousands of passengers stranded argentina receives more than 20 flights daily from cities in europe and the united states husband and wife pastors from burkina faso who traveled to france in february were found to have the coronavirus after they developed symptoms following sunday services at their 12 000 capacity megachurch in their country s capital ouagadougou the possible mass exposure comes on a continent that has so far largely escaped the sweep of the virus across the globe egypt has the highest number of confirmed cases with around 60 most of them aboard a nile cruise ship south africa has 15 and there is a scattering of cases elsewhere in africa many involving europeans africa s many megachurches and their vast congregations have been a source of worry for the spread of coronavirus particularly after a large majority of the more than 7 800 cases in south korea were traced back to the secretive shincheonji church of jesus the pastors mamoudou karambiri and hortense karambiri had spent the week of feb 17 24 praying and fasting with more than 2 000 fellow evangelicals at an annual lenten gathering in france which has one of europe s highest caseloads they then returned to their home church bethel israel tabernacle and held a sunday service on march 1 according to le monde a french newspaper almost 40 others who attended the lenten prayer week held in mulhouse france carried the virus to other parts of france and to guyana transcript there are countless more examples of problems with people getting access to tests all across the country including in my home state of florida we need to have someone in charge of making sure that as many people as possible across this country have access to getting tested as soon as possible who is that person is it you is it the vice president can you give us the name of who can guarantee that anyone but especially health care workers who need to be tested can be as i tried to explain to congressman green from the c d c perspective ok i m asking for a name who is in charge of making sure that people who need to get tested who are indicated to be tested can get a test who yeah i was trying to say that the responsibility that i have at c d c is make sure all the public health labs have it and they can make the judgment on how they want to use it but they re referencing people who have been advised to be tested to you and they ve been turned down so is it you as i said i m going to look into the specifics i know that so basically you re saying reclaiming my time basically you seem to be saying because you can t name anyone specifically that there s no one specifically in charge that we can count on to make sure that people who need to be tested health care workers or anyone else there s not one person that can ensure that these tests can be administered yes or no my colleague is looking at me to answer the system the system does not is not really geared to what we need right now what you are asking for that is a failing a failing yes it is a failing let s admit it the fact is the way the system was set up is that the public health component that dr redfield was talking about was a system where you put it out there in the public and a physician asks for it and you get it the idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it we re not set up for that do i think we should be yes but we re not ok that s really disturbing and i appreciate the information one of the country s top health officials said that the government s coronavirus testing methods were inadequate in testimony on capitol hill on thursday speaking at a house committee hearing on coronavirus testing dr anthony s fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and dr robert redfield the director of the centers for disease control and prevention fielded pointed questions about rising frustration over a lack of testing kits across the country the system does not is not really geared to what we need right now what you are asking for dr fauci said that is a failing it is a failing let s admit it dr fauci had stepped in to respond to a question from representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida to dr redfield about who was ultimately responsible for overseeing testing the idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it we are not set up for that dr fauci added do i think we should be yes but we are not on both sides of the atlantic on thursday the consequences of president trump s decision to ban most travel from europe began to be felt economically politically and socially traveling americans sought to understand what mr trump s plan meant for them and european union leaders sharply condemned the move even as many nations on the continent moved to tighten their own restrictions on the movement of people the coronavirus is a global crisis not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action a statement from european leaders said the european union disapproves of the fact that the u s decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation italy s government reported more than 15 000 infections through thursday a jump of more than 2 000 and more than 1 000 deaths with the worst outbreak outside of china italy is under a national lockdown in france which has more than 2 280 cases president emmanuel macron announced that the country s schools and universities would close starting next week mr trump imposed a 30 day ban on foreigners who in the previous two weeks have been in any of the 26 countries that make up europe s schengen area of open borders american citizens permanent legal residents and their families returning to the u s would not be affected neither would cargo in appearances on several morning television shows on thursday mr pence said that americans returning from
