posted a link to the facebook event monday urging peaceful protest i hope to see you all there we ll be nice respectful and well dressed bring your signs and your passion for america he wrote by thursday huizenga struck a different tone some of us understand what is happening the rest of the sheep do not but it was designed that way which is why we re speaking out and acting out he wrote wait for the violence it will happen people in our culture are not designed to obey these kinds of orders huizenga said in a phone interview that he worked in the 6th congressional district for trump s campaign he said that he and event co host michele even who he said was a fellow activist came up with the idea he said that while people are really energized and trump is an attachment to that energy

we can to clean up our mess when we leave to make sure people are respectful this is a conservative rally i don t expect it to be chaotic people here really don t want it to be chaotic he said but huizenga reiterated his warning about violence the message here that i had violence will happen and it will happen in two weeks when people literally don t have any food he said when we re pitting neighbor against neighbor people are going to be angry humans aren t designed to act like this especially american humans aren t used to this at all you re gonna rub people the wrong way there will be
