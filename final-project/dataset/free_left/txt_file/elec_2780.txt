 2020 elections look forward to daily reminders of sanders bitter fight against hillary clinton four years ago and how that election turned out for democrats democratic presidential candidate joe biden mario tama getty images by marc caputo and natasha korecki 03 05 2020 04 30 am est link copied the morning after whipping bernie sanders joe biden woke up wednesday to his primary opponent s first paid negative tv ads attacking him over social security and trade biden s campaign response 2016 advertisement framing sanders as a divisive party outsider who won t accept defeat the biden campaign pointed to his bitter democratic primary fight four years ago with his party nemesis hillary clinton that ended with a chaotic nominating convention and donald trump s election months later biden s strategy capitalizes on clinton s successful effort to brand sanders as more unlikable than biden among women who favored the former vice president by 12 percentage points during his 10 state romp super tuesday according to exit poll averages with the averages showing sanders lost black voters by even more 34 points the biden campaign also tangentially brought up race in bashing the vermont senator we can t divide this party like we did last time to allow trump to get reelected biden campaign co chairman rep cedric richmond a member of the congressional black caucus from louisiana told reporters on a conference call wednesday democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders m scott mahaskey politico the fact that senator sanders is on tv today with negative attack ads and consistently saying the establishment is teaming against him no african american voters have made a conscious decision that we fought and we earned civil rights through blood sweat and tears richmond said and so as he rails against the establishment i did not know that african americans in the south were considered part of the establishment sanders campaign did not respond for a comment the sharp turn in the primary marked the kickoff of the de facto two man race between sanders and biden the former is waging a campaign about policy the latter is focusing on personality though biden remains nominally ahead in the race for delegates needed to win the nomination at the party s convention in june he does not have a commanding lead and tensions are escalating in a sign of his campaign s struggles sanders finally gave in to advisers who had been pushing for months to go negative on biden releasing two ads criticizing him sanders then personally laid into biden at a news conference in vermont wednesday joe is going to have to explain to the people the union workers in the midwest why he s supported disastrous trade agreements sanders said joe is going to have to explain to the american people why he voted for a wall street bailout something that i vigorously opposed sanders repeated the phrase joe is going to have to explain three more times concerning biden s positions on authorizing the iraq war supporting a a disastrous bankruptcy bill which benefited the credit card companies and advocating cuts to social security medicare and medicaid but biden who has addressed many of the criticisms over the months in debates town halls and media interviews has little interest in fighting on the terrain picked by sanders now flush with cash biden advisers said the campaign raised 15 million in three days the campaign is better positioned to go head to head on paid messaging including television ads that were already running in the next batch of primary states the biden strategy is to make bernie pay as steep a price as possible among electability minded voters to whom bernie s attacks would be off putting because it reminds them of the divisions in 2016 said brian fallon a former spokesman for clinton he predicted that sanders would repeat his primary tactics of four years ago by going negative on biden hours later sanders did just that and biden s deputy campaign manager kate bedingfield was quick to remind reporters of the past we ve seen unfortunately what kind of campaigns bernie sanders runs bedingfield said we saw the impact that it had in 2016 biden supporters from donors to surrogates huddled wednesday to devise how to handle what they expect will be an onslaught of negative attacks not just from sanders but from republicans who never quite counted out the former vice president already on wednesday gop members of congress started up talk of investigations of biden that would benefit trump biden advisers note the attacks are nothing new and that over the past year even amid a barrage of attempted takedowns biden showed resiliency ultimately emerging the sole surviving moderate in what began as a vast primary field they also say the sustained attention from republicans is further evidence of the threat trump believes biden poses in a general election still biden s campaign has had its share of criticisms even from supporters most notably rep jim clyburn who complained of a deficient field organization and poor fundraising on wednesday biden s media organization attempted to keep a tight ship on messaging

said we re trying to keep a tight united front as we centralize messaging from our staff here biden s camp is pushing forward with a strategy whose success the past four days is indisputable framing him as the momentum candidate to that end staffers continue lining up congressional and local endorsements in upcoming states work that s made easier by biden s against the odds victories across the super tuesday map sanders too is making an electability argument saying biden will ultimately suffer in a matchup against trump over issues like trade sanders said an issues debate is what voters want i do not want this campaign to degenerate into a trump type effort where we re attacking each other where it s personal attacks sanders said emphasizing he wants to debate substance in a separate email to supporters biden s campaign noted his strength in the suburbs and swing districts an argument biden has attempted to underscore for his candidacy for months on the trail now the campaign has data points to back it up biden won people of all backgrounds he did very well in the suburbs and swing districts the email read he won in the places that democrats won in 2018 laura barron lopez
