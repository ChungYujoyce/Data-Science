advertisement supported by the defeat of the measure allows president trump to continue to act unilaterally on iran in defiance of congress by catie edmondson washington the senate failed on thursday to overturn president trump s veto of a resolution seeking to block him from taking further military action against iran without explicit approval from congress falling short in its latest effort to curtail his unilateral moves on matters of war and peace the unsuccessful override attempt the second in two years aimed at limiting mr trump s war making powers was defeated on a 49 to 44 vote a margin well below the constitutionally required two thirds majority that would have been needed to enact the measure over his veto but the bipartisan support for doing so underscored lawmakers deep skepticism about the president s penchant for defying congress on military matters and his expansive authority to wage war without consulting a coequal branch of government seven republicans joined democrats to support the measure congress needed to stand up in a bipartisan way to make plain that this president should not get into a war with iran or any war without a vote of congress said senator tim kaine democrat of virginia and the sponsor of the measure congress has expressed what is the popular will mr kaine introduced the resolution after the president ordered a strike against iran s top security commander maj gen qassim suleimani a provocation that brought the united states to the brink of war with iran and unleashed a bitter dispute in congress lawmakers were furious about the white house s failure to confer with them before the strike as well as a classified document notifying them of the move that provided no information on future threats or an imminent attack the justification the president initially cited for the strike in the first in a series of shifting explanations mr trump vetoed the measure on wednesday evening and used his formal veto message to frame the legislation as a personal affront calling it a very insulting attack introduced by democrats as part of a strategy to win an election on nov 3 by dividing the republican party we live in a hostile world of evolving threats and the constitution recognizes that the president must be able to anticipate our adversaries next moves and take swift and decisive action in response mr trump said that s what i did senator mitch mcconnell republican of kentucky and the majority leader on thursday praised the strike as sending a strong message to iran we must maintain the measure of deterrence we restored with the decisive strike on suleimani mr mcconnell said that starts today with upholding the president s rightful veto of a misguided war powers resolution the pentagon has begun gradually reducing the military forces sent to the middle east in the wake of the jan 3 strike on general suleimani after anticipating either more retaliatory strikes directed by tehran or a surge in attacks by iranian proxy forces two patriot missile batteries weapons designed to down enemy aircraft and incoming ballistic missiles were withdrawn from saudi arabia and two were pulled out of iraq according to a u s official four batteries still remain in the region two fighter squadrons have also returned to the united states along with hundreds of soldiers from the 82nd airborne division the wall street journal first reported the developments in the senate republicans were initially resistant to backing mr kaine s resolution but a small group eventually supported it after growing angry about the administration s apparent disregard for lawmakers input and an attitude among top officials that suggested that raising questions about the suleimani strike amounted to emboldening iran a small group of republicans has crossed party lines in recent years to join democrats in trying to curb the president s war powers arguing that congress must reclaim its authority as the branch of government empowered to make war but legislative remedies have failed to garner the support necessary to survive a veto a measure similar to mr kaine s passed by the democratic led house was voted down in the senate last year after lawmakers were spooked by the president s admission that he had called off a military strike against iran while some u s officials have determined that the threat from iran has diminished enough in recent weeks to pull back some american forces others are not so sure since last may in response to iranian attacks and provocations the pentagon had deployed about 14 000 additional troops to the persian gulf region including roughly 3 500 more to saudi arabia the military assets include early warning aircraft maritime patrol planes patriot air and missile defense batteries b 52 bombers a carrier strike group armed reaper drones and other engineering and support personnel thomas gibbons neff contributed reporting advertisement
