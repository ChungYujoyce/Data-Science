intelligence matters will dedicate several forthcoming episodes to understanding the fundamentals and national security implications of covid 19 intelligence matters john mclaughlin correspondent michael morell producer olivia gazis jamie benson michael morell john welcome welcome to intelligence matters in fact welcome back to intelligence matters john mclaughlin thank you michael great to be with you michael morell so this is the second time that you ve been on the show the first time was may 2018 in fact it was late may it was around memorial day and you ll remember that we talked about the organization the c i a officers memorial fund that was created after 9 11 to take care of the families of c i a officers who were lost in the line of duty and i would encourage our listeners that if you haven t listened to that episode you should go back and do so it s one of my favorite episodes i also want to let people know that we re in the midst of a series of episodes on the implications of coronavirus so we started with dr david agus a cbs news medical contributor to talk about the virus itself and what we know and what we don t know and last week we had lisa monaco talking about how a white house how a government should manage this sort of thing and today we have you john to talk about the national security implications and i mentioned to you in an email that i have a lot of questions about specific issues ranging from strategic competition with china and potential political instability in important countries and all sorts of things but i d like to start by asking you if you have any kind of broad cross cutting thoughts at this point about what the kind of long term implications of this might be for the world and international affairs national security et cetera john mclaughlin well a couple things michael you know i think you have to begin with something that i would not normally begin with and that is something that you and i will be familiar with from our time in our former profession where we always would want to know at the very beginning what is it we don t know about something and i think we re struggling a bit with the fact that there are more uncertainties about this situation than we typically have you may have been through some of them with the medical expert but obviously it bears repeating that we don t know yet whether this is a seasonal phenomenon a year round phenomenon whether we ll have a second wave or a third wave we don t know yet when we ll get a vaccine that s the second thing people are saying a year to 18 months perhaps we don t really know the origins of it a lot of controversy about that so you have to start by saying there are so many unknowns here that what we say about the longer term consequences are inevitably subject to revision and speculation that said some things are fairly obvious there s a drop in output in the world to the point where i think most economists are now projecting a fairly serious plunge in growth next year i ve seen estimates as high as a 12 plunge in growth when people were expecting really a rather smooth economy globally for the next year another thing that s been going on for a long period of time and that has been highlighted in some even intelligence publications is a kind of global how to put it a kind of global dissatisfaction with government which we see in a lot of different arenas and countries that s probably going to increase as a result of this because most countries are looking at their response to this and questioning whether their systems are performing as they should be there s also another big huge issue globally is simply demographic change you know the world s going to hit something like 8 3 8 4 billion people in a couple of decades urbanization is increasing 65 is what most people are expecting in a couple of decades 65 of people living in cities so it s already a very urban globe 55 or so of the population of the world in cities that means that it s another way in which this is going to be hard to combat because social distancing is pretty easy where i m living right now in virginia but it s awfully hard in a place like karachi or cairo so there s that global order how do we think about global order well global order essentially boils down to rules institutions borders things like that this thing presents a challenge to global order in ways that we hadn t really considered previously on just multiple levels if you look just at let s just take something like maritime roles and challenges everyone knows about china s challenge in the south china sea and the east china sea and so forth but it s kind of striking that at this point in the pacific i think we have really no carriers operating one is the roosevelt which is out of commission because of the outbreak there another one is in maintenance and another one is on quarantine and so at this point china has the only aircraft carrier operating in that region michael morell isn t that something john mclaughlin that in itself is kind of emblematic of how it has affected the u s ability to project power and i know our defense department will say that they re up to any mission and so forth and that s kind of what we expect of them and what they typically say but in truth i think our ability to project power is somewhat limited and then on this whole issue of global order obviously china and russia see opportunities here to increase their influence around the world even as they struggle with the consequences of this virus for them so one could go on about the broader strategic challenges and the global challenges or just the supply network that s interrupted in multiple ways just medical supplies i mean as an economist you know better than anyone that the economy globally works well when things are unimpeded and moving freely but the virus has kind of acted maybe like a circuit breaker in terms of breaking the flow of goods in an environment where almost everything is a product of multinational contribution from the iphone to automobiles to the medicines that we take one of the struggles right now being of course that many of the components for what we need to do testing happen to come from china michael morell right john mclaughlin you know eight to ninety percent of our antibiotics come from china most generic drugs 60 to 70 are made in india but they get many of their components from china and because everyone needs these things and because other things are impeding the flow of goods that s also off balance at this point i should stop there because the global implications are almost beyond imagining michael morell john let me pick up on a couple of things that you said and the first is the growing dissatisfaction that you mentioned with regard to how populations might be seeing their governments in terms of how they re dealing with the outbreak itself or how they re dealing with the economic consequences and so i m wondering sort of after the fact as people are allowed to or as they feel comfortable going back out onto the streets if we re going to see calls for political change in a number of countries calls for political change that could even become violent how do you react to that john mclaughlin you know i m not thinking so much of violence i m thinking more a matter of diminished trust in government if you look at china for example and it s always hard for us to imagine any really consequential discontinuity in china people tend to think china will just be china and they ll continue being the way they are well it s now pretty obvious that china waited six seven days a week or so before they informed the population that they had a serious problem that s come out in some leaked documents that have appeared in the media it s also obvious and been reported that china is restricting publication of research that has been done in china on the origins and the development and spread of the virus so given that china already has a problem with hong kong feeling oppressed and speaking out about it and given that taiwan handled this a lot more skillfully than mainland china did you can imagine in the aftermath of this that there will be some strong discontent in china about how the government handled all of this you know in our own country surveys by the pew organization a reliable public opinion surveyor if you went back to 1964 75 76 of americans said they trusted the american government to do the right thing that s now down to 17 michael morell wow john mclaughlin that s before coronavirus before coronavirus so you start off with in the united states a kind of diminished trust in government that has built over a long period of time and you just have to watch the news every day to realize that we re at a moment here where i think the average citizen is not quite sure what to believe about everything from masks to the availability of testing look at russia it s clear putin is trying to stay out of the public sight and delegating most of the public decisions on this to his advisors and his spokespeople and the mayor of moscow and so forth this is nothing he wants to be particularly associated with as the responsible authority so i m not thinking of violence so much but here s another one and i ll stop at this point if you look at the developing world where we don t have a real at least i have not been able to find a real empirical sense of what s going on there with the spread of the virus largely because in some cases it s authoritarian governments as in iran who aren t publicly acknowledging the depth of their problem and in other places it s just inefficiency or so forth so i mentioned demographics a few minutes ago with the burgeoning population in the world only two to three percent of that population increase is going to occur in the developed world this is going on every year so in the less developed world you have burgeoning populations governments that already have trouble providing services and now you ve got the coronavirus on top of it i don t think we have the slightest idea what s happening in countries that have no ability to do social distancing and the potential because of many of them being in the southern hemisphere for all of that to coalesce into a second wave that comes north again we ve got to think about that but in those societies themselves you can see because the stresses are already there ethnic turmoil migration all of that that s probably all going to be increased by this virus because it s a problem that they re not prepared to handle michael morell so john do you have a sense of how this will impact the already existing trend away from democracy and toward authoritarianism in the world john mclaughlin well i gather it s already started in places like hungary where orban has taken a lot of power unto himself to the point where the european union has scolded him for exceeding the rules of the european union when it comes to democracy you have a sense that certainly it s not going to enhance democracy in places like china or russia or egypt for example or iran so yes i think the net result is probably going to be strengthening of authoritarian societies if they can survive it going back to the uncertainties i mentioned at the very beginning michael morell yeah you get the sense that publics are willing to give up some of their rights in these kinds of situations and are willing to give more power to the executive in order to protect them and executives like orban and it s also happened in some other places now look to take advantage of those situations and grab power and probably don t plan on giving it back after their crisis subsides so i worry about that john mclaughlin well it s a war it s a war and in wartime you typically find that in societies even in democratic societies michael morell yeah so i want to come back to the point you made about the origins of the virus you mentioned it a couple of times and there s the whole issue of man made versus naturally occurring i m not really interested in that debate but the issue of was this a virus that was being researched at the wuhan institute and did it leak out accidentally the secretary of state mike pompeo has been pretty strong about his views on that with regard to the possibilities and i wonder to what extent that might be overstating the evidence that we have just wondering what your thoughts are about the origin question and then why it s an important question john mclaughlin i think that s overstating the knowledge on this again you know i m not reading classified material here but you and i can both usually read between the lines of press stories that talk about intelligence and the ones i ve read and this is obviously the result of someone in the policy community i guess talking about what they ve seen in the intelligence the intelligence community at this point seems undecided about it or at the point of saying they cannot yet get to the bottom of it and so i d go for now with the idea that this is not certain enough to be confident and that seems to be what people other than secretary pompeo think certainly the defense secretary esper has come down on the side of we re just not sure yet we re looking into it why is it important i think it s important on two levels first i ve seen nothing that tells me that this was created in a lab perhaps it was but i ve seen nothing that affirms that confidently most of what i ve seen indicates that it came from a bat that infected an animal that in turn was passed along to human beings one way or another we don t know yet whether that s true and that s impeded a bit by the fact that china has started to clamp down on the publications of its research institutes on this so it s only important because of what it tells us about the trustworthiness of what the chinese are putting out on this and the importance of that is that we can t get through this in my personal opinion without a fairly transparent and cooperative relationship with china i mean the distinguishing feature of this virus is that it requires a global response because it doesn t know any boundaries and unless we work together on this we are not going to be able to beat it in an efficient manner so it matters as a matter of confidence in dealing with china that we understand its origins and the sooner we get to the bottom of that and they help us get to the bottom of that the better michael morell so i couldn t agree more with your characterization that we need a global response but it sure looks like every nation has turned inward and is worried about itself inside of its borders with not a lot of folks being interested in coordinating some sort of global response john mclaughlin yeah well we have to think about this look at the way the world reacted to the spanish flu in 1918 19 again nationalism triumphed after that and within 20 years we were back at war in the second world war so the question here is do we deal with this in the way the world dealt with it after world war i or do we deal with it in the way that the united states dealt with turmoil and trouble after world war ii when we created largely with u s leadership all of the institutions multinational ranging from the u n to nato to the bretton woods agreement and so forth and so on the imf creating essentially the foundation of what became a globalized economy and a globalized network which of those models prevails here and to get to a globalized model you need leadership someone has to lead it and i don t see any country capable of leading it other than the united states for a couple of reasons first everyone looks to us even when they criticize us one thing i learned in my career was people want u s leadership even when they don t want it and yet we re not at the moment really postured to do that and i don t want to get overly political but the truth of it is our current administration has pulled out of just about every multilateral institution that could be a foundation for global leadership and has signaled with the america first policy that that s not what we re doing i know they will say that we are leading and i ve heard them speak publicly at the munich security conference and elsewhere about how the united states is leading but if you re in the audience and listening to people no one thinks we re leading so you have that problem and then if we re not going to lead who does i don t think the chinese can lead they do not have our soft power meaning the universal identification with culture and values that people have when they look to the united states i mean 70 of the box office receipts for american movies are overseas mostly in russia and china and no other country has that that soft power so while people may want medical supplies from china and they are presently the world s largest manufacturer and supplier of ventilators and masks and while they re also shipping out medical equipment to dozens of countries in europe africa asia and the united states i think people will gladly take their help but not translate that into a desire for chinese leadership on international affairs global order national security and so i fear that we re in that world war i posture where no one is picking up the leadership mantle in a real sense it s hard work it s really hard work and nations are going their own way and on top of that i mean i ve always been kind of an embarrassingly enthusiastic fan of the european union largely because i was a student in europe in the early days of that and i became infected with the idea that this was kind of a solution to europe s problems which i think for the most part it has been but even in the european union you have disunity germany has done well better than most of the countries there but none of the countries are helping each other and they re competing for all of the things you need to get through this and the chinese have shown up again with help that s accepted in places like italy russia has shown up in serbia which is not a nato member but is a partner nation of nato russia has shown up to great effect with their slavic allies in serbia so what you see is a situation so far that is more comparable to the post world war i situation than the post world war ii situation michael morell okay john let s maybe dig into some specific issues and maybe the most important is what you think what your sense is i know it s awfully early but what your sense is of how this will affect the u s china strategic rivalry john mclaughlin well this is a difficult time for u s china relations for a bunch of reasons first you have the trade war which has eased a bit with the phase i agreement but the phase i agreement didn t cover the toughest issues really it didn t cover agreements on manufacturing for example which is the thing i think trump really wanted out of it so you have still the trade tensions i mean let s break it down you ve got that you ve got the military competition which centers on the south china sea china sea and taiwan potentially and in the background of all of that you have the approaching presidential election now i ve been around long enough to have listened to the china debate in every presidential election and in every presidential election china s one of the bad boys so we re about to experience a lot of rhetoric perhaps not from the democratic side in fact i don t anticipate it from the democratic side even though it has been often in the past on the democratic side but i have a sense it may not be this year because of these unique circumstances but the potential for a breakthrough in china u s relations is not great at the moment that s probably an understatement add to that the fact that washington s debated this for years and the way i see the foreign policy elite in washington whatever that means to some it s the swamp to others it s the elite i guess but really smart people thinkers people who work on foreign policy both in the government and outside the mood on china has really soured in the last couple of years a sense that we have tried all of the things that we can try to encourage a better relationship with china and nothing has quite worked and so that s left i think more people than in the past thinking of china as much less than a partner when in fact for years the debate was will china be an enemy an adversary a competitor potentially a partner right now i think the partner vote is pretty small michael morell uh huh affirm john mclaughlin now what do i think i think i get to say what i think right i think we ought to be trying to figure out how to get closer to competitor partner here because given the fact that these are the two most important largest economies in the world we re not just doing this for ourselves it s going to affect everyone in the world what happens in the china u s relationship so we actually are carrying a responsibility for a good part of the world when we deal with china and i think a trade war is a bad idea even though i think trump is correct to have spotted abuses in their trade program that s fair enough but to make it a war is a bad thing to have pulled out of the trans pacific partnership gave up leverage that we would have had in asia to deal with china on a more effective foundation because with the i guess total of 11 other countries from pacific to asia we would have had a foundation of accord on broad trade issues with which to face china versus the situation we have now where we re facing them bilaterally and the remaining members of the trans pacific partnership have coalesced and gone their own way in an agreement that leaves us out so what you ve got to do then to get a better strategic relationship is get back into that kind of club where you re dealing with all of these people together it would have the advantage of traditional alliances like nato the european union relationship the former partners in the trans pacific partnership if we were all knitted up with them then we would be able to represent those interests combined in our dealing with china rather than where we are now so i don t want to leave the sense that this is all hopeless this is all fixable repairable but it s hard work and those things i think have to be done with no illusions because china is certainly not going to be an easy counterpart for us to deal with they are a rising power they are looking to the future they think their day has come and yet they have their own internal problems and i ll stop there because that s the other side of this coin they re having their own internal problems michael morell yeah it really seems to me and i don t know if i m overstating this but it seems to me that they sense that this is an opportunity for them to garner some significant influence around the world right with us focused internally and with their ability to share medical supplies and medical personnel that they see this as a soft power opportunity and i m wondering how you think about that john mclaughlin it certainly is an opportunity it is an opportunity to gain soft power or to present a different face that leaves that residue of soft power with other countries i am skeptical that they can bring it off in part because i just don t have a sense that people identify with everything from their human rights practices to their governmental structure they d like to present what they are doing governmentally as an alternative model call it market leninism whatever you want to call it basically a fairly open economy and a very restricted tight political control regime i don t think anyone really wants that but i could be wrong i mean we may be at one of those that s how i would bet i would bet that people will have a transactional relationship with china be very happy about that but the only reason they would lean toward china and allow china to exploit this for soft power advantage and leadership advantage the only reason in my judgment is because we are creating a vacuum in other words we are creating a void there that they can move into we are part of the opportunity and i think michael morell yeah one of the john mclaughlin we michael morell one of the th john mclaughlin the old people would run to us everyone that i talk to in asia and i ll bet you ve had this experience too they want us in the game in asia they re in china s orbit economically but they don t want to be in it politically that s where i see it michael morell john the other primary adversaries of the u s russia iran north korea one of the questions that i get and i d love to pose it to you is do you have any concerns about any of them trying to take advantage of the current situation john mclaughlin yes yes iran i m sure they all consider us not only distracted but militarily less adroit right now than we normally would be because of the fact that our military has to be concerned about this virus so we re seeing i think in iraq there has been no letup in the attacks on american interests and forces by iran s proxies the militia and so forth the russians have been behaving mischievously with things like buzzing our aircraft and ships vessels in both the black sea and the mediterranean the chinese have been very provocative recently in the south china sea and the north koreans have been on a missile shooting spree so add all of that up i think you re definitely seeing a time when these countries see an opening to do things that we would normally combat instantly both rhetorically publicly and perhaps militarily when we re off balance we re not being able to do much of that michael morell yeah the one i worry the most about john is iran because they both need an external enemy an external focus to get their public s mind off of their public s dissatisfaction with them and i think they sense that maybe this is an opportunity for us to look at iraq and say it s just not worth it it s just not worth fighting for so i do really worry about iran picking up the tempo even more in iraq with the hope that we just say we re going to go home it s not worth it john mclaughlin i think that s a valid fear i agree with you we haven t mentioned syria either where in this current circumstance we were already at the point of saying it s not worth it to us but it s hard for me to imagine us remaining very committed there in these circumstances and also places like this it ripples into other things for example the great controversy now over the world health organization you could do a whole podcast on that itself but what they re facing reminds me of the kind of situations that you and i often dealt with in our former jobs where you look at something and you realize the alternatives facing us none of them are good which one is least bad i think the world health organization is not without its faults and flaws but when you look at a situation like syria for example they re kind of stuck if they don t intervene in parts of the world where we can t really be present whether it s syria or sub saharan africa those countries are not going to get much help as this virus takes hold and yet they end up having to deal with nasty characters dictators and open themselves up to criticism for doing that so which do we want do we want them not to do that do we want them to do that those are unpalatable alternatives but this virus is confronting people with those kinds of choices michael morell so another question i wanted to ask you is about international terrorists you know we both know that al qaeda prior to 9 11 was researching chemical and biological weapons anthrax on the biological weapons side we know that isis was interested in both chemical and biological weapons and actually used chemical weapons on the battlefield in iraq and syria chemical weapons they had produced in university labs where those universities were inside the caliphate so i m just wondering about whether this might rekindle an interest of terrorists in biological weapons what s your sense john mclaughlin you know that s a really tough one michael the surprising thing to me all along with terrorism is why we haven t seen them use biological weapons more than they have because we ve known for years that they re not that hard to make leave aside coronavirus it s been demonstrated that you can make pretty sophisticated chemical and biological tools with household chemicals and fairly easily available strains cultures so i m puzzled as to why they haven t done it before i could see i almost hate to say it because sometimes you think up an idea and you think it s so horrible you don t want to suggest it but i could see the extreme elements of the organizations seeing merit in getting someone infected and circulating him in society somehow as a kind of living weapon that can t be detected very easily but on the other hand it s also occurred to me this is why this question s so hard if you re in isis right now you re probably on the run hiding out in remote parts of iraq and syria you re probably getting this virus or you re susceptible to it and it could just as easily destroy their fighting population as it destroys everything else and hard to believe that they have much in the way of medical equipment testing medicines and so forth so i think that s a really hard one i can t really offer any great wisdom on that one michael morell let me just come to the last question john come back to this issue of china s pursuit of influence one of my concerns is the financial stability of emerging markets they are heavily leveraged they have a lot of dollar denominated debt they re not going to be from a public health perspective able to deal with the outbreak they re not going to have the fiscal and monetary policy tools to make a difference on the economic side so i wouldn t be surprised if a number of them start lining up outside the imf and the world bank asking for help and my fear is that there are going to be so many of them that they re not going to be able to get what they need from those institutions and there s only one place in the world who has that kind of money and so i m concerned that china kind of swoops in to save the day here for many of these emerging markets and the potential impact of that on chinese influence may be much much more significant than it is on the public health side john mclaughlin i think that s exactly what going to happen the projections i ve seen for emerging markets have their growth rates plummeting by at least five percent just this year and lord knows what happens after that so they re michael morell and we knew how difficult it was to deal with one country in financial crisis or two or three in financial crisis let alone ten or 15 john mclaughlin right and a number of these countries yes so yes they re ripe for the picking and china will show up i m sure again the only way i think china begins to translate this into real influence is if they stop being so transactional in the way they provide assistance usually what they re doing is providing assistance with all kinds of qualifiers not moral and human rights qualifiers but qualifiers that give them territorial rights commercial rights and so forth and so there s a kind of exploitative quality to their assistance that doesn t mean people wouldn t take it but it does again in my mind limit how much love they buy for it michael morell yeah john mclaughlin maybe it s not so much about love though in the end and then at the end you ve also got to look at how one thing we haven t talked about and very quickly i would just observe the other part of the economy that s really in a tailspin as a result of this little tiny microscopic virus is the oil market michael morell right john mclaughlin because everyone s production is down demand is down russia and china had a brief battle over reducing oil output russia won the projections i ve seen have oil prices plummeting in april and may below where they are now which is around what 40 some a barrel and so that is going to hit some of these emerging markets nigeria angola it s going to hit russia itself michael morell right john mclaughlin and that s another almost incalculable factor in all of this but again if china s recovering they ll be one of the few people buying oil and so that s another bit of leverage they have perhaps michael morell john thank you john mclaughlin the other thing with china is we keep our eye on it i ve said where i stand but i m also quite prepared to say i could be wrong because we re going to see some discontinuity out of this that none of us are predicting michael morell right john thank you so much for taking the time to be with us today thank you john mclaughlin it s always a pleasure michael thank you end of transcript first published on april 22 2020 6 03 am 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the
