the following is a transcript of an interview with david rubenstein that aired sunday december 1 2019 on face the nation john dickerson so david start me off with where this project came from that became the book david rubenstein i thought it would be a good idea to educate americans about history we don t really educate americans as much about history as we should we don t teach history as much as we used to we don t teach civics as much as we used to on a recent survey it turned out that three quarters of americans cannot name the three branches of government and one third of americans cannot even name one branch of government it also turns out that 49 out of 50 states the majority of citizens cannot pass native born citizens the basic citizenship test that naturalized citizens have to pass and ninety one percent of naturalized citizen candidates pass that test so we are rightly concerned about stem subjects but we shouldn t ignore history and civics so i think that s important for all citizens but i also thought it was important for members of congress as well because they re making the laws so i thought about six years ago it would be a good idea to get members of congress that know a little bit more about history than they already know and they do know a fair bit so once a month i have a dinner at the library of congress for members of congress to educate them a little bit about history by interviewing a great author doris kearns goodwin david mccullough ron chernow jon meacham and the members like it we get 250 to 300 people coming it s about members are about half of that and they have a guest so it s well attended and i think members like it so i decided to put a number of the interviews together in a book and let other people see what members of congress are learning john dickerson why is it so important for regular old americans to study history david rubenstein the theory of history is that if you learn from the past you won t make the same mistakes as was as were made in the past our famous harvard historian and philosopher george santayana said those people that don t remember the past are condemned to relive it so the theory of history is that we can learn from what we made mistakes about before and what we did right before and then maybe we can do better things in the future civilization is all about improving things and if we don t improve in the past how are we really advancing civilization so that s the importance of history sadly we don t have as much of a knowledge monologist history as people in other countries have in their own country john dickerson when members of congress come to these gatherings its bipartisan do you find that they ask questions with a specific intent because they want to use it in their own lives or are they just kind of more general histor historical questions david rubenstein it s interesting members of congress come together and it s like an era of good feelings when the dinners occur there s no bickering members from the opposite parties sit together members in the opposite house sit together and it s you wouldn t know how rancorous the atmosphere is in other parts of washington but it s like a time where they put a truce down and they come together members of congress are interested in history and they come just like anybody comes to an authors signing with their dog eared copies of books and they say to the author can i have you sign it just like anybody would because these are people who really are making the laws and they really feel that if they don t understand how presidents live before or great members of congress they aren t really doing the job that they should be doing they really want to know history john dickerson do they take any lessons away from david rubenstein well i think members tell me that it s one of the more enjoyable things they re doing in washington and i think that s because the authors we get are the best authors and best historians we have in the united states so it s not because of my interviewing of them but it s because the authors are so distinguished for example take robert caro he spent about 40 years of his life on lyndon johnson so when i interviewed him about lyndon johnson members of congress who didn t really know lyndon johnson but knew he was a great legislator they want to hear about it and so i think they re quite interested in learning from these people john dickerson what john dickerson on lyndon johnson often people will say you know if if just somebody some president applied johnson s skills to congress there d be much more progress the bipartisanship might return what do you think of that argument david rubenstein lyndon johnson became majority leader only six years after he joined the senate so he was only in the senate for six years before he came majority leader it was unbelievable how power went to him so quickly but the senate was much more it was much different then it s much harder to accrue that kind of power today and i don t think lyndon johnson for all of his skills could do today what he did in the 1950s john dickerson do you see anything or have the historians been able to give these members of congress any guidance on how they can break out of what they all agree is a time of hyper partisanship david rubenstein i don t think the historians are trying to lecture members of congress of what they should do they re just saying i wrote these books let me tell you about these great figures and you take the lessons away from them that you will and members of congress are given copies of these books after each of the sessions and they tend to read them and i think members of congress look forward to it sometimes the members of congress call it date night because they bring their spouses from outside of washington and they live elsewhere and they really see it as an enjoyable way to spend time with their spouse because they can get a nice dinner they can see artifacts from the period of time that the book is written about and they can learn something about american history john dickerson in your own work have you had a moment or a time in your career where the lessons of history have really been applicable david rubenstein well as a young man when my hair was dark and i was much thinner i worked in the white house under jimmy carter i wish i had as much knowledge of history then as i do now i was only in my 20s and of course when you re in your 20s you think you know a lot more than you really do so i wish i had the energy today that i had then and the knowledge that i have now i wish i had then but that s not the case john dickerson speaking of carter when they came in he was he had he was a disrupter of the system he had won the presidency when people didn t think he would and they came to washington saying we re not going to do things the old way would a little lessons of history have been helpful to the carter team when they came in david rubenstein well i think in hindsight we made some mistakes and i would take the blame for it as long as as well as other people who were involved in the system as well but we did some very good things we did say we re gonna shake up washington and jimmy carter came up with a very unique idea he said i m not a lawyer i m not from washington and that was unique at that time and he kind of used that populist appeal when we came to washington we probably didn t have as much breadth of knowledge of people who had served in washington before but in hindsight president carter was president for only four years and we did enormous number of things and today the amount of legislation we passed that four year period time dwarfs what s getting done today john dickerson yeah if you one of the things you ve asked these historians when you talk to them is if you could talk to one former president and ask them a question which one would it be so for you what former president if they were alive today would you would you want to talk to him what would you ask them david rubenstein in my view in our long history in this country the greatest american without doubt is abraham lincoln abraham lincoln held this country together because it wasn t obvious to people that the country should stay together i m not sure any other person who we elected president would say to the south no we re not gonna let you go away so i would ask him two questions if i had a chance to have dinner with him one why did you feel was so important to have the south stay as part of the country why not let it go away and secondly were you convinced that ending slavery through the emancipation proclamation was the only way to win the war and are you pleased that you ultimately freed the slaves and why did you not do it earlier john dickerson when you look at lincoln he came into that job with a kind of a patchwork of experience and a lot of failures do you think his rise and also you know he wasn t a well versed politician of washington what do you see in his background that tells us about lincoln s success david rubenstein he probably didn t have more than a second grade education he taught himself how to read he loved to read but he really didn t have a classic college education he didn t really go to law school and he d made a lot of mistakes in his career but he was very clever in getting the nomination that year in 1860 he wasn t the favorite for the nomination he was probably fourth or fifth most likely to get it but the clever thing he did that doris kearns goodwin points out in her book team of rivals is that he took the people who were more likely to be president or presidential nominee of his party and he brought them together in his cabinet and he really took the best of their knowledge and in the end those people idolized him the people who had thought he wasn t a really talented person they became his best friends his secretary of state for example mr seward ultimately became his biggest admirer and his biggest friend though they had been rivals for the nomination and i think abraham lincoln s great talent was that he didn t take himself too seriously he had a great sense of humor he knew how to write extremely well he had a way with words that really no president has really had since that time think about the gettysburg address 272 words that the most eloquent statement of what this country really stands for than anybody s ever written john dickerson which president when you started becoming a presidential historian yourself and so interested in them which one was the first one that you really got turned on to the presidency about david rubenstein president kennedy when i was in the sixth grade my sixth grade teacher went over the inaugural address of president kennedy which was 14 minutes in length it was very short and she went over that with my classmates and me and i realized then that it was poetry in prose form and i was honored later in my life to practice law the same firm as ted sorensen who d worked on that speech with president kennedy i think president kennedy was somebody that took my generation and said come in and give back to your country ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country and it inspired me to go into public service and many people in my generation were similarly inspired and so i think he was the one that i probably was most impressed with early on in my life john dickerson and you ve dedicated your life to public service in one form or another what do you think is the state of that notion in america the ask not notion david rubenstein i think americans want to make the country a better country but i think it s what has changed from president kennedy s time is that many people think you can help your country as you can without having to go into government service there are so many ngos today so many ways to serve your country in nonprofit areas that do not require you to be on the government payroll and so in my own case for example i think i m trying to give back to the country now through philanthropic acts and things like that and other countries and other citizens are as well so i think that s changed but i also think many people in our country don t feel that government service is as noble a thing as it once was and in fact we tend to denigrate government servants much more than we do john dickerson is there danger david rubenstein than than we should i should say john dickerson is there a danger to that that david rubenstein there is for example it s very easy to make fun of members of congress and you can always get a joke by making fun fun of members of congress they re relatively modestly paid they have an incredible lifestyle in terms of how much work they have to put in and they re under enormous amounts of pressures and we don t realize the burden they often face but we you can still make fun of very few people in our country you make fun of lawyers you make fun of private equity people you might be out to make fun of members of congress and you won t get criticized for making fun of members of congress but actually they re pretty good public servants and we should honor them more i think we should pay them more their salary hasn t gone up in about 10 years and in many ways that s really unfortunate john dickerson do you think if we actually honored public service a little more it might squeeze some of the vinegar out of our public life david rubenstein it certainly wouldn t be a bad way to start right now there s a lot of vitriol in washington there s a lot of reasons for it it s the internet social media a whole variety of things but i do think that right now public service is not honored by young people as much as it used to be it used to be the case that people who were very talented coming out of college would say i want to go and serve my country in the military or in some other government way now many people want to go do tech startups with nothing wrong with that or go into private equity or hedge funds or do other kinds of things but i think more government service would be would be a good idea john dickerson let s talk about the presidential campaign since you spent so much time thinking about presidencies and interviewing historians let s imagine any presidential candidate if you had to ask them a couple of questions given your understanding what the job is actually like what would you want to know david rubenstein why do you really want to be president it s nice to be called president of the united states but what do you really want to do as president of the united states do you really know how difficult the job is do you have the management skills to actually lead the federal government do you want to be president because it s a powerful position or because you think you can improve the lives of other americans and people around the world what is your real motivation and if the motivation is right then that s a good thing but i think people should look themselves in the mirror and say i want to be president because i really think i can help the country and make the lives of people better not because i ll have an airplane and i ll have a helicopter and i ll have a nice house in the white house and so forth i think you should really make sure you know what you want out of it and know how difficult the job is it is not an easy job people who have that job they age pretty rapidly and you should recognize that it s not a job for the faint of heart it is a tough tough job john dickerson and there s also a psychological squeeze to that job do you think that s gotten worse david rubenstein well it s a squeeze because people don t really praise you that much when you re doing the job maybe after they leave office they might praise you but people are beating you up every single day and remember you re getting the toughest decisions that are coming to you if it was easy to decide something we d get decided before it got to you so you have to make tough decisions and no decision you re going to make is going to please everybody you re gonna please probably half the people with your decision that you re gonna upset the other half so it s not an easy job and i think those people that take on that job should recognize how hard it is talk to people who ve been president talk to people who ve worked in the white house make sure you know what you re getting into john dickerson you mentioned with abraham lincoln doris kearns goodwin s book team of rivals one of his key moves was setting up that team and you also just mentioned management talk about that a little bit you have done a lot of managing in your career how important that is and why it s important david rubenstein clearly people have been good presidents without having a lot of experience as managers abraham lincoln really had never run anything barack obama had not been a manager of a lot of people a lot of people who have gone right from the senate like john kennedy really didn t manage many people before so you can still be a good president but i think you have to have the skills i think what you need to do is you need to make sure you have a sense of who you are you need to have self confidence but not arrogance i think you need to be able to admit mistakes when you make them you need to be able to get along with other people and the most important thing is you need to know how to communicate with the american people the presidency as richard newstat once wrote in a book about harry truman the presidency is really about the power of persuading and you persuade people by speaking well you persuade people by writing well but you persuade people most importantly by leading by example and you do certain things that other people say if he s doing that or she s doing that i should do that and that s the most effective way that a president can lead is lead by example do what you say others should do john dickerson as we judge presidents how should we think of them should we think of them like like a baseball player where if you re doing really well you re still striking out a lot or is it like a surgeon where one mistake and the body dies and you know it s catastrophic how should we get our expectations right about presidential success david rubenstein well in baseball if you hit a hit three for 3 out of 10 times you re gonna be considered pretty good for the time times you d be in the hall of fame right but that means you re striking out or not getting a hit 6 out of 10 times or or 7 out of 10 times and a surgeon as you point out you can t really make mistakes i don t really analogize it to being a surgeon but i do think it s similar to baseball in the sense that if you can get things right 30 percent of the time or 40 percent of the time that s pretty good because so many times things are beyond your control and you can t really manage things the way you want remember you re only the president united states you re not the president of the world and so many things are events that beyond your control it s not a job that is very easy to do and i think it s a good thing that there s a limit of only eight years it used to be the case and you could serve longer and we changed the constitution but it s a debilitating job eight years i think is a really really long period of time to serve in that position john dickerson so it s more like a baseball player and you want to be successful 3 out of 10 times or 4 out of 10 times what do you think the current way of evaluating presidents is though it seems more like people expect them to be great 9 out of 10 times david rubenstein well we evaluate presidents today to its large extent by public opinion polls because we don t see whether they got legislation passed or they are helping the country in some ways we look at public opinion polls and we take them almost every day and that s how we evaluate them that s probably not completely fortunate it s obviously important to know whether a president is popular or not but i think we shouldn t obsess over the standing in public opinion polls remember you can be very popular sometimes and do bad things and you can be unpopular and do very good things so public public opinion polls shouldn t be as important an indicator as whether you re really making the lives of americans better not on the short term only but also in the longer term john dickerson you ve had success in public sector private sector philanthropy let s say you were thrust into the job as the as the president what do you think the hardest part of the job would be for you david rubenstein i think the country would be very upset if they saw me in that position but i don t think that will happen but i d say if i were to do that something like that i would want to surround myself with people who i thought had experience who had the right motivations were coming into public service because they wanted to help the country and not for any other purpose i d want to make sure i recognize that members of congress are an equal branch of government and want to work cooperatively with them and also want to recognize that the judiciary is an equal branch of government and what it says also is a very important in terms of how the government is to be governed but also the most important thing is persuading people to do things that you think are the right things to do and you have persuade people by being honest with them being forthright with them bringing them along in a way i think makes people feel they are getting something from them the negotiation they re getting a bargain as well you can t save people i i have done the best deal and not leave anything for other people a good negotiation is one where both sides feel they re getting something they re not completely happy with it but they re getting something out of the out of it john dickerson how do you think donald trump has done on that front david rubenstein well i think it s very difficult to judge a president this early to be honest i think most historians would say give me 40 years after the presidency to evaluate whether the person has done a good or bad job so i think it s early because we don t have all the documents and so forth and clearly things going on in washington now wouldn t let s say it s a difficult time for him but i think it s too early to say how well he s done or how poorly he s done clearly he has challenges clearly he s trying to work through them i think for the sake of the country my hope is that whatever is going on in washington now will get resolved in a way that makes the american people feel the country is moving forward in a direction that we re happy with because this country is the greatest country on the face of the earth and if we don t do well the rest of the world won t do well so we have an obligation to our citizens around the whole world to do well and make sure that our government works as well as it could possibly could john dickerson given what you know about the presidency what do we misunderstand about the job or let me try that again given what you know about the presidency when you hear it talked about in presidential campaigns is there a part of that conversation that you say you know this is nice but it s really not what the job is david rubenstein well when you re running for president united states your job is to get elected to some extent and do so in a reasonably honorable way you can t say things that are ridiculous i think but you should do so in a reasonably honorable way but you have to recognize that what people say in a campaign rarely can get implemented so easily so if you say i want to have a certain type of tax i want to change the law this way it s not that easy to do you have to deal with congress and so i think it would be a good idea if people were to propose things that are realistically possible and not not to ignore the impossibility of doing something great but sometimes you have to have bold ideas and bold ideas are good but sometimes some things are just not going to happen and you can get people excited about the prospect of it and you re really going to disappoint people i think it d be a good idea when campaign proposal put together to talk to people who ve worked in the government who ve worked in these areas before and make sure you know what it is realistic to be achieving because i don t think you want to disappoint the american people and get hopes up when they can t really be achieved john dickerson if you had to build a president from component parts which parts would you choose what skills and attributes would you pick david rubenstein to me the most important skills that a president should have are one integrity two know who he or she is three make certain they have some sense of what they want to achieve with the presidency they know where they re taking the country four be honest with themselves and the american people about what s realistic and not realistic also have the ability to gather information be able to use other people s knowledge and bring people together in a way that you can get the best decision from the best brains that are available don t be afraid of people that are smarter than you don t be afraid of people have more experience and you take the best of the country bring it together and that s what i think a president should do john dickerson on the economy when we talk a lot about the economy in the context of political campaigns how much influence does a president really have on the economy david rubenstein the president has a fair amount of influence remember it s a global economy today not just a u s economy but the president can lead the president s ability to lead is still important but there are global factors beyond your control but for example today if there is a trade agreement with china as i suspect there will be that ll be a plus and the president will deserve some credit for getting a trade agreement if a president passes legislation that is good to stimulate the economy that could be helpful as well but i think the president can t control things that are absolutely beyond anybody s control there are certain factors that no president can can take into account and really control i think a president has disproportionate amount of public blame or credit for what goes on the economy but i think he his influence is less than the public perception in terms of the economy s impact john dickerson do you think because the economy is now global transactions moved so quickly we saw in the mortgage backed security crises of 2007 to 2009 there was a federal response is it now more a part of a president s portfolio that he or his team has to be an emergency manager of the economy for these kinds of global shocks david rubenstein today if there s a major problem in the global economy or the u s economy the president has to be on top of it i think under herbert hoover for example he wasn t sure that he had really the need or the responsibility to solve the the great depression and i think that was a mistake he could have probably done more i think today if there s a major problem or a minor problem of any consequence the president of the united states is today seen as the person who has to come up with some solution sometimes it s beyond his control and that s unfortunate but i think a president is seen as a person who can solve problems or at least provide comfort if there s a hurricane and there s damage the president can t do that much about preventing the hurricane and can t solve all the related problems but showing comfort compassion i think is an important job of the presidency john dickerson what about confidence we ve we gets thrown a lot in poli political discussions about confidence in the economy and the way in which a president either adds to confidence or not what do you think of that theory david rubenstein i think a president who knows what he s doing and is comfortable with what he s proposed and can give a sense of confidence to the american people you need to give the american people a sense that you know what you re doing and you are comfortable that what you re doing is likely to come up with the best result but not saying that everything you do will be perfect i think self confidence is important but not arrogance john dickerson ask you a couple questions about philanthropy what inspired you to get involved in philanthropy and make it such a big part of your life david rubenstein my parents were not college educated or they didn t graduate from high school i was their only child i grew up in very modest circumstances my father worked in the post office his entire life made a very modest salary so when i got lucky with my business i said i don t think with my last name and my modest birth i would have been able to do this in other countries so i thought i should give back to my country in ways that were meaningful to me and i ve tried to do that now i was an original signer of the giving pledge i m proud of that but that isn t the only thing i m trying to do i don t want to just give away money i want to give my time my energy and my ideas philanthropy is a derivative of an ancient greek word that means loving humanity and you can love humanity with your time everybody isn t wealthy but you can give your time your energy your ideas that can be just as valuable the most valuable thing you can give is your time you can make more money if you re inclined to do so you can come up with good ideas all the time if you re inclined to do so you can t make more time and so time is a very valuable thing when de tocqueville came here in the night in the 1830s he observed that everybody united states was volunteering for things in europe they didn t do that because the europe the government took care of all problems here we didn t have wake rake wealth and the tradition has continued in this country we are the most philanthropic country in the world as measured not just by money but by time volunteering and so forth and so in my own case i thought i wanted to give back to the country and that s what i m trying to spend most of my life doing now john dickerson do you see that spirit continuing through the younger generation david rubenstein i think the younger generation is trying to do this but it s more complicated the challenge is to get jobs as harder the challenge is to get a good education is harder i think there are a lot of difficulties that my generation perhaps didn t have but the current generation does have and remember when i was growing up in this country we were a more robust part of the global economy were not as significant a part of the global economy as we once were and therefore you have factors that americans have to take into account today when they re dealing with the economy that i didn t have to take into account when i was younger still i think americans are inclined to want to make the country better and thus like most citizens of most countries are inclined to be patriotic about their country patriotism is a good thing we shouldn t denigrate patriotism we should say that people are patriotic want to help their country doing something good for the country we shouldn t though make it used in an inappropriate way people who are not necessarily very conservative but let s say they re liberal they can be patriotic as well sometimes we bastardized the word patriotism to mean it s only people that are have a certain conservative point of view or only relating to the military obviously the most patriotic people in our country are people who sacrifice and prepared to give up their lives and those are things that are incredible that people are willing to give up their lives and give what lincoln called the last full measure of devotion to our country but you can be patriotic as well by not serving in the military you can be patriotic by serving in the country other ways and that s what i hope a lot of people are doing and younger people increasingly i hope they re doing that as well john dickerson tell me about patriotic philanthropy david rubenstein patriotic philanthropy is a phrase that i coined it s a little misleading all philanthropy is patriotic in some respects you re helping your country presumably but patriotic philanthropy is something i tried to do to remind people of the history and heritage of our country and so when i bought the magna carta and later declaration of independence the 13th amendment i put it on display so americans can see it why is that important well it turns out that if you see the page the magna carta on a computer slide you won t have the same impact it won t have the same impact on you as if you see it in person when you see it in person you ll learn more about it before you see it or after you see it and the same thing is true of fixing up the washington monument or monticello or lincoln memorial if they are better experiences more people will go see them before they go there after they go there they ll learn more about lincoln or jefferson or whoever it might be and i think that s a good thing i think people should learn more about the history and heritage of a country the good and the bad so for example in monticello when i i said i ll help fix up monticello and needed some rehabilitation i said i really want to do it but i want to make sure we recognize it thomas jefferson for his eloquence and his great skills was a slave owner and we should have the slave quarters built out as well and so that s that s done there now and i think therefore in all cases we should illustrate the good and the bad so the americans can learn the good and the bad of our past and hopefully perpetuate the good parts john dickerson and that in learning that that presidents can have great parts of them and then also have parts that are not so great and that that s kind of the human condition of a presidency not necessarily in other words that they re all angels are all devils david rubenstein yes we ve tended to defy founding fathers and we ve tended to make them almost religious figures they were great men but they weren t gods and they had their flaws many of our early presidents were slave owners there s no doubt about it so i think we should look at people with some dispassion and say look what the great things are that they did for our country but let s say they did have some flaws and some foibles and we should take those into account and learn from them john dickerson if you could give the american story to every presidential candidate what lesson would you hope they draw from it david rubenstein i would say to all the presidential candidates learn more about american history learn about the things we ve done right and wrong in the past do not think you have the sole knowledge of what s the right thing to do is and bring other people into the equation make sure you bring into the to your proposals about what you want to have done and what you re into your administration if you re elected people that have a sense of history very often many of our presidents have met with historians because they want to learn what previous presidents did i think that s a good thing and i think learning what our previous presidents did the good and bad is a good way to learn how to be a good president john dickerson david rubenstein thank you so much david rubenstein my pleasure thank you very much
