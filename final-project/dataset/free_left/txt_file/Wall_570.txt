advertisement supported by prosecutors questioned a former f b i official whose notes were used to buttress their motion to dismiss the charge against the president s first national security adviser by adam goldman and katie benner washington a key former f b i official cast doubt on the justice department s case for dropping a criminal charge against president trump s former national security adviser michael t flynn during an interview with investigators last week according to people familiar with the investigation department officials reviewing the flynn case interviewed bill priestap the former head of f b i counterintelligence two days before making their extraordinary request to drop the case to judge emmet g sullivan they did not tell judge sullivan about mr priestap s interview a justice department official said that they were in the process of writing up a report on the interview and that it would soon be filed with the court the department s motion referred to notes that mr priestap wrote around the bureau s 2017 questioning of mr flynn who later pleaded guilty to lying to investigators during that interview his lawyers said mr priestap s notes recently uncovered during a review of the case suggested that the f b i was trying to entrap mr flynn and attorney general william p barr said investigators were trying to lay a perjury trap that interpretation was wrong mr priestap told the prosecutors reviewing the case he said that f b i officials were trying to do the right thing in questioning mr flynn and that he knew of no effort to set him up media reports about his notes misconstrued them he said according to the people familiar with the investigation the department s decision to exclude mention of mr priestap s interview in the motion could trouble judge sullivan who signaled late on tuesday that he was skeptical of the department s arguments mr priestap and the justice department declined to comment mr priestap told investigators that he did not remember the circumstances surrounding the notes that he took and that he was giving them his interpretation of the notes as he read them now according to a person familiar with his interview transcript from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily today federal prosecutors are asking a court to throw out their own criminal case against former national security adviser michael flynn mark mazzetti on what led to that decision it s thursday may 14 mark remind us where the michael flynn story starts well michael flynn was a three star army general who had a quite distinguished career became the head of the defense intelligence agency under the obama administration and then he gradually sort of moves into the trump orbit in 2016 when trump was running for president during the republican convention we do not need a reckless president who believes she is above the law he famously leads a chant lock her up yes that s right lock her up of lock her up meaning to hillary clinton right if i did a tenth of what she did i would be in jail today and after trump is elected he announces that he s going to make flynn his national security adviser so it s during this time when there s a series of events that get michael flynn into trouble it s shortly after christmas in 2016 when the obama administration announces a number of sanctions against russia for its efforts to sabotage the 2016 campaign it was soon after that the washington post reports that trump s incoming national security adviser michael flynn repeatedly called the russian ambassador to the u s that the washington post reported that flynn had been on a number of phone calls with the russian ambassador on the exact same day on the same day the obama sanctions were announced which raised questions about whether the incoming trump administration was trying to meddle with the obama administration s foreign policy i talked to general flynn about that conversation actually it was vice president elect mike pence goes on face the nation they did not discuss anything having to do with the united states decision to impose a censure against russia pence says that flynn had told him the sanctions never came up on the call but the justice department had transcripts of the calls in which flynn had actually urged the ambassador not to overreact to the obama administration s sanctions f b i agents interviewed michael flynn about whether he discussed u s sanctions with russian so f b i agents are sent to the white house to interview flynn what has he told investigators he tells them that the sanctions never came up on the call right he s lying to the f b i right this all becomes public and in february 2017 general michael flynn suddenly resigned late last night flynn is forced to resign he is the shortest serving national security adviser now in modern history and what happens to flynn once he s pushed out of the white house the f b i continues to investigate flynn but very little is heard from him for a number of months and during this time president trump starts leaning on james comey the f b i director in essence to drop the flynn investigation right and that raised this idea that the president of the united states was trying to obstruct justice and that s this kind of cataclysmic moment that ultimately sets off a chain of events that leads to not only comey being fired but also the appointment of mueller as the special counsel right in many ways the flynn saga is the beginning of the mueller saga and the beginning of a very dark chapter for the trump administration that s correct what ends up happening to michael flynn well flynn pled guilty to repeatedly lying to the f b i flynn ends up pleading guilty to lying to the f b i says that he is cooperating becomes a cooperating witness in the mueller investigation he s awaiting sentence court documents make clear that flynn was not acting alone and the significance was that he was the first top white house official to plead guilty as part of the mueller investigation court papers say flynn could get up to six months behind bars but he was under mark i feel like for many people that is where the michael flynn story pretty much ends right i mean you have this three star general national security adviser who just totally falls from grace after lying to his bosses and the f b i and now he s headed to prison that s right and the mueller investigation marches on and the next significant point is the end of 2018 into 2019 when flynn is set to be sentenced by a federal judge and the mueller team weighs in breaking news right now bob mueller s office is recommending to the judge that michael flynn actually not receive any prison time and says flynn s been a good witness michael flynn cooperated plenty with the special counsel they recommend very little if any jail time the defendant provided firsthand information about the content and context of interactions between the transition team and russian government officials and something curious happens then where flynn s legal team which had been very cooperative towards the mueller investigation clearly they cut what seemed to be a pretty good deal with the mueller team decide to take a more combative stance they enter into the public record this idea that maybe flynn had been railroaded that the f b i may have set him up so this angers the judge he really reads flynn and his team the riot act saying are you now saying you re not remorseful and why are you now accusing the f b i of misconduct and basically says let s take a pause we re going to put this off for a few months and come back to me when you ve found some remorse in the intervening time the ground starts to shift william barr has just been sworn in as the new attorney general gaining broad control of the special counsel robert mueller s russia investigation william barr takes over as attorney general i believe it is vitally important that the special counsel be allowed to complete his investigation he during his confirmation hearing pledges that he s not going to interfere with the mueller investigation so mueller famously then delivers his report to barr in march of 2019 the deputy attorney general and i concluded that the evidence developed by the special counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense and barr writes a very short summary of sorts that he says summarizes mueller s findings which we now know misinterprets the mueller report it s quite clear starting at that point that barr has great issues with not only the mueller investigation but how this all began how the russia investigation began at the f b i and whether there was real misconduct i ve been trying to get answers to questions and i found that a lot of the answers have been inadequate and i also so he makes no secret of the fact that he s going to start investigating the investigation he is going to launch a campaign to get to the bottom of what happened and whether there really was a political effort to go after donald j trump and his advisers and what does that mean for michael flynn awaiting sentencing for lying to the f b i as the ground shifts and as it s clear that barr is going to look at the predicate for the entire investigation flynn decides to get a new lawyer nothing about this case was done right they violated every rule every protocol who is not only a lawyer but also a pundit of sorts the entire prosecution was false it must be dismissed this is a texas lawyer named sidney powell who has made no secret of the fact that she thinks the entire thing is a witch hunt their prosecution of general flynn was needed to keep the obstruction hoax going against the president because they already knew the russia hoax had fallen apart very much in line with what the president of the united states has said so the whole thing was orchestrated and set up within the f b i and days before she takes over as flynn s lawyer she writes a secret letter to attorney general barr where she writes quote it is increasingly apparent that general flynn was targeted and taken out of the trump administration for concocted and political purposes wow so you re saying flynn recognizes the winds are changing recognizing that there s literally a new sheriff attorney general in town who s skeptical of the entire russia investigation and so flynn hires a lawyer who fits quite nicely into that dynamic yes and during that period of time attorney general barr decides to appoint another prosecutor who s going to examine the case and see whether there had been any misconduct that had taken place so just to be clear in addition to examining the roots of the russia investigation broadly barr appoints a specific prosecutor inside the department of justice just to examine the flynn case that s right and that leads to the release of a number of documents to the public in recent weeks that have led both flynn s lawyers and the president to make the case that michael flynn was indeed railroaded and set up by the f b i we ll be right back mark tell us what s inside these documents in essence the documents are internal f b i and justice department communications around the time that flynn was interviewed by the f b i and what they show kind of broadly are that there was concern about the decision to interview flynn one of the documents that got a lot of attention was written by bill priestap who at the time was the head of the f b i s counterintelligence division which was running the whole russia investigation and this is january 24 four days after the trump administration takes over and right before there is this decision to go send f b i agents to interview the national security adviser and priestap writes quote what s our goal truth admission or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired wow in another document he seems to understand the risks of conducting this interview and he says protect our institution by not playing games and if we are seen playing games the white house will be furious some of that language is quite potentially inflammatory the idea that the person running the investigation is wondering if their goal might be to get the national security adviser fired essentially to get him in trouble it raises this question of whether sidney powell flynn s lawyers had a point that they were trying to set him up right and finally there s also interesting divide that is revealed between the f b i and the justice department and what some of the documents show is that there was some concern of justice department about what the f b i was up to so there s some concern about whether or not interviewing flynn is at all a good idea right and we find out that the f b i only tells the justice department they re going to go do this while the agents are on their way to the white house huh mark what happens once these internal f b i documents are released what s the reaction this unleashes a torrent of criticism he should dismiss the case for egregious government misconduct without a doubt by flynn s lawyer sidney powell that the government has been hiding this evidence that shows their own crimes while they were accusing mr flynn falsely of any crimes because they made it all up by other commentators on the right a lot of people close to this feel like michael flynn was setup never lied admitting that they got things completely wrong and actively worked to defame instead it looks like two systems of justice in terms of how the f b i handled hillary clinton and how they handled donald trump by president trump when i looked at what they did to him they tormented him dirty cops tormented general flynn making the case that flynn should never have been interviewed and the case should now be dropped and what would be the legal basis for that argument what in the documents do flynn s lawyers seize on and say makes his prosecution illegitimate well they re saying that these documents reveal that there was real concern in the f b i about whether the interview should have taken place in the first place mm hmm and if the interview doesn t take place then there s no lies to worry about and if there s no lies then there s nothing to prosecute flynn on and therefore there is no case period and michael flynn should walk free you have no predicate to be there in the beginning then whatever you find is immaterial to the investigation and this is what barr seizes on when he makes this incredibly dramatic decision last week just in this afternoon the justice department is dropping its criminal case against president trump s former national security adviser retired general michael flynn to drop the charges against michael flynn the justice department today is holding that there was not a legitimate basis to do an investigation of flynn barr said there was never any good reason to interview michael flynn in the first place and so whatever flynn said during the interview was irrelevant and barr even goes further than that attorney general barr thank you for speaking first to cbs news hi catherine in an interview last week he not only criticizes the decisions that were made at the time to interview flynn there was not in our view a legitimate investigation but he also goes to bat for flynn going all the way back to flynn s phone calls with the russian ambassador and it is very typical and very common for the national security team of the incoming president to communicate with foreign leaders and that call there was nothing wrong with it whatever in fact it was laudable and it was nothing inconsistent with the obama administration s policies and it was in u s interest he was saying to the russians don t escalate he actually says that the phone calls were laudable and that it was perfectly understandable that flynn would talk to the russian ambassador to try to lower tensions in a very tense environment when history looks back on this decision how do you think it will be written well history is written by the winners so it largely depends on who s writing the history i mean what s fascinating about what barr is doing is that it does not feel like every day when the department of justice sides with a defendant in a criminal prosecution over its own prosecutors who have successfully gone after that defendant and it s in keeping with what william barr has done for a year from the time that robert mueller presented his report to barr barr has questioned the legitimacy of the investigation and any fruits of that investigation he has questioned whether those prosecuted were done so fairly or whether the f b i overreached he has also backed decisions to lower sentences of others mark is barr s legal analysis in the flynn case sound is it in dispute barr s decision has been widely criticized plenty of legal experts say that prosecutors in general have wide discretion to decide which aspects of the investigation they want to pursue what is germane to the case and in this specific instance the fact that there was an ongoing investigation into contact between trump aides and the russians would make flynn s calls germane to this particular investigation that is not to say that now looking back there haven t been instances of f b i abuse over the course of the russia investigation mark given everything you ve just said and reading these documents that have been released from the department of justice about the debate that went on inside the f b i these notes from an agent about how to conduct this interview whether they might basically trap flynn in a lie and get him fired i mean is there a version of this where what bill barr has done is exactly what any justice system should do when there are serious questions about the legitimacy of a prosecution which is kind of give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant you always want greater transparency when it comes to how an investigation was conducted that s true if the target is michael flynn or if the target is someone far less famous the concern of course is whether there is abuse going on in the other direction what do you mean that what the attorney general is doing is in effect launching a campaign to discredit the investigation to discredit the mueller probe to discredit its results in a way that will ultimately benefit his boss president trump remember president trump who s been railing against the quote unquote witch hunt for years will be using this for his re election campaign so the concern of course is that bill barr is kind of acting as a proxy warrior for the president but mark is it possible that both things can be true that the attorney general bill barr may be trying to discredit the entire russia investigation and in the process very much oversimplify things and that the prosecution of michael flynn might be flawed yes both of those things can be true and this is why the passions are so intense on this issue because both sides want to control the narrative and because of that can t allow necessarily any gray area in this argument either michael flynn is a hero or he s a traitor either the mueller investigation was a just pursuit or it was a witch hunt and of course there is a lot of space between those characterizations and nuance that gets lost because the political debate is black and white so mark what s going to happen to michael flynn now well of course given what william barr decided there is a very likely scenario that michael flynn soon is a free man and he is brought back into the fold and in the coming months we see him once again campaigning for donald trump thank you mark thanks michael on wednesday night the times reported that before the department of justice sought to throw out the case against michael flynn it had interviewed the f b i official whose notes have been interpreted as potentially seeking to entrap flynn in that interview the official bill priestap said that his notes had been misconstrued and that there was no effort to set flynn up we ll be right back here s what else you need to know today the scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent significantly worse than any recession since world war ii we are seeing a severe decline in economic activity in a speech on wednesday the chairman of the federal reserve warned that the pandemic could permanently damage the american economy if congress does not act to prevent a wave of bankruptcies and prolonged unemployment long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up and leave families in greater debt the message from jerome powell suggested that the trillions of dollars that congress has already pumped into the economy may not be enough additional fiscal support could be costly but worth it if it helps avoid long term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery and the house of representatives is poised to temporarily change its rules to allow lawmakers to vote and hold committee hearings remotely so that they can avoid traveling to washington during the pandemic the rules expected to pass tomorrow would mark a major change for a body long defined by the tradition of meeting and voting in person that s it for the daily i m michael barbaro see you tomorrow former prosecutors and defense lawyers called the department s position hypocritical and troubling if it is accurate that the f b i official provided context around those notes which is materially different from what they suggest this could be a game changer in terms of how the court views the motivations behind the request to dismiss the case said edward y kim a former federal prosecutor in manhattan the department s decision to drop the flynn case was a stunning reversal widely regarded as part of an effort by mr barr to undermine the russia investigation the prosecutor who led the case brandon l van grack withdrew from it and only the interim u s attorney in washington timothy shea a longtime adviser to mr barr signed the motion both mr van grack and jocelyn ballantine another prosecutor on the case were upset with mr barr s decision to drop the charge and his overall handling of the flynn review according to people familiar with their thinking mr barr who has long said that he had misgivings about the decision to prosecute mr flynn asked the top federal prosecutor in st louis jeff jensen earlier this year to scrub the case for any mistakes or improprieties mr priestap s notes were among the documents that mr jensen found the prosecutors already on the case mr jensen s team and the f b i disagreed about whether they were exculpatory and should be given to mr flynn s lawyer sidney powell mr jensen prevailed and gave them to ms powell who declared that they would exonerate her client people familiar with the events said mr priestap played a central role in the f b i investigation into russian interference in the presidential election and was involved in high level discussions about whether to question mr flynn whose phone calls to the russian ambassador at the time sergey i kislyak had aroused investigators suspicions mr jensen and ms ballantine herself a veteran prosecutor interviewed mr priestap along with another prosecutor sayler fleming and an f b i agent from st louis who was there to memorialize the encounter justice department investigators spoke with mr priestap while they were embroiled in a debate that began last month about whether to drop the flynn case mr jensen and officials in mr shea s office pushed to give mr flynn s lawyers copies of the notes and other documents they had recently found mr van grack and dana boente the f b i general counsel argued against disclosing them eventually the f b i agreed to release the documents because they contained no classified or sensitive material even though they believed they were not required to share them with the defense according to an email from lawyers in mr boente s office on april 23 by the beginning of may mr jensen recommended to mr barr that the charge be dropped and the team began to draft the motion to dismiss it mr van grack and ms ballantine the prosecutors on the case acknowledged the facts but vociferously disagreed with mr jensen s legal argument that mr flynn s lies were immaterial to the larger investigation into russian election interference according to department lawyers familiar with their conversations as the lawyers digested the interview with mr priestap some prosecutors expressed concern that they were moving too fast but other officials pointed out that in less than a week the department was due to respond to mr flynn s motion to dismiss the case and argued against proceeding in that matter if they were about to drop the entire case mr jensen agreed as did mr barr and they filed their request even though they knew it was coming some prosecutors on the case expressed shock associates said mr flynn s case grew out of phone calls he made to mr kislyak in the final days of 2016 asking that moscow refrain from retaliating after the obama administration imposed sanctions on russia as punishment for interfering in the election the conversations were captured on routine wiretaps of mr kislyak and prompted concern among the f b i agents investigating mr flynn once they learned of them then the incoming vice president mike pence publicly denied that mr flynn had asked russia to hold off on sanctions agents began to suspect that mr flynn was lying to other trump officials about the phone calls and were concerned that he was a blackmail risk because russia knew the truth of the calls mr priestap s notes taken hours before agents questioned mr flynn on jan 24 2017 showed that f b i officials were debating how to proceed and trying to determine the objective of questioning mr flynn mr priestap wrote what s our goal truth admission or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired mr priestap also mentioned the risks of an interview adding protect our institution by not playing games and if we re seen playing games wh will be furious those notes reflected mr priestap s own thoughts before meeting with f b i leadership to discuss how to question mr flynn the people said a footnote in mr shea s motion included a reference to mr priestap s ruminations the motion described them as talking points the notes also showed that the f b i softened its interview strategy with mr flynn officials decided that agents would be allowed to read back portions of the highly classified phone call transcripts to refresh mr flynn s memory f b i investigators felt at the time it was important to figure out whether mr flynn would tell the truth in an interview though mr flynn was told ahead of time about the interview the f b i director at the time james b comey unilaterally decided to go forward with it angering justice department officials who said the bureau should have coordinated closely with them and notified the white house counsel s office two agents went to the white house to question mr flynn he lied repeatedly and prosecutors have said that agents gave him multiple opportunities to correct his false statements by revisiting key questions mr flynn later agreed to plead guilty entering a plea twice before he later reversed himself hiring new lawyers and asking judge sullivan to allow him to withdraw it after the notes and other documents were made public ms powell seized on them to declare that they cast doubt on the f b i s decision to question mr flynn and to charge him with lying she accused the bureau of framing her client mr shea also argued that the f b i had no legitimate reason to interview mr flynn he said that the bureau s counterintelligence investigation into mr flynn had essentially ended and agents had insufficient reason to keep it open and were trying to entrap him the interview with mr flynn seems to have been undertaken only to elicit those very false statements and thereby criminalize mr flynn mr shea wrote mr barr has called mr flynn s conversations with mr kislyak laudable and said that his lies were immaterial to the russia investigation rejecting the view of the prosecutors who had said that mr flynn hurt the inquiry by misleading the f b i agents judge sullivan has also said the lies were
