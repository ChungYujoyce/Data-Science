two weeks ago just before the access hollywood video hit donald trump was in a tight race with hillary clinton now he trails in some polls by double digits two weeks ago democrats had a small edge when it came to winning the senate now well basically nothing s changed even as the presidential race appears to have experienced a real shiftover the past 12 days or so the battle for the senate has remained largely as is in fact we re updating our race ratings today and all of the most competitive seats are staying exactly where they were back on oct 5 the one change we re making is moving alaska gop sen lisa murkowski from lean republican to safe republican after a poll showed her up 33 points on a crowded field we still have democrats favored to win two gop seats in illinois and wisconsin and we still have six seats listed as toss ups indiana missouri nevada new hampshire north carolina and pennsylvania democrats still need to win three of the six to get an effective majority and republicans are still in the game largely despite their presidential nominee trump and that last point is key the question has long been how much a trump implosion would damage the gop s congressional hopes but as i argued last week it s still not really showing up in the actual downballot numbers that could be for any number of reasons including people not really associating trump with the gop and or wanting a gop congress to keep an unloved hillary clinton in check or it could be because several republicans in these key races have now said they won t vote for trump including sen john mccain r ariz sen kelly ayotte r n h and rep joseph j heck r nev but whatever the reason thestasis in these races is actually pretty newsworthy given what s happening to trump in nevada there was a cnn opinion research poll this week that showed democrat catherine cortez masto taking an unprecedented 7 point lead but then monmouth university on tuesday putheck up 3 polling in pennsylvania has also been all over the place with bloomberg last week showing democrat katie mcginty up 2 points and quinnipiac university this week showing sen patrick j toomey r up 4 the most recent pollsin three other toss up states missouri new hampshire and north carolina are all virtual ties right now and in indiana former senator evan bayh d still looks like he ll have trouble holding off rep todd c young r despite a big early lead mccain and sens marco rubio r fla and michael f bennet d colo meanwhile all still look like favorites especially mccain and bennet rubio s race is polling somewhat close quinnipiac had him up just 2 on tuesday but national democrats havenow pulled advertising in that state the one race that looked like it might be shifting over the past couple of weeks was wisconsin there a marquette law school poll showed sen ron johnson r wis pulling to within 2 points of former senator russell feingold after trailing big early on loras college incredibly even had johnson taking a 5 point lead but then on tuesday came a st norbert college poll that put feingold up 12 points 52 40 republicans haven t reinvested in johnson s campaign and they probably won t because in the battle for the senate there has been plenty of news but nothing really new receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacypolicy
