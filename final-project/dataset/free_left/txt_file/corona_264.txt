leana s wen is an emergency physician and visiting professor at george washington university milken institute school of public health previously she served as baltimore s health commissioner the federal government s social distancing guidelines ended last week as states lift their shelter in place orders and reopen parts of their economies i am deeply worried that the next phase of the coronavirus pandemic will bring much more suffering and many more preventable deaths what should concerned policymakers and residents do two things first prepare for a massive surge more than 40 states have announced plans to lift restrictions even though only a handful have met the minimum criteria for reopening as outlined by the white house coronavirus task force the consequences of this are all too predictable because the science around covid 19 has not changed without a vaccine or cure the only thing keeping the disease in check has been keeping people separated from one another once social distancing is relaxed covid 19 will again spread with explosive speed full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic but of course that might not be apparent for weeks or even months that s because of the lag between new exposures to the virus and the subsequent increase in infections hospitalizations and deaths as everyone knows by now the incubation period the time between exposure and symptoms is up to 14 days it could take another week or two before people become ill enough to seek medical care and another week or more for those who are severely ill to succumb to the virus the danger here is that policymakers and the public will jump to the wrong conclusions if they don t immediately see the numbers increasing instead of breathing a sigh of relief they should prepare for the surge that will inevitably arrive a month or so from now what new york went through at its peak will happen in communities across the country hospitals will become overwhelmed with ill patients staff will be forced to ration personal protective equipment there will be shortages of intensive care unit beds and ventilators sign up for our coronavirus updates newsletter to track the outbreak all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access the difference is that this time there will likely be numerous outbreaks at once that will strain the nation s capacity to respond also worrisome is that many of these outbreaks will occur in rural communities that already struggle with lack of hospitals and health care workers our only advantage now is that we can easily see it coming a month ahead the more people return to life as usual the more hospitals should prepare for an influx elected leaders public health officials and hospital ceos should be urgently preparing for this expected surge now is also the time to fully implement pandemic response plans to shore up health care capacity across the country in addition no state has yet set up the testing contact tracing and quarantining needed to contain the virus state and local officials should do their best to ramp up these public health capabilities as they call upon the federal government to put forth the national coordinated effort to secure needed supplies and staff second stay safe for yourself and for those around you just because you now can go out in public doesn t mean you should this is not the time to plan family gatherings dinner parties and play dates restaurants retail shops and salons might be open but is going worth the risk residents in reopening states should follow the same public health guidance as when they were under shelter in place orders stay six feet away from people wash your hands frequently wipe down surfaces that others are touching if you must return to work be an advocate for your health ask your employer what practices are being put into place to protect workers and customers inquire about telecommuting staggered shifts and other possibilities risk is cumulative the more people you have contact with the higher your risk of contracting the virus do your best to continue to limit your interactions with people outside of work the opinions section is

and reserve public transportation for those who have no other choice keep a daily diary of where you ve been and with whom you spent time that way if you re found to have covid 19 it will be easy to trace your contacts most important stay home if you can social distancing is a privilege that many do not have it will be tempting to see reopening as a return to our way of life before the coronavirus but it will be anything but as a society we have made the decision to reopen before the science says we are ready we are knowingly going back to where we were in mid march before the first exponential surge in infections and deaths that surge will come again but this time no one can say they didn t see it coming read more read a letter responding to this column danielle allen the white
