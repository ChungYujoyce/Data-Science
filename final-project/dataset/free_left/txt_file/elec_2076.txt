advertisement by larry buchanan and alicia parlapiano updated april 15 2016 a coalition of republicans is banking on a scenario in which donald j trump fails to reach the 1 237 delegates required to secure the party s nomination before its july convention creating a potential opening for another nominee as the delegates vote on the convention floor most states bind their delegates to candidates based on primary results but most delegates are released if no candidate wins a majority in an initial vote at the convention so those who were bound to mr trump could shift their support this scenario is less likely if mr trump is close to 1 237 delegates or if he continues to face a split opposition first vote at least 5 percent of delegates are not bound to candidates and can vote as they please from the outset needed to win 95 bound to a candidate 5 unbound did one candidate get a majority of delegates yes that s it he s the nominee no move on to a second vote with some new rules second vote after the first round of voting more than half of all delegates from more than 30 states become free 39 bound to a candidate 61 unbound did one candidate get a majority of delegates yes that s it he s the nominee no move on to a third vote with some new rules third vote many states with a large number of delegates like california with 172 release them before the third vote 18 bound to a candidate 82 unbound did one candidate get a majority of delegates yes that s it he s the nominee no move on to a fourth vote with some new rules this could go on for a while but it s very unlikely it would be difficult to get through more votes without one candidate receiving a majority because many states release their delegates early if candidates withdraw from the race or do not meet a certain vote threshold on the floor preventing those with low support from remaining in contention first vote at least 5 percent of delegates are not bound to candidates and can vote as they

meet a certain vote threshold on the floor preventing those with low support from remaining in contention currently in addition to securing a majority of delegates a candidate is required to win more than 50 percent of delegates in at least eight states to secure the nomination mr trump has already done so in eleven however this rule or any other could be changed before the voting begins putting candidates who do not win a majority in eight states into contention because delegates are free to vote for their candidate of choice once they are unbound mr trump and some of the other candidates have already begun organizing their supporters to get as many allied delegates as possible selected 2 472 total delegates 7 of delegates automatic delegates the three members of the republican

state rules that free delegates earlier based on other factors there are additional delegates whose choices are not tied to election results and who are only bound to candidates if they declare support for them the timing of delegate selection is estimated from state rules compiled by the republican party some dates are expressed as deadlines so some delegates could be selected earlier than
