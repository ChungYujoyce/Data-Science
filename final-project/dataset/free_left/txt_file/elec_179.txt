there s a sense of growing optimism among democrats that if donald trump is at the top of the ticket they might have a chance at what otherwise seems impossible curtailing the gop s stranglehold on the us house of representatives the fundamental landscape is deeply unfavorable to house democrats they re down 30 seats and behind in fundraising with district boundaries drawn in such a way that winning a national majority of votes won t deliver them a majority of seats they need fundamentally something game changing and weird to happen and then like magic along comes donald trump who happens to be weak in exactly the sort of republican leaning suburban districts they are hoping to peel away from the gop trump makes districts that would have been hard core tossup districts into ones that lean democratic and gives democrats a little bit of a push in republican leaning districts across the country according to kelly ward the executive director of the democratic congressional campaign committee in a practical sense the dccc s pre trump vision was heavily focused on the long term planning of what they call the majority project a multi cycle effort to simultaneously improve the dccc s field and data infrastructure while understanding which districts are being made newly competitive by ongoing demographic change data shows us that democrats are moving into republican districts and making them more democratic over time as we look between now and 2020 dccc chair rep ben ray luj n d nm told me just before trump s super tuesday sweep post sweep ward says the trump takeover accelerates this for us for a sense of exactly how lost and forlorn house democrats were before trump breathed new life into their hopes it s useful to look beyond the dccc to the behavior of maryland rep chris van hollen himself a former dccc chair he was widely regarded as a likely successor to nancy pelosi as the democrats leader in the house since the top two dems behind her in the party hierarchy steny hoyer and james clyburn are both quite old themselves but rather than hold on to a safe house seat and hope to sweep into the speakership he chose to resign his seat in order to fight a tough contested primary for the democratic nomination for an open senate seat in maryland a clear indication that he saw no short term path to significant gains in the house and he s not alone house democrats face two serious headwinds in their quest for a majority that they are essentially powerless to cure the first is that the map is simply very unfavorable to them back in 2012 barack obama won considerably more votes than mitt romney but romney actually carried more house districts this is because democrats through a mix of partisan gerrymandering and natural geography are more likely to be packed into lopsided districts to win the house they need a landslide not just a win the second is that house landslides when they happen almost always hurt the incumbent president s party the basic dilemma for a house minority whose party controls the presidency is that either people are generally happy with the status quo in which case the president is likely to be popular but voters are unlikely to vote out tons of house incumbents or else people are unhappy with the status quo in which case the voters are likely to punish both the president and his co partisans in the house democrats only real hope for 2016 is for something off the charts weird to happen in presidential politics something like say a vulgar real estate developer turned reality television host with scant record of involvement in the conservative movement erupting onto the scene with an under developed policy agenda and a track record of offensive statements and inflammatory rhetoric it is of course possible that if trump secured the republican nomination he will prove himself to be an exceptionally skilled candidate who mops the floor with hillary clinton in ways we can barely imagine today it is also possible that unpredictable events terrorist attacks foreign wars financial crises will impinge on the election in ways that badly damage clinton s hope in either of those cases house democrats will be dragged down too but based on what we know of trump so far he seems likely to be a weak general election nominee who is weak specifically in areas that house democrats see as growth possibilities democrats top targets are a series of suburban districts where republican incumbents have retired somewhat fatigued with the incessant inter caucus warfare among house republicans these kind of districts places like pa 8 mn 2 nv 3 ny 19 are places whose republican voters are disproportionately well educated and supporting non trump candidates those are the voters most likely to be persuaded to swing to clinton or just stay home as a reaction to gop disunity in the face of trumpism meanwhile one crucial element of democrats larger focus has been on identifying areas where the latino population is growing rapidly in ways that are likely to make them more competitive over the medium term but a big challenge democrats traditionally face is that hispanics punch below their weight in terms of actual voter turnout ward believes that turnout momentum that we could see among hispanic voters because of donald trump could accelerate that competition in general she notes that democrats win when turnout is high and the media s fascination with trump is creating heightened electoral awareness in a way that should boost democrats senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has according to press reports already privately told colleagues that his caucus will drop trump like a hot rock if his presence at the top of the ticket seems to be hurting senate candidates in new hampshire florida wisconsin and elsewhere dropping your party s presidential candidate is a tough trick to pull off for a senate candidate and it s not clear that it s at all possible in a house race most people after all simply don t pay that much attention to their local member of congress meanwhile national media is overwhelmingly focused on the presidential race ward argues plausibly that the celebrity presence of trump in the race should only exacerbate that tendency for presidential politics to crowd out everything else donald trump will define this election as we have seen from day one ward says he will dominate the attention and he will create the narrative of the election get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
