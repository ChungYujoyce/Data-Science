advertisement supported by they are anything but spontaneous by lisa graves ms graves is the executive director of true north research and curator of kochdocs i first became aware of the political influence of charles and david koch in 2009 when i started looking into who was behind the protests at health care town halls the tea party formed after america elected its first black president used a series of health care town halls to spur angry republicans to oppose the affordable care act as a socialist takeover of american medicine little matter that it was modeled on a plan devised by mitt romney a republican when he was the governor of massachusetts such false claims about the act have not aged well as millions of americans now depend on the law for health care coverage as the coronavirus contagion sweeps across the nation and yet a tea party co founder mark meckler is using the same tactics and same phony claims to stir his followers to protest against governors seeking to mitigate the covid 19 death toll by closing businesses and banning public gatherings that public anger is both real and manufactured the same was true in 2009 when the koch fortune fueled the tea party s attacks on the obama administration s health care law still the legend that the tea party was a spontaneous uprising took hold and continues to be peddled as we face tea party 2 0 let s not be fooled again the protests playing out now have the same feel as the tea party protests aided by koch financed americans for prosperity and others a decade ago and with good reason early evidence suggests they are not organic but a brush fire being stoked by some of the same people and money that built the tea party look no further than the first protest organized by the michigan conservative
