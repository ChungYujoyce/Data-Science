advertisement supported by the president craves a nationally televised coronation with cheering supporters but even republican lawmakers in north carolina are expressing doubts it can take place as planned by trip gabriel president trump has made clear that he wants a traditional political convention in charlotte n c in late august with thousands of sign waving delegates from out of state filling an arena to acclaim his renomination but in north carolina they are not so sure even the republicans as the relaxing of shutdown orders across the country leads to alarming projections of a surge in coronavirus cases some leaders of the president s party in the state that is hosting the convention are striking a less rosy view i think it s very clear it may not be possible to host a convention as planned said edmund h driggs a republican member of the charlotte city council mecklenburg county home to charlotte is the hardest hit in the state by the virus with more than 1 900 cases and 58 deaths as of friday gov roy cooper a democrat announced this week the partial lifting on friday of a stay at home order the first of three phases to reopen the state but under the governor s timeline the full return of businesses and a green light for mass gatherings may not occur before midsummer clearly if we re a couple months away from opening businesses in mecklenburg county then that would be very difficult to host the convention senator thom tillis of north carolina said last week mr tillis a republican who has sometimes broken with the president was responding to a constituent during a telephone town hall event he said that because hotels and restaurants in greater charlotte would need to be fully open to accommodate up to 50 000 visitors we don t know yet if the convention will take place that assessment is at odds with mr trump s pledge that the convention which is scheduled to begin aug 24 at the 20 000 seat spectrum center will proceed as planned as well as with the stated intentions of republican organizers ronna mcdaniel the chair of the republican national committee said on twitter last week that we are full steam ahead she added no one who is actually in a decision making position has discussed alternate plans for our convention the question of whether republicans will gather for a pull out the stops renomination that mr trump craves is bound up in the president s desire to reverse the economic devastation that threatens his re election the national convention is both an actual event and a symbol for people who rarely tune in to political jamborees for mr trump it would be a powerful signal that he is returning the country to normal republican lawmakers in some states have moved to curb the influence of public health experts over stay at home orders on tuesday mr trump made clear he wanted to reopen the country even at the cost of higher fatalities from the virus will some people be affected yes he said will some people be affected badly yes but we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon as the president pivots from containing the pandemic to championing the nation s economy experts projections of deaths show new spikes one model the white house has watched closely projects more than 134 000 fatalities by early august up from about 60 000 under a broad lockdown john bradford a former republican state representative from mecklenburg county predicted that even if the party was able to hold the convention it would not be business as usual i m not convinced any convention is going to look the same for some period of time he said i m hopeful we can have some sort of convention and while it may not be exactly like the past it s still exciting for our city matthew ridenhour an alternate delegate from charlotte predicted organizers would do everything they can to deliver the coronation the president wants with a balloon drop and televised speeches it s hard to say how i ll feel three months from now he said of the personal risks that might entail i m relatively young and healthy i would feel i would have some trust in my fellow delegates that they re being responsible charlotte a democratic run city of 870 000 pursued the opportunity to host the convention eager for the swipes of so many visitors credit cards and the bath of national media attention but even in that pre coronavirus era of two years ago the decision was politically polarizing decided by a one vote margin on the city council now the prospect of thousands of out of staters arriving at a time of pandemic sparks trepidation after a heated debate last week the council narrowly voted six to five to accept 50 million from the justice department for convention security one democratic council member voting no said that we don t want to offer up our city as a petri dish for the next outbreak mayor vi lyles a democrat argues that charlotte is contractually obligated to put on the convention taking questions on twitter last month she was asked about the virus s greater impact on african americans who make up 35 percent of the city s population and if the convention would still take place i don t have an answer to say yes or no she said we will be guided by the best decisions for our residents mr driggs the republican councilman is one of the approximately 2 300 alternate delegates along with about 2 500 main delegates although he is not part of the official planning he said it was likely that contingency plans were quietly underway for a scaled back event my best bet would be we ll participate in a highly controlled encounter he said there ll be masks perhaps restrictions on crowds in rooms it may involve people working in shifts marcia lee kelly the republican convention president said in a statement as we have done throughout our planning we will ensure the convention prioritizes the health and safety of delegates media guests and community members on thursday organizers named a new adviser for health and safety dr jeffrey runge who was chief medical officer in the homeland security department under president george w bush neither party wants to completely abandon a national convention a gaudy made for tv event that seizes the spotlight at a time when most voters are tuning in to the election even if the polling lift to the nominee has historically been fleeting democrats who pushed back their convention in milwaukee from mid july to mid august over health concerns are talking much more openly than republicans about scaling back the gathering or pulling the plug entirely and doing it online joseph r biden jr the presumptive nominee now campaigning virtually from his delaware home said last month he was prepared for an entirely online convention i think we should be thinking about that right now he said the democratic party chairman tom perez has been more circumspect predicting an in person gathering mr trump who mocked mr biden s suggestion of an internet convention told fox news in march there was no way he would cancel the big rendezvous in charlotte still mr cooper the governor is proceeding cautiously to reopen the state the first of three phases which he announced in an executive order allows for travel to some newly opened businesses but gatherings of more than 10 people are still prohibited phase one runs through may 22 if health metrics turn negative it could be reversed in phase two the stay at home order would be lifted and restaurants hair salons and gyms could serve limited numbers of customers this period the governor has said would last four to six weeks phase three allows increased traffic to restaurants houses of worship and entertainment sites but the size of gatherings is still restricted there is no fixed time before phase three ends and a mass event like a national convention could take place but it is unlikely it would end before midsummer giving the republicans a short runway ahead of their four day wing ding with mr trump s re election coming down partly to a referendum on his handling of the pandemic one local republican on the ballot with the president said he looked forward to a convention that would be one of the country s first mass gatherings i think it is imperative that someone has to take the first step toward normalcy said jim puckett a candidate for county commissioner how the republican party manages this i think will be an indication of whether they re in a position to lead or not bill brawley a former republican state representative from the county is a delegate to the convention he attended the 2016 republican convention in cleveland which he said was as packed as a rock concert something he doesn t expect in charlotte i m not that cynical to think the republican party would risk a disaster he said i think the people organizing the convention will hold it in a responsible manner mr brawley who is running in 2020 to regain his old seat said his wife has an underlying health condition that makes her vulnerable to the coronavirus the question is when august comes can i attend the convention in a way that does not put my wife at risk he said and if i can i will if i do not have confidence that those issues have been addressed i reserve the right not to go to protect my wife s life advertisement
