donald trump raised about half as much as hillary clinton for his presidential campaign committee in the first 19 days of october putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the white house contest campaign finance reports filed late thursday show trump raised just 28 9 million for his campaign committee over that period a fall off from september while clinton s already robust fundraising ratcheted up helping her bring in 57 2million the democratic nominee s campaign and two joint fundraising committees with the party together pulled in 101 million in the 19 day stretch according to filings with the federal election commission trump s campaign and two joint fundraising committees with the national party raised a total of 61 million in the first 19days of the month a fall off from september when the three committees together pulled in 100 million including 53 million for the trump campaign the gop presidential nominee had 16 million in his campaign

bid trump gave his campaign about 31 000 in in kind contributions in the first 19 days of the month down from the 2 million a month in cash he had been donating trump s total personal contributions to his campaign currently total a little more than 56 million out on the campaign trail with 12 days until the presidential election clinton warned her supporters against complacency because she said the contest against trump is likely to be closer than the latest polls suggest clinton appearing on the campaign trail for the first time with first lady michelle obama urged voters to stay engaged and vote because the outcome remains uncertain let s go out and win this election clinton exclaimed at a rally at wake forest university in front of about 11 000 people let s make sure we vote early vote

t want any part of it the first lady then told the crowd when you hear folks talking about a global conspiracy and saying that this election is rigged understand that they are trying to get you to stay home they are trying to convince you that your vote doesn t matter that the outcome has already been determined and that you shouldn t even bother to make your voice heard with less than two weeks to go clinton holds a six point edge over trump among an electorate fixated on the campaign and nervous about their candidate losing according to a new washington post abc news national tracking poll clinton leads by 6 points post abc tracking poll finds more than 3 in 4 clinton and trump supporters say that they are very anxious at the thought of the other candidate becoming president fears that underscore perceptions of the election s high stakes and stark contrast between the contenders the post abc poll finds that 57percent of registered voters are following the election very closely and that 85percent say they are absolutely certain to vote or have already cast ballots both measures are similar to four years ago and nearly identical percentages of clinton and trump supporters are

challenges in appealing beyond a core base of supporters clinton and obama s joint appearance came on a day when trump made three stops in another battleground state ohio where he sought to build on a reed thin lead the race has tightened in several battlegrounds in recent polls notably in florida nevada and north carolina in toledo trump jokingly suggested that the election should be scrapped
