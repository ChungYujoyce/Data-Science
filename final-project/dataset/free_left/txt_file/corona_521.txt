advertisement supported by a memo from peter navarro is the most direct warning known to have circulated at a key moment among top administration officials by maggie haberman a top white house adviser starkly warned trump administration officials in late january that the coronavirus crisis could cost the united states trillions of dollars and put millions of americans at risk of illness or death the warning written in a memo by peter navarro president trump s trade adviser is the highest level alert known to have circulated inside the west wing as the administration was taking its first substantive steps to confront a crisis that had already consumed china s leaders and would go on to upend life in europe and the united states the lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave americans defenseless in the case of a full blown coronavirus outbreak on u s soil mr navarro s memo said this lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full blown pandemic imperiling the lives of millions of americans dated jan 29 it came during a period when mr trump was playing down the risks to the united states and he would later go on to say that no one could have predicted such a devastating outcome mr navarro said in the memo that the administration faced a choice about how aggressive to be in containing an outbreak saying the human and economic costs would be relatively low if it turned out to be a problem along the lines of a seasonal flu but he went on to emphasize that the risk of a worst case pandemic scenario should not be overlooked given the information coming from china in one worst case scenario cited in the memo more than a half million americans could die a second memo that mr navarro wrote dated feb 23 warned of an increasing probability of a full blown covid 19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million americans with a loss of life of as many as 1 2 million souls at that time mr trump was still downplaying the threat of the virus the administration was considering asking congress for more money to address the situation and the second memo which circulated around the west wing and was obtained by the times urged an immediate supplemental spending appropriation from congress of at least 3 billion this is not a time for penny pinching or horse trading on the hill mr navarro wrote in the second memo which was unsigned but which officials attributed to him it was unclear whether mr trump saw the second memo whose contents were first reported by axios the second memo seemed aimed at members of the white house task force established by mr trump to manage the crisis and reflected deep divisions within the administration about how to proceed and persistent feuding between mr navarro and many other top officials about his role and his views any member of the task force who wants to be cautious about appropriating funds for a crisis that could inflict trillions of dollars in economic damage and take millions of lives has come to the wrong administration the memo said among other things the memo called for an increase funding for the government to purchase personal protective equipment for health care workers estimating they would need at least a billion face masks over a four to six month period the administration ended up asking for 2 5 billion congress then approved 8 billion mr navarro is now the administration s point person for supply chain issues for medical and other equipment needed to deal with the virus the january memo written by mr navarro was dated the same day that mr trump named the task force to deal with the threat and as the administration was weighing whether to bar some travelers from china an option being pushed by mr navarro mr trump would approve the limits on travel from china the next day though it would be weeks before he began taking more aggressive steps to head off spread of the virus questions about mr trump s handling of the crisis especially in its early days when he suggested it was being used by democrats to undercut his re election prospects are likely to define his presidency mr navarro s memo is evidence that some in the upper ranks of the administration had at least considered the possibility of the outbreak turning into something far more serious than mr trump was acknowledging publicly at the time neither mr navarro nor spokespeople for the white house responded to requests for comment the memo which was reviewed by the new york times was sent from mr navarro to the national security council and then distributed to several officials across the administration people familiar with the events said it reached a number of top officials as well as aides to mick mulvaney then the acting chief of staff they said but it was unclear whether mr trump saw it mr navarro is a well established china hawk who has long been mistrustful of the country s government and trade practices both mr navarro and matthew pottinger the chief deputy at the national security council were among the few officials urging colleagues in january to take a harder line in relation to the growing threat of the coronavirus but their warnings were seen by other officials as primarily reflecting their concerns about china s behavior and their concerns look more prescient in hindsight than they actually were other officials argue with the subject line impose travel ban on china mr navarro opened the memo by writing if the probability of a pandemic is greater than roughly 1 a game theoretic analysis of the coronavirus indicates the clear dominant strategy is an immediate travel ban on china updated may 20 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities mr navarro concluded at one point regardless of whether the coronavirus proves to be a pandemic level outbreak there are certain costs associated with engaging in policies to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease the most readily available option to contain the spread of the outbreak is to issue a travel ban to and from the source of the outbreak namely mainland china he suggested that under an aggressive containment scenario a travel ban may need to last as long as 12 months for proper containment a duration of time that at that point some white house aides saw as unsustainable the travel limits subsequently imposed by mr trump did not entirely ban travel from china and many travelers from the country continued to stream into the united states mr navarro was at odds with medical experts like dr anthony s fauci who had argued that such travel bans only delay the eventual spread mr navarro alluded to that debate on saturday during a separate argument with dr fauci in the situation room about whether the anti malaria drug hydroxychloroquine was effective in treating or preventing the virus according to two people familiar with the events in the memo mr navarro cautioned that it was unlikely the introduction of the coronavirus into the u s population in significant numbers will mimic a seasonal flu event with relatively low contagion and mortality rates he noted the history of pandemic flus and suggested the chances were elevated for one after the new pathogen had developed in china this historical precedent alone should be sufficient to prove the need to take aggressive action to contain the outbreak he wrote going on to say the early estimates of how easily the virus was spreading supported the possibility that the risks were even greater than the history of flu pandemics suggested mark mazzetti contributed reporting advertisement
