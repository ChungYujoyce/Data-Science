as president obama has conducted his ill fated experiment in diminished u s leadership he has fended off critics with what many dismissed as a straw man argument that the only alternative to his approach was mindless bellicosity then ted cruz came along and turned out to be the straw man when the republican texas senator said of the islamic state that he would carpet bomb them into oblivion and find out if sand can glow in the dark it seemed he wanted to prove that mindless bellicosity was no figment of obama s imagination but there is a common thread to what obama and cruz offer the false promise of an easy way out for the united states in the fight against terrorism obama wanted americans to believe and may have believed himself that the tide of war is receding as he said in 2011 it turned out that he could end the united states wars temporarily but that didn t mean the wars ended and before long the president was forced to return americans to battle cruz like donald trump who promises to quickly and decisively bomb the hell out of the islamic state wants americans to believe that the bad guys can be defeated speedily and easily with no sacrifice by americans and no harm to american values but carpet bombing kills civilians not terrorists pilots need information that only people on the ground can provide and air power succeeds only as part of a larger military and political strategy for the united states there is in reality no alternative to sustained years long commitment to the world s most troubled region that doesn t mean an invasion by hundreds of thousands of troops but it does demand intelligent diplomatic economic and military engagement that s not a popular thing for any politician to say fortunately at least one candidate is saying it ironically perhaps that candidate is obama s former secretary of state in a speech to the council on foreign relations in november hillary clinton said that the united states needs to wage both an immediate war against an urgent enemy and a generational struggle against an ideology with deep roots it will require sustained commitment in every pillar of american power clinton said this is a worldwide fight and america must lead it there was more we should be honest about the fact that to be successful airstrikes will have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from isis she said she cited the sunni awakening in 2007 in iraq as a successful model and said we need to lay the foundation for a second sunni awakening she called for no fly zones in syria which obama has steadily opposed perhaps most telling she promised to recommit the united states to the kind of sustained values based engagement that though she didn t say this obama has deemphasized and that cruz and trump with their odd mixture of pugnacity and isolationism would jettison we have to join with our partners to do the patient steady work of empowering moderates and marginalizing extremists supporting democratic institutions and the rule of law creating economic growth that supports stability working to curb corruption helping train effective and accountable law enforcement intelligence and counterterrorism services clinton said sustaining such views through a presidential campaign won t be easy voters much prefer understandably to be told that the country can concentrate as obama told them on nation building here at home it s even more tempting to believe that we can be made safe by obliterating the bad guys as if in a video game not every republican is peddling the cruz trump snake oil but clinton s political challenge is particularly acute since she has to distance herself from a record that she helped shape and do so without alienating the most ardent supporters of a president she worked for her unconvincing repudiation of the pacific trade deal that she helped design illustrates the pressures and the policies that clinton promotes aren t easy as critics rightly point out there s no recipe for supporting democratic institutions that always works but on issues of u s leadership clinton seems disinclined to compromise despite pressure from a dovish primary electorate that may reflect a calculation of what will sell best in the general election but it also seems to reflect core principles principles that she argued for sometimes unsuccessfully as secretary and principles on which almost certainly she would govern as president her views have the added virtue of being right americans can see that obama s policy of premature disengagement hasn t worked in libya iraq syria or afghanistan will they also see through cruz s phony alternative that is one of the key questions to be answered in 2016 read more from fred hiatt s
