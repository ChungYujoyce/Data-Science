advertisement supported by by maggie haberman and michael barbaro the cash rich group aiding jeb bush s white house run has filmed a provocative video casting his rival marco rubio as ultimately unelectable because of his hard line stand against abortion that group which has raised more than 100 million has asked voters in new hampshire how they feel about mr rubio s skipping important votes in the senate and the group s chief strategist has boasted of his willingness to spend as much as 20 million to damage mr rubio s reputation and halt his sudden ascent in the polls according to three people told of the claim seething with anger and alarmed over mr rubio s rise aides to mr bush the former florida governor and his allies are privately threatening a wave of scathing attacks on his former prot g in the coming weeks in a sign of just how anxious they have become about the state of mr bush s candidacy their looming problem in trying to undercut mr rubio as unaccomplished and unprepared mr bush is a flawed messenger over the years he has repeatedly and sometimes lavishly praised the younger lawmaker often on camera in one of many such tributes mr bush declared in a 2012 television interview that mr rubio had the intellectual acumen and the fortitude to be a good president whether or not the onslaught ever materializes mr rubio and his team are bracing for it and preparing to counter it by sifting through hours of video footage for instances in which mr bush spoke about mr rubio as an admiring ally not a political foe they are also telegraphing a warning that has already reached many of mr bush s donors such an assault they argue would be beneath the dignity of the bush name and mr bush should focus on resurrecting his own candidacy they say not on trying to tear down mr rubio who they contend represents the future of the republican party some bush donors campaign aides and republican operatives are cautioning mr bush and his staff about the dangers of seeking to wound mr rubio whose career he assiduously nurtured for years when mr bush was governor and mr rubio was a member of the florida house of representatives given their closeness while governing i find the whole thing baffling said stuart stevens a republican strategist who oversaw mitt romney s 2012 campaign i seem not to be alone mr stevens added i don t see any evidence that it s working some supporters of mr bush are publicly urging restraint at the end of the day wisdom dictates that an internecine fight between the two is unnecessary and potentially damaging to both said anthony scaramucci a new york financier and bush fund raiser mr rubio s campaign sees a potential benefit attacks by mr bush and his allies could engender sympathy for mr rubio as occurred when charlie crist his republican rival in the 2010 senate primary was perceived as overly hostile to mr rubio history suggests that each party s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions as measured by endorsements fund raising and polling those involved in the bush camp s discussions about whether to assail mr rubio said that no firm plan or timeline was in place and that their focus could shift to different rivals in the coming weeks but the preoccupation with mr rubio is revealing suggesting not just fury at his challenge to a former mentor but also a conviction that rivals like donald j trump and ben carson have no chance of winning and will collapse in time for mr bush to rise again mr rubio the bush team expects will remain standing for many of mr bush s longest serving advisers mr rubio s run is a betrayal mr bush backed mr rubio s bid for house speaker in florida and persuaded important donors to endorse him for the senate a few of mr bush s supporters have taken to calling mr rubio judas in meetings with donors and allies mr bush s top aides have pointed to what they describe as a trove of research on mr rubio that they could unleash any attacks on mr rubio would come primarily from right to rise the super pac that has raised more than 100 million for mr bush its top strategist mike murphy refused to detail its strategy but did not dispute that mr rubio was in its sights part of running for president is you have to put your big boy pants on and get vetted on the issues so we know we don t have a dud candidate running against hillary clinton he said asked about the multiple videos of mr bush praising mr rubio over the years mr murphy said of mr rubio we all supported him for the senate we all support him staying there because he is far from proving he is ready and experienced enough to be president of the united states in a dangerous time mr murphy s critique echoed an internal bush campaign memo outlining mr rubio s vulnerabilities under the headline marco is a risky bet the memo which surfaced on oct 29 said mr rubio has never been in charge of anything larger than two dozen people the preparatory work by right to rise was described by three people privy to it who insisted on anonymity to preserve their relationships with the group and with the bush campaign right to rise held focus groups in new hampshire shortly after the oct 28 republican debate in which among other things the participants were quizzed about mr rubio s missed votes on two republican priorities cutting federal funding for planned parenthood which carries out abortions and blocking president obama s nuclear agreement with iran the responses suggested that both could provide potent lines of attack in an attempt to blunt mr rubio s appeal and showcase a potential vulnerability against the democratic nominee in the general election mr murphy recently showed some republicans a video portraying mr rubio as too extreme on abortion a longtime opponent of abortion rights mr rubio said in a debate in august that he had never advocated laws that would allow abortions even in cases of rape or incest mr murphy has privately said to several people that right to rise would be ready to devote up to 20 million to fighting mr rubio according to several people told of the conversations asked about the figure mr murphy declined to comment aides to mr bush meanwhile have grown weary of conflicting advice about how to deal with mr rubio after the oct 28 debate in which mr bush criticized mr rubio for missing votes mr bush s top adviser sally bradshaw archly noted on a conference call that the very donors accusing mr bush of being too aggressive had previously encouraged mr bush to go after mr rubio many of mr bush s supporters are eager for political combat i think it s fair game to point out marco s record or lack thereof said joseph m kyrillos jr a republican state senator in new jersey who is raising money for mr bush it s not below the belt advertisement
