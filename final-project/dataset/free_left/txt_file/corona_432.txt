are concerned i have a colleague taking care of an ill parent i have kids what if we get the virus and give it to them social security s top managers are at odds with many of its 60 000 employees

nuclear attack after the attacks of sept 11 2001 new blueprints evolved to protect the homeland from another terrorist attack and eventually from flu pandemics they lay out how agencies would operate essential services with skeletal staffs and alternative work sites where agency leaders would go about 12 years ago with broadband technology in most homes telework became a key feature of the plans but they have yet to be activated on a wide scale the closest call was during the h1n1 pandemic of 2009 a novel influenza virus known as the swine flu the government ramped up for a robust response but no federal offices were affected we were racing the clock recalled w craig fugate who ran the disaster relief agency for eight years during the obama administration but we never got to the point of closing anything in government down the trump administration concerned that remote work was being abused has pushed to strictly limit it a lot of people look at telework and think it s just some nice to have thing for employees said jeffrey neal a former homeland security personnel chief who writes a blog on federal personnel policies what they don t talk about much is the emergency planning aspect of it neal said it s not like you can pull the trigger now and say poof we have a telework program about 43 percent of federal employees were eligible to work from home in fiscal 2017 the last year for which data is available the number has declined since then but it s unclear by how much with coronavirus planning managers are realizing that shifting gears is not as simple as telling someone to power up their computer at home not everyone has broadband access at home or a government issued laptop that s generally required to telework employees need access to agency networks some of their work contains sensitive material that can t be exposed in a home setting agencies will have a hard time retrofitting what they ve been scaling down and now they re in the middle of a world

d c area house democrats are so furious about the cuts that last week they introduced legislation to force the administration to reinstate telework where it has been curtailed agencies have said little publicly about their workforce plans the department of homeland security announced last week that it had closed its seattle field office for two weeks after an employee tested positive for coronavirus but the agency declined to say how many employees were affected or could work remotely then on monday u s citizenship and immigration services told employees in an email that it was reopening a week early after professionally cleaning the office at housing and urban development some employees are resisting signing agreements because they don t want to be required to work if
