the former treasury official who was in charge of the 700 billion government response to the 2008 financial crisis tells 60 minutes what tools the federal reserve can use to combat the economic stress being caused by covid 19 the world economy has never shut down this fast in the u s virus related layoffs are expected to be measured in the millions and soon for insight into what s coming we found someone with responsibilities over the economy now and who helped pull the u s out of the great recession of 2008 that person is neel kashkari president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis in 2008 he was the treasury official in charge of the 700 billion rescue of the financial system we met kashkari this past thursday for an eye opening look at the stock market freefall the near freeze in the bond markets and a prediction for this economic emergency neel kashkari millions of people are gonna lose their jobs and that s what s so scary about this scott pelley are we in a recession neel kashkari if we re not right now we will be soon my base case scenario is we ll at least have a mild recession like after 9 11 the worst case would be we d have a deep recession like the 2008 financial crisis we just don t know right now scott pelley and what s keeping us from knowing with any certainty neel kashkari nobody knows how the virus is gonna progress how many americans are gonna get it how effective is social distancing going to be how long will it take the health care system to catch up scott pelley nationwide last week there were almost 300 000 people filing first claims for unemployment benefits neel kashkari it could be five times that amount next week maybe more scott pelley where is the bottom neel kashkari if this is a three month shutdown we ll find the bottom pretty soon if this is a year long shutdown this could be very damaging to the u s economy and most importantly to the american people 46 year old neel kashkari has been president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis since 2016 he s the son of indian immigrants and literally a rocket scientist as an engineer he worked on nasa spacecraft after wharton business school he joined investment firm goldman sachs in 2008 as assistant treasury secretary kashkari ran the 700 billion troubled asset relief program known as tarp that helped end the great recession kashkari was the republican nominee for governor of california in 2014 today he is one of 12 federal reserve regional bank presidents who oversee and support the nation s largest banks neel kashkari i heard from a bank in our region a well to do customer came in and said i wanna withdraw 600 000 of cash now we can supply all the cash that the banks need to meet their customers concerns but it just speaks to the fear and the uncertainty that is rippling through the economy scott pelley will the federal reserve ensure that banks have all the cash they need to satisfy whatever withdrawals may be coming neel kashkari yes this is the fundamental reason the federal reserve exists we call it lender of last resort this is literally why central banks exist if everybody gets scared at the same time and they demand their money back that s why the federal reserve is here is to make sure that there s liquidity that there s money to meet those demands we will absolutely meet those demands scott pelley is the fed just going to print money neel kashkari that s literally what congress has told us to do that s the authority that they ve given us to print money and provide liquidity into the financial system and that s how we do it we create it electronically and then we can also print it with the treasury department print it so that you can get money outta your atm scott pelley are the banks sound neel kashkari they are right now now we re hearing from big businesses across the country including in minnesota that big businesses are drawing down their credit lines they re borrowing money from the banks just because they re nervous and if they re all drawing down these credit lines at the same time it puts stress on the banking system and that s where the federal reserve steps in to provide that liquidity to make sure that the banks have enough money to get out to their customers the dow has tumbled about 35 but something else is wrong some investors lost confidence in bonds which normally do well in troubled times the bond markets finance government corporations and by extension homebuyers scott pelley and the stresses you re seeing in the bond market are what neel kashkari well we were seeing stresses this week in the treasury market and in the mortgage backed security market and that s why the fed stepped in with this very aggressive action to provide liquidity to those markets we saw stresses in the commercial paper market which is another type of bond market and we re still seeing stresses in the municipal market where state governments and cities fund themselves and in the corporate bond market so we re not outta the woods yet scott pelley and by stresses you mean what neel kashkari there s just a freezing up of new financings for corporations that s something i m very focused on we need to get that market open again because we don t want blue chip american companies who have customers who are operating we don t want this virus to creep into their businesses because they re not able to raise money to meet their basic operational needs we need them to keep running scott pelley solid blue chip american companies are having trouble borrowing money neel kashkari it s more expensive for them to borrow money say someone s saying i m gonna go issue 1 billion of debt to go fund my new factory those aren t taking place right now scott pelley people are shunning u s treasury bonds which are always thought to be the safest possible investment neel kashkari it is now keep in mind treasury bond prices are still very high relative to history they ve just been just not quite as high as they were a few weeks ago so they still are viewed as a very safe investment very attractive for a lotta people but this fear of where the virus is going to go is leading people to say i just want cash and if that s cash under my mattress or in my safe i ll sleep better at night scott pelley what s it gonna take to get the bond markets working again neel kashkari i think a combination of factors i think congress taking bold action to say they re standing behind the u s economy the 1 trillion stimulus they re talking about i think that ll help i think continued actions from the federal reserve will help and i think more confidence that the health care system is catching up to the crisis this past sunday the fed dropped interest rates nearly to zero then every day last week it announced emergency lending programs it pledged to spend at least 700 billion supporting mortgages banks money market mutual funds corporate bonds and lending to central banks of other countries because the dollar is the currency of world trade neel kashkari we re being very aggressive and i think our chairman jay powell has learned from the experience of 2008 we re moving much faster than we moved in 2008 we re being more aggressive is there more we can do yes is there more we may end up doing yes but i think we re being very aggressive i think that s the right thing scott pelley can you characterize everything that the fed has done this past week as essentially flooding the system with money neel kashkari yes exactly scott pelley and there s no end to your ability to do that neel kashkari there is no end to our ability to do that scott pelley what did we learn from 2008 when you were in the treasury department and how is that being applied today neel kashkari there are two big mistakes when i look back at 2008 that we made that i think are relevant today number one we were always too slow and too timid in responding to the crisis the reason is we didn t know how bad it was gonna get and we didn t wanna overreact and it turned out it got really really bad and the right answer should ve been overreacting to try to avoid the devastating recession that we ended up happening so today whether it s health care policy makers fiscal policy makers which means congress or the federal reserve we should all be erring on the side of overreacting to try to avoid the worst economic outcomes and number two in 2008 we tried to be very targeted in helping homeowners only helping homeowners who needed a little bit of help because a lot of americans were angry at the thought of their neighbor getting a bailout for being irresponsible or so they thought so we tried to target our program it ended up we didn t help very many people we would ve been much better off if we had been much more generous in our support for homeowners deserving and not deserving we would ve had a less crisis so my advice to congress as they re designing their programs to help workers and to help small businesses err on being generous scott pelley when america gets back to work how long does it take to recover from this neel kashkari you know the economy can bounce back fairly quickly it s the workers that take time i mean that s the one of the other lessons from 2008 it took more than ten years to put america fully back to work relative to where they were before the crisis ten years and so that s what we have to try to avoid having these mass layoffs we can t have another ten year recovery the deadline for filing taxes both personal and business has been postponed until july this past week the house and the senate proposed trillion dollar emergency spending plans the bills envision sending government checks directly to households expansion of unemployment insurance corporate tax cuts and relief for small business republicans and democrats are haggling over the details scott pelley well what do the small businesses need neel kashkari i think that they need forgivable loans like it s much better if we can keep small businesses to retain their workers than to lay them off scott pelley what do you mean by forgivable loans neel kashkari i ve heard a proposal that if the government made a loan to a small business if they retain their workers the government would forgive the loan after a couple years just to avoid the mass layoffs that we re starting to see right now scott pelley sort of a bridge loan to get the local restaurant or the local mechanic through this period of time neel kashkari that s right and importantly keeping their workers employed that s much better because once people are lost into the sidelines it just takes a long time to get them back the federal reserve system as we know it was set up in the great depression to regulate big banks set interest rates and be the source of all cash that s why every bill in your pocket is inscribed federal reserve note the fed s mandate is to provide the highest rate of employment with the lowest rate of inflation but in 2008 it invoked its authority for the first time to take the role of emergency first responder scott pelley if the current measures are not enough what else can the fed do neel kashkari well we have very broad authorities with our emergency lending authorities that have to be done in concert with the treasury secretary we ve announced a couple of those measures this week on money markets and commercial paper as an example some people have suggested that we should be providing more support directly to the corporate bond market and i m sympathetic with those views and also the municipal market making sure that states and cities are able to access the capital markets as well so there s a range of things the federal reserve could do we re far from out of ammunition scott pelley far from out of ammunition sunday the federal reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate to zero can you go below zero neel kashkari in theory we could some countries have i don t think many of us i don t think any of us on the committee think that s a particularly good idea it creates other challenges for financial markets but in the last crisis we ve used something called quantitative easing buying long term bonds we ve got a lot more experience in how to do that it didn t trigger inflation so there re other tools that we ve used before that i think we could also use again in using it aggressively states face an enormous surge in unemployment claims connecticut alone which normally has a little over 2 000 claims a week saw 72 000 last week when the national number of new claims for unemployment is released thursday it s expected to be in the millions the fed is watching china and south korea where the outbreak appears to be subsiding scott pelley what are you seeing in china neel kashkari well china appears to be turning back on and they are telling a very good story that they ve got their arms around this they don t have new cases but if at the same time they re saying lots of people had the disease with no symptoms so unless you ve tested everybody how do you know that you ve really got this under control and as you relax the economic control does the virus simply flare back up again we just don t know yet scott pelley to the person who is about to grab their car keys and go to the atm and take out 3 000 you say what neel kashkari you don t need to your atm is safe your banks are safe there s enough cash in the financial system and there s an infinite amount of cash at the federal reserve we will do whatever we need to do to make sure that there s enough cash in the banking system scott pelley are you optimistic or pessimistic neel kashkari overall i m optimistic having been at the frontline of the 2008 financial crisis and i saw how devastating that was we did get through it it was very painful for millions of americans we did get through it we will get through this crisis produced by henry schuster
