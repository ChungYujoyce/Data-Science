to victory let us win here in new hampshire let us win the democratic nomination let us defeat donald trump let us transform this country let us go forward together on tuesday new hampshire did its part now the senator must convince voters in upcoming caucus and primary states that he will make the rest of the pieces fall into place the sanders campaign must go beyond bernie beats trump sloganeering and deliver a comprehensive and convincing argument that the senator is the most electable contender it certainly helps to have won the first primary with 95 percent of precincts reporting the networks declared sanders the winner with 26 percent of the vote former south bend mayor pete buttigieg who moved into the top tier of the competition after a tight finish with sanders in iowa was in second with 24 percent minnesota senator amy klobuchar surged into third place with 20 percent it was a steep drop off to fourth place for massachusetts senator elizabeth warren who had 9 4 percent former vice president joe biden who fled to the upcoming primary state of south carolina before a victory party that wasn t finished fifth with 8 5 percent sanders buttigieg and klobuchar won delegates warren and biden did not more from john nichols anti war groups push biden and the democrats to rethink foreign policy yesterday 6 00 pm scott walker is peddling the deadly snake oil of austerity may 25 2020 america needs a coronavirus cure not more war may 21 2020 author page the new hampshire results were not so decisive as they were for sanders when he swept the state s 2016 primary but they were still reassuring for the senator who secured the first clear win of 2020 after a stumbling start in iowa at the same time however new hampshire handed sanders a message about what matters most to primary voters in that state and beyond its borders about 6 in 10 democratic voters in exit polls in new hampshire said they preferred a candidate who can beat president trump rather than one who agrees with them on the issues explained a washington post analysis iowa entrance polls had that number at 61 percent of the 63 percent of new hampshire voters who said they want a candidate who can beat trump 28 percent backed buttigieg while 21 percent were sanders voters and 20 percent were for klobuchar biden and warren each got 11 percent among the agrees with you on the issues crowd sanders was the big winner with 39 percent while buttigieg was at 22 percent and no one else was above 11 percent but there s a twist while almost half of voters said sanders was too liberal overwhelming majorities of those same voters embraced the issues most closely identified with his campaign the post noted about 6 in 10 new hampshire democratic primary voters in preliminary exit polls said they support replacing all private health insurance with a single government plan for everyone about two thirds of democratic voters in early exit polling said they support making tuition free at public colleges and universities if the issues that sanders has been raising have such broad appeal why then is he considered too liberal the answer has a lot to do with how he s covered by media outlets that often go out of their way to portray sanders and to a lesser extent warren as too extreme but it also has to do with the messaging that comes from the candidate and his

are discussing ideas that were popularized by sanders in 2016 this amplification doesn t involve abandoning positions or principles as presidential contenders frequently do when they gain traction rather sanders must define his campaign as a new center where democrats independents and millions of new voters have a place in much the way that franklin delano roosevelt did as he crafted a
