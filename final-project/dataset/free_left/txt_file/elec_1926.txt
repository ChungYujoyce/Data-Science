et former secretary of state colin powell was extremely frustrated both publicly and privately about hillary clinton s minions trying to drag me in to her email controversies according to his personal emails seen by buzzfeed news in his frustration with the hillary campaign powell lashed out at clinton s camp to vernon jordan a longtime democratic adviser i have told hilleary s sic minions repeatedly that they are making a mistake trying to drag me in yet they still try the media isn t fooled and she is getting crucified powell wrote in may the differences are profound and they know it what exactly powell told clinton about his use of email while he was secretary of state became a point of reporting this summer in an august 2016 email with nbc news reporter andrea mitchell powell said he wrote a memo to clinton describing what he did at the department i told her how i was using my personal computer for unclassified emails i said nothing about servers basements domains clinton foundation government employees powell wrote reiterating that this information was not new and was detailed in his latest book the clintonistas have been trying for months to connect our usage powell added the website dcleaks com which has reported but not confirmed ties to russian intelligence services obtained powell s emails it may be the latest example of a russian entity potentially trying to influence the us presidential election in july the fbi said it believed russia was behind the hack of the democratic national committee s internal emails right before they party s convention powell told buzzfeed news he had no comment in late august 2016 he wrote that he spent last week with clinton confidante cheryl mills and the hrc team burying the email flap the retired four star general wrote to a california official sad thing it that hrc could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me into it i told her staff three times not to try that gambit i had to throw a mini tantrum at a hampton s party to get their attention she keeps tripping into these character minefields the new york times reported in august that clinton told fbi agents that powell told her to use personal email while in office over the past year her campaign has noted repeatedly in public that he also used personal email according to the fbi documents later released clinton told agents that powell s instructions to her about her email did not factor into how she used email while secretary house democrats subsequently released an email powell sent clinton in 2009 after she asked for information on how to use a blackberry at the state department in his response powell tells clinton that he did not use a blackberry and instead used a computer with his personal account his email did not go through state department servers however there is a real danger if it is public that you have a blackberry and it it sic government and you are using it government or not to do business it may become an official record and subject to the law powell wrote reading about the president s bb rules this morning it sounds like it won t be as useful as it used to be be very careful i got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data recently in an august 2016 email powell wrote to a reporter with thompson reuters that he unlike clinton used a public server aol not my own servers and domain he reiterated that he wrote about his use of email in his book and briefed the state ig ic ig an the fbi and that everyone in the department knew about it and were overjoyed that same month in another email powell wrote that he tried to warn clinton s people three times i will send an even tougher counterattack from a trump media friend and in august in an email with the subject line re clinton in hiding 259 days since last press conference powell compliments a new york times article that said clinton was using private email before that dinner or the memo i sent her the dinner is in reference to a reported 2009 dinner party attended by former secretaries of states powell clinton and condoleezza rice where powell allegedly suggested that clinton use a personal email account both powell and rice have repeatedly said that have no recollection of the dinner in another email with a journalist in july of 2016 in response to his allegedly using his home computer as secretary of state powell said that he brought the state department into the 21st century by replacing an out of date and not functioning information system i set about fixing fixed the pipes bought everyone a computer 44 000 i then went on line with my aol account on a phone line to talk to my folks as well as some foreign officials all unclassified powell wrote powell goes on to write that he used a state computer for classified messaging when i left i took no emails or records with me no private servers in the basement etc no secrets everyone in the department knew what we were doing no one ever said bad boy powell wrote prior to the back and forth this summer clinton allies had often noted that powell used a personal account during his tenure as secretary powell in another email from february 2016 reiterated that he didn t tell hillary to have a private server at home connected to the clinton foundation two
