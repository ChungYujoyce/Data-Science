 like many asians in america i was and am inspired by andrew yang s rise to political prominence running a charismatic and innovative campaign yang showed that asian americans can and should fight to make a difference in our country but no amount of admiration could cancel out my disappointment after reading yang s recent opinion piece in the washington post in his april 1 op ed yang argues that asians must combat covid 19 by show ing our american ness in ways we never have before he recommends that we wear red white and blue and show without a shadow of a doubt that we are americans who will do our part for our country in this time of need apparently to remind our neighbors that we are not to be feared but yang s message is misguided at best to save lives and fight the virus the best thing that asian americans can do is embrace our asian ness and understand that doing so need not be in any tension with our simultaneous american identity asian culture is in many ways primed to combat infectious disease which makes it all the more frustrating that suspicion and even harassment of asians has increased due to fears of coronavirus before new york told people to stay inside their homes unless necessary i observed the tension between asian hygiene and anti asian prejudice almost every time i commuted to and from work every day i d step on a packed 7 train only to find that every seat was occupied except for a single spot next to an older asian woman wearing a face mask apparently nobody wanted to contract the virus from the chinese lady even though she was taking special precautions you don t need to be a lifetime 7 train rider to know that the use of face masks by new york s asian americans far predates the covid 19 pandemic the purpose of the masks is to prevent the spread of disease if coronavirus was already on the loose in nyc and it was then the seat next to that old asian lady was probably the safest place on the whole train widespread face mask use isn t the only aspect of the eastern world that has contributed to asian nations relative success in flattening the curve in china and south korea citizens were quicker to shelter in place due to a deeper respect for the authorities instructing them to do so a distaste for the physical affection that spreads covid 19 is also common among many asian cultures non asian americans would benefit greatly from the adoption of these social mores at least for the duration of the crisis in his op ed yang ignores the potential benefits of asian ness in favor of a strategy invalidated by american history in the past asian americans have tried and failed to use yang s tactic of enthusiastic patriotism to disarm suspicions against them during world war ii japanese american shopkeepers emblazoned their storefronts with declarations of american loyalty and tens of thousands of japanese men served in the u s army all the same japanese americans were forced into concentration camps until 1946 the truth is that over enthusiastically proclaiming our american ness and encouraging other asians to do so only sends the message that asian americans are inherently less american than our non asian countrymen we don t need to remind our neighbors that we re americans whether we embrace our asian ness or not american identity is not something you have to earn asian ness can exist within american ness asian ness can augment american ness it already has with the potential to accomplish much more asian americans can protect their neighbors by doubling down on the aspects of asian culture that have battled the virus so effectively across the pacific if we did this it wouldn t be a case of outsiders swooping in to show their usefulness during a nationwide crisis it would be americans helping americans lee is a writer and editor based in queens
