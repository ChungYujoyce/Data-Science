advertisement supported by reporter s notebook by ashley parker get live updates about voting in the march 15 primaries the first time i felt unsafe at a trump event was a week ago in new orleans i hadn t been on the trump beat for the new york times for very long but the warm friday night rally in an airport hangar on the outskirts of the city thrummed with an ominous energy donald j trump took the stage just as the sky was slipping from purplish twilight to slate black and the mood shifted as well turning tense and electric the first interruption came early followed by another and another as a constant stream of protesters disrupted the event some went peacefully and quietly as they were escorted out by security officers but others did not shouting obscenities and dropping to the ground to resist the crowd turned angry jostling and pushing and jeering the disrupters one young woman a trump supporter was shoved against the metal barricades and began to cry a group of older women left early shortly after a man holding a k k k 4 trump sign was hustled out nearby for mr trump the rally was simply one hell of a way to spend a friday evening as he crowed from the stage but it was also a harbinger of future violence and a glimpse of how mr trump who has promised to bring the country together seems to have united americans only in stirring their passion and anger what we are witnessing now is complicated with few obvious heroes at times both sides have behaved badly trump supporters are quick to turn on protesters especially those who don t look like them they point and holler sometimes they spit and kick and shove a young black woman in kentucky was pushed and called names her sign ripped from her hands a black man in north carolina was sucker punched by a 78 year old white man who later looked into a camera and warned that next time we might have to kill him to witness the crowd turn on the protesters in its midst is to watch a feverish body bucking and writhing as it tries to eject an invading virus i have talked to protesters who still don t quite have the words to describe what they felt when they were singled out and turned upon often by their communities mr trump says he condemns violence but he also shouts at his crowds to get em out and even when he urges them not to hurt the protesters a hard edge of menace bullets his words yet the protesters too have sometimes instigated the clashes they fling themselves to the ground forcing law enforcement officers often outmanned and overwhelmed to drag them away they also shout and curse making obscene gestures as they are led from events and friday night in chicago in perhaps the best organized effort so far they came not to simply stand quietly but to utterly halt mr trump s ability to deliver his speech both sides say they feel deeply wronged and disenfranchised albeit in different ways the trump supporters i interview are almost unfailingly courteous in the snaking lines of traffic that precede his events they smile and wave and allow me to cut in front of them and they politely answer my questions explaining how their vision for the country a place where if you worked hard and followed the rules you could provide for your family and have a decent life is being snatched from them already they feel as though their key rights the ability to earn a fair wage the right to own a gun are slipping away and now they believe that the republican party is trying to withhold the nomination from mr trump and they are watching as protesters interrupt his events they are angry the 71 year old woman i talked to before the new orleans rally who told me that nothing short of trump shooting my daughter in the street and my grandchildren would dissuade her from voting for him said she had been forcibly retired part of a recent round of layoffs to me her comments reflected not just her genuine passion for mr trump but also the depth of her despair the protesters feel similarly wronged many of them are minorities blacks hispanics muslims who hear his pronouncements and are insulted or even frightened they too have a vision for this country and the american dream believing that if they worked hard and followed the rules they could melt into this nation that has welcomed so many they say they cannot stand by and do nothing as mr trump calls mexicans rapists and criminals or threatens to bar all muslims from entering the country griselda cardena segovia 20 a college sophomore was part of a small group of young people who were removed from a trump event on monday in concord n c before it began after they linked arms in silent protest she said she and her younger sister had come to peacefully observe the rally and support their parents immigrants from mexico whom they felt mr trump was disparaging but as soon as they entered the crowd looked at us wrong and you could feel the energy that we weren t wanted she said adding that they found the scene which included some of their high school teachers to be jarring we have never in our whole life living here in concord we have never experienced racism until now ms segovia said i never thought my town that we contributed to would treat us like this after the rally ms segovia s group stood on the grassy curb holding signs it was unseasonably warm for march the sort of day when you might sneak out of work for a long lunch outside and as cars exited dozens rolled down their windows to shout obscenities and slurs at the young men and women go back to mexico someone hollered from an s u v as it peeled away the group clad in solid black and white t shirts replied with god bless you but some of them too got caught up in the moment chasing the cars and hurling their own invectives back the unnerving energy began infusing mr trump s rallies in recent weeks just as i started covering him after several months on the jeb bush beat where what constituted drama at a night rally was the candidate politely imploring his crowd to please clap as a reporter i always try to anticipate where the story is headed so i can get there first or at least right alongside the news and i quickly began jotting down notes on scenes of violence and near violence and gathering voices of angry frustrated trump supporters sometime soon i warned my editors someone is going to be seriously wounded or worse at a trump rally and we ll want to have a story ready the images broadcast to the world friday evening from chicago of people shouting and swinging at one another of others lying bloodied in the streets felt like a nation many of us didn t recognize or didn t want to recognize the sights and sounds felt foreign and far away to me too but they were also right there all in my notebook gathering and growing and waiting to explode because in many ways what happened friday night in chicago felt less surprising than it should have and utterly inevitable advertisement
