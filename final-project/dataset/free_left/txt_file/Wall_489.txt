advertisement supported by the allegations suggest personal clashes influenced how the administration responded to the pandemic by sheryl gay stolberg sharon lafraniere michael d shear and ben protess washington the call in early february from the white house situation room came as a surprise to rick bright peter navarro president trump s trade adviser wanted him to come present his ideas for fighting the coronavirus alone dr bright whose tiny federal research agency was pursuing a coronavirus vaccine had long been at odds with his boss at the department of health and human services robert kadlec his white house visits twice in a single weekend only exacerbated those tensions weekend at peter s dr kadlec quipped in the subject line of an email that expressed his displeasure the hostility between these two key officials in the government s response to a pandemic that has claimed more than 75 000 american lives burst into public view tuesday when dr bright who was abruptly dismissed last month as head of the biomedical advanced research and development authority filed a formal whistle blower complaint the document accuses dr kadlec and other top administration officials of cronyism and putting politics ahead of science whether or not the charges are ultimately proven the 89 page complaint along with other documents and interviews expose troubling infighting at the health and human services department the sprawling agency that includes barda the centers for disease control and prevention national institutes of health the food and drug administration and other arms of government as officials there struggled to combat the worst public health crisis in a century barda is the front edge of the global response in terms of organizing the financing laying down the bets on what s coming forward as the options on vaccines and therapies said j stephen morrison a global health expert at the center for strategic and international studies adding that the infighting had consequences they need to move with incredible skill and judgment and speed the internal clashes extend beyond drs bright and kadlec fierce battles have erupted between alex m azar ii the health and human services secretary and seema verma the medicare and medicaid administrator mr azar has also clashed with a senior white house policymaker joe grogan but the consequences of such clashes were vividly brought to life by dr bright s complaint email messages show that as early as january when president trump was saying the outbreak was totally under control dr bright was pressing for the government to stock up on masks and drugs and to commence a manhattan project effort to develop a vaccine but dr bright was largely sidelined by personal disputes with dr kadlec and his aides some of which long predated the coronavirus the documents suggest by the time the pandemic arrived in force the relationship between them had become toxic with dr bright increasingly left out of key decisions his ideas about battling the threat were met with skepticism the complaint says and were clearly not welcome on friday lawyers for dr bright said the federal watchdog agency handling his complaint the office of special counsel had notified them that it had found reasonable grounds to believe he was retaliated against and was seeking his reinstatement for 45 days while it investigated on thursday he is scheduled to testify before a house committee mr azar must now decide whether to reinstate dr bright an h h s spokeswoman caitlin oakley declined to comment on a personnel matter but she said the agency strongly disagrees with the allegations and characterizations in the complaint from dr bright with a 1 6 billion annual budget barda was created in the aftermath of the sept 11 2001 attacks to partner with industry to develop medical countermeasures that could be stockpiled to combat a bioterror attack or pandemic threat dr bright had been in charge for less than a year when dr kadlec was confirmed by the senate as assistant secretary for preparedness and response in 2017 the two men came from different worlds dr kadlec spent 20 years in the air force and helped write the legislation that created barda he advised president george w bush on biodefense dr bright who grew up in small town kansas began his career at the c d c an influenza expert he considered a pandemic to be the nation s biggest threat dr bright s allies say he was viewed with suspicion in the trump administration as an obama holdover one of his earliest clashes with dr kadlec centered on a long running contract barda had with a small biotechnology company and a consultant who dr bright said invoked jared kushner mr trump s son in law and senior adviser in an apparent effort to salvage that contract the company aeolus pharmaceuticals was developing a drug to treat the effects of radiation from a potential nuclear attack when barda employees decided not to extend the contract in early 2017 john l mcmanus the company s chief executive said in an interview that the decision was based on a flawed process and appealed it directly to dr bright in august 2017 dr bright s complaint says john m clerici a consultant and aeolus board member who is close to dr kadlec pleaded the company s case to dr bright over coffee and emphasized that mr mcmanus was friends with jared and has hollywood connections mr mcmanus said he did not know mr kushner or anyone in his family and he disputed nearly all of dr bright s claims about aeolus mr clerici said the conversation never happened a review of corporate political and nonprofit records shows only a distant and indirect connection between aeolus and the kushner family some of mr kushner s relatives have donated to national jewish health a hospital that co owned several patents licensed by aeolus and mr kushner s father and sister sit on the hospital s council of national trustees dr bright though said the political pressure from dr kadlec and his underlings became undeniable and had no place in a system designed to award funding based on scientific merit in the end he stood by barda s decision to not extend the contact with aeolus the company folded within months mr mcmanus lost his job in the fall of 2019 with aeolus bankrupt mr mcmanus landed at partner therapeutics a massachusetts based company represented by mr clerici that also appears in dr bright s complaint dr bright said that in september 2019 before mr mcmanus arrived dr kadlec handed out a 55 million no bid contract to the company to prevent it from going out of business partner therapeutics with 200 employees produces and sells a single drug leukine that can be used to treat excessive exposure to radiation in 2018 the federal government decided to buy more anti radiation drugs for the strategic national stockpile dr bright s division following the recommendation of a panel of experts had chosen california pharmaceutical giant amgen which produces two similar drugs as mr clerici pressed partner therapeutics case dr bright alarmed by the consultant s contacts with a former barda employee pushed for and got an internal procurement integrity investigation he asked investigators to examine mr clerici s and dr kadlec s phone records the complaint said and even called for an inspector general to investigate after that he says he was cut out of meetings about the procurement inquiry there is no evidence that an inspector general investigation was ever conducted allies of dr kadlec say he did make some changes that dr bright had wanted including supporting a directive by congress to put the contracting team under barda s jurisdiction but the request for the investigation added to the bitterness between them eventually dr kadlec circumvented dr bright and awarded a new sole source contract to partner therapeutics on the basis of industrial mobilization the interest of the federal government to keep more than one supplier of an important type of drug in business bill mcclements the chief operating officer at partner therapeutics said in an interview that leukine is the only drug shown to improve survival when given 48 hours after radiation exposure and without requiring whole blood transfusions but jessica tillipman a procurement expert at george washington university law school said if a company is so desperate that one contract is going to keep them afloat i would be concerned about their ability to perform the clash between the two men intensified in late 2018 as dr kadlec s office moved to take custody of the strategic national stockpile from the c d c asserting control over the drugs medical equipment and other supplies that would be critical in responding to a pandemic or biological attack the dispute centered around a well known anti viral drug in the stockpile tamiflu that was expiring just as the united states was entering flu season a new anti viral baloxavir marketed as xofluza had just been approved by the f d a a panel of scientific experts recommended that the government maintain tamiflu at current inventory levels dr bright says while also diversifying the stockpile with xofluza because a new flu strain had emerged that was resistant to tamiflu but the stockpile s managers backed by dr kadlec decided to spend 40 million to purchase additional doses of oseltamivir the generic and much cheaper version of tamiflu he said dr bright accuses dr kadlec of trying to steer the purchase to alvogen a company that makes oseltamivir and is a client of mr clerici as the disagreement escalated dr bright said his boss ignored his objections telling him he had no choice in the matter in fact alvogen was the only generic manufacturer that bid for the contract which was open to any company including roche the maker of xofluza which submitted a bid that was rejected as nonresponsive by the department s independent contracting division allies of dr kadlec say he did not steer the contract in any direction and merely pushed for the more cost effective drug because it was needed to replenish a stockpile ahead of what was expected to be a particularly bad flu season several officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said that scientific advisers assigned to the stockpile while open to acquiring baloxavir differed with the earlier panel believing it was important to replace the expiring stock of generic tamiflu quickly nicole lurie who held dr kadlec s job when barack obama was president and chose mr bright to lead barda the day after mr trump was elected zeroed in on his description of political appointees overriding the decisions of scientific experts what i find most troublesome is the description of repeated attempts to subvert scientific assessments the disregard for scientific judgments and the dismantling of the checks and balances that keep you from spending money either illegally or wrongly ms lurie said the relationship between dr bright and dr kadlec broke last month when dr bright objected to the widespread use of a malaria drug hydroxychloroquine that mr trump had promoted as a treatment for covid 19 and then leaked emails on the subject to a reuters journalist dr bright began sounding alarms on coronavirus within weeks of its emergence in january expressing a sense of urgency that he felt his superiors and the president did not share on jan 18 the complaint said he pushed dr kadlec to convene high level meetings about the virus but dr kadlec initially rejected the request dr bright had been in contact with mike bowen an executive at prestige ameritech a mask manufacturer who had been warning for years that the united states was too dependent on china for its mask supply mr bowen who in an interview called dr bright a great public servant who didn t have the authority to do anything told dr bright on feb 5 that a trump insider had heard his pleas please ask your associates to convey the gravity of this national security issue to the white house mr bowen wrote two days before mr navarro invited dr bright to meet with him at the white house i m pretty sure you ll get the chance kitty bennett
