advertisement supported by by amy chozick miami it was supposed to be a carefully planned anniversary to mark one of the most important and widely praised moments in hillary rodham clinton s political career and to remind the country ahead of a likely 2016 presidential campaign about her long record as a champion for the rights of women and girls instead as mrs clinton commemorates her 1995 women s rights speech in beijing in back to back events in new york she finds herself under attack for her family foundation s acceptance of millions of dollars in donations from middle eastern countries known for violence against women and for denying them many basic freedoms this was not how she intended to reintroduce herself to american voters mrs clinton s glide path to a likely april announcement that she will seek the presidency was built around women s issues advancing women has been her central life s work as she and her admirers say proudly she made it a priority as secretary of state and focused on it as a philanthropist but that focus also allowed mrs clinton who played down her gender in 2008 to frame her second attempt at the white house in what could be one way to make it special and new as a shot at history for her and for all women and for someone who has so long been lampooned and demonized on the right as overly calculating playing up her gender as a strength would also allow her to demonstrate her nurturing maternal and newly grandmotherly side to voters whom she may have left cold in the past even her most strident critics could not have predicted that mrs clinton would prove vulnerable on the subject but the bill hillary chelsea clinton foundation has accepted tens of millions of dollars in donations from saudi arabia the united arab emirates kuwait oman qatar algeria and brunei all of which the state department has faulted over their records on sex discrimination and other human rights issues the department s 2011 human rights

fiorina the former hewlett packard chief told a crowd at the conservative political action conference last month that mrs clinton tweets about women s rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights and on wednesday the republican national committee released a biting video showing president obama calling political donations from foreign sources a threat to our democracy and mrs clinton smiling next to several middle east leaders on saturday mrs clinton s husband the former president felt compelled to defend the foundation s fund raising at an event at the university of miami where mrs clinton and the couple s daughter chelsea discussed no ceilings the foundation s project measuring the advancement of women and girls he defended the charity s acceptance of foreign donations pointing to the united arab emirates and saudi arabia in particular do we agree with everything they do no mr clinton said you ve got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country he added the no ceilings report to be unveiled monday finds that there has never been a better time to be born female but catalogs a host of problems and obstacles legal economic and social that persist one section has particular resonance for mrs clinton almost twice as many women hold political office today compared to 20 years ago but they still are very much a minority the report says adding that the pace of change in women s leadership has been far too slow there s a lot of unfinished business mrs clinton said saturday of the report s findings a foundation official said no foreign governments had contributed to the no ceilings effort anyone that supports the clinton foundation does so knowing we work to empower girls and women around the world said maura pally its acting chief executive reports of mrs clinton s use of only a private email account while she was secretary of state meanwhile have cast a new light on efforts by outside groups to obtain access to her correspondence with the clinton foundation during her tenure at the state department about donations or anything else that correspondence if it exists would most likely have taken place on mrs clinton s private email address putting its accessibility to journalists scholars or political adversaries in doubt already citizens united a conservative advocacy group has made 16 appeals under the freedom of information act for state department correspondence mostly related to mrs clinton

afflicting women around the world and declared human rights are women s rights and women s rights are human rights the beijing speech has been a touchstone for mrs clinton since she stepped down as secretary of state in early 2013 but the more she recalls it the more republicans seek to diminish it she made one statement in beijing that wasn t very profound that women are human beings said bruce fein a lawyer and supporter of senator rand paul republican of kentucky at the state department mrs clinton emphasized how empowering women and girls could also enhance economies national security and the overall progress of a country she appointed a close aide melanne verveer as the first united states ambassador at large for global women s issues some of that work was behind the scenes however in
