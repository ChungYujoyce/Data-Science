third trimester and getting her paycheck by annie waldman the u s response to covid 19 propublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they re published last september over pancakes at a diner in central massachusetts molly baldwin told her husband jonathan they were going to have a baby he cried into his coffee mug elated and a little surprised they had only been trying for about a week and they had yearned for a summer baby ideally in june which would enable their parents to spend more time with their first grandchild we thought we had the best timing she said but as the novel coronavirus began to spread through the country this year baldwin realized in early march that it was only a matter of time before the virus hit her town fitchburg and the nursing home where she s a social worker her patients would be among the most vulnerable some had battled addiction many had experienced homelessness and most were elderly flu seasons were always hard on her patients and she dreaded the havoc a more lethal disease would wreak are you a public health worker medical provider elected official patient or other covid 19 expert help make sure our journalism is responsible and focused on the right issues note if you develop emergency warning signs for covid 19 such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips get medical attention immediately the cdc has more information on what to do if you are sick baldwin also worried about her baby she spent hours looking up the prenatal effects of covid 19 and the lack of evidence based research concerned her she called her obstetrician who cautioned that because of the unknowns she should consider working from home to limit her exposure to the virus so baldwin made a plan for when covid 19 arrived at her nursing home she would swap shifts with a colleague to work fewer hours and request to work from home as many of her duties are paperwork or computer based she would work from the comfort of her kitchen table she would avoid catching the virus she would keep visiting her doctor until it was time to deliver her belly swelling with a baby girl she knew was healthy and safe none of it not a single thing would go according to plan baldwin said her supervisor and the human resources representative from the facility verbally agreed in mid march to let her work from home baldwin spoke with propublica on the condition that her workplace not be named propublica contacted her employers with questions for this story then on april 16 one of the residents at her facility tested positive for the virus baldwin sought testing at a walk in clinic and the results came back negative but when she called her obstetrician s office she got a warning if she continued to work at the facility potentially exposing herself to the virus they would not allow her to enter their office for prenatal appointments unless she could prove with a test before each visit that she was negative for covid 19 she understood their caution her job was beginning to feel at odds with her pregnancy it was time for her work from home plan to go into action she called her employer and asked to start the accommodations she had requested the month before but they told her that now the plan would not be feasible she said other pregnant employees were continuing to work at the facilities and she would have to as well she said she was told the services provided at a nursing home do not typically allow for remote working a company spokesperson told propublica however we have made changes to accommodate our staff whenever possible provided there is no impact on patient care after finding out her request to work from home would not be granted baldwin panicked i m not even a mom yet she said this is my first baby and i already feel like i m doing everything wrong baldwin is one of dozens of pregnant workers who propublica has heard from who are navigating the risks of covid 19 while in the field of health care there are plenty of pregnant women across the country who are trying to figure out what to do to protect themselves given the uncertainty said emily martin vice president for education and workplace justice at the national women s law center if you feel like you can t do your job because there aren t certain accommodations and you feel like you re at risk it s difficult to see where to go next about half of the states have laws that allow pregnant women to request reasonable accommodations including massachusetts martin said according to the massachusetts pregnant workers fairness act signed into state law in july 2017 employers must grant reasonable accommodations to their pregnant employees that allow them to continue to do their job unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer an employer also cannot make an employee accept a particular accommodation if another reasonable accommodation would allow the employee to perform the essential functions of the job both the centers for disease control and prevention and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists have stated that based on the data available pregnant women do not face a higher risk of infection or severe morbidity related to covid 19 that said both the cdc and acog have suggested that health care facilities may want to consider reducing the exposure of pregnant health care workers to patients with confirmed or suspected covid 19 if staffing permits in the overwhelming majority of pregnancies the person who is pregnant recovered well with mild illness said dr neel shah an obstetrician and assistant professor at harvard medical school echoing the current guidance but he cautioned there is a lot we still don t know about how the virus impacts bodies let alone those that are pregnant we can t say that it s completely safe we don t know baldwin and her husband went through their options she couldn t quit because they needed her paycheck they had a mortgage student loans and a new baby on the way she also loved her job and cared deeply for her patients whom she wanted to continue to serve her employer trying to manage understaffing had discouraged employees from taking time off she said she didn t want to take any additional sick days because she needed to save them for her maternity leave they decided that she would have to return to work her employer told her to wear a mask and gloves use hand sanitizer and remain in her small boxy office which has three desks for four people though she didn t have contact with the residents her office mates still did even though she was scared she tried to stay optimistic i was grateful for what i had because i have friends that are out of work right now she said but she remained perplexed about why her requests had been denied i was sitting in my office doing work that would have easily been done from a laptop on my kitchen table the company spokesperson did not respond to a question about whether it had originally given baldwin verbal approval to work from home when asked why she couldn t have done the same work remotely he said based on your questions our hr and risk management are anticipating action and would prefer to not comment at all the next day the massachusetts national guard delivered testing kits to the nursing home and every resident was checked for the virus when the results came back at least 22 residents and 20 other staff members tested positive we are conducting cleanings and infection control measures multiple times per day with extra focus on high touch areas the company spokesperson said we screen and take the temperature of anyone entering our building and we have increased monitoring of our residents public data shows the facility has more than 30 cases among residents and staff the maximum number that the state reports publicly i thought if i just keep working stay in my office use hand sanitizer wear my mask go home and shower right away disinfect my clothes then i will be fine and i can keep my baby safe and i can shed all this guilt she said then on april 24 two of her office mates texted to tell her they had the virus and that morning she d felt a tickle in her throat i know i m positive she thought to herself as she left work midday and drove to a cvs drugstore testing site an hour away that was offering free rapid tests for front line and health care workers hundreds of cars were already lined up she waited alone in her jeep wrangler for three hours wearing her mask as required which muffled her nagging cough she shifted around constantly to keep blood from pooling in her swelling feet at the front of the line she received a 6 inch cotton swab wedged it deep in her nasal cavity and returned it to the technicians they directed her into a side parking lot and 30 minutes later she got a phone call with her results we re sorry to tell you that you re positive the voice on the line told her baldwin s mind stalled engulfed in a wave of anxiety which gave way to seething frustration this was so preventable she said now here i am 33 weeks pregnant and positive my most important job is to keep the baby safe and my actual job wasn t making that happen the experience you expected is likely to be very different from the one you actually get the key to staying sane is to be as ready as possible to throw your best laid plans out the window when she called her co workers and supervisor to tell them she tested positive she said they were all very caring and compassionate they told her to stay home for at least a week or until her symptoms subsided the families first coronavirus response act requires most employers to provide their workers with two weeks of paid leave if the employee is quarantined or experiencing covid 19 symptoms baldwin said she would have to exhaust her sick days first she d been saving them for her maternity leave her husband who works as a correctional officer at a county jail was allowed to take 14 days of paid leave to tend to his wife without using his own sick days she could no longer go to her normal obstetrician for in person appointments and instead she would have to rely on telemedicine her doctor connected her with an obstetrician specializing in covid 19 cases with whom she planned to meet this week last saturday baldwin s mother had planned to throw her daughter a baby shower she had invited 50 of their closest friends to celebrate at a new restaurant and had ordered dozens of pink favors from etsy because of the stay at home order her shower morphed into a drive by celebration where her friends and family passed by her house honking their horns and holding celebratory signs balloons and streamers they dropped gifts in front of her house including first aid kits and a handsewn pink mask for an infant her symptoms have so far been relatively mild similar to a normal flu headaches a stuffy nose a sore throat and muscle pains she s spent most of the past week resting in bed and taking baths to soothe her body aches while taking care of baldwin her husband has also contracted the
