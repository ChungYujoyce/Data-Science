political upheavals in recent memory the election process of 2016 is starting to feel like an extended car ride with a group of people after the conversational possibilities have run out we re all buckled up with a long way to go but everyone s most irritating habits are already out in force we re feeling candidate fatigue a malady first observed in the 1980s perhaps earlier and it s the inevitable consequence of an exceptionally drawn out political process combined with ample media coverage candidate fatigue strikes people at different times people were already complaining of al gore fatigue in 1999 and the complaints were deafening by 2000 john kerry fatigue yes there was that in 2004 but it plagues everyone eventually barack obama john mccain mitt romney yes yes yes and now it s all of them fatigue hillary clinton donald trump bernie sanders ted cruz and john kasich rotate seats regularly each of them taking turns at the wheel each takes a different approach to driving all of them tiresome donald trump used to be the most interesting driver because he took strange turns and it kind of worked he also crashed through fruit stands and that was fascinating at first then it seemed like he was driving through fruit stands for no reason other than that it pleased him perhaps you thought trump had a grander plan with this that there were some shortcuts being taken now in order to get everyone somewhere worthwhile later perhaps you don t think so anymore hillary clinton is a more controlled driver at first glance she sits straight at the wheel signals diligently looks attentive but she doesn t seem to notice or maybe care that she s weaving between lanes and belching up exhaust ask her about it and she smiles sometimes laughs and says she doesn t know what you re talking about she sometimes sings to project cheer she does not have a good singing voice ted cruz when driving moves his seat back leans the seat back down and steers with just one hand his right resting his left arm in the open window this is meant to look confident manly and controlled but it s 40 degrees outside and raining everyone is cold ted has planned everything out carefully he doesn t want you to touch his things when you left your journal in the hotel room though he found it and said he intended to keep it because technically he was in possession of it then he started reading it and smirking occasionally pushing his hand in the air in a shushing gesture and telling you to calm down john kasich pulls his seat nearly all the way forward and he places both hands on the very top of the wheel elbows at the bottom he fumes at other drivers and he gets angry when he makes a wrong turn if he feels people aren t behaving themselves he likes to pull over park on a shoulder and turn around in his seat to lecture everyone no one can explain why he s in the car or where he s going bernie sanders has two hands on the wheel and drives alertly but also like kasich irritably he yells a lot he often lifts his arms and spreads his hands upturned into the air to signal incredulity when hillary takes potshots at his driving he tells her he s driving fine he looks tired and the car s running out of gas but he thinks he can make it people tell him to try some of the new features or do some reading to get up to speed on the auto world but he has an approach to driving and he s sticking to it candidate fatigue can be a dangerous thing actually in 2000 journalists who were stuck with al gore got so sick of him that they got unfair amplifying every one of his missteps and inventing some more to boot that s one reason reporters are rotated more often now it makes them less likely to fall in love with the candidate or descend into hate so one must keep that in mind especially since there are over six months to go in any case we must be grateful to these candidates on the presidential car ride as they weather the madness of a presidential campaign it s rough enough to watch them imagine how much rougher it is to be them will be used in accordance with our privacy policy mr hyde is suddenly sounding a lot like dr jekyll by tina nguyen in a world of trumpism and clintonism there s only one place for globalist minded elites to go by t a frank actually his gaffes could be shockingly valuable in 2016 by t a frank more from vanity fair contact 2020
