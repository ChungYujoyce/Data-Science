to be released according tocbs news campaign reporter adam brewster the class action lawsuit argues that holding the election last week was an attempt to disenfranchise thousands of voters in the spring election the lawsuit asks for allowing people who weren t able to vote in the election to be able to cast a vote this may include people who stayed home for health reasons or who had issues with their absentee ballots arriving on time the case was filed before results were released in wisconsin to show that this action is not partisan about winners and losers instead the lawsuit argues it was about the fact that voters had to decide between exercising their fundamental right to vote in an in person election during a pandemic and forgoing their right to vote in order to preserve their life and health and the lives and health of those close to them and the public overall earlier on monday wisconsin democratic party chair ben wikler said every legal option is on the table for
