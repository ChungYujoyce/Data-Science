 minnesota democrat amy klobuchar confers with committee chair lindsey graham r s c during a senate judiciary hearing on jan 15 2019 carolyn kaster ap photo 2020 elections gop senators praised the minnesota democrat for her deal cutting ways even as they worried it could doom her presidential bid by burgess everett and marianne levine 02 11 2019 05 02 am est amy klobuchar has an unusual constituency behind her as she launches her run for president senate republicans in a democratic caucus filled with presidential hopefuls taking a hard line against donald trump s presidency the minnesota senator s brand of pragmatic politics stands out and numerous republicans are raving about klobuchar her personality her respect for the other party even her competitiveness in a general election advertisement in fact a dozen gop senators were so effusive in interviews this month that some worried they might damage her candidacy in a democratic nomination fight that has many candidates embracing the party s left flank i hope i m not condemning her nascent run for the presidency sen john cornyn r texas said praising klobuchar she s too reasonable too likable too nice she wants to achieve a solution and i would hope that s not a disqualifying thing for someone who would like to be president said sen roy blunt r mo who runs the senate rules committee on which klobuchar serves as ranking member i like her a lot and hope that s not harmful to her the three term senator is no joe manchin klobuchar votes with her party when it comes to big issues like abortion and immigration she s embraced progressives ambitious green new deal and is rarely a headache for democratic leadership but she s also established herself as someone who can cut deals with republicans and occasionally tacks to the center it s a combination that that could give her a boost among primary voters seeking a candidate with bipartisan bona fides if it doesn t doom her with a party running to the left in a brief interview klobuchar made clear she doesn t compromise just for compromise s sake but acknowledged it s something she seeks as a senator oftentimes i ll stand my ground she said but if i can find common ground to get something done i do last year she reached an agreement with blunt to combat sexual harassment on capitol hill that drew ire from liberals and she s never bought into purity contests finding herself at odds with other presidential candidates on surveillance issues a budget deal and some trump nominees like commerce secretary wilbur ross klobuchar also was the democratic presidential aspirant most involved with a centrist senate effort last year to address the plight of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had been brought to the country illegally as children she was in a series of meetings intended to forge a bipartisan immigration deal that came up short sen thom tillis r n c said klobuchar was one of the more reasonable voices in the room she s a person of character and great ability sen johnny isakson r ga a fellow negotiator said she s the whole package that s probably too nice it s not just on major legislation that klobuchar collaborates with the gop she runs the congressional coalition on adoption institute with blunt and has teamed with sen shelley moore capito r w va on combating eating disorders and expanding rural broadband she s worked with conservative sen ron johnson r wis on improving a bridge between their states and pushed through legislation with tillis to treat veterans exposed to toxic burn pits in combat zones beyond her ideology and legislative acumen klobuchar offers a stylistic contrast from the sharp edged politics of sens bernie sanders i vt kirsten gillibrand d n y and elizabeth warren d mass and the attention grabbing inquisitions of sens kamala harris d calif and cory booker d n j republicans have said klobuchar was one of the democrats on the judiciary committee who was most respectful when questioning then supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh last year about sexual assault allegations even as klobuchar found herself being asked by the nominee whether she had a drinking problem but befitting her minnesota nice style klobuchar moved on and didn t linger on the confrontation her questioning on the judiciary committee is excellent sen susan collins r maine said her questions can be thoughtful and respectful still probing they re not easy but it s a good model of the folks that are running she s probably more responsible senate agriculture chairman pat roberts r kan said klobuchar s republican pals say that her political abilities would be imposing in a general election against trump noting her strong appeal in the midwest the region that tipped the presidency to trump in 2016 some democrats are going to be looking for somebody that is actually going to be electable in a general election and i think it s a spot she could fill said sen john thune of south dakota the gop whip i don t like to give democrats advice but they ve got to be able to carry the midwest collins said it s not just republican senators who are fans george will a conservative columnist for the washington post penned an op ed recently that described klobuchar as the person perhaps best equipped to send the current president packing pointing to her midwest roots as an asset for democrats and praising her even keeled temperament however klobuchar s minnesota nice reputation has taken a hit in recent days amid multiple reports she has mistreated staff regardless the very qualities that have earned klobuchar so much love on the right could be liabilities in a democratic primary 2020 elections by elena schneider cornyn said klobuchar doesn t strike me as ideological enough to be competitive tillis said she has a legitimately centrist argument to make but she s going to find herself in a field that s going to out liberal themselves she ll probably have a pretty hard time in the nominating process thune said yet democrats aren t so sure for one many democrats believe klobuchar former vice president joe biden or montana gov steve bullock could offer a compelling contrast to the more liberal candidates in the field members of her caucus have said klobuchar is results driven which inevitably means embracing bipartisanship she s someone that s more oriented toward getting some things done and in order to do that you ve got to work with both sides that s the arithmetic around here sen angus king i maine who caucuses with the democrats said and in early states bipartisanship might not be a dirty word even as new hampshire keeps electing democrats to congress the granite state also has a popular gop governor and allows undeclared voters to participate in either party s primary we like our leaders to work together sen jeanne shaheen d n h said that s probably the no 1 concern i hear when i go around the state why can t you all work together to address the challenges facing this country missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020 politico llc
