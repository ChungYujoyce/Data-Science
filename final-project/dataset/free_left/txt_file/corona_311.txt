out by trip gabriel think of it as super postponed day june 2 had been an afterthought on the democratic primary calendar ever since joseph r biden jr seized the mantle of front runner voters in new jersey and a few other states scheduled to vote that day assumed the democratic horse race would be over before their primaries rolled around but with numerous states pushing back voting to june 2 because of the coronavirus pandemic the date has gained sudden prominence it now confers a huge bounty of delegates second only to super tuesday in early march with indiana pennsylvania and others moving to hold their primaries on the first tuesday in june although mr biden has built an all but insurmountable lead june 2 which is a long 10 weeks away will be his first chance to clinch the presidential nomination only then would the former vice president have a definitive reason to press for the withdrawal of senator bernie sanders of vermont who has shown no inclination to leave a race that feels frozen in place some democratic strategists see possible perils in the delay having to wait until june 2 for the next major chapter in the nominating race largely deprives mr biden of a chance to rack up interim victories that would bring media attention president trump meanwhile is promoting his leadership in a global pandemic a monmouth university poll on tuesday showed mr biden with a three point lead over mr trump among registered voters nationally 48 percent to 45 percent an edge the pollsters called negligible as the democratic nominee in waiting mr biden may simply have to wait longer this idea apparently being floated by the sanders campaign that bernie can stay in the race and accumulate delegates without harming biden s chances of winning in november is delusional said j j balaban a democratic strategist in pennsylvania the lengthy pause in the primary and mr sanders s reluctance to step aside are distractions mr balaban said from the need for democrats to refocus on the general election race in which mr trump has a head start raising money and coalescing supporters michael soliman a democratic strategist in new jersey said the delay might not be all bad if it concentrates the minds of voters on the need for change in the white house as this crisis causes more states to push back their primaries new jersey voters will not only be reminded about the need for strong and steady leadership but they will finally be in a position to play a meaningful role in securing the nomination for joe biden he said on tuesday delaware became the latest state to move its primary originally scheduled for april 28 to june 2 under an executive order by gov john carney pennsylvania s legislature passed a bill on wednesday to likewise reschedule the state s primary from april 28 to june 2 which gov tom wolf is expected to sign by the end of the week delaware and pennsylvania would bring to six the number of states to move primaries to june 2 including connecticut indiana maryland and rhode island the newcomers join the five primaries originally scheduled that day new jersey montana new mexico south dakota and the district of columbia inevitably the date seems destined to be stamped the acela primary for its new regional tilt ohio which canceled its primary scheduled for march 17 because of the coronavirus also has its sights on june 2 the date is one week before the june 9 deadline that the democratic national committee has set for states to hold primaries election officials in new york which is emerging as a hot spot of infections are considering delaying their presidential primary from april 28 to june 23 a group representing new york s election commissioners on tuesday called for the primary to be moved to june 23 the date of another statewide vote and to allow all voters to request absentee ballots as the d n c rules currently stand new york could forfeit some delegates at the national convention for voting so late in all 822 pledged delegates would be at stake on june 2 if all the states eyeing that date follow through the d n c has said a candidate needs 1 991 to clinch the nomination mr biden currently leads with 1 214 pledged delegates to mr sanders s 910 the delegate math has become nearly prohibitive for mr sanders to overtake mr biden he would need to win the remaining states by about 20 percentage points
