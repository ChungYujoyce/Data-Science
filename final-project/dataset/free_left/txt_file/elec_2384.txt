an old saying asserts that falsehoods come in three escalating levels lies damn lies and statistics now however we ve been given an even higher level of intentional deception policy speeches by donald trump take his recent highly publicized address outlining specific economic policies he would push to benefit hard hit working families it s an almost hilarious compilation of trumpian fabrications including his bold statesmanlike discourse on the rank unfairness of the estate tax no family will have to pay the death tax he solemnly pledged adopting the right wing pejorative for a tax assessed on certain properties of the dearly departed fine but next came his slick prevarication american workers have paid taxes their whole lives and they should not be taxed again at death workers the tax exempts the first 5 4 million of any deceased person s estate meaning 99 8 percent of americans pay absolutely nothing so trump is trying to deceive real workers into thinking he s standing for them when in fact it s his own wealth he s protecting what a maverick what a shake em up outsider what an anti establishment fighter for working stiffs oh and don t forget this what a phony sure the donald sounds like a populist on the stump bellowing that the systems been jerry rigged by and for the corporate and political elites which is killing the middle class well he s right about that but what s he going to do don t worry he says smugly i ll fix it i ll make the system honest again trust me as groucho marx said to know if a man is honest ask him if he says he is he s a crook or in the case of this phony populist just look at the specific policies he laid out as his fixes for our economy trumpeting the package as his blueprint for the economic renewal of america s working class but trump s idea of working class turns out to be millionaires and billionaires for that s who would get the bulk of benefits from his agenda rewarding the very corporate chieftains he denounces in his blustery speeches for knocking down middle income families and grabbing all of the new wealth our economy is creating his proposed tax cuts for example don t benefit low wage workers at all and provide only a pittance of gain for those with middle class paychecks but corporations are given a huuuuuuuge windfall with over a 50 percent cut in their rate his tax giveaway will also take 240 billion a year out of our public treasury money desperately needed for such basics as expanding educational opportunities and restoring our nation s dilapidated infrastructure in his policy speech he offered a new tax break to help hard working people reduce their cost of child care by allowing parents to fully deduct such spending from their taxes trump even gave this push a personal touch saying his daughter ivanka urged him to provide a helping hand to working parents because she feels so strongly about this before you tear up over their show of dad and daughter working class empathy however note that 70 percent of american households don t make enough to warrant itemizing tax deductions thus the big majority of americans that are most in need of child care help get nothing from trump s melodramatic gesture once again his generosity is for his own elite class for the tax benefits would flow uphill to wealthy families like his who can purchase the platinum packages of care for their children what we have here is the same old failed establishmentarian economic elitist hokum that republicans have been peddling for decades only bigger and more extreme rhetoric aside the reality of trump s plan is to replace ronald reagan s trickle down theory with his own arrogant anti worker scheme of tinkle down economics as an early 19th century labor leader noted figures don t lie but liars do figure that fits the donald perfectly copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
