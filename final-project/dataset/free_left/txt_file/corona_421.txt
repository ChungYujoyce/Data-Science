advertisement supported by economic view winner take all economics and cost cutting may make many in person lectures obsolete but the best education continues to be intensive expensive and done in person by david deming as the coronavirus pandemic forces schools and college campuses to go online the delivery model of education largely unchanged for centuries has suddenly been disrupted this may seem like the acceleration of a permanent shift toward online learning but i have my doubts in fact economics tells us that technology will make in person education more valuable than ever at the moment teachers from kindergarten through graduate school are struggling to take their classes online and the initial results are understandably spotty but the longer this mass experiment continues the more familiar remote learning will become and has been predicted for many years online performances by superstars are increasingly likely to replace more pedestrian in person lectures this can go only so far because other important aspects of education are best done by teachers in more intimate settings educators will increasingly be tutors mentors and role models and economics also tells us that these features of a great education will not scale up therefore i worry not about the future of teachers but of students i fear that on campus learning will become an increasingly important quality differentiator a luxury good that only students with means can afford consider that online education has been around a lot longer than covid 19 according to the latest estimates from the department of education 35 percent of college students took at least one course online before the pandemic and this share has been growing steadily for more than a decade this spring schools and universities had to move courses online with only a few weeks notice and the results have often been ugly students face significant challenges such as spotty access to the internet or an unstable living environment yet the long term prospects for online learning are good up to a point many universities already offered high quality lectures online before this crisis sometimes through partnerships with organization like edx and coursera khan academy has offered free courses for younger learners the increased flexibility of online learning has been especially important when students need to balance burdens like jobs or right now to care for themselves or relatives who have fallen ill after this crisis ends online lectures will still be increasingly valuable because they are known in economics as nonrival goods meaning they are not used up as more and more people view them for this reason the very best lecturers can teach everyone at the same time this could make lesser lecturers obsolete and should at least to some degree generate much needed productivity growth in education this seems grim for teachers but i don t think it will make us obsolete for two reasons first demand for education is a moving target and as people become more prosperous they typically want better education not worse so while cost is important it s not everything bending the higher education cost curve through online lectures may seem appealing but the point isn t to enable everyone to learn on the cheap rather people will want better education for the money and online lectures alone won t do it this explains why massive open online courses known as moocs have largely failed to disrupt traditional education despite the hype lectures are part of education but they are not the best part second as online lectures become better and cheaper the other essential components of education will take more time and energy within economics this is known as unbalanced growth the tendency for resources to shift toward parts of the economy where productivity growth is lowest it is partly why the bulk of u s employment has moved away from manufacturing and into the service sector and in education why tuition and salaries keep rising precisely because they are personal services are hard to scale up few people are interested in mass produced child care for example the personal services provided by educators include tutoring individualized feedback and mentoring and numerous studies as well as countless individual experiences show that such services are essential

a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities good teachers work with students individually or in small groups to diagnose and remedy specific learning gaps a survey of nearly 200 educational experiments found that high dosage tutoring defined as groups of no more than six students meeting at least four times per week was one of the most effective ways to improve learning high frequency individual feedback also greatly improves student performance teachers are critically important as mentors and role models as well the studies show students are more likely to complete a college degree when teachers have high expectations of them a female instructor greatly increases the performance of women in math and science courses and their subsequent interest in stem science technology engineering and mathematics careers furthermore racial gaps in course performance are smaller in classes taught by professors from underrepresented groups yet the implications of this research extend even beyond race and gender mentors matter for everyone and they can have a powerful impact on students life choices and career success there is simply no technological substitute for these aspects of great teaching because of unbalanced growth efficiency gains in online instruction will cause educators to shift toward more personal forms of education moreover what economists call cost disease tells us that the price of tutoring mentoring and direct personal intervention will rise even as lectures are provided more efficiently online if these trends continue unchecked on campus learning and intensive interaction between teachers and students may eventually become unaffordable for all but the wealthiest institutions and probably the wealthiest families two changes are necessary to avoid this tragedy first we must broaden access to institutions that can afford a high quality on campus experience second universities under budgetary pressure should resist the temptation to think of online learning technology only as a means of cost reduction it is wonderful that technology has enabled millions of students to keep learning even when direct contact is impossible but once this crisis ends we will be better off if technology frees up precious class time so that educators and students can engage deeply with each other and build personal connections that will last a lifetime david deming is the director of the malcolm wiener center for social policy at the harvard kennedy
