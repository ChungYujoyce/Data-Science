finishes her second speech in a row not to address sanders directly but that line we welcome everyone to be a part of this campaign just as we welcome everyone to be a part of this administration could well be read as a peace offering to the sanders campaign on the eve of the california primary 5 13am bst 05 13 we are going to run a grassroots campaign a broad base campaign where we reach out and welcome everyone to be part of this campaign just as we welcome everyone to be a part of this administration to make sure we have a democrat following barack obama she says as perhaps an oblique offer of an olive branch to bernie sanders 5 12am bst 05 12 it is not an overstatement for me to say that we have a really important election ahead of us now she says her tone victorious california is really important california is going to help us and were going to come out of the primary even stronger to take on donald trump she s striking out at trump just mention of her speech last week in san diego gets a cheer enough with the fear enough with the anger enough with the bigotry enough with the bullying donald trump is not qualified to be president of the united states of america 5 02am bst 05 02 fivethirtyeight s harry enten puts the percentage of delegates clinton needs to win tomorrow to finish with a majority of pledged delegates at 31 well below her average how do you argue with a majority of pledged delegates if you re bernie sanders you make the case that you re the better candidate to take on donald trump in the general election and as long as superdelegates are required to call it one way or another a call for sanders would be as valid as a call for clinton but it s conceivable that clinton and the millions of people who voted for her millions more than sanders might not go for that result which does not appear to be happening anyway in terms of any observable superdelegate movement away from clinton and towards sanders clinton will clinch a majority of pledged delegates tmmw in california she needs just 31 of all delegates up tmmw to clinch 4 51am bst 04 51 nicky woolf hillary clinton s primary eve party at the greek theatre in hollywood was star studded

57 sabrina siddiqui bernie sanders just now this campaign is going to win bernie sanders spokesman michael briggs pushed back on the notion that clinton had clinched the nomination dubbing the reports
