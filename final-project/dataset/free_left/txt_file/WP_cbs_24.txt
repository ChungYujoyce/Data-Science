watch cbsn live by audrey mcnamara may 15 2020 11 20 am cbs news at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic it appeared that young people were largely spared from the virus now doctors believe there s growing evidence that a rare mysterious illness appearing in childrenmay be linked to the virus it s been dubbed pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome abbreviated aspmisorpims the u s centers for disease control and prevention issued an advisory to doctors about it thursday afternoon referring to the condition as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children mis c associated with coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 symptoms of the syndrome have been compared to those of kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome pmis however is being recognized as a new entity according to dr luiza petre a cardiologist and professor of cardiology at mount sinai s school of medicine in new york kawasaki disease is a rare but serious illness believed to be triggered by the immune system s response to infection but an official cause is unknown children with kawasaki experience a prolonged fever lasting several days a skin rash and swollen lymph nodes in the neck affected children can also develop redness in their eyes lips mouth as well as the palms of their hands and soles of their feet according to the national institutes of health most children recover but if left untreated kawasaki can cause cardiac issues and become life threatening toxic shock also causes fever and a decrease in blood flow but is triggered by a bacterial infection kawasaki disease mostly occurs in childrenunder the age of 5 while astudy of pmis cases in italy found an average age of 7 while an understanding of pmis is still evolving children with the syndrome also experience a prolonged fever rashes change in the color of their skin or their lips swollen glands and red eyes what differentiates pmis from kawasaki appears to be complaints of abdominal pain as well as nausea vomiting diarrhea and chest pain what we re seeing is the immune system is actually going into overdrive impacting the body in a negative way dr jake kleinmahon a pediatric oncologist at ochsner hospital for children in new orleans who has treated several children for the illness told cbs news some of these patients are having inflammation of their coronary arteries and you can have basically a heart attack according to dr sean o leary vice chair of the american academy of pediatrics committee on infectious diseases the level of inflammation in the heart tends to be higher with pmis as compared to kawasaki disease all together the syndrome has shown to be more severe than kawasaki that s what s concerning petre told cbsn and a lot of pmis cases do require icu almost 80 of them pmis has been reported in over 100 children in new york the epicenter of the u s coronavirus outbreak cbs news has tallied about 200 cases under investigation in 19 states and washington d c and cases have also been reported in at least six other countries doctors in italy published a study wednesday documenting numerous cases of pmis linked to the coronavirus eight out of 10 children they studied with pmis had antibodies to covid 19 indicating that they had been infected the fact that the syndrome is appearing in places where coronavirus is prevalent suggests that there could be a correlation o leary said he cautioned however that it s still too early to say anything for certain some of the things i tell you will be true tomorrow but some of them may not he said cbs news senior medical correspondent dr tara narula said it s important to stress that in the grand scheme of the pandemic this is rare we re still learning a lot more about it a majority of the children with pmis symptoms reported in new york have also tested positive for covid 19 but others have not that is something we doctors don t have an explanation for petre said if we talk about the frequency of kawasaki disease even the specialists in this disease say they ve never seen more than five cases at once in one hospital she said so that s something definitely suspicious about the timing between covid and these cases according to o leary pmis cases seem to appear about a month after a peak of covid 19 cases in an area if the syndrome is brought on by a covid 19 infection the lag time for pmis symptoms is a curious feature he said it s almost more surprising that most of these kids are covid 19 positive that s the mystery it s a lot like a delayed reaction petre said of the symptoms onset if a child does present with pmis symptoms it is important to contact your doctor according to petre if a child has a fever that doesn t go down and is resistant to medication for more than a day a doctor should be contacted the american academy of pediatrics released guidelines for parents earlier this week advising them to call their pediatrician if they notice any of the following symptoms in this syndrome early intervention is critical as children can decompensate very quickly and they should seek medical attention immediately petre said according to petre and o leary if a child is admitted for pmis their primary treatment will be supportive care fluids and medication would likely be administered to maintain blood pressure as well as anti inflammatory medication like steroids or immunoglobulin ivig if you re not really aware of this syndrome that s being described it could easily be missed said kleinmahon fortunately children overall are very resilient and almost all of the cases if we re able to knock down the inflammation and get them past the beginning stages of this they re usually doing very well first published on may 14 2020 2 49 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
