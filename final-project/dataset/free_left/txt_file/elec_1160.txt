 while donald trump s team asserted they were moving in the right direction a slew of polls normally one of the gop nominee s favorite talking points suggested otherwise getty there s plenty of time to make up ground campaign chairman paul manafort says by nick gass 08 04 2016 10 02 am edt updated 08 04 2016 06 12 pm edt after a rocky week donald trump s team projected confidence thursday with trump his running mate his staff and his surrogates all sending the same message the campaign is moving in the right direction and it s hillary clinton who s in trouble ben carson and other surrogates are working to put trump s feud with a gold star family in the campaign s rear view mirror indiana gov mike pence is working to mend frayed fences with fellow republicans after trump offered a surprise non endorsement to paul ryan ahead of his tuesday primary and trump himself on wednesday aimed to squash reports of campaign strife with assertions that the campaign is more unified than it has ever been advertisement top trump advisers and aides vowed that the candidate would pivot to more substantial issues like clinton s role in the iranian nuclear deal and the candidate himself acknowledged as much to a florida tv station but while trump s team asserted they were moving in the right direction a slew of polls normally one of the gop nominee s favorite talking points suggested otherwise polls in florida new hampshire michigan and pennsylvania battleground states trump needs to win to have any chance at winning in november showed him trailing clinton substantial margins coupled with a national fox news poll taken in the days following clinton s official nomination at the democratic national convention last week the numbers suggested big trouble a new mcclatchy marist poll released on thursday puts clinton 15 points ahead of trump nationally 48 percent to 33 percent that s a surge from last month s edition of the survey in which clinton led trump by only 3 points trump foreshadowed the latest wave of dismal polling on tuesday when a cnn orc poll taken after the dnc showed him trailing by 7 points i think these polls i don t know there s something about these polls there s something phony trump said a day before trump similarly expressed a fear that the general election is going to be rigged meanwhile trump s opponents continue to pile on president barack obama on thursday repeatedly took trump to task in a press conference the president suggested it was ridiculous for trump to speak of rigged elections suggested trump was unfit to be in charged of nuclear weapons and even said that if trump wanted access to classified briefings he needed to start acting like a president senate minority leader harry reid meanwhile suggested clinton could win both arizona and georgia by nick gass trump s problems don t stop at the numbers a number of high profile republicans have in recent days withdrawn their support from trump or like retiring new york rep richard hanna defected entirely to clinton and even in the face of intraparty tension over his refusal to support house speaker paul ryan in his primary election trump showed no remorse i was you know very forthright when i said when i made certain statements trump told florida cbs affiliate wpec on wednesday in discussing his snubs of ryan and sens john mccain of arizona and kelly ayotte of new hampshire and you know i m happy with them we ll see what happens i think we re going to do very well trump s plan to refocus on clinton seemed to go into action in part thursday when he criticized clinton over a report of money transferred to iran under the supervision of the obama administration but trump again put himself into the center of the story by claiming that he had seen a video of the cash exchange a claim that has been widely debunked but even with wilting poll numbers and widespread gop concern about the man the party nominated less than two weeks ago there s plenty of time to make up ground campaign chairman paul manafort insisted in two television interviews thursday morning usually campaigns don t even start until september we re using august as a very aggressive month however manafort remarked on cbs this morning he cited the large crowd trump had drawn in florida the night before even though the candidate himself had mused during that same jacksonville rally i don t know why we re not leading by a lot maybe crowds don t make the difference and he boasted about the campaign s announcement of 50 state directors everybody s deployed and working and he said it s impressive though not quite as impressive as the record fundraising haul of 80 million in july so no we re feeling comfortable he concluded and the campaign is working to refocus scrutiny on clinton especially with an emphasis on her role in orchestrating the beginnings of the nuclear deal with iran after it was reported this week that the united states secretly delivered 400 million to the iranian government on the same day four american prisoners were released pence peppered his address thursday morning with multiple shots at clinton and president barack obama making note of the money sent to the iranian government on the day of the prisoner release clinton and obama he declared at a stop in raleigh north carolina essentially put a price tag on every american who goes abroad by nick gass manafort told cbs that he rejects the media narrative that democrats are currently in command of the 2016 race though he acknowledged being surprised by the onslaught of negative polls pence who has tried as trump s running mate to bridge the divide between the blunt businessman and the gop grass roots got called out on his role thursday morning by an 11 year old boy in north carolina i ve noticed you ve been softening up on trump s policies and words is this going to be your role in the administration the boy asked pence who replied sometimes things don t come out the way that you mean them explicitly tying the media and the democratic party together as having mutual interests and methods pence observed i mean the media and the democrats they all have the same problems pence added they all keep telling each other the usual methods are going to work against him they keep thinking they ve done him in they think this is over we finally got him and they turn on the tv the next morning and donald trump is still standing and fighting in front of thousands of people and he will make america great again and pence publicly broke with trump and endorsed ryan in his primary on wednesday saying that trump himself encouraged him to support the speaker manafort suggested to abc s good morning america that the speaker need not worry of course he s gonna work with paul ryan of course he s trying to bridge the party together but ryan is also running against somebody who s not going to win but nonetheless is a strong supporter of mr trump s manafort mused so it s not just in paul ryan s district that gets all the notoriety because he s the speaker in any case trump campaign officials said it wouldn t be prudent to endorse ryan anyway manafort told abc that the campaign has sort of had a rule of not getting involved in primaries because it s usually not a good situation for the presidential candidate trump endorsed rep renee ellmers r n c in her special primary election in june which she lost trump co chair and policy adviser sam clovis suggested to cnn s new day that it would not be an appropriate move to endorse primary candidates pointing to mccain s strong opponent in former state sen kelli ward senior communications adviser jason miller sounded a note of frustration on fox friends calling absolute pure fiction multiple reports about a so called intervention for trump with republican national committee chairman reince priebus former house speaker newt gingrich and former new york city mayor rudy giuliani giuliani singled out gingrich for using the word intervention in a memo that got around during a discussion on fox business network what a ridiculous word an intervention is for a drug addict and it s for someone who s an alcoholic and i ve had to do them with people at times there s nothing wrong with them if that s the case donald trump doesn t drink or smoke by the way we don t have that problem giuliani said gingrich did not return a request for comment a lot of this talk is just silliness coming from washington or coming from the clinton campaign miller said and i ve got to give the clinton camp credit they ve done a pretty good job of working their contacts in the media you know pushing a lot of this not all networks and news outlets are quite as fair and balanced as fox news he added while not disputing that trump s continued reluctance to endorse ryan has created a complication for the campaign both miller and manafort emphasized the point that their boss is running a campaign with little precedent i think the important thing to keep in mind is that donald trump is more different from any other candidate miller said on fox news going on to lay out what he suggested will be the republican nominee s winning argument what kind of justices do we want nominated to the supreme court do we want to stop an iran nuclear deal do we want to lower taxes reduce regulations so republicans who want to stop this otherwise we don t want eight years of hillary clinton that would be disastrous think about what the country would look like if we have eight years of obama and then hillary clinton it d be a disaster still the rnc remains frustrated with trump said one person who is close to priebus who described the current situation as unfathomable several rnc officials suggested that the party might need to consider diverting resources away from the presidential race and toward key house senate and governors races with concern mounting about the party s congressional majorities the sources suggested that trump had until labor day about a month from now to turn things around by nick gass such a drastic measure would be similar to what happened during the final weeks of the 1996 presidential contest with the gop shifted funds away from bob dole s flailing campaign toward congressional battles one rnc official described the blueprint as plan b yet within the party there s rampant confusion about where things stand one gop official said they d reached out to priebus in hopes of figuring out what was happening within the trump campaign but hadn t heard back trump surrogates insisted reports of the candidate s struggles were misguided the past week has even been good for trump giuliani said at another point during his fox business appearance my father taught me to be a boxer and the only way you find out how good a boxer is when you hit him in the face the first time or when he gets knocked down the first time donald trump i think is positioned very very well the former mayor said adding that the fundamentals remain the same america wants change desperately america doesn t want hillary clinton while conceding that trump s campaign is evolving and that trump as a political neophyte has a little more of a learning curve than normally would be the case giuliani added but you get bad weeks and good weeks tough couple of days giuliani concluded later in the same program but that s what s gonna happen when you re breaking eggshells alex isenstadt and bianca padr ocasio contributed to this report missing out on the latest
