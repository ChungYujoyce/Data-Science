advertisement supported by now part of the long list of women the president has insulted a governor a reporter the head of general motors and of course the house speaker by annie karni washington as he confronts a pandemic president trump s attention has also been directed at a more familiar foe those he feels are challenging him and particularly women always a mess with mary b mr trump tweeted last week attacking the female chief executive of general motors mary t barra as he accused the company of dragging its feet on producing ventilators as usual with this general motors things just never seem to work out he wrote this g m apparently referring to the one led by the first female chief executive of an american auto manufacturer at least he mentioned ms barra by name when it came to gretchen whitmer michigan s democratic governor who delivered her party s official response to his state of the union address earlier this year and has been pushing for a national emergency declaration in her state mr trump did not acknowledge her by name we ve had a big problem with the young a woman governor he said in an interview last week with sean hannity the fox news host you know who i m talking about from michigan the president dismissed ms whitmer who has been pressing the federal government to provide more medical equipment to her state noting that she was a new governor and it had not been pleasant in a tweet he later referred to her as gretchen half whitmer saying she doesn t have a clue ms whitmer whom white house officials have privately criticized for showing her inexperience on the group conference calls with the president has been relatively measured in her public criticisms of mr trump in interviews she said michigan was not receiving clear directives and guidance from washington and that the federal government told her that if the state needed supplies we needed to go it ourselves on the calls officials said she has been corrected by seema verma the administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services about what waivers she had already been granted by the federal government at his news conference on friday mr trump said he had directed vice president mike pence to cut off communication with ms whitmer again without using her name he said he told mr pence don t call the woman in michigan mr trump said at his news conference i say if they don t treat you right don t call but tiffany brown ms whitmer s spokeswoman said the governor was committed to maintaining a functional relationship with the federal government even if that no longer included mr trump governor whitmer has and will continue to have conversations with the vice president and the head of fema ms brown said in a statement as mr trump has had to reverse himself on his overly upbeat assessments of how quickly he could reopen the country for business he has also increasingly targeted some of his regular foils on monday morning in an interview with fox friends he referred to speaker nancy pelosi as a sick puppy after she had appeared on cnn s state of the union and said the president s early denials about the dangers of the coronavirus carried deadly consequences as the president fiddles people are dying ms pelosi said in an interview on monday she rolled her eyes at his attack every knock from him is a boost for me quite frankly so i don t care what he says she said and at his sunday evening news conference mr trump snapped at yamiche alcindor a pbs newshour correspondent whom he has criticized publicly in the past for asking him to defend his own statements about governors making requests for medical equipment like ventilators that he believes they do not actually need let me tell you something mr trump said after denying he made statements that he had in fact made be nice don t be threatening don t be threatening be nice ms alcindor tweeted in response that she was not the first human being woman black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job it was a sentiment echoed by democrats who said mr trump s pattern of singling out women for critiques ultimately takes a toll on him politically with female voters even as it energizes some members of his base women see this and they ve all been on the receiving end at some point in their lives said cecile richards the former president of planned parenthood and a founder of supermajority a new women s advocacy group when you actually poll women who did vote for him they did it with enormous hesitation because of his bullying attitude towards women and his vulgar attitudes women who work for mr trump have long defended the president s treatment of women by noting that he is an equal opportunity counterpuncher someone whose gut reaction to being insulted by anyone is to respond in kind and the women closest to him like his daughter ivanka trump or his former campaign manager kellyanne conway now the white house counselor have often pointed to their own experiences when pressed on mr trump s history of sexist attacks i speak for many women who have and do work for him ms conway said on monday we are on equal footing with our male colleagues even though some of those male colleagues have not always agreed i feel empowered respected and engaged as for mr trump s recent attacks on women ms conway said the president responded when under attack without regard to the immutable characteristics that seem to obsess so many who should otherwise put their full force and energy into covid 19 stephanie grisham the white house press secretary added that women rightfully fought for equal treatment for years and there should not be special rules applied to what constitutes equal treatment she noted that she found it funny how i never get these inquiries from men in fact the insults are hardly specific to gender in the briefing room earlier this month the president also pounced on peter alexander a correspondent for nbc news calling him a terrible reporter and accusing him of asking a nasty question when mr alexander asked the president to deliver his message to a fearful country he has described gov jay inslee of washington as a nasty person and a snake for criticizing the administration s response to the virus but his attacks on women even as the country together faces a pandemic have stood out in part because they recall his dismissal of his 2016 democratic rival hillary clinton as a nasty woman and of many powerful women who have challenged him since they re all appalling jess mcintosh a democratic strategist said of mr trump s personal attacks on men and women alike the difference is that it s easier to name the women he doesn t attack and the attacks become much faster and meaner when he himself is facing some kind of pressure and he lashes out at who he perceives to be the weakest person in the room advertisement
