 a vocal group of democratic bundlers and donors want hillary clinton s campaign to unleash the fury on the gop billionaire by gabriel debenedetti 03 31 2016 05 22 am edt democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton waits to be introduced before speaking at the mary ryan boys and girls club in milwaukee wis monday march ap photo seattle hillary clinton s high level bundlers and donors are increasingly urging the campaign to direct more attention to donald trump and begin the process of tearing the bark off the billionaire they expect will be the republican nominee in weekly conference calls periodic meetings and closed door campaign fundraising events a vocal group of clinton s top funders is calling for a more immediate and aggressive approach to trump reflecting a sense of urgency born of the real estate developer s domination of news cycle after news cycle advertisement there are those of us who recognize that a trump candidacy is a very serious threat in minnesota we lived through this in 1998 when jesse ventura was elected explained ken martin the chairman of minnesota s democratic farmer labor party and a clinton fundraiser the concern for me at the dfl is that there s a complacency among some party leaders who don t believe that he s electable the more that people believe that the more dangerous it gets even by the usual standards of bundler input say fundraisers and prominent democrats who attend political and finance briefings and listen in on the calls organized by the campaign the rising tide of feedback is noteworthy a sign of mounting unease with an unconventional opponent who may outwardly seem easy to defeat but who has already dispatched 14 primary rivals she would do well to separate herself from this lunatic trump look at the mistakes that rubio made and that cruz is making at the moment said one west coast bundler who is eager to see a ramp up in attention and resources committed to trump but without descending into one on one insults you don t argue with this guy who has no sense of decency you re going to lose on that for me i would say take the highest road you possibly can clinton campaign officials typically refuse to tip their hand when answering the questions note those who frequent these calls including many who agree with the campaign s current approach there s a set of answers at the ready when aides are confronted with questions about when and how they plan to mount an offensive against trump a gradual increase in attacks on the manhattan billionaire the officials say is all part of the plan while clinton s primary contest with bernie sanders drags on careful to focus on the primary against sanders the staffers tend to explain that campaign workers are prepping for the general election with research and message testing while clinton knocks trump s policies in a series of speeches and ads looking ahead to new york s april 19 primary for example her campaign on wednesday released a television spot suggesting that trump s offensive statements are opposed to the values of the state still the ad never explicitly says his name and it isn t as direct and hard hitting as some donors urge highlighting the divide between nervous contributors and the campaign strategy setters as it was described by roughly two dozen high level democrats in and around the clinton political and fundraising operations the campaign is eager to avoid a schoolyard style brawl with trump a lesson it learned from the demise of marco rubio said several donors who have discussed the topic with campaign staffers the time for a more direct style of political combat aides tell fundraisers has not yet come the clinton campaign and clinton supporters need to remember the rules of the ncaa basketball tournament you play one game at a time to get ahead of themselves and focus on trump when they still have work to do with bernie sanders would be a mistake the political graveyard is full of people who got ahead of themselves running the next race before they have run the first one and i think that s how the campaign feels said former south carolina gov jim hodges who has raised money for the campaign outlining the campaign s imperatives does that mean you don t play out what a race would look like with trump or cruz you look at those things but that doesn t mean you re not still focused on the nomination our first important goal is to get the nomination in a way that lets us get 90 to 95 percent of the sanders voters added ed rendell a former pennsylvania governor and democratic national committee chairman explaining the task of respecting the vermont senator s ongoing primary challenge there will be plenty of time to take on trump i want surrogates to take him on the growing drumbeat calling for an immediate declaration of war against trump comes at a delicate time for the campaign which is still competing against sanders in tough battles in wisconsin and new york even as clinton fine tunes a preliminary general election message that includes throwing elbows at trump and occasionally ted cruz the campaign itself nodded to that tension in a wednesday night fundraising plea to its rank and file backers reminding them we re fighting on two fronts as senator sanders tries to make a comeback and donald trump smears our team not to mention his republican opponents immigrants muslims women our nato allies and much of the rest of the planet clinton is still raising only primary not general election money but that process is taking place against a backdrop of heightened scrutiny as sanders has ratcheted up his criticism of her fundraising practices including her plans to headline high dollar events with george and amal clooney next month and alphabet cfo ruth porat a former morgan stanley official on wednesday night after a heavier fundraising stretch that will help finance her upcoming campaign schedule clinton is now back to a busier schedule of public campaign events in primary states still she is scheduled for a handful of closed door events in new york massachusetts and colorado hosted by gov john hickenlooper in the coming days according to invitations obtained by politico while the campaign itself refrains from launching a full out assault on trump for now other arms of the pro clinton political machine are revving up their own efforts the prospect of a showdown with trump is catching the eye of donors to priorities usa action the main super pac supporting clinton explained chief strategist guy cecil we have had more donors reach out to us proactively in part because the election is getting closer and in part because they realize that the republican nominee is likely going to be donald trump or ted cruz he explained both of them are equally unacceptable from a policy point of view but there is not a question that trump s hyperbolic name calling minority bashing approach has attracted the most attention so while the brooklyn based campaign itself tells fundraisers it s mostly focused on the primary at the moment the broader pro clinton operation is taking the lead against trump led by groups like priorities and a handful of other independent groups dedicated to clinton correct the record and american bridge have been digging into trump s background for months for example and priorities is readying the first major democratic ad blitz against him which could come as soon as spring the campaign is striking the right balance between staying focused on securing the nomination and preparing for a competitive general election her speech in wisconsin this week was spot on when it comes to laying out the stakes in november and what a donald trump candidacy would mean for the country the fact that we have had a competitive primary makes it even more important that priorities is fully prepared to take on the republican nominee whether it is trump or cruz said cecil i expect we will take the fight to both of them early and often in fact we have already begun the most important thing for democrats progressives activists and donors to understand is that donald trump should not be taken for granted added cecil whose group is closely watching republican ads that are already running against trump a tactic that both hodges and gary locke a former washington governor and obama administration commerce secretary encouraged for other democratic groups as well but monitoring how trump s gop rivals attack him and reciting the clinton campaign s anti trump talking points as some prominent surrogates have been tasked to do may not be enough to satisfy the pleas to confront him some high profile supporters have started taking matters into their own hands embracing their roles as attack dogs while the official campaign operation takes its time gearing up i have a very nuanced and subtle approach to donald trump washington gov jay inslee said turning the brash billionaire s words against him it is our intention to build a wall around the state of washington and to get the republican party to pay for it missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico
