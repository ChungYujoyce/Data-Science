nation six weeks after the mueller report s completion president trump is still taking victory laps this time in a conversation with russian president vladimir putin president donald trump he said something to the effect that it started off as a mountain and it ended up being a mouse margaret brennan russian interference in the 2016 election is of course what prompted the investigation in the first place kristen welker did you tell him not to meddle in the next election president donald trump we didn t discuss that really we didn t discuss it margaret brennan what should be done to punish russia and keep them from meddling again we ll talk with secretary of state mike pompeo and attorney general william barr faces a firestorm on capitol hill angering democrats on one committee mazie hirono please mister attorney general you know give us some credit for knowing what the hell is going on around here margaret brennan and declining to appear before another steve cohen chicken barr should have shown up today and answered questions margaret brennan that same committee is threatening to hold him in contempt of congress we ll explain why and there is outrage over some of barr s answers in testimony last month nancy pelosi he lied to congress and if anybody else did that it would be considered a crime margaret brennan we ll ask the top republican on the house committee doug collins and california democrat eric swalwell what s next plus we ll speak to the number two democrat in the senate dick durbin of illinois we ll have plenty of analysis on all of the news of the week it s just ahead on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation it s quiet here in washington but that is not the case in other parts of the world overnight we ve seen the worst flare up in violence between israel and hamas in months hamas fired hundreds of rockets into israel which responded with what prime minister netanyahu called massive airstrikes in gaza meanwhile north korea tested what appeared to be short range missiles as president trump s diplomatic outreach stalls kim jong un personally oversaw that launch and in venezuela a u s backed uprising against nicolas maduro fizzled as opposition leader juan guaido was unable to peel away his key military support we begin this morning with america s top diplomat secretary of state mike pompeo welcome to face the nation on a very busy morning for you on this latest north korea test it appears to be short range missiles does kim jong un get a pass on this or are we looking at a situation where more sanctions are necessary mike pompeo secretary of state secpompeo so the sanctions haven t changed the toughest sanctions in the history of north korea remain in place that s probably what s putting some of the pressure on chairman kim today you saw this happen too right after his visit to russia right right after he spoke with vladimir putin he made the decision to take these actions we re still evaluating the appropriate response but i want everyone in your audience to know we re going to exhaust every diplomatic opportunity there is i continue to invite our counterparts for negotiations we still believe there is a path forward where chairman kim can denuclearize without resort to anything beyond diplomacy we re hopeful that we can achieve that we ve made real progress between singapore and hanoi and we hope that progress can continue it would be the best outcome for the world and chairman kim s commitment that he made to president trump back in singapore remains in effect he has said he s prepared to denuclearize my task as america s most senior diplomat is to achieve that margaret brennan so when president trump tweeted i m with him he wasn t saying that this test will go without consequence mike pompeo i think president trump understands that the path forward that is the most optimal for the entire world is a negotiated solution to this so we re he i talked to him last night we are full speed ahead and trying to work with the north koreans to diplomatically achieve the verified denuclearization on the peninsula margaret brennan cynthia warmbier the mother of otto warmbier the college student from the university of virginia who died in north after being released from north korean custody spoke out forcefully about kim jong un and the diplomacy under way take a listen cynthia warmbier this is not only a nuclear problem this is a problem that we re dealing with absolute evil there is a charade going on right now it s called diplomacy how can you have diplomacy with someone that never tells the truth margaret brennan how do you respond to her mike pompeo well i ve gotten to know the warmbier family especially cindy she is an amazing patriot and a remarkable woman and i have enormous sympathy for her and admiration for her as well and i completely understand her remarks we re hopeful we we don t expect chairman kim to tell us the truth that s why we re going to verify any denuclearization that takes place that s why we will ensure that we see actual on the ground on the ground outcomes we re not going to take anyone s word for it but we want to work to try and do that in a way that is a negotiated solution and that s our mission set margaret brennan are you still president trump s lead negotiator on north korea mike pompeo so far as i know margaret brennan well the north koreans have said that they objected to mike pompeo yeah margaret brennan negotiating with you personally mike pompeo the north koreans don t get to choose our negotiator and we don t get to choose theirs each of these two leaders is also very personally committed to this effort they ve both shown great effort to try and achieve this outcome i i m working to support those two leaders so that we can get the outcome that the world deserves margaret brennan i want to ask you about china chinese officials are headed here to washington for trade talks mike pompeo mm hm margaret brennan we heard from a pentagon official on friday a pretty stark description of what is underway right now in china he said that there are three million muslims being rounded up into concentration camps in china why hasn t the administration taken any kind of action or sanction against beijing for this mike pompeo oh goodness the president trump has pushed back against china in a way that no previous president had they d margaret brennan concentration camps mike pompeo they d given they they had given the chinese a free pass in every dimension president trump is now pushing back on the enormous trade abuses you ve seen me personally speak out about the same situation that you re describing this this number certainly up to a million people held in reeducation camps the trump administration is going to hold every nation accountable margaret brennan you re okay with that term reeducation camps not concentration camps which the pentagon used mike pompeo we can we can use lots of different terms to describe what s taking place this is an enormous human rights violations i ve spoken about it repeatedly margaret brennan why the difference between mike pompeo the entire administration has spoken on it repeatedly margaret brennan you just said a million minorities mike pompeo yeah margaret brennan the pentagon says three million mike pompeo yeah margaret brennan is there a discrepancy within the administration mike pompeo no margaret brennan on what to do about this and what s actually happening mike pompeo there there there s there there s not don t don t don t play ticky tac there s no discrepancy this administration this this margaret brennan concentration camps is a loaded term sir mike pompeo ma am margaret brennan and three million muslims being rounded up is something that many would expect the united states to raise mike pompeo yes margaret brennan at the highest levels mike pompeo and and we ve done so margaret brennan so sanctions mike pompeo so so it sounds like it sounds like you re satisfied with that margaret brennan well mike pompeo right we we ve done so right and so so don t don t don t don t make don t make margaret brennan but why use sanctions should we expect that be because the accusation as you know sir is that the trade talks are causing the u s to choose its own financial interests over its values are you saying that s not the case and there will be actions taken mike pompeo thanks for the clarification of your question i i appreciate that this administration can do more than one thing at a time we re working to stop the intellectual property theft that has destroyed millions of jobs in the united states we re working to stop the foreign technology transfer foreign technology transfers that have taken place we have got the largest defense budget in history in place part of which will go to ensuring we counter chinese military power we re working on these human rights violations as well this administration takes a backseat to no one in our efforts and our outcomes in achieving a more rational relationship with china the previous administration put us in a bad place and we re working to fix it margaret brennan were you just saying human rights are going to be included in the trade deal mike pompeo no human human rights are are going to be addressed margaret brennan on mike pompeo and we ve done so i ve raised it in multiple conversations with my counterpart their foreign minister and with others margaret brennan you ve got the whole world as your portfolio so let s move on to venezuela and russia there was this phone call between vladimir putin and president trump that just happened the president described it to us in an oval office spray why didn t he bring up election interference on this phone call when he said he did discuss the findings of the mueller report which found sweeping and systematic russian interference in 2016 mike pompeo well you ll have to ask the white house that question the president has been very clear the administration has taken great action i wish the previous one had stopped the election interference that took place in 2016 they failed to do so between 2017 when president trump came into office and 2018 we had a successful election year a set of midterm elections we re working diligently to ensure that the elections in 2020 aren t interfered with by russia by iran by north korea or anyone else we have enormous resource deployed against that challenge and the american people should be sure that their government is working hard to keep our election safe and secure margaret brennan you said this week that moscow has hundreds of people in venezuela and you were very clear that you think it was russia that convinced nicolas maduro not to get on a plane and to flee the country here s what the president said during his after his phone call with vladimir putin president donald trump friday he is not looking at all to get involved in venezuela other than he d like to see something positive happen for venezuela and i feel the same way margaret brennan there seems to be a difference in how the president described the situation and how you and ambassador bolton have described it mike pompeo no no difference no difference the pre the president has said i think he in fact tweeted that the russians must leave venezuela we ve asked every nation that is interfere interfering with venezuelan democracy you ve seen this i i was down on the border we saw mothers who couldn t feed their children fleeing the country we saw families that had sick kids but couldn t get medicine it s all sitting sitting within 50 miles of where we were located and maduro won t allow it to come in the president has been very clear we want the cubans out there are iranians on the ground there we want the russians we want everyone out so that the venezuelan people can get the democracy they deserve that includes mr maduro leaving margaret brennan so when he says the president says putin is not looking to get involved at all in venezuela that is not the president accepting him at face value mike pompeo he ll have to leave he ll have to live with margaret brennan he knows but that s not the case mike pompeo the president has tweeted that he wants the russians out of venezuela margaret brennan so he was just putting a positive spin on things in that moment mike pompeo we are working very diligently to ensure that maduro leaves and we get free and fair elections in venezuela that will require the 2 300 cuban security personnel frankly the people closest to maduro who are protecting the in tight security for maduro they have got to leave we re working on that as well we re working with the cubans to try and get an outcome that will let the venezuelans have this opportunity margaret brennan on this i know you will be meeting with the russian foreign minister in the coming days is there a deal to be struck with russia on this front i mean russia benefits right by having venezuelan oil off the market by having a level of influence in america s backyard is the u s going to negotiate a deal with russia on venezuela mike pompeo i ll certainly bring up venezuela it will be one of many topics that foreign minister lavrov and i speak speak about whether there is a particular deal that can be reached only time will tell margaret brennan lindsey graham the republican senator from south carolina who i know you know well tweeted this week cuba russia send troop to prop up maduro on venezuela while we talk and have sanctions where is our aircraft carrier he seems to be calling a bluff here on your mention and mention from others that military options aren t off the table what is actually being considered here because you can t refer to the use of military force lightly is there an actual option that you are considering deploying in the coming days mike pompeo oh goodness the president has made clear that no option is off the table we worked this week to further the planning so that we d have a wide range of options diplomatic options political options options that would involve the department of defense we have made clear the president has margaret brennan is that hospital shifts or that s actual offensive action mike pompeo there will be many options that we will fully bake make sure they re ready get laid out in exquisite detail that are executable so that when the situation changes on the ground or the president makes a conclusion that it s path he wants to go down that these options are prepared for him we would t want to be flat footed and we have worked diligently to make sure that that capability a wide range of capabilities are prepared to be executed margaret brennan and just final point on this juan guaid the opposition leader that the u s backs and many other countries recognize is a legitimate leader has said that he essentially miscalculated the level of support in assuming the military would back him or break away from maduro are you still saying a military option is on the table when the opposition leader we re backing can t get the support of his country s military mike pompeo well he didn t get it that day although the senior intelligence official left it s not the case that military haven t left there have been lots of venezuelan military that have departed but margaret brennan not enough to make that successful mike pompeo not yet we re not there yet we won t be successful until the day that we are we are determined to see that the venezuelan people have their democracy as are 54 other nations including most every nation in the region they understand that three million refugees three million migrants that have departed venezuela and another two million this year is unacceptable for their region and they are working to build out a coalition to support the venezuelan people and their democracy margaret brennan all right mr secretary i m told we have to leave it there thank you for coming in mike pompeo thank you ma am margaret brennan we turn now to the number two democrat in the senate dick durbin of illinois he joins us this morning from chicago senator i i want to get to a number of these domestic issues with you but i do know you had visited venezuela within the past few years do you support the administration s approach here senator dick durbin d illinois minority whip senatordurbin well i support their approach but i don t agree with lindsey graham i am not in favor of military intervention but i i can just tell you that i listened to secretary of state pompeo trying to explain this president s conversation with vladimir putin and i just don t get it this president is totally dazzled by vladimir putin by the crown prince of saudi arabia by authoritarian leaders in countries like brazil he gets on the phone with them and he loses it gets all googly eyed over their assertions they have nothing to do with what s going on in venezuela listen to what john bolton says listen to what even what secretary of state pompeo said russia has sent at least a planeload full of these little green men that we ve seen in eastern ukraine and they are destabilizing the situation there they re there to to support maduro they don t want to see the change that the american people want to see and that s to have a free election in that country and a choice of someone democratically margaret brennan now to the question of russian election interference in this country s election in 2016 which is of course what prompted the mush mueller report and what brings us to where we are right now with the attorney general testifying to congress about his description of that to the public speaker pelosi said this week that a g barr lied do you agree with her senator dick durbin well i don t know what other conclusion you can reach i asked him the question point blank and charlie crist of florida asked him well is there any effort by the people who worked on the mueller staff and such to raise questions about the accuracy of what you said in your letter and he said no i don t know and the fact is he d received a letter from bob mueller just a few days before that explicitly said in writing the concerns which he had with the characterizations by attorney general barr i don t know any other way to characterize it margaret brennan let s listen to that exchange that you just referenced begin vt charlie crist april 9 reports have emerged recently general that members of the special counsel s team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your march 24th letter that it does not adequately or accurately necessarily portray the report s findings do you know what they re referencing with that william barr attorney general april 9 no i don t i think i think i suspect that they probably wanted you know more put out senator chris van hollen april 10 did bob mueller support your conclusion william barr i don t know whether bob mueller supported my conclusions end vt margaret brennan that was congressman crist and then senator van hollen those questions that you are saying you view as a lie republicans defenders of attorney general barr say no no this was a a matter of answering the question regarding members of mueller s own team disagreeing not saying that he was not aware that the special counsel personally objected why don t you buy that excuse senator dick durbin i don t buy it at all let s be honest about it attorney general barr not only received that letter from bob mueller saying in writing that he disagreed with the attorney general s characterization of the mueller report he then had a telephone conversation with him to follow and to say he wasn t aware of mueller s misgivings about his characterization that is at at the minimum misleading if not worse deception to the american people margaret brennan now you did have a chance to ask some questions of attorney the attorney general yourself the chairman of the senate judiciary committee lindsey graham has since issued a letter saying that offering robert mueller the chance to testify specifically about this phone call in conversation with the attorney general do you expect him to testify and and if he declines do you consider that a closed matter senator dick durbin well i hope it is not a closed matter because there s so many unanswered questions remember there are two volumes to the mueller report the first volume deals with russian interference in our election much of that is redacted we need to know what they did which led to the indictment of russians by mueller and led to i hope a a new resolve by the united states to never let it happen again but margaret brennan so do you expect him to testify take lindsey graham up on that offer senator dick durbin well i would take him up on it but i asked him point blank on the record on thursday in the senate judiciary committee are we going to have bob mueller before this committee and he said no as far as he was concerned it was over if he s opened the door now to bring in bob miller bob mueller good i believe he should testify not only about the first volume on russian interference but clearly about his conclusions or lack of conclusions on obstruction of justice margaret brennan you wrote an op ed recently challenging the attorney general and saying he should recuse himself from a number of the related investigations that have sprung off the special counsel s probe itself are you suggesting that the attorney general would meddle in ongoing investigations regarding the president senator dick durbin i m not going to suggest that but i ll tell you this for the sake of justice and in light of what we ve seen in the rollout of bob barr or bill barr s rollout of this mueller report he should recuse himself fourteen different matters are being investigated because the mueller in inquiry the mueller investigation and mister barr should not be a hindrance or raise any questions about whether this is going to be a an investigation and a prosecution with total integrity he has raised that question because of his characterization of mueller testimony margaret brennan so should he resign senator dick durbin well i i ve not called for resignation some of my colleagues have but recusal yes he should withdraw himself from any of the results that are leading could possibly lead to prosecutions because of the mueller investigation margaret brennan but aren t you concerned that this could just you know in some ways strengthen the president s decision to take this as a fighting matter make this a matter of partisan politics he clearly feels that the mueller report in his words exonerated him and that this is a fight he wants to have in the public space senator dick durbin well the mueller report expressly said it was neither exonerating him nor finding him guilty and that s what led to the conclusion by mister barr and mister rosenstein when it came to the obstruction of justice but as far as i am concerned there is work to be done on the mueller report in volume 1 to protect us from russian interference margaret brennan mm hm senator dick durbin the fact that the president of the united states had this conversation with vladimir putin within the last several days and didn t raise this issue after the mueller report what is he thinking we don t want to relive what happened in 2016 in the united states the russians ought to take their hands off of our election process margaret brennan senator thank you for joining us this morning senator dick durbin thanks margaret brennan we re joined we will be joined in a minute with congressman doug collins he s a top republican on the house judiciary committee so stay with us announcements margaret brennan we re back now with congressman doug collins he s the top republican on the house judiciary committee and joins us from warner robins in his home state of georgia good morning to you have you read the full 400 plus pages of the mueller report representative doug collins r georgia repdougcollins judiciary committee ranking member yeah good morning margaret yes i have and i ve also read what bill barr actually let us go back and he actually opened it up even more and i have went to the department of justice and read the less redacted report which means that of the whole report i have read all of it except a little less than 2 almost 1 of the report margaret brennan and that is what the democrats on your committee are calling for to be made public and in fact there is this threat of holding the attorney general in contempt if he doesn t share more information and underlying evidence do you expect him to be held in contempt representative doug collins it s really interesting margaret what s happened here i mean a little over sixteen days ago the chairman asked for this material he knows that he can t get it in a normal oversight proceeding but yet he s continuing on and now with pressure it seems like from his own side they are going to move to contempt over not producing the documents not showing up this is about the documents but if you go back to any other press before eric holder you know indistinct or others this is a longer process we re looking at sixteen days or a little over that to actually go to a contempt report on information that he knows he can t get my question to the chairman is why don t he go down why doesn t he read what s already available and then if he wants more then work with the department of justice to figure this out instead of having the public show of contempt and trying to discredit bill barr margaret brennan but democrats would say if they look at it and can t talk about it publicly then that s not fair but on top of this are you disappointed that the attorney general didn t come before your committee so you could have this conversation representative doug collins i m very disappointed that my chairman let that happen i wanted to actually talk to bill barr he had that opportunity and the day before he was in the senate and in the senate for over six hours and even did a double round of questions from democrats bill barr is not afraid of testifying bill barr is frankly has already said he will testify he just didn t want to be part of a show in which the democrats who have not brought up impeachment because they know they can t in fact i have a question for you margaret why would you impeach a president except for the what is found out because mueller said there was no collusion there was no obstruction i mean at this point i mean you he is we have the best economy we ve had in years 50 years of unemployment what were you impeaching him for margaret brennan we re going to talk about that representative doug collins and i think they want to make it look like impeachment margaret brennan we re going to talk about that more with you representative doug collins they want to make it look like impeachment margaret brennan we re going to have to take a quick commercial break and i want to talk to you more about that on the other side of it so please stay with us announcements margaret brennan be sure to join us next sunday we ll have an interview with former defense secretary robert gates that s next week on face the nation announcements margaret brennan some of our stations are leaving us now but we will be right back with more from republican congressman doug collins of georgia stay with us announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we want to continue our conversation with the top republican on the house judiciary committee georgia congressman doug collins congressman let s pick up where we left off in terms of the attorney general s testimony and the questions about the accuracy and truthfulness of his accounts to the public and congress we now know because it became public that the special counsel himself wrote a letter dated march 27th saying quote there is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation this threatens to undermine the central purpose for which the department appointed the special counsel to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations do you want the special counsel to appear and explain exactly what he was objecting to here representative doug collins we ve already asked for the special counsel to come margaret we did that over a month ago because we believe you know actually he is the fact witness here he was the one that conducted the hearing the investigation over two years spending mult you know well over thirty million dollars had all the assets in place with a grand jury and everything he s the one that is the central figure here but the one thing he said in that letter i think is worth margaret brennan but do you know what he was objected objecting to in that letter because you seem to be defending the attorney general representative doug collins well i think if you read the letter you see what he is concerned about he is concerned about the public perception a la what has happened through the press on how it was margaret brennan he didn t representative doug collins being port portrayed when you when you look at it margaret brennan the quote was as i read it representative doug collins what he is saying is a roll out margaret brennan there sir representative doug collins i read it and i read the letter as well in in totality in which he never disagreed with the conclusions of the attorney general he the conclusions were right and as the attorney general has said and also mister mueller said in that letter he was concerned about how it was put out he thought there might have been more put out at a certain time and it was the attorney general s job to actually make sure on how he was going to put that out for most of the folks in the public to see it that was i think believe the difference if you take a strict reading of the letter margaret brennan okay this is not the only hearing in fact there are many investigations there are many subpoenas that have been issued to the administration and and it seems that really you re seeing an a head to head clash between the congressional branch of government and the white house on many fronts is the refusal to comply worrisome to you that this is setting a precedent that undermines the oversight capabilities and charge of congress representative doug collins no it does not because it s happened with every administration in fact you know during the obama administration there was a lot of pushback there was always a slow walk of of information requested and sometimes a rescheduling of witnesses this is something that goes on between the administration and the congressional branch at all times now i am very much in favor of congressional oversight no matter who s in the white house and we have that proper role but there is a give and take between the two and i believe if especially in the regards of what we re seeing right now from our chairman if the chairman would actually engage and then find a way to find accommodations offer accommodations do the things that have been done in the past historically instead of rushing to do a contempt or rushing to a press release or rushing to make a an assumption then i think we could actually get to the oversight that we need to have on this margaret brennan congressman thank you for your time this morning we turn now to congressman eric swalwell who joins us this morning from mason city iowa where he is campaigning for the democratic presidential nomination welcome to face the nation congressman i know you are very representative eric swalwell d california judiciary committee ericswalwell good morning thank you margaret brennan you are very much involved as well with these hearings and these investigations so let s start there before we talk about your 2020 platform this hearing that we were just talking about that the attorney general did not show up for in the center of the room one of your democratic colleagues put a bucket of kentucky fried chicken and an actual chicken it obviously got a lot of press attention but is this really the tone that democrats want to set representative eric swalwell margaret the the tone we want to set is to highlight that america was attacked by the russians in 2016 the basic function of a government is to protect its people from a foreign attack and we needed the attorney general to come to congress a separate branch of power and tell us what the russians did who they worked with and what we could do next and he chose not to show up and there s going to be consequences for that and that was highlighted by another colleague of mine but the bigger issue here is he didn t show up margaret brennan he didn t show up they argue over these procedural arguments in regard to having other lawyers staff lawyers question alongside congressmen like yourself for you you think this is just a refusal to comply because of what representative eric swalwell you know margaret i don t care if we asked him to meet us here in mason city to tell us about what the russians did we are a separate branch of power and we have the right to ask so we can protect the american people and again i think this is more about not wanting to play an away game he had a home game with the senate with chairman graham he didn t do so well there it looks like he lied to congress and he didn t want to come the next day where he would face even more tough questions and again the bigger picture here if we are not able to protect our people from a foreign attack do we really actually have a government that can defend us margaret brennan you said you seem to agree with speaker pelosi that the attorney general lied specifically here what is it that you are taking issue with representative eric swalwell well first he prejudged the report before he even became attorney general i think he should have never been confirmed but once confirmed should have recused second he falsely accused the obama administration of spying on the trump campaign third he mischaracterized at the press conference and to congressman christ what bob mueller s view was on the report and finally and most importantly he missed the deadline last week to give us the full mueller report there have to be consequences for that for that reason i think you have to move this obstructor out of the way and i m recommending that we impeach attorney general barr so that we can get the information we need to protect our country margaret brennan did you read all the muller report representative eric swalwell yes there s an eighth of it that i m not allowed to read that i should be allowed to read margaret brennan well your leadership has the ability to read it but we know that there s a a reason for that objection but i want to get to the point of the the sweeping and systematic russian interference that is laid out in the report is substantiated but i know you have been talking because you are also in an intelligence role on that house committee saying a number of things that i want to quote back to you up until this point you said when you were asked in january do you believe the president right now has been an agent of the russians you said yes you were asked again at the end of that month by a questioner i m still not hearing any evidence that he s an agent of russia and you said yeah i think it s pretty clear it s almost hiding in plain sight the mueller report did not substantiate any conspiracy or coordination with russia do you regret prejudging the outcome representative eric swalwell no actually i i think i should have been louder considering the top of your show and you talked about the phone call between vladimir putin and the president at the president s request and and margaret the mueller team was not even allowed to look at the financial entanglements so i think it s really hard to draw a conclusion about conspiracy if they couldn t look at the president s tax returns they couldn t look at the president s loans from the margaret brennan you still believe he s an agent of russia representative eric swalwell i think he acts on their behalf i mean again i think ten years from now we are going to we are going to look at what happened this week and we are going to say are you kidding me after russia attacked the united states after the special counsel laid out two hundred pages of links between the russians and the trumps and how they tried to help him our president instead of calling the russian president saying don t do this again he talked to him for an hour and a half and said that the russian president was smiling i mean that is just nutty margaret that is putting the russian s interests ahead of the united states interests margaret brennan this along with other investigations the administration is pushing back on given the level of pushback do you think that this is stirring up enough frustration among democrats that they might change the judgment and go ahead with impeachment do you support impeachment of the president representative eric swalwell this president is taking us down that road it s it s maybe the only road to save the country but right now you know i ll i ll tell you with the attorney general i think we should move to impeach him first now i m i m a father of a a two year old and a six month old we re going through the terrible twos when my son misbehaves we take a toy away we know if we don t do that he is only going to get worse we have a really bad kid at the white house and unless we start showing that there are consequences for their actions he is only going to get worse and the next kid the next president is going to look at what we did now and judge their actions based on whether there were consequences or not so we have to start taking this president seriously and speaking the only lan language they know which is force and consequence margaret brennan so you re running for president day one more sanctions on russia representative eric swalwell yes but also day one is take the oath and go on a global affirmation tour to assure our nato allies and others that we are still with them and we need them to be a check on russia margaret brennan congressman more to talk about with you but we re going to have to leave it there representative eric swalwell i look forward to that margaret brennan pick that conversation up representative eric swalwell thank you margaret brennan another time and we will be back with our political panel announcements margaret brennan we turn now to our political panel byron york is the chief political correspondent for the

you i m excited thank you margaret brennan and hope to have you back at this table byron good to see you byron york washington examiner byronyork thank you margaret brennan the speaker of the house says that the attorney general lied under oath did he byron york i don t think so i think you could if if you look at the text of what the attorney general said in that exchange with representative crist you played it earlier if you look at the text bill barr gave an accurate and very lawyerly answer we ve seen that in congress before he was asked about robert mueller s team about a news story that appeared in the new york times right before about members of mueller s team had told associates that they were unhappy with the report specifically said they didn t know what mueller himself thought and bob bill barr said look i talked to robert mueller himself i don t know what his team said and that s why i answered the question it was not forthcoming it was narrow but it was not a lie margaret brennan but the letter from the special counsel that became public this week underscores it seems at least some level of disagreement between the special counsel and the attorney general in the public portrayal byron york i don t think margaret brennan how do we make sense of that byron york well i don t think there is any any doubt about that i think barr would say look there was intense public pressure when the when the report was sent over to the justice department on march twenty second i had to get something out so in a couple of days i summarized the report s principal conclusions i didn t characterize the whole report basically he said that mueller had found there was the evidence did not substantiate a charge of conspiracy and that he chose not to exonerate the president on obstruction and he included that in his letter so look i think a two page letter is not going to characterize a four hundred and forty eight page report shawna thomas vice news shawna but what this underscores and i think also what barr is hearing in the senate judiciary committee underscores is the need to hear from mueller there were so many questions that attorney general barr got that day and what i was struck by was they were asking him to characterize bob mueller s thoughts and there was even one time where he says i don t want to characterize bob s thoughts about a question from a democrat and i think if if bob mueller is willing to speak to the senate judiciary committee to a house committee that whole thing he can actually answer some of these questions that barr got and that can help figure out you know was it a lie was it not a lie all of those things actually sort of rest on bob mueller rachael bade washington post rachaelmbade there s also the saying that you know if you re explaining you re losing so maybe you know barr can go out there and try to explain well i thought the question was this or that but democrats feel they definitely have enough in terms of saying he lied and it s not just that comment you know he has now ignored two subpoenas from the house democrats he did not show up at a hearing that he was supposed to attend last week and they have a whole list of grievances with him and so we re going to see them it s interesting with your interview with swalwell he talked about impeaching barr you know the judiciary committee michael crowley question about impeaching the president margaret brennan yeah rachael bade right right well there s this debate going on about do we just hold barr in contempt of congress because they are going to do that it s a matter of when not if but you know if they impeach barr does that make it harder for them to one day impeach the president and there was a private conversation with some judiciary democrats last week where they actually debated that very thing can they impeach both or if they re going to impeach anyone they would want to impeach the president not barr so it s sort of an interesting how they handle that will be interesting to watch margaret brennan any attempt to impeach is dead on arrival in the republican controlled senate so what does this accomplish to people at home it just sounds like more fighting in washington rachael bade yeah so i think with the mueller report the democrats had the house democrats had a call right after the mueller report came out and the message was still the same do not talk about impeachment well let s talk about investigating the president we ll keep investigating him and see where it leads but there was a turning point i feel like last week with a lot of democrats when the president came out and said i am going to ignore all the subpoenas that infuriated a whole bunch of democratic investigators in the house and that more than the mueller report i would say has made more people start talking about impeachment now pelosi is still pushing back on that but she is feeling a lot of heat from her members right now which i think is why you see her rhetoric become sharper and sharper accusing the president being worse than nixon for instance margaret brennan mm hm rachael bade but you know she s going to have to find a way to sort of calm the caucus down if she doesn t want to do impeachment because a lot more democrats are talking about it margaret brennan michael is it a fair question and itself a question i put to secretary of state i ll say that but is it a fair question to ask why the president didn t bring this up with vladimir putin given that it has been discussed they have confronted him in some way through other channels does in the wake of the mueller report should we have expected the president to have pushed vladimir putin michael crowley well i wouldn t have expected it because at this point we know that the president just doesn t want to talk about this he doesn t want to prioritize it in his relationship with putin and i i find it although you know strange on some level also utterly unsurprising and what s more striking to me is in general the president s tone toward putin is just completely unchanged so in other words it s not that particular point about election interference and is he still pushing that it s that he s still talking about trying to have a a good relationship with russia speaking in generally positive terms about putin kind of describing this you know this kind of bon ami that they have between each other this light rapport joking around putin was smiling through the telephone that kind of strange formulation the president used and you know i do wonder if there is some part of trump that now feels that all the russia stuff is behind us and i can get back to work on this relationship with putin now congress has really tied his hands made it difficult for him to change u s policy there s still a lot trump can do in terms of building relations with putin giving putin more freedom around the world to act his comments about venezuela although he said one thing verbally and another thing on twitter as mike pompeo pointed out he can still make it easier for putin to operate in venezuela and elsewhere places like syria and the middle east if he wants to so i would say beyond that particular question which is very important i am watching to see whether trump now feels like he can resume this effort to develop some kind of relationship and the last thing i ll say margaret very quickly is pompeo meeting with the russian foreign minister to tee up a potential trump putin meeting margaret brennan right michael crowley at the g20 summit in japan this summer i think that s very possible byron york can i say one thing on this trump margaret brennan we re going to have to take a break and then finish i ll give you that thought on the other side of it so stay with us we ll be back in a moment announcements margaret brennan we re back now with our political panel byron start with you i cut you off before the break byron york well the margaret brennan we were talking about russia and the president s lack of confrontation with putin byron york yeah i mean the trump putin show is a recurring show trump has consistently refused to publicly condemn putin it just happens over and over and over i think he makes a mistake every time he does that but with trump as with everything else there are always two levels going on there s what the president says publicly and what the administration is doing i was at a hoover institution event a few days ago stanford michael mcfaul who was the obama administration s ambassador to russia no fan of trump at all said i don t see a big difference between the late obama years and the early trump years i see more continuity along the three big dimensions strengthening nato punishing russia for belligerent behavior and strengthening ukraine so there is always a two level thing going on and you do have to remember what the president s administration is doing against russia in addition to what he is saying shawna thomas but it also puts his administration in a weird position i mean one of the things about secretary pompeo s interview with you is he had to find himself either ignoring or explaining away the president of the united states and you re right we see this happen over and over again and it s worth paying attention to what the administration continues to do but what does that say to our friends our allies the people who don t like us around the world when the president continues to say one thing but secretary pompeo and everyone else say something else it is just confusing and it it isn t it isn t clear and the president s words do matter in foreign affairs michael crowley and just one sentence on this now that the mueller report is behind us and mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy at least to collude with russia will the president now feel more freedom to try to change u s policy so that is behind us what you just described and i am just waiting to see what comes next we may be in a different environment now margaret brennan and i m interested in what you said about potential meetings since the president has floated this idea of a nuclear deal with russia and with china so more to come on that front well let s turn back here to home rachael in an interview with the new york times speaker pelosi said the best plan to defeat president trump not to impeach him but is to win at the ballot box in 2020 but she said own the center left own the mainstream is that a message being heard rachael bade yeah it s really interesting to see pelosi you know for for years we saw republicans sort of paint her as this san francisco liberal you know this bogeyman and she more than any other leader in the democratic party is really taking a pragmatic approach to impeachment to 2020 she has pretty much put any notion of putting medicare for all on the house floor to the side they re having hearings on that but she s not talking about it she says calm down on impeachment and this just shows the sort of cautious approach that she is taking when it comes to keeping her own majority and this fear that she has that you know her caucus could potentially overreach or being accused of overreaching when it comes to these investigations and i it could have a blowback not only on the house but you know potentially giving trump a second term which is the last thing that she wants i i also think it s interesting to look at the republicans side too because you know you asked collins about if he had any concerns about precedent here margaret brennan mm hm rachael bade and about trump stonewalling all these investigations you know i covered his response was something along the lines of oh every administration does this and it is true there s always a tug of war between you know the house and and the white house but i i covered the irs scandal and the benghazi investigation and the white house the obama white house that hated those investigations they gave over a ton of information they let people do depositions and so it s really interesting to see that republicans don t have any concerns about precedent here because they re actually going to be undercutting potentially themselves in the future when there is a democrat in the white house and they regain control of the house margaret brennan byron why isn t there more concern about that byron york you know i am actually a little mystified at pelosi s behavior she has been putting the brakes on this a lot on on on impeachment talks she knows a lot of her base wants it and a lot of senior democrats like pelosi believe that impeaching bill clinton was political suicide margaret brennan right byron york for republicans back in 1998 and in fact in 1998 republicans thought they were going to pick up seats in the house with impeachment and they didn t they actually lost a few seats but they won control of the house and after impeaching clinton they won control of the house in 98 2000 2002 and 2004 and when they lost in 2006 it had nothing to do with bill clinton and in addition they won the white house in 2000 and 2004 impeachment was not political suicide for republicans and i think actually nancy pelosi has a difficult case to make to her base on that shawna thomas but nancy pelosi also says and and i think this came up in that phone call that they had right after the mueller report came out but all the democrats were scattered throughout the country because of the recess that some of the things we remember from from the nixon situation the hearings john dean talking all that stuff weren t impeachment hearings they were hearings about the investigation and they were hearings about what was going on margaret brennan mm hm shawna thomas and that her point was we can get our version of the mueller report out into the world because we know lots of people aren t going to actually read it we can do that through committee hearings we can do that through hearings without quite going as far as impeachment when we know we are going to lose that argument in the se in the senate so i think what she s focused on is like how what is the pr way to do this like can we get all this can we get mueller out in front of it margaret brennan mm hm shawna thomas can we do all that and not have to call it impeachment rachael bade the problem there though is that you know with the president doing the stonewalling of congress the democrats that plan is going up in smoke right now i mean they wanted to put don mcgahn shawna thomas not if bob mueller rachael bade well bob mueller is one thing and it sounds like he is going to appear before the house at some point here in the next couple of weeks but don mcgahn for instance was a key witness in the mueller investigation and specifically on questions of obstruction of justice shawna thomas right rachael bade but the white house is saying they re not going to let him appear so that whole plan of investigating and laying it out for the public it s sort of shot right now margaret brennan well we will see the special counsel does testify it will be much watched must watch television we will be
