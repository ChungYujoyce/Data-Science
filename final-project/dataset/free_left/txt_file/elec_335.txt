contract this week for another four years which will enable him to blow cigar smoke up his followers fossilized backsides for the duration of hillary clinton s first presidential term as eric boehlert reports and observes in media matters the rollout for rush s contract renewal is rather more muted this time around in 2008 the news of limbaugh s 400 million dollar eight year contract renewal was treated like a coronation ceremony with all the royal trumpets blaring this time barely a bird chirp twas to be expected yes i said twas dammit as boehlert notes the business model for am talk radio is broken the angry white male audience is dying on the shriveled vine and i would add the trump ascendancy has scrambled the binary heroic patriotic religious conservative cowardly treasonous godless liberal stereotype that formed the theater platform of talk radio s and fox news s punch and judy show the decline of limbaugh s radio reign was inevitable it s impressive that it lasted this long but it was hastened by a sharp downward break from which he never recovered a self inflicted blow produced in a petty fit of pique an unforced error that acquired major magnitude and all because rush was too arrogant to retreat a step or two and apologize and this week donald trump whom rush is in the tank for one old bro supporting another made the same mistake drilling a hole in the bottom of his dinghy glub glub it was in case you need a refresher course rush limbaugh s scurrilous attack on sandra fluke that led to his irreversible unraveling in 2012 fluke then a law student at georgetown university testified before a congressional oversight and reform committee on the need for contraception coverage in the university s health plan from wikipedia she stated that 40 of georgetown law school s female population suffered financial hardship as a result of birth control not being covered by the student health insurance plan and that the lack of contraception coverage in the university insurance plans would induce many low income students to go without contraceptives she then shared the stories of friends affected by such policies citing a friend with polycystic ovary syndrome this was not a major prime time testimony and would have receded into the archives of c span had not limbaugh or his crack staff swooped down upon it with talons flexed limbaugh took to the airwaves on leap day february 29 and bombasted what does it say about the college co ed susan fluke sic who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex what does that make her it makes her a slut right it makes her a prostitute she wants to be paid to have sex she s having so much sex she can t afford the contraception she wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex what does that make us we re the pimps interruption the johns we would be the johns no we re not the johns interruption yeah that s right pimp s not the right word o k so she s not a slut she s round heeled i take it back so ms fluke and the rest of you feminazis here s the deal if we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex we want something for it and i ll tell you what it is we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch and limbaugh didn t let up for days after ignoring fluke s emphasis on women s health as a reason for coverage just as concern for women s health is negated in all of the republican bills to restrict abortion to portray her and the other women at georgetown as a bunch of mattress hoppers who insisted that the government pay for their frolics now here s the thing limbaugh had spewed things just as ugly or even uglier in the past at a wide pageant of liberal feminist minority targets this was the man who made fun of chelsea clinton s looks when she was 12 years old then issued a mock apology his supremacy on the am dial remained unshaken he had gotten away just about everything over the length of his huckstering career and was like fox news s roger ailes a man whom elected republicans were afraid to cross the rest of the public was irrelevant to his carnival franchise as long as his sponsor and fan base held steady video could donald trump pass a sanity test but this was different this controversy resonated and gathered force sandra fluke was a civilian so was chelsea but right wing loathing of the clintons was so pervasive that the daughter was just considered collateral damage she conducted herself with dignity and assurance even after the ad hominem barrage began refusing to be rattled and limbaugh so used to getting his way didn t have brains or grace enough to let up he kept punching down in his merry nasty manner conservative david frum described it as a brutally sexualized accusation against a specific person prolonged over three days relenting only when pushback and blowback from advertisers and affiliates compelled him to issue an apology an apology that wasn t as transparently phony as the one he made after the chelsea clinton slur but nevertheless weasel worded with insincerity limbaugh s reputation his hold on the the zeitgeist was never the same he would never be the big bopper again he still makes waves but they don t carry the same high crest this cautionary tale of hubris has now been reenacted on a bigger stage with bigger stakes demonstrating yet again george santayana s adage that those who do not learn from the past will louse up even worse the next time santayana may have phrased it a bit differently the khans are donald trump s sandra fluke after khizr and ghazala khan the parents of a captain killed in iraq in 2004 made their powerful emotional appearance at the democratic convention with khizr khan issuing the rebuke of rebukes by presenting his pocket constitution and offering to lend it to trump so that he could acquaint himself with our founding document trump could have respectfully acknowledged their loss honored their son s sacrifice and risen above it after all fox news didn t even carry the khans live ensuring that most of trump s legions would have remained lulled in their usual state of unknowing he didn t have to make an issue of them just as limbaugh didn t need to single out fluke but elegant deflection and rising about are not what a limbaugh or trump do they descend below it whatever it may happen to be scuba diving in the fever swamp that has become republican conservatism s nature preserve like rush with fluke trump didn t ease up acting as if he were the injured party going after the khans with kamikaze zeal while they like fluke stayed composed resolved unruffled portraits of fortitude and integrity that revealed trump as the all thumbs smear artist and opportunist that he is unlike rush trump has not apologized has not even made a pro forma mea culpa that might have stopped the hemorrhaging and permitted him to pivot into pretending to be an actual human being capable of self governance but trump has never apologized it s not in his executive orange gorilla nature he considers it a sign of weakness and beta manhood trump s campaign was destined for crack up his incontinence and impulsiveness guaranteed it but no one could have foreseen that the khans would be the tipping point just as no one could have scripted a fluke scenario that would unwind el rushbo the lesson is that we often believe that striding dominant big shots on the political and cultural landscape are brought down by titanic forces history as a clash of thunderclouds but they re often undone by seemingly minor players who emerge from the wings previous unknowns whose moment in the spotlight starts a blaze or by former cast members who retake the stage with a vengeance could anyone have predicted that roger ailes who presided over fox news for decades and played kingmaker for the republican party would be toppled by a lawsuit for sexual harassment lodged by former anchorwoman gretchen carlson it was a flaming arrow that seemed to come out of nowhere and now bluebeard s castle is laid bare for all to see no one is as invincible as he and it s usually he seems it is probably
