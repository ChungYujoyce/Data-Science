 2016 the texas senator telegraphs how he plans to win the gop nomination by alex isenstadt 04 04 2015 12 52 pm edt m scott mahaskey politico ted cruz s aggressive pursuit of the evangelical vote began with a deliberate choice of venue for his presidential announcement two weeks ago liberty university which bills itself as the largest christian university in the world the texas republican senator s strategic play for christian conservatives comes into even sharper focus this weekend as he rolls out the first television ad of the 2016 race titled blessing the commercial is aimed directly at evangelical and social conservative voters in early voting states timed for easter weekend and slated to air during popular christian themed programming advertisement it s an exercise in narrowcasting that telegraphs exactly how cruz intends to win the gop nomination against better funded and better known rivals his advisers say the liberty university backdrop the tv ads and even his recent two day tour of iowa are all part of a detailed blueprint designed to tap into the power of two distinct gop wings evangelicals and the tea party movement also on politico alex isenstadt with establishment voters breaking toward former florida gov jeb bush florida sen marco rubio and wisconsin gov scott walker and libertarian oriented conservatives likely to go for kentucky sen rand paul the cruz team believes the texas republican must flat out win the tea party set and finish either first or second among christian conservatives a bloc that dominates the gop base in iowa and south carolina i don t think he could have had a better strategy all the way from his launch to his swing through iowa said bob vander plaats an influential social conservative leader in iowa he s had a strong announcement and he s going to be a strong candidate he could face competition however from several proven vote getters among social conservatives former arkansas gov mike huckabee and former pennsylvania sen rick santorum the past two winners of the iowa gop caucuses or from louisiana gov bobby jindal it s a crowded field said tony perkins president of the family research council a prominent washington d c based conservative group there are several candidates who will be competing for the same base of support also on politico alex isenstadt a 44 year old born again baptist and the son of a preacher cruz told advisers early on of his intent to pursue the evangelical vote as part of a plan to break through in a crowded field in february cruz gave the green light to begin planning for the official announcement after considering several possible venues the cruz team settled on the lynchburg virginia university founded in 1971 by the late rev jerry falwell the location was an unorthodox choice since most presidential candidates typically hold their announcement events in their home states or early voting states but the campus is rich with religious symbolism and it gave cruz a direct pipeline to the voters he wanted to reach the culture of the cruz campaign from the candidate to the grass roots activists is to do things differently said jason miller a cruz adviser even before the formal rollout the senator and his wife heidi had been courting influential social conservatives such as vander plaats the president and ceo of iowa s family leader in 2012 vander plaats endorsed santorum but he hasn t yet decided who to back in 2016 cruz has been very serious about reaching out vander plaats said also on politico hillary flynn cruz returned to iowa this week for a two day swing where he came out in defense of indiana s controversial religious freedom law highlighted his opposition to same sex marriage and argued that he would be the republican candidate best positioned to turn out christians who hadn t voted in the past two presidential elections the texas senator also managed to capture front page stories in two of iowa s largest daily newspapers given the crowds he drew this week it s the most energy i ve ever seen for a candidate this early in the process said steve deace a socially conservative radio show host in the state yet it s the ads this weekend that might deliver the biggest burst of attention the actual amount of the buy 34 000 is a pittance by political standards but by being first out of the gate with a televised spot cruz has generated a national splash more important he ll be reaching his target audience at an especially opportune time the christian holy days of easter weekend the 30 second blessing spot isn t subtle it features the senator talking about the transformative love of jesus christ and includes images of his family and others in prayer god s blessing has been on america from the very beginning of this nation he says in the ad this is our fight and that is why i m running for president of the united states a screenshot of ted cruz for president s video release blessing politico the ads aired
