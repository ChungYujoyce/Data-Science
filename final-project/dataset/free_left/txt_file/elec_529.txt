friday the governors of new york and kentucky signed executive orders expanding vote by mail access new york and kentucky announced new programs on friday aimed at improving access to mail in ballots as both states work to find ways to limit interaction at the polls during upcoming elections amid the covid 19 pandemic on friday new york gov andrew cuomo and kentucky gov andy beshear both signed executive orders mandating applications for absentee ballots be sent to all of their states voters upon returning the applications to state officials voters will receive ballots i am issuing an executive order to ensure every new york voter automatically receives a postage paid application for an absentee ballot because no new yorker should have to choose between their health and their right to vote cuomo said in a statement kentucky s plan does not include prepaid postage but does require the state to create a website so voters can request ballots online it also waives the requirement for absentee voters to notarize their ballot applications while there will be significant education and work required we are committed to making sure this election will be held in a safe manner while we are in this worldwide health pandemic beshear said in a statement both kentucky s and new york s primary elections have been postponed to june 23 because of the coronavirus outbreak new york s was originally scheduled for april 28 and kentucky s for may 19 new york has become the epicenter of the outbreak with at least 271 000 confirmed covid 19 cases as of april 25 and more than 16 000 deaths kentucky has nearly 3 800 cases with 200 deaths the push for increased absentee voting in both states comes weeks after a primary election in wisconsin on april 7 illustrated the risk of forcing people to stand in long lines during an infectious disease outbreak that election led to at least 19 wisconsin voters being diagnosed with covid 19 hoping to avoid similar scenarios other states like ohio have begun making voting an entirely mail in process in some states that have not taken that step certain specific jurisdictions such as florida s miami dade broward and palm beach counties the last of which being where president donald trump is registered to vote have also established their own plans to mail out absentee ballot request forms to all voters but such measures have faced political pushback with many republicans including trump arguing that mail in voting carries with it a risk of fraud voting experts have disputed these claims finding voter fraud to be incredibly rare and noting that when it does happen it does not privilege one party over another nationally some lawmakers are working to expand mail in voting for the long term sens ron wyden d or and amy klobuchar d mn introduced an updated bill that would expand early and absentee voting and mandate voting contingency plans for future emergencies like coronavirus as vox s ella nilsen has reported 34 states allow all voters to vote by mail the remaining 16 states require applicants to provide an excuse such as serving in the military or living abroad to request a mail in ballot new york has such a requirement which is functionally waived under cuomo s executive order it remains to be seen how the coronavirus will affect november s general election and whether efforts to broaden the availability of vote by mail will come to fruition by then at a hearing on the subject on wednesday elections experts warned there may not be enough time to prepare for a nationwide mail in election in november states may not have the time or resources to acquire the envelopes ballots and scanning machines needed washington state secretary of state kim wyman told wednesday s panel with the impacts of covid 19 i am very concerned that with only six months really to implement vote by mail or absentee voting in a jurisdiction that it s going to be a heavy lift she said and she added that poorly implemented absentee voting structures could undermine faith in the election s result on the state level ohio has seen the difficulties wyman outlined in march its primary was postponed at the last minute causing confusion the state decided to move to an entirely mail in process now some voters may not receive ballots in time to vote ohio s secretary of state has said it s a reminder for increasingly cash strapped states and for federal lawmakers hoping to create national vote by mail programs that to ensure a smooth transition to mass mail in voting this fall action must be taken now support vox s
