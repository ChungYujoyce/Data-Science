minister narendra modi the boisterous scene featured soldiers on camels a mix of songs from bollywood hits and the trump campaign rally playlist including an elton john hit that seemed to puzzle most of the crowd mr trump basked in the raucous reception that has eluded him on many foreign trips some of which have featured massive protests and icy handshakes from world leaders in india he instead received a warm embrace at the airport literally from the ideologically aligned and hugger modi the sun baked city of ahmedabad bustled as mr trump arrived as the streets teemed with people eager to catch a glimpse of the american president newly cleaned roads and planted flowers dotted the roads amid hundreds of billboards featuring the president and first lady thousands lined his motorcade

chanted modi the stadium was packed with revelers many of whom sported trump and modi masks as they sat in 80 degree temperatures the namaste trump rally was in a way the back half of home and home

stand in contrast to those of their rivals in the opposing party slogging through diners in early voting states and clashing in debate this trip in particular reflects a trump campaign strategy to showcase him in his presidential role during short carefully managed trips that provide counter programming to the democrats primary contest and produce the kinds of visuals his campaign can use in future ads his aides also believe the visit could help the president woo tens of thousands of indian american voters before the november election the visit also comes at a crucial moment for modi a fellow populist who has provided over a steep economic downturn and unfulfilled campaign promises about job creation india is also seen as an important counter to china with which it shares a border the president will conclude his whirlwind visit to india tuesday with a day in the capital complete with a gala dinner meetings with modi over stalled trade talks between the two nations the two countries are closely allied in part to act as a bulwark against the rising influence of nearby china but trade tensions between the two countries have escalated since the trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium from india india responded with higher penalties on agricultural goods and restrictions on u s medical devices the u s retaliated by removing india from a decades old preferential trade program perhaps alluding to tough negotiations over trade mr trump lightheartedly told the rally crowd everybody loves him but i will tell you this he s very tough eyes will also be on whether mr trump weighs on in the protests enveloping india over its citizenship amendment act it provides a fast track to naturalization for some migrants who entered the country illegally while fleeing religious persecution but excludes muslims raising fears that the country is moving toward a religious citizenship test passage has prompted large scale protests and a violent crackdown

the president will tell modi the world is looking to india to continue to uphold its democratic traditions and respect religious minorities indian police used tear gas and smoke grenades to disperse a
