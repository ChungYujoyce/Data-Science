minors dependents persons with disabilities or other vulnerable persons is allowed while virginia s order says people can leave their homes to tak e care of other individuals while the orders do not explicitly state that individuals who work in other people s homes such as housekeepers and gardeners can still travel officials in maryland and the district confirmed to the washington post that such workers are permitted to do so it is also worth noting that all three orders allow travel that is required by law enforcement including for example court ordered visitation rights patient tracker the latest on coronavirus patients in the region hogan said residents should not travel out of state unless absolutely necessary though this is not an explicit part of his ban his spokesman michael ricci later clarified that residents can travel within the national capital region but should only do so under the provisions laid out in the order those who regularly travel from maryland to the district or an adjacent state for work caretaking or other essential tasks do not need to quarantine upon returning but those coming home from a more extensive trip to another state particularly a place like new york where the outbreak is widespread should quarantine for 14 days virginia also has not banned interstate travel but northam too discouraged such trips and said those who leave the state particularly to visit areas where there is severe community spread should self quarantine for 14days the answer varies location to location but many cemeteries are closed or restricted at this time

visits or walking the grounds it s best to call a cemetery before heading there to make sure their gates are still open each order has its own quirks in virginia northam said colleges and universities are prohibited from holding in person classes a ruling that could be aimed at liberty university which welcomed students back to campus after spring break but has pledged to hold most classes online
