advertisement by jonathan martin may 5 2015 mike huckabee the former governor of arkansas joined the race for the republican nomination for president on tuesday here is a look at what he will need to do to win related article mr huckabee will begin the 2016 race with the same voter base that propelled him to a win in the iowa caucuses in 2008 christian conservatives but mr huckabee a former baptist pastor will have considerable competition for such voters in this year s nomination contest that is part of the reason he is shifting his message to explicitly appeal to older working class conservatives as he does in this video in which he vows to protect social security and medicare given his past success in iowa and the strong base of evangelical voters there a strong showing in the state is crucial for mr huckabee if he can win the caucuses or come in a close second he has an opportunity to become the leading social conservative in the race the question would then be whether he tries to compete in new hampshire a more secular state or heads straight to south carolina where a weaker than expected performance in 2008 effectively ended his candidacy but if he is outdone in iowa by one or more of the younger conservatives in the race he will have a difficult time as the race goes on mr huckabee said recently that there was a movement on the left to criminalize christianity the sort of rhetoric meant to appeal to his fellow evangelicals the convergence of what proponents call religious liberty laws and the supreme court decision on same sex marriage this summer could offer the former governor a chance to reconnect with his christian conservative base he also intends to appeal to those voters and a wider array of hawkish republicans by reaffirming his support for israel mr huckabee opposes a two state solution between the israelis and the palestinians and talking tough against islamic extremism what could cause the most waves in the primaries is opposition to the kind of changes in social security and medicare that are popular with many conservative elites mr huckabee both relishes and resents being underestimated it is part of his populist persona but he has long seethed at the lack of respect that he think he is accorded within the party should he come out atop a potentially crowded field in iowa he would prove those doubters wrong success in the caucuses followed by a win in south carolina could make him a formidable candidate on march 1 when many evangelical heavy southern states plan to hold primaries if he can put together a coalition of evangelicals and blue collar conservatives while establishment aligned republicans remain divided mr huckabee could again surprise success from 2008 will not necessarily translate with conservatives likely to have an array of options why would they reach to the past mr huckabee still enjoys solid support according to early polls but that may be a product of his being familiar from his presence on fox news the worst case scenario for mr huckabee is that conservative voters who like him as a media personality have moved on to other candidates advertisement
