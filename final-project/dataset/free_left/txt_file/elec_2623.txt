with breanne deppisch the big idea las vegas katy perry s glamour tom steyer s money univision s megaphone and organized labor s muscle along with a late assist from barack obama each helped lubricate harry reid s well oiled political machine over the past 48 hours the media tends to focus on the lack of enthusiasm for hillary clinton relative to president obama which is real but a few thousand more ballots were cast in nevada on saturday during the first day of early voting than during the kickoff day four years ago when there was a similar flurry of activity to propel democrats to the polls and that was before air force one touched down yesterday afternoon it is a testament to the power of the organization that reid the retiring senate minority leader has built over three decades and thathe is now using to get clinton and his hand picked successor catherine cortez masto across the finish line as much as 60 percent of the vote will be cast before nov 8 in the silver state democrats for several cycles have dominated early voting running up the score so that republicans struggle to overcome it on election day since handily winning the republican caucuses here in february donald trump has been stronger in nevada than in most other battlegrounds the race remains tight here a function of the relatively high percentage of low income whites without college degrees let s face it nevada is always close obama who carried the state twice said during a rally at a high school in north las vegas nevada always makes you a little nervous because you don t know what s going to happen but that s what makes it exciting the bulk of nevada s democratic voters are concentrated in clark county which includes vegas during a two week window the race is on to lock in clinton s narrow advantage in the polls by getting as many of her supporters as possible to one of 97 early voting sites the reid machine fully activated is a sight to behold unions play a huge role reid kicked off his saturday with a 9 a m speech at the iron workers union in the suburb of henderson cortez masto joined him then she went to the carpenters union training center at 10 15 a m and the service employees international union s office on sunset boulevard a little after noon a taco truck parked out front served dual purposes the promise of free lunch built a crowd while trolling the trump surrogate who warned during a recent cable interview that a clinton victory would mean a taco truck on every corner a shuttle bus ferried people to the nearest polling location a few hours later pop star katy perry drew a diverse young crowd of 500 to the courtyard in front of the student union at the university of nevada atlas vegas the 31 year old didn t sing but she did get right to the point perry talked about how she likes to procrastinate as much as anyone else but that s not okay when it comes to early voting let s cut the crap we ve all got excuses don t put it off she then lamented thatvotes in nevada matter more than hers does in california i m not just here to see a cirque show she said you guys are important perry wore a blue leather dress red heels and a white t shirt that said nasty woman which is what trump called clinton during their debate right here on the campus of unlv last wednesday night as she spoke about how she s been campaigning for the democratic nominee since the cornfields of iowa a guy in the audience yelled that clinton should appoint her to be an ambassador not yet she replied i ve got to put out a record or four then perry introduced cortez masto it s important to not just vote for president the singer concluded we ve got a crew we ve got a clique we all run together we need to vote for the right senators too she announced at the end of her speech that she would take sophomore kendra patterson president of the campus black student organization to vote for the first time perry and her entourage piled into three black escalades and headed for the nearest polling place nextgen the climate change focused super pac bankrolled by liberal billionaire tom steyer had a dozen volunteers working the perry rally in orange t shirts they handed out water bottles and had a coach bus in front of the student union to shuttle anyone who wanted a ride to go vote early voting also gives democrats more opportunities to turn out latinos who have never voted before mi familia vota and voto latino co hosted a four hour block party saturday afternoon in the parking lot of a mall that has an early voting site there was live spanish music and all you can eat plates of free tacos from a popular local eatery there were two bouncy houses face painting and popcorn for the kids steyer s group helped pay for the event and univision radio a co sponsor promoted it on the air staffers directed attendees to go inside the mall to vote at around 6 p m saturday there were about 100 people in line for tacos and another 50 voting inside they waited in a line between a candy store and a cosmetics shop the clinton team is investing heavily in door to door canvassing to run up herearly vote numbers pilar grullon a field organizer for the nevada democratic party led a training session for 40 volunteers before perry arrived at unlv the native of the dominican republic said her mom worked two jobs to make ends meet but that her family still relied on public assistance including food stamps and medicaid to get by she recently became the first in her family to graduate from college all of those services that my family depended on are at risk in this election she said grullon spent 15 minutes giving volunteers tips on how to give a little extra push to registered democrats who might be reluctant to vote early everyone got commit cards to get people to write down exactly when and where they will vote and they got leaflets with the number for a hotline that clinton supporters can call to get a free ride to the polls you walk through and you make a plan with the voter at every door grullon said she encouraged volunteers to be forceful if a mom tells you her daughter is voting for hillary don t take her word for it note that and someone else will come back to find her be scrappy if there s a gate wait for someone to come to the gate if they speak spanish and you can t mark it down and someone else will go don t engage anyone who wants to talk smack about our candidates it is a waste of your time for good measure she even told everyone to smile part of the democratic strategy is to unashamedly pester people until they vote the campaigns find out who voted at the end of each day so they can stop targeting potential supporters once they havecast a ballot during the training session grullon urged her door knockers to tell people that they won t get bothered once they ve voted if you don t want somebody to knock on your door or call you anymore go vote she said and it will stop seriously this turns out to be a powerful incentive in a state where almost every commercial is about the election beatriz martinez 27 voted saturday inside a temporary trailer that has been set up in a target parking lot in las vegas asked why she went on the first day she said we got tons of texts saying early voting started this morning from the clinton campaign people from the climate change people from the party people she and her boyfriend a law student supported bernie sanders in the caucuses but rallied behind clinton after she wrapped up the nomination martinez also brought her dad with her to vote the 58 year old was born in mexico and speaks spanish he became a u s citizen more than a decade ago but had never voted before saturday the chance to vote against trump changed that he was very excited at the end of saturday democratic staffers celebrated news that 39 148 people had voted in clark county compared to 33 187 in 2012 of those 55 percent were registered democrats and 27 percent were registered republicans hitting the churches the work continued early sunday ruben kihuen a state senator challenging republican rep cresent hardy arrived at a baptist church just before 8 a m to warn that all the progress of the obama years could unravel if democrats do not win i was trying to convey the sense of urgency of getting to the polls he said in an interview after the service as he headed to a second church to deliver the same closing argument this election could be won during early voting if you run a strong campaign five hours later obama arrived in kihuen s congressional district for a rally aimed primarily at turning out african americans the president took the stage at cheyenne high school after boyz ii men performed the end of the road speaking in front of a giant sign that said vote early obama told an audience of 5 100 you ve got the winning hand you ve got blackjack but you ve got to make sure to turn over the card by voting this game does not start on november 8th the game ends on november 8th bringing back a fictional character whom he invoked often in campaigns past obamaadded with a hint of nostalgia i need you to call up cousin pookyand say pooky it s time to vote i need you to go call jesse and say jesse come on don t be sitting on the couch it s time to vote everybody has got to vote early that s how we won in 08 that s how we won in 2012 that s how we re going to win in 2016 the republican effort to push early voting pales in comparison and it certainly lacks the star power the rnc led victory program has 66 staffers spread across eight offices in nevada more than in 2012 the state democratic party declined to provide a staff count but said it has 17 field offices but even gop operatives marvel at the reid machine they are trying to play catch up but they acknowledge that their only hope to carry nevada is to win big among those who vote on election day starting this weekend the gop s field staff pivoted to knocking on the doors of registered republicans who are probably with trump but do not routinely vote rep mark amodei chairman of trump s campaign in nevada hosted a modest early vote kickoff event at the rnc s reno office on saturday morning republican senate candidate joe heck meanwhile campaigned with ted cruz in reno and elko less populated but redder areas of the state heck a congressman from vegas alienated many trump supporters by rescinding his support so he campaigned with the texas senator in an effort to shore up his conservative base many republicans familiar with nevada worry about this nightmare scenario if trump loses decisively along the eastern seaboard new hampshire virginia north carolina and or florida the networks could declare that clinton is the president elect before polls even close in nevada many core gop voters typically cast their ballots while commuting home from work what if a couple percent of them decide that the election is over and it s not worth waiting in line because republicans are so reliant on these voters and democrats will have so many votes locked in from early voting it could lead to a down ticket bloodbath at the very least it could tip a close senate race

that s as far as it got neither approved nor rejected the plan was left in a state of ambiguity that u s officials said reflects growing administration skepticism about escalating a covert cia program

ramped up her appeals to rich donors and shrugged off restrictions that president obama had imposed on his fundraising team even as her advisers fretted about the perception that she was too cozy with wealthy interests they agreed to let lobbyists bundle checks for her campaign including those representing some foreign governments top aides wooed major donors for super pacs taking advantage of the leeway that campaigns have to legally collaborate with the groups on fundraising an analysis by the post found that more than a fifth of the 1 billion donated to help her bid was given by just 100

contentious debate over social issues including the state s transgender bathroom law the only problem trump keeps coming to town and telling voters how terrible the economy is it s the most glaring example this year of the disconnect between trump s apocalyptic rhetoric and the message of achievement that many republican incumbents are trying to use to win reelection it has been known to happen before there was reportedly friction between affable mitt romney s campaign and some recovery touting gop governors in 2012 but the gap between mccrory s carolina comeback theme and trump s doom and
