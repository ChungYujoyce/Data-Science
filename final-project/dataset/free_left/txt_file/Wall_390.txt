advertisement supported by the justice department asked the justices to temporarily halt a lower court order arguing that the executive branch would suffer irreparable harm if the evidence is disclosed by charlie savage washington the trump administration asked the supreme court on thursday to block congress from seeing grand jury secrets gathered in the russia investigation by the special counsel robert s mueller iii saying the executive branch would suffer irreparable harm if lawmakers see the evidence in a 35 page filing noel j francisco the solicitor general asked the justices to halt an order by a federal appeals court that imposed a may 11 deadline on the justice department to turn over the evidence to the house judiciary committee he said the justice department should first get a chance to fully litigate an appeal of the ruling before the supreme court the government will suffer irreparable harm absent a stay once the government discloses the secret grand jury records their secrecy will irrevocably be lost mr francisco wrote adding that is particularly so when as here they are disclosed to a congressional committee and its staff house democrats have argued that they need to see the grand jury evidence in part because of suspicions that mr trump may have lied under oath in his written answers to mr mueller including about his campaign s advance knowledge of and contacts with wikileaks about its possession of hacked democratic emails and plans to publish them but under attorney general william p barr the justice department has fought to prevent house investigators from seeing the grand jury material including information that was blacked out in the report on the mueller investigation it released last year and underlying testimony transcripts those passages derived from usually congress has no right to view grand jury evidence but in 1974 the courts permitted lawmakers to see such materials as they weighed whether to impeach president richard m nixon last summer as the house judiciary committee weighed whether to impeach president trump it sought a judicial order to see certain mueller grand jury materials too the politically charged fight turns on a technical legal issue whether the impeachment process which begins with a house inquiry and can culminate in a senate trial counts as a judicial proceeding under an exception to grand jury secrecy rules that permits sharing evidence for that purpose both a federal district court judge ruled last fall and a panel of the court of appeals for the district of columbia ruled this spring that impeachment is a judicial proceeding following the nixon impeachment precedent but the trump administration has delayed any sharing of the evidence by continuing to argue at each level that it is not in the request to the supreme court that it halt the appeals court s order that the justice department turn over the material by may 11 mr francisco argued that at least four justices the number necessary to take an appeal are likely to decide that the supreme court should weigh in on the issue and that there is at least a fair prospect that a majority will eventually rule in favor of mr trump but if the house has already seen the evidence in the interim he argued the executive branch will be harmed even if it ultimately wins the case he noted that nothing could stop house democrats from publicly releasing the evidence mr mueller gathered by a simple majority vote in the judiciary committee advertisement
