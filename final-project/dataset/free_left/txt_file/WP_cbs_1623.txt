president hassan rouhani during the united nations general assembly which begins next week the president has made it clear he s prepared to meet with no pre conditions treasury secretary steven mnuchin said wednesday speaking alongside pompeo but the line from tehran s u n ambassador suggested the iranians intend to stand by their own precondition no talks until the sanctions imposed by mr
