quarantine has popularized a new kind of performance when all the world can t be a stage it seems during lockdown the balcony will have to do as this platform and its bigger cousin the terrace have become stand in venues for performances i think we are fairly well known as those americans over there on the balcony now said cellist matt walker he and violinist zeneba bowers spent 20 years in the nashville symphony before moving to italy a few months ago they d planned to write their fifth travel book and perform until italy s lockdown made that almost impossible correspondent seth doane asked did you ever imagine you d be playing on a balcony no we had never thought of using this space as any type of concert venue said bowers we wanted to use this space as a grill and drinking venue they bought their place about an hour from rome because of its stunning view of the town of soriano nel cimino it occurred to us that we could come out here on the balcony and play bowers said when that became just about the only place they could play they started making nightly videos that feature more view than musicians and posting them live on facebook walker and bowers perform j s bach s badinerie from orchestral suite no 2 in b minor buonasera soriano 52 j s bach badinerie from orchestral suite n 2 in b minor soon the town started piping these balcony performances into loudspeakers bowers said this is one way we could still perform that we could do something positive for our community and also not go crazy in quarantine helps doane asked liz lev a rome based art historian is this coronavirus making us more appreciative of the balcony i think the balcony has really come into its own in this period lev replied standing in st peter s square under the grand loggia or papal balcony where the world first meets a new pope lev said what balcony could be more famous than the center of st peter s it s the most famous balcony i would argue i would even say it s more famous than the queen of england s balcony but that might get me into trouble we connect balconies with things like the pope doane said but there are also bad leaders who ve used balconies well it s the same thing you get a platform and sometimes use the platform for good and sometimes people use the platform for ill lev said historically it s a perch that s said power from balconies benito mussolini and hitler exhorted their people to war but there are also balconies that inspire shakespearean love like the balcony of juliet capulet in verona according to lev there is evidence of balcony design in persia and egypt and in pompeii buried by volcanic ash nearly 2 000 years ago we learned how archaeologists uncovered evidence of the ancient appreciation for the structure a street with the remains of balconies centuries later those balconies were all over europe lev said and then the next thing you know you have sixtus iv pope in 1475 taking the king of naples around to show his fabulous city and the king of naples looks at the rickety balconies and says to him you will never have the control of your city if women throwing stuff from the balcony can stop your troops so there went all the balconies in today s pandemic crisis it s a place to burn calories receive a drive by blessing or just kill time father and son team fabio and jacopo mastrangelo have made the most of their 8 weeks in
