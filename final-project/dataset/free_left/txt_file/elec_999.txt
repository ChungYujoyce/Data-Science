while i m running for president the shooting has handed but tigieg the first significant challenge of his charmed campaign to allies his decision to leave the campaign trail and then hold two days of private meetings signals deliberate considerate leadership but to detractors including many of south bend s black activists his actions show that he still doesn t get it how s he handling it said

said and o neill opened fire late sunday buttigieg appeared at news conference where he offered little new information about the shooting we ve had prior cases of use of force incidents and officer involved shootings where i hesitated frankly to get in front of cameras because we didn t know very much and it was out of our hands he said but what i learned what i was told by people in the community is that it is important to open channels of communication when asked whether he planned to open channels to the logan family who were waiting at that moment in the next room buttigieg was noncommittal he wound up speaking briefly with the family but the meeting ended after they grew frustrated with buttigieg s inability to provide information and his lack of compassion friends of the
