religion that had inspired her to seek the presidency and to get back up after setbacks on sunday she spoke about the core of christ s message at mount zion missionary baptist church in cedar rapids then on monday here in knoxville when a voter asked if her beliefs aligned with the ten commandments mrs clinton reflected at length and spontaneously on her religious outlook i am a person of faith i am a christian i am a methodist she said my study of the bible my many conversations with people of faith has led me to believe the most important commandment is to love your neighbor as yourself she continued and that is what i think we are commanded by christ to do in her 2016 campaign mrs clinton has proved willing to speak personally about things she did not discuss in earlier campaigns leaning heavily on the story of her late mother dorothy rodham who was neglected and abandoned as a child and evoking her experiences as a young working mother but despite the constant central place it has occupied in her life mrs clinton s methodism has seldom come up on the campaign trail it s been a remarkably private part of this hugely public person s existence said lissa muscatine a longtime friend and adviser to mrs clinton it s almost like because it s so private and has motivated her so deeply that she doesn t talk about it that has changed with the approach of monday s iowa caucuses mrs clinton who friends say turns to religion in difficult times has increasingly seized opportunities some spontaneous and others planned to speak more openly about her faith including how it undergirds her politics in knoxville mrs clinton referred to the beatitudes in the gospel of matthew after jessica manning 36 a high school guidance counselor who opposes abortion rights said she was conflicted about being roman catholic and supporting a democrat what does the sermon on the mount really mean mrs clinton said referring to the sermon in which the eight beatitudes are outlined by jesus christ including blessed are the meek it sure does seem to favor the poor and the merciful and those who in worldly terms don t have a lot but who have the spirit that god recognizes as the core of love and salvation for all the efforts her campaign has made to reintroduce mrs clinton over the past eight months her religiousness remains little known more than four in 10 voters regardless of party affiliation said they believed mrs clinton was not very religious according to a pew research center study on faith and the 2016 campaign released on wednesday among democrats and voters who lean toward the democratic party about two thirds said mrs clinton was at least somewhat religious 27 percent said she was not though republican candidates aggressively court evangelicals who make up a particularly powerful conservative constituency in iowa democrats whose voters are a more diverse lot in sectarian terms tend to be more cautious in talking about religion mrs clinton s main opponent senator bernie sanders who is jewish has said he is not particularly religious but for mrs clinton a candidate who struggles with questions of authenticity her evident ease at discussing her faith and scripture and how they help explain why she is running for president might well help her connect not just to the faithful but to nonreligious voters as well it doesn t reach the bulk of democratic voters said mike mccurry a former white house press secretary to bill clinton who is now a professor of public theology at wesley theological seminary but in hillary s case what you want to hear is about character and values and what motivates her on wednesday during a quick fund raising trip to philadelphia mrs clinton spoke with 50 african american pastors at mother bethel african methodist episcopal church in what she called a stimulating and inspirational meeting the same night mr clinton told a crowd in mason city iowa that if you really want to understand hillary you just have to understand she was raised a methodist and mentioned one of her favorite spirituals if i could help somebody i won t bore you with all the verses mrs clinton said but the last line is if i can help somebody when i travel along then my living will not be in vain mrs clinton s methodist roots trace back to the 1700s as she wrote in her memoir living history her father s parents claimed they became methodists because their great grandparents were converted in the small coal mining villages around newcastle in the north of england and in south wales by john wesley himself she wrote she often repeats wesley s dictum do all the good you can by all the means you can in all the ways you can indeed her political proposals on everything from health care to climate change have roots in the united methodist church which advocates social justice in addition to personal piety said paul g kengor a professor at grove city college and the author of god and hillary clinton a spiritual life he described mrs clinton as a classic standard religious left christian who connects her faith to issues of poverty and helping people growing up in the chicago suburbs mrs clinton was active in the first united methodist church of park ridge ill and often credits her youth minister don jones whom she consulted until his death in 2009 with inspiring her to pursue public service she taught sunday school in arkansas and set up a bible study group soon after moving to the white house after the monica lewinsky scandal broke mrs clinton spent a lot of time alone praying and reading she wrote in living history she and her husband prayed with gordon macdonald an evangelical minister and author and mrs clinton developed a friendship with billy graham since moving to chappaqua n y the clintons have attended the united methodist church in nearby mount kisco mrs clinton has worshiped in church less frequently during her campaign but she regularly reads a leather bound bible which she has called the biggest influence on my thinking mrs clinton drifted back to its teachings in knoxville after mrs manning the guidance counselor expressed reservations about mrs clinton s position on some issues including her support for abortion rights her response drawing on the sermon on the mount deeply impressed mrs manning i really thought she nailed her answer she said mrs manning said she had not known mrs clinton was so religious i hoped so but i didn t she said adding i feel like she is genuine advertisement
