watch cbsn live by pamela falk updated on april 25 2020 4 08 pm cbs news on top of the coronavirus pandemic the world may see a global humanitarian catastrophe includingfamine in three dozen countries potentially the most serious crisis since world war ii ports are closed and supply chains disrupted as a disaster looms for millions david beasley the executive director of the united nations world food program and a former governor of south carolina said in an interview with cbs news that members of both parties in the u s have come together to help stave off poverty starvation and instability but he says more aid is needed to keep food supplies moving he also spoke about the need for common sense on when to reopen the economy beasley spoke with cbs news pamela falk from his home in society hill south carolina where he recently recuperated from a case of covid 19 himself cbs news pamela falk you came down with coronavirus tell us what the experience was like david beasley you read all stories then when it hits you it s a whole different ballgame i ve been lucky in the sense that it never got so severe that i had to go to the hospital but at the same time it didn t hit me for three days it was real slight and went away completely it hit me with a little fever aches and pains and then i thought it was going away after three days and then it it just kept lingering for three straight weeks fortunately i never had respiratory issues i was worried one particular day but made a good turn and it s behind me now i m so grateful that i can speak with experience about what i faced so that people can understand what this is all about even when governors or leaders say we re going to open up still use common sense that s the key use common sense use the brain that god has given you and be careful this is a deadly disease even if it s not deadly for you you can give it to someone who might be elderly or with a pre existing condition and then that obviously is deadly the world food program warned that in addition to the coronavirus pandemic the world may see a global humanitarian catastrophe what is your message to world leaders to the private sector what can be done beasley this is tragic we feed about 100 million people on any given day but 30 million depend on us 100 so now with covid we ve got an additional 130 million people bringing us to 265 million people literally marching to the brink of starvation we got to work out these issues immediately otherwise we re going to have famines unlike anything we ve ever seen in history number one let s end the wars right now please end the wars that would be the biggest thing number two we need to pre position about 1 9 billion worth of food to advance that funding so we can pre position it so that when supply chains begin to break down people won t lose their lives because of what we do number three we need about 350 million so that we can move medical supplies testing kits doctors nurses and health care professionals the last thing we need to do is keep the supply chain going because if you can t get the food out of a field to the market to the consumer people will die i tell you the worst is yet to come i m so concerned about africa obviously i m concerned about our donor nations that their economies get back to moving as quickly as they can so that we can provide the monies that are going to be needed to stave off massive famine in many of these countries that depend on success in the economies of donor nations like the united states like the u k like germany many africans depend upon remittances from their friends and families from around the world like from the united states and if we start seeing in urban areas of africa youth losing their jobs and not having food you re going to have riots destabilization is going to be a game changer so we re trying to identify the hotspots upfront and see what we can do to come in with safety nets but we re going to need funding to do that if we don t it ll be catastrophic are you speaking to the u s administration to the trump administration about keeping ports open beasley yes i ve been talking to not just the u s administration but literally leaders from many countries all over the earth and i can tell you that the united states has been an extraordinary donor in fact we get about 3 4 billion from the united states republicans and democrats even though they seem to be fighting over everything when it comes to food security foreign aid and stabilization they have been absolutely remarkable and every leader that i have talked to including the united states is committed to working with us doing their dead level best not to back down this is the 75th anniversary of the un do you think the next general assembly in september could take place beasley this year is one of the most devastating years in the united nations history so this would be a year for everybody really coming together because covid has transcended all borders around the world so it d be a great time for leaders to come together for a variety of reasons however if covid is still a contagious issue i would imagine we might see the first un general assembly as a virtual show a final note asked about being back home in south carolina to recuperate beasley said he s able to walk around and get fresh air my family s lived in this area since the early 1700s so we re an old family that came across like we were we were immigrants way back when he said first published on april 24 2020 9 22 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights
