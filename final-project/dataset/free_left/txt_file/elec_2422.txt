this post has been updated on monday sen marco rubio r fla outlined his lofty vision of a new american century as he announced his candidacy for presidentin miami before an enthusiastic crowd revved up by the music of u2 and flo rida and chanting marco marco on tuesday it was back to his day job as a junior member of a legislative body where he wields little clout because power depends heavily on seniority if he speaks on the senate floor he will simply be referred to by others as the senator from florida as is the custom that s the reality for rubio and sens rand paul r ky and ted cruz r tex each of whom launched presidential campaigns in recent weeks they have to balance two starkly contrasting worlds the fast paced lively battle for the white house filled with emotional highs and lows and where they are the feature attractions and the slow moving deliberative senate which plods along seized by partisan gridlock and where they are each but one out of 100 in addition to the whiplash they will confront an extra layer of scrutiny on their voting records and attendance hurdles former florida governor jeb bush and current wisconsin gov scott walker both likely republican candidates won t be facing in quite the same way the senators are also subject to special restrictions when it comes to super pacs which can raise unlimited sums of money putting them at a potential financial disadvantage in other words senators may have it tougher asked by the washington post tuesday how he planned to balance his time between the campaign trail and the senate rubio responded we ll just have to work twice as hard the florida republican flew back to washington tuesday morning where he will jump back into the second day of a busy workweek for the senate how does it feel to be back a day after launching his run for president the same as the last time i was here he said rubio appeared at a closely watched senate foreign relations committee meeting in the afternoon wherelawmakers sought to advance a billthat would grant congress the authority to examine the nuclear framework the obama administration recently reached with iran before the arrangement could be finalized paul also appeared at the meeting while they each boast loyal national followings they both had to wait patiently to speak since neither is the chairman rubio had offered anamendment to require iran to formally recognize israel s right to exist putting him in lockstep with the position of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rubio is emphasizing his hawkish national security leanings in the campaign for president rubio voiced concern at the hearing about the destruction of israel meanwhile the senator s attendance in the coming months is expected to come under examination he has already drawn attention for being the most absent senator according to a govtrack during a monday meeting in miami involving the campaign and donors aides explained that they anticipate rubio will be in the senate more than they want but less than he would prefer according to a donor present at the meeting who was granted anonymity to describe a private gathering rubio who foregoing reelection in 2016 will not return to the senate in 2017 no matter what happens but for paul and cruz there could be a cost for missing votes if you are successful in gaining the nomination i think there will be a certain amount of pride on the part of your constituents said sen john mccain r ariz the 2008 gop nominee for president if you lose badly then it can be not helpful when you are up for reelection in the senate if you ve missed a whole bunch of votes but mccain joked that his colleagues may not want to put too much stock into his outlook i lost how could i give them good advice should i tell them what not to do quipped mccain in addition to attendance records the positions rubio paul and cruz take on legislation will also come under close watch especially when they disagree by the media each other and from other campaigns third party groups and donors involved in the presidential contest during the recent budget vote a rama for example rubio and paul introduced competing amendments on defense spending the budget votes also stirred tensions between cruz and paul the senators are also dealing with an added barrier when it comes to fundraising as federal officeholders cruz rubio and paul have never been allowed to coordinate with super pacs at any stage of the presidential campaign official candidates no matter their position are also barred from doing so but bush and walker are not official candidates yet allowing them more leeway when it comes super pac fundraising on top of a busy week in the senate rubio has events planned in three states and d c on wednesday rubio will make the case for a tax reform plan he is pushing with sen mike lee r utah at the conservative heritage foundation then he will hit the road again first to raise money in new york and boston on thursday then to hold events in the first in the nation primary state of new hampshire on friday balancing the trail and the hill may be tough but there s proof at the other end of pennsylvania avenue a first term senator can make it all the way to the white house ed o keefe and mike debonis contributed
