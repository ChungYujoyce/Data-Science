advertisement americans share their hopes fears and frustrations in interviews from the campaign trail americans share their hopes fears and frustrations in interviews from the campaign trail mayor shirley franklin started a program in the city of atlanta in which every single student who graduated from a public school she d find a way to pay for their first year of college and after hearing my story she took an interest in me she gave me a job in her office and she helped me get into college summer came and i didn t go to work because i didn t have a suit i got a call saying you need to get to work and she had someone take me suit shopping they took me and bought me like five different suits and said this is how you invest in your kids i m the first person in my family to graduate from college that is the kind of local politics i grew to love in atlanta national politics is more messy but i have hope that is going to change antonio lewis 29 photograph by ryan stone for the new york times about this project both of my parents grew up in really poor rural areas they just wanted to get out of there so they joined the military most of my family is in the military a lot of my friends are in the military i remember my senior year everyone graduating and being excited about college but then when we graduated the war in iraq started so instead of all of us walking together some people were in iraq some people in afghanistan i think there are a lot of people like me who are in their mid 30s and who have that frame of mind it s just crazy to just say yes let s bomb them let s carpet bomb them if kids get killed oh well laura martin 35 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project i graduated in chicago where at that time it had the highest unemployment rate when i was applying for jobs i was lucky to get one interview a month because so many dentists lost their offices or lost their jobs there were over 100 applicants on each craigslist job posting and i had just graduated and i was going up against people who had been dentists for 10 to 15 years i had to actually work overseas for three years in singapore my student loans are still in default but i m working on them that s how much the 2008 economy hurt me if trump is president i don t see him bankrupting the country like george w bush did jonathan moon 36 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project out here in vegas it is hard to get good wages it took me like six months to get a job here and i had good experience when i didn t have a job i was on unemployment and i tried to get help i wanted to be in the work force and that s why there s so much alcoholism and drugs out here they get depressed because they can t find a job and the candidates haven t talked about it as much probably because they ve never faced it or never paid attention to it or something that they want to keep under the rug heather hill 43 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project i believe that from ages 18 to 22 the country and the corporate society have nowhere to put us we re not trained for anything so college i think is a big business they parked this whole generation of young people there for a while so they can be trainable i don t want them to go into debt i paid for my college my parents didn t i got out of school and i was working for the new york state department of labor and i had 50 000 worth of debt and i had a 18 000 a year job so maybe college should be more affordable or maybe free but we do need to do something with our youth they re not ready for prime time deborrah collymore 67 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project my mom was 16 when she had me so my dad wasn t ever around so there weren t too many people to look up to you know trump was just always out there a lot of people never liked him but he seems successful i always wanted to be like a businessman and i liked the way he did it i saw trump i thought that s somebody to look up to ain t too many successful people in my neighborhood as far as business maybe doing something illegal but a legit businessman going all over the world that has buildings where i m from it s good to have some jordans that might be the goal but i don t hear nobody talking about having buildings that they built damairs carter 37 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project my husband came to the united states when he was 16 he was up here working sending money back he s got family members who have been here some legally some not i ve got six grandchildren who are half mexican you do not call people rapists and murderers and drug dealers one group of people there are good and bad people in every country it makes me mad roaring mad even people who were born here like me in america we have criminals we have rapists my birthday is in august and so my son and my 18 year old grandson took me to the state fair they have something where you place a kernel of corn in a glass jar to say who you re voting for and my grandson started to go to drop his in trump s and i hit him with my paper i m not telling him how to vote but i kind of did lisa ramirez 54 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project as a small girl we didn t live too far from a railroad spur and wendell willkie came into town and i went out to see him and i said oh mom you have to vote for him he s cute and she says what did you do where did you go and i got the third degree don t you ever come into this house talking like that again so that s how i got indoctrinated into what s the good party and what s not the good party and then i married a rabid democrat i would say all my kids are democrats i like hillary because i thought she should have got it eight years ago when i busted my i mean when i caucused for her carol hendricks 84 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project one of my biggest issues with the way a lot of entitlements are crafted what they amount to are generational transfers to existing and future retirees i think unless there s some truly radical policy changes i just don t see the financial situation as sustainable there are just a lot of generational and institutional pressures that are going to keep on keeping on regardless of who is in office so for me personally that s why i like some of the more radical proposals for making the united states more competitive internationally the time for incremental changes probably passed 30 years ago we can t just keep kicking the can down the road duncan taylor 27 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project i never thought about senior citizens until i became one we re one of the only countries in the world that doesn t respect seniors most seniors supported kids through school now that they re old some of them choose between paying for their house or paying for their prescriptions their golden years are not so golden they work all their lives then they retire and then they can t live i worked hard i saved some money i m enjoying mine i was a forklift driver i got a pension from firestone but there s hardly no such thing as a pension anymore mike o deay 67 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project i started paying attention to politics when i started having to pay taxes i went to school and i worked and i paid for going to school and it wasn t easy i look at other people and it just doesn t seem like they were working as hard as i was i bought a condo and down the street they got low income housing and they were living in nicer places than me but i was paying full price for it you know the less you make the more you get being in a union everyone gets paid the same no matter how hard you work i don t like it i m not a big union guy but it s the best paying job around rocky ditullio 26 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project i have a 2 year old daughter maybe i ll be asking this question every time my daughter goes into a grade or a different school how is she going to get out of the building when someone comes through that door it s scary and we re becoming immune to that fear when i was 16 or 17 i worked at a grocery store around 7 30 or 8 o clock it got quiet it was just me and another girl and she was busy a man came up to the window and pointed a gun at me and said give me the money in the register i just did what he wanted me to do people face worse than that but i ll never forget that feeling i ll never forget looking down the barrel of a gun angelica ladd 32 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project i came from peru in 1963 i was legally given a visa at the time when i came into this country they didn t give us money or anything like that you came in you put your money in the bank and then you supported yourself nowadays this country gives all the muslims or whoever is coming welfare money housing furniture i worked for the city of la mesa in california and i used to deal with a lot of people from afghanistan they come into america and they give free rent free food free money and all of that i worked all my life i went to school and now we have to work harder to support those people adolfo villalobos 75 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project the black casino workers and hotel people once they got off work they were never allowed back into the hotels and casinos once they punched out they couldn t even go in there to have breakfast or have dinner at all back then when the union first formed my mother and my grandmother had us out on the picket line with them so they could sit in the restaurant or go to the shows so that s been with me all my life you have a lot of different immigrants in vegas now and everybody is in the melting pot and everyone s got something to say the union has given a voice to the voiceless for me it has yes it has sheila bell 54 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project i had experienced a sexual assault freshman year i was like 14 my parents didn t really believe me no one in school really believed what happened i realized at that moment that education was going to be my way out of that situation get into a good college and just get away i realized that i wanted to help other people in ways that i hadn t been helped politicians talk about it when it s trending in the news and then they move on if you are really going to look at women being equal you need to look at situations where they are unequal they can t be an equally successful parent if they are afraid of their partner they can t be effective at their job if they re having ptsd all of these boil down to an equal rights issue audriana mekula hanson 23 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project i tutored a kid this little black kid he looked up to me a lot one day he asked me mr ebbie is jail a good place to be i said why would you ever ask that he said my daddy s in jail and he said he gets three meals a day and sometimes my mom can t make me food and i m hungry i went home and i cried that night this is a kindergartner teachers told him he was going to jail i looked at him as a 5 year old i didn t see a criminal i didn t see a drug dealer i didn t see a rapist i didn t see a gangbanger i saw myself when i was a little kid 10 years ago the candidates a lot of them are from very privileged backgrounds and benefit from a white male christian power structure and that s o k i don t think that white people should feel guilty about their privilege but they should feel a responsibility to acknowledge it ebbie banks 17 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project i ve been in it for years i was asked to make telephone calls i worked at the polls i had my picture taken with mrs nixon mrs eisenhower when reagan came to portsmouth i set up a room for him and his wife i m in the book who s who in american politics you can find me in there if you ve got that book i think it s important to take part get involved do what you can we started out with taking fliers to people s houses and telephoning there s so much to do i wish i was more able i haven t been doing anything too much in the last few years being 94 now i kind of let other people do it but i do still vote and i still have signs in my window shirley hodgdon 94 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project i came out at 15 i had gotten rid of all the kind of people who would go against me before i came out and was discovering a lot about my gender identity i stopped going to church and all that sort of stuff but luckily my family is really accepting they can t be perfect it s more of a learning experience for them just as much as it is for me luckily they have a very outspoken son but i live in rural iowa going out canvassing in a lot of these rural areas when i m sort of expressing my gender more femininely is not necessarily the safest thing i did go out with painted nails and skinny jeans and a cardigan and i got yelled at on the side of the street around the college is completely fine but outside of that it s not as safe austin wadle 19 photograph by chad batka for the new york times about this project i had just gotten my family out in the beginning of september out of aleppo i have three family members remaining there my uncle his little baby and his wife the baby was born prematurely because a bomb fell on their home the next leader of the u s has to know that this is an important issue for me how did the u s start it was people from all over europe coming here looking for freedom my daughter she s 5 we ve
