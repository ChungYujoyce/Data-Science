advertisement supported by the new new world the sudden silence of ren zhiqiang a vocal member of the communist party signals a retreat from the principles that led china out of poverty by li yuan weeks before ren zhiqiang disappeared leading to fears among his friends and fans that he had been picked up by the chinese authorities the 69 year old former property mogul locked himself up it happened at an exhibition he held in december to show off his wood sculptures a late life passion after retirement and rising censorship left him little else to do he barred himself inside a small work studio so that attendees could view him only through a small window or from the open roof it was performance art mr ren explained to his friends to show his isolation after the government barred him from social media and giving speeches when friends asked how the government might react he smirked the way he usually did when challenging authority now mr ren may have gone further than the current leadership will allow his friends say he vanished this month after writing an essay critical of the chinese government s response to the coronavirus outbreak the essay which was shared widely within private internet message groups never named xi jinping china s top leader but it said the actions of a power hungry clown and the communist party s strict limits on free speech had exacerbated the epidemic it declared that the party should wake up from ignorance and oust the leaders holding it back just as it did with the leaders known as the gang of four in 1976 ending the turmoil of the cultural revolution the disappearance of mr ren a longtime critic of the chinese government adds to fears that china is sliding backward and abandoning the reforms that saved it from extreme poverty and international isolation mr ren was no radical he was a decades long loyal communist party member the former leader of a state run company and a friend to some of china s most powerful politicians he emerged in what now seems a distant time from the 1980s to the period before mr xi became top leader when the party brooked no challenge to its rule but allowed some individuals to question some of its choices mr ren s fate remains unclear but if he was punished for his writing it suggests china s leadership won t tolerate criticism no matter how justified it might be like mr xi mr ren was born into party royalty his father was a deputy commerce minister his mother went to school with the north korean dictator kim il sung who held him in a photo when he was a baby according to his social media posts and media interviews he was also well connected he has been friends with vice president wang qishan of china since he was in junior high mr ren wrote in his 2013 autobiography that mr wang would sometimes call him late in the evening and chat for hours mr ren hired liu he china s main negotiator in the trade war with the united states as a part time researcher when mr liu was a graduate student yu zhengsheng a former member of the party s politburo standing committee its highest ruling body worked with mr ren when he was the construction minister and wrote the introduction of mr ren s first book in 2002 mr yu wrote that he had first noticed mr ren at a conference in 1998 when the latter attacked a new housing policy as one of the people who proposed the policy i of course disagreed with him mr yu wrote but his candid remarks and philosophical argument left a deep impression on me after the meeting i told relevant comrades that they shouldn t be repulsed by his remarks and should study the reasonable parts of his argument mr ren won respect from government officials because they came to believe his criticisms were made in good faith dissent he often told others is the highest form of patriotism i believe ren zhiqiang is 90 percent like us wrote ning gaoning a respected executive who has run some of china s biggest state run conglomerates in the introduction for mr ren s 2013 autobiography the other 10 percent of his brain is made up of something different from us he is too competitive wrote mr ning who is known as frank ning in the west he takes things too seriously he likes to get to the bottom of everything he studies intensively but is way too confident and he is always concerned about the affairs of the state in one sense it is a minor miracle that mr ren nicknamed the big cannon for his tendency to air his provocative views managed to stay out of jail for so long as chairman of a state controlled real estate developer he clashed with city and central government officials including mr yu he sued two ministries over payment disputes and cut off the heating supply of a big state owned bookstore after it repeatedly failed to pay construction fees according to his autobiography he prompted one beijing mayor to declare that a company that sued the government should not exist he wrote he was influenced by free market economists like milton friedman and friedrich hayek he believed government control needed to be checked state power in any country is greedy so it needs to be subject to public supervision he wrote in his autobiography otherwise the power will be abused and everybody will suffer from it mr ren became an important national voice between 2010 and 2015 when weibo china s equivalent of twitter became a public arena where people shared their grievances and debated ideas before then he was widely hated in china because he declared that his job was to build housing for the rich and he blamed government policies for a lack of affordable housing as housing prices surged despite government cool down efforts people began to see him as honest instead of greedy in 2011 near the peak of china s openness to new ideas mr ren an avid reader started a book club it drew china s top entrepreneurs intellectuals and government officials books included alexis de tocqueville s democracy in america and hannah arendt s the origins of totalitarianism the events became so popular that people had to apply through a lottery system to join some people flew to beijing from all over the country to attend mr ren said his goal was to help china s young generation develop independent thinking so it would not follow the orders of authority slavishly the government said no to some topics and speakers but left it largely alone by early 2016 he had nearly 38 million followers on weibo but party attitudes toward expression were changing that same year mr xi declared that all chinese news media had to serve the party no chinese leader since mao zedong had made that obligation so explicit mr ren shot back on weibo writing that the news media should serve the people not the party or the people would suffer retribution was swift his weibo account was deleted his party membership was suspended for a year his passport was taken away members of his family weren t allowed to leave the country he faced constant investigations and interrogations he stopped dying his hair and it went all white quickly he sometimes looked sullen at dinners and some of his friends were worried that he was suffering from depression his health became an issue as well he had been scheduled for a biopsy on suspicion of prostate cancer after the lunar new year holiday in may he started making sculptures out of wood some of it looked natural as he had worked with the knotted branches and roots of trees for other works he cut and carved pieces to arrange them into skylines and landscapes he was rejuvenated and overjoyed friends said then came the coronavirus outbreak when doctors working with the disease tried to publicly warn china about the outbreak they were threatened by government officials for mr ren friends said this confirmed his argument that a media that serves the party couldn t serve the people without a media representing the interests of the people by publishing the actual facts he wrote in the essay that circulated this year people s lives are being ravaged by both the virus and the major illness of the system he shared the essay with a few friends three days after his 69th birthday he disappeared his assistant and his son have disappeared too advertisement
