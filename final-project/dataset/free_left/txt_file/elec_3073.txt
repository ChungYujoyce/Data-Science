 2016 sanders is winning big in democratic caucuses and there s another one coming up this weekend by daniel strauss 04 08 2016 05 12 am edt bernie sanders speaks to supporters during a campaign rally in laramie wyo on april 5 ap photo bernie sanders is poised to notch another win saturday his eighth victory out of the past nine democratic primary contests a result his campaign will likely claim gives the vermont senator unstoppable momentum heading into a spate of bigger states indeed even before all the votes were counted in wisconsin tuesday sanders was moving to lock down wyoming the lone state to vote before the pivotal april 19 new york primary he positioned himself tuesday night at the university of wyoming in laramie rather than deliver his victory speech in wisconsin the scene of his latest romp over hillary clinton advertisement a win in wyoming wouldn t put much of a dent in clinton s roughly 250 delegate lead over sanders even a runaway victory there wouldn t net him a huge number of delegates but the state is suddenly taking on exaggerated importance at least for sanders since it advances the momentum argument that s now central to his stump speech as the two democrats enter the smash mouth phase of the primary marked by ever sharper attacks on each other the least populous state in the nation is offering a chance for sanders to strut into clinton s home state with confidence knowing that an upset victory in new york could have the effect of resetting the primary sanders enters 14 delegate wyoming on the upswing aside from his recent victories in wisconsin he made gains among a wide array of demographic and ideological groups including older voters and minorities who ve been more resistant to his campaign 2016 by burgess everett and seung min kim while there s been no public polling to date as a western caucus state with a largely white electorate wyoming has the ingredients for a sanders victory it also failed to warm to clinton in 2008 president barack obama defeated her by 61 percent to 38 percent recognizing the favorable conditions which resemble those in idaho and utah where sanders won by landslide margins on march 22 the sanders campaign is outspending clinton in the state though neither campaign is devoting significant resources there we are similar to other states that sen sanders has done well in he s performed very well in states with predominately white communities wyoming democratic party executive director aimee van cleave said and he does perform well in caucus states so that pretty much describes wyoming sanders path to victory in a small turnout caucus there are only roughly 41 000 registered democrats in the entire state is through making sure college students come out to vote explained van cleave i d say that their biggest challenge is making sure that university students are turning out to vote she said by hanna trudo the clinton campaign isn t writing off the state even if the candidate herself hasn t spent much time there the democratic front runner has the backing of prominent state democrats including former gov mike sullivan former secretary of state kathy karpan and state party chairwoman ana cuprill she s also got endorsements from leaders of the northern arapaho and eastern shoshone tribes this time all of our superdelegates have come out for secretary clinton so that means now it s just a straight delegate to delegate fight said karpan who also backed clinton in 2008 still wyoming democrats say sanders efforts have eclipsed clinton s in the run up to the caucus sanders has spent about 72 000 on advertising over tv cable and radio in the state while clinton has not spent any money at all on the airwaves clinton also hurt her chances in the nation s top coal producing state by stating recently that her energy policy would put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business 2016 by annie karni frankly i think sanders was out here organizing earlier one of the reasons hillary lost this state to obama last time was that she didn t organize early hillary has some really good people kathy karpan and others who are looking out for her and mike sullivan said former democratic gov david freudenthal who endorsed obama in 2008 after his caucus victory but does not support either candidate this year sanders is going to benefit from having organized early and having done that the clinton folks are a little late getting to it freudenthal continued but there aren t that many votes here and i think it was the same thought she had when she was against obama that these states weren t gonna matter so they didn t start in the caucus states and it turned out that frankly in the end they may not matter now but they certainly matter in terms of the momentum missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020 politico llc
