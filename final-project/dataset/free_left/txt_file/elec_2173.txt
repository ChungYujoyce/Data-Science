the first night of the first debate of the 2020 democratic presidential primary is over with the first 10 candidates jousting wednesday night in miami below are our winners and losers winners and losers from the second night of the first democratic debate elizabeth warren the massachusetts senator went into the debate with the biggest target on her back as the highest polling candidate onstage but she largely skated other candidates didn t seem to have the appetite to put her on the spot after the first question sen amy klobuchar d minn former texas congressman beto o rourke and sen cory booker d n j all got a chance to offer differences with warren on her proposals free college a huge tax increase on the wealthy and breaking up big companies respectively none of them took the bait with only klobuchar offering a quibble the idea that taxpayers pay for rich kids tuition and even she didn t actually tie that to warren s proposal from that point on warren got a pass and she used her platform to do what she has done to great effect on the campaign trail talk about her bold liberal policy ideas it s about the best she could have hoped for after being slotted onto the joe biden and bernie sanders free debate stage juli n castro for someone on the periphery of much of the 2020 debate he made a splash he made a strong statement about the father and daughter who drowned earlier this week in the rio grande saying everyone should be pissed off about it later after a joust with o rourke on immigration other candidates emphasized their agreement with castro it s a great sign when other candidates are straining to show they agree with you bill de blasio since making a late entry into the 2020 field the new york mayor has been the butt of more than a few jokes in d c and new york media he s also by far the most unpopular candidate in the field but he was on his game he cut in to get more time he talked about having hard conversations with his black son he talked about his dad s ptsd which eventually led to suicide and he made perhaps the most far reaching case for government activism outside of warren exactly as he wanted raise your hand questions candidates hate having to answer questions with yes or no answers but sometimes moderators must make them good news you can get all of them to do it at once the nbc moderators asked the 10 candidates onstage whether their health care plans would get rid of private insurance in favor of single payer health care only warren and de blasio raised their hand then they all discussed the details it worked and it can continue to for the right kind of question klobuchar s one liners the overall picture wasn t a resounding success for her but a couple of lines landed well one well improvised and one clearly planned when washington gov jay inslee talked about being the only candidate to sign into law a reproductive rights bill klobuchar shot back i just want to say that there are three women here who have fought pretty hard for a woman s right to choose the audience erupted in applause then later while talking about iran klobuchar had maybe the line of the night on trump i don t think we should conduct foreign policy in our bathrobe at 5 o clock in the morning former vice president joe biden did you know he is the leading democratic candidate you wouldn t from this debate there was some worry that he might be attacked in absentia and not have a chance to respond immediately but it didn t really happen spanish it was probably inevitable that some candidates would speak it on the stage and o rourke was quick to do so followed by booker even castro whose lack of fluency in spanish as the only latino candidate has been much discussed offered a brief bit of bilingualism i need to learn spanish by tomorrow night at 9 tweeted marianne williamson who will debate thursday night my spanish is terrible her fellow thursday nighter andrew yang admitted in his own tweet o rourke i wrote before the debate that o rourke was one of the candidates who needed the most out of it he didn t get it off the bat he was asked a question about marginal tax rates and declined to offer a specific answer instead offering an apparently pre rehearsed spanish monologue and again didn t really answer after being offered a narrower question about rep alexandria ocasio cortez s d n y 70 percent rate later he was asked why he wasn t willing to get rid of private health insurance and he was challenged on it by de blasio rather than offer a forceful defense he was rescued by former congressman john delaney d md who offered a much more studied answer later when castro hit him for not supporting a specific change to asylum rules o rourke offered a broader rebuttal about his favored reforms he righted the ship somewhat when talking about gun control later in the debate but the whole thing reinforced the narrative that o rourke is somewhat out of his depth on policy tulsi gabbard gabbard was lost for much of the debate that may not have been her fault she wasn t asked many questions but fellow cellar dwellers delaney and de blasio were able to work their way in by piggybacking on others answers toward the end gabbard was asked a question about her past opposition to gay rights which she has apologized for her answer about personal evolution and coming from a socially conservative family was perfectly fine but then booker swooped in and argued she should have also talked about transgender rights making her answer suddenly seem insufficient trump s mission to save the free world before the debate trump tweeted that he wouldn t be watching sorry i m on air force one off to save the free world but about 40 minutes in he tweeted boring one problem it came right after a particularly heavy portion about that tragic image of the father and daughter just as they asked about the dead parent and child in the water and immigration though he might be on delayed watch https t co j08qiikyyy a political plan of action the liberal candidates including warren were asked about the practicality of their proposals and they said you need to fight for things candidates including warren were asked how they would bend mitch mcconnell to their will if he remains senate majority leader and they didn t have much of a plan tim ryan offered a compelling case for democrats need to appeal to working class voters and it got some tepid applause and little buy in from other candidates it wasn t exactly a lesson on how you enact actual policies russia and impeachment the first mention of either of these came more than 100 minutes into the debate de blasio said russia was one of his top issues then delaney was asked about whether a president should be immune from prosecution and he said it wasn t really what voters cared about then klobuchar suggested the important issue was election security not necessarily what to do with trump for all the talk about robert s mueller iii and impeachment in recent weeks and months it would have been an easy applause line wednesday night to bring this up early and often somehow democrats resisted the urge in a way house speaker nancy pelosi d calif will surely appreciate smooth production upon returning from the first hour and handing things off to moderators chuck todd and rachel maddow the nbc news proceedings were marred by a hot mic somewhere and they had to cut to commercial to fix things receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access
