the following is a transcript of an interview with sen john kennedy that aired sunday february 16 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan we turn to another big story this week attorney general barr s strong public pushback to perceived presidential interference into justice department cases republican senator john kennedy joins us now from louisiana senator thank you for being with us senator john kennedy thank you margaret margaret brennan the president says he has the legal right to intervene in criminal cases do you agree sen kennedy just because does the president have a right to tweet about a case of course just because you can sing though doesn t mean you should sing you can have a voice like mick jagger but you wouldn t want to start belting out honky tonk woman in church this is a case where tweeting less would not cause brain damage look roger stone is pretty good at bad decisions and nobody would confuse him with alexander hamilton bill barr s justice department prosecuted him and convicted him while the attorney general and others were trying to get the senate s recommendations straight the president tweeted put the attorney general in an awkward spot and he spoke out margaret brennan do you think the interference sen kennedy i hope the president will margaret brennan ends at tweets sen kennedy i have no indication that it doesn t and bill barr has said categorically and unequivocally that the president has never tried to influence him in a criminal case nor should he look this is my experience with bill barr he s mature he s serious he exercises power fairly and intelligently he s cursed with a rational mind and he s tough as a boot and he has given the president his advice his best advice and i hope that president trump will accept it margaret brennan you said that you take the attorney general at his word that he was already going to intervene in this case prior to the president s public tweet about roger stone but sen kennedy yes margaret brennan is it a good idea for him to get personally involved in such a politically charged case sen kennedy look this is this is the way the process works at justice particularly when a public figure is involved there are checks and balances and there are multiple layers of supervision now i it has been reported i don t know if it s accurate it s been reported by two major mainstream news organizations that the the four the four front frontline prosecutors here said look we re going to recommend seven to nine years for stone and if you don t like it they said this to their supervisors we re going to quit and call a press conference that s not the proper procedure nobody s above the law but nobody beneath the law being mr stone s status as a chucklehead is not a criminal act margaret brennan right but the question was whether the sen kennedy and there s nothing wrong margaret brennan whether the attorney general himself should have gotten personally in involved he said in an interview with abc that that the u s attorney did consult with him before the filing sen kennedy well he didn t initiate it margaret brennan he disagreed on it and then he sen kennedy bill barr bill barr didn t margaret brennan personally got involved sen kennedy yeah bill barr didn t initiate it all bill barr s justice department did was prosecute the gentleman the us attorney in washington came to bill barr and said hey i ve got a question about the sentence so barr says well let s talk about it at least according to mr barr s testimony in the meantime the frontline prosecutors went out on their own now i don t know exactly what happened i just know what s been reported margaret but i can tell you if a if a staff one of my staff members came to me and said kennedy i don t agree with your position on net neutrality and if you don t change it i m going to quit and call a press conference i ll tell you what i d do i d say you have me confused with somebody who cares about what you think go call your press conference you can t resign because you re fired margaret brennan do you want to call those prosecutors in for questioning sen kennedy i i if they want to make a statement that s fine if if if the reported facts are wrong margaret brennan well sen kennedy they should say something margaret brennan well it would it would answer your questions i guess sen kennedy but a frontline prosecutor margaret brennnan right sen kennedy a front line prosecutor on any case can t just go go out on his or her own particularly when it involves a public figure margaret brennan i want to sen kennedy now bill barr margaret brennan i want to ask you sorry i just to just get to another topic as well sen kennedy it s okay margaret brennan since i have you here last time you were with us sen kennedy ok margaret brennan back in november on face the nation you said if it could be demonstrated that the president asked for an investigation of a political rival then it would be in your words over the line and probably impeachable do you still stand by that sen kennedy it depends on why he asked for it margaret brennan because i want sen kennedy i think what i said at the time i think what i said at the time was that if a president asked for an investigation of a political rival because he is a political rival that would be wrong margaret brennan right because i m asking you sen kennedy but if a president asks margaret brennan because president trump was on geraldo rivera s program this week and said that he did direct rudy giuliani to go to ukraine and as we know rudy giuliani has said he went to ukraine to investigate the bidens so that description sen kennedy well but you have to ask why margaret brennan from the president does it meet your standard sen kennedy you have to ask why margaret the president asked for investigation of joe biden and his son and burisma he didn t get joe biden s name out of the phone book he didn t ask for an investigation of amy klobuchar and elizabeth warren he asked for an investi four words why the president asked for an investigation hunter biden and burisma now these are the facts i didn t make this up president obama put vice president biden in charge of the foreign affairs of two countries ukraine margaret brennan ok sen kennedy and china and in both cases margaret brennan we re running out of time here senator sen kennedy his son walked away with millions of dollars of contract margaret brennan all right i was just asking you about sen kennedy and you know the message that sent to the world margaret brennan i wanted to ask you just about your standard which is why i was going back to that but we do have to leave it there senator sen kennedy let me let me let me be clear margaret brennan and we will sen kennedy let me be clear margaret brennan i i sen kennedy there s nothing wrong margaret brennan senator i m sorry sen kennedy there s nothing wrong with a president asking for an investigation of corruption margaret brennan ok thank you we ll be back with senator amy klobuchar who had a strong third place in new hampshire she s going to join us from nevada watch
