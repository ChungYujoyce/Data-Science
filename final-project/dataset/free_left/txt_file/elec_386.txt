hillary clinton s declaration friday night at a new york fundraiser that half of donald trump s supporters fit into a basket of deplorables seems in its tersest formation like a stupid comment to make the new york times s michael barbaro sums up that sentiment no 1 rule of presidential politics okay to mock your opponent never a good idea to mock the electorate but my summary above is not a fair condensation what clinton said and the fuller context makes it clear what she was aiming at to just be grossly generalistic clinton said according to a transcript from buzzfeed s ruby cramer you could put half of trump s supporters into what i call the basket of deplorables right the racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamophobic you name it and unfortunately there are people like that and he has lifted them up she talked a bit about how trump has interacted with that racist element and then continued but the other basket and i know this because i see friends from all over america here but that other basket are people who feel that the government has let them down the economy has let them down nobody cares about them nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures they re just desperate for change those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well trump s campaign and trump himself quickly tried to make hay from the first part wow hillary clinton was so insulting to my supporters millions of amazing hard working people i think it will cost her at the polls but there are two ways in which this differs from something like president obama s cling to guns and religion comments from another fundraiser in 2008 the first is that the clingers remark disparaged something that was positive a person s religion or their cultural affinity for gun ownership and sportsmanship it was a dismissal of things of which people were proud clinton however was saying that half of trump s base was motivated by negative inclinations racism sexism no one is going to say hey how dare you disparage my family s history of being racist trump s tweet said she insulted his supporters but clinton clearly delineated between two groups of supporters and she offered words of understanding to the latter so let s break the electorate out into four groups and consider how the comment will play 1 clinton supporters they support clinton it seems unlikely they ll be put out 2 racist sexist xenophobic islamophobictrump supporters how big a group is this it s hard to say clinton s spokesman nick merrill tried to defend his boss s use of half by saying on twitter that the racist xenophobic types appear to make up half of his crowd at events update clinton issued a statement on saturday apologizing for implying it was half of trump supporters we do know that 7 percent of trump supporters think the candidate is racist suggesting that they themselves don t see racism as a dealbreaker regardless of the actual fraction of the trump base this group constitutes clinton s not likely to change their minds away from their preferred candidate either 3 non deplorable trump supporters this group will go one of two ways they ll either a see clinton s remarks as insulting them as a whole or b be reminded that there are elements of trump s base of support that makes them uncomfortable that sense may spur them to be less enthusiastic to go vote for trump in november but notice either way there s no loss for clinton if she spurs some trump supporters to reconsider the loss is to trump republicans think hillary clinton just made her own 47 percent gaffe did she 4 undecided voters they ll go one of two ways too it seems some may think clinton was being rude and be less likely to support her some may similarly be reminded about elements of trump s base that they don t like and be less likely to back him this is a much smaller group than the number of trump backers mind you in the current realclearpolitics average trump backers are about 43 percent of the electorate and undecided voters are about 12 percent if clinton sways 5 percent of the let s say 90 percent of trump backers who aren t deplorables to rethink their support that s 2 percent of the overall electorate if she loses 10 percent of the undecideds that s 1 2 percent of the electorate that s assuming the shorthand here doesn t collapse into clinton insulted all trump supporters this is the point that barbaro was making clinton may have been trying once again to separate out non racist sexist xenophobic trump backers by pointing to those supporting trump who do hold those objectively deplorable views it s a tricky line to walk but compared with clingers for example she s in a slightly better position and then there s that other thing about obama s clingers
