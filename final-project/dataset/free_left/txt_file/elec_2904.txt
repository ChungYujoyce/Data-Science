after donald trump named stephen bannon head of the right wing political website and trumppropaganda outfitbreitbart news as his new campaign ceo earlier this month advocates of the increasingly popular alt right movement which breitbart has championed over the past year were more than a little jubilant his appointment is great news said peter brimelow editor of the white supremacist websitevdare tothe daily beast while richard spencer president ofthe national policy institute an overtly racist think tank praised breitbart as a gateway to alt right ideas and writers last thursday about a week after the hiring of bannon democratic nominee hillary clinton denounced the alt right at a campaign rally inreno nevada declaring that the de facto merger between breitbart and the trump campaign represents a landmark achievement for the alt right a fringe element continued clinton has effectively taken over the republican party predictably those who identify with the alt right were once again ecstaticwith the publicitythat their onetime fringe movement was receiving thealt right which the southern poverty law centerdefinesas a set of far right ideologies groups and individuals whose core belief is that white identity is under attack by multicultural forces using political correctness and social justice to undermine white people and their civilization has grown into a popular buzzword over the past year alongside the trump campaign for politically inclined social media users or redditers the term denotes trump worshipingtrolls who regularlyharass women and people of color on twitter and tumblr and who embracethe billionaire sapparentstands againstpolitical correctness feminism and multiculturalism as well as his strongman personality broadly speaking the alt right is a big tent movement characterized by an intense disdain for liberalism egalitarianismand feminism anda shared affinity for white supremacy nationalism andauthoritarianism there are various ideologies and groups that fall into the alt right classification but for practical purposes the movement can be divided into two categories first there are the bona fide far right extremists one could call thetrue believers white supremacists neo nazis neoreactionaries who all genuinely believe that the white race is superior or that there is a conscious liberal plot to annihilate the white race and destroy western civilization i e white genocide then there arethe trolls who loathe political correctness and feminism but primarily post despicable racist and sexist comments online in order to provoke and offend the so called social justice warriors these trolls may or may not be genuine racists or white supremacists but theyarecynical and amoral opportunists much like their hero mr trump the infamous breitbart provocateur and alt right darling milo yiannopoulos falls into the latter category and in anarticle on the alt right he compared itstrolls to kids of the 60s who shocked their parents with promiscuity long hair and rock n roll like transgressive beatniks and hippies the alt right s young meme brigades shock older generations with outrageous caricatures from the jewish shlomo shekelburg to remove kebab an internet in joke about the bosnian genocide because anti semitism and white supremacy areso veryoriginal these trolls who contaminate social media with racist bile are according toyiannopoulos no more bigots than death metal devotees in the 80s were actually satanists on the other hand there are the alt right s true believers like neo nazis and white supremacists atthe daily stormerandstormfront sites that have become increasingly popular with the rise of trump or perhaps the most bizarre alt right faction the cultish neoreactionary movement also known as the dark enlightenment these curious new arrivalsare pro monarchist futurists who identify as race realists i e they promote pseudo scientific theories used to justify racism and seem to believe like a classic ayn rand hero that their genius has been unfairly overlooked in a society of parasites and underachievers hence their contempt for democracy and egalitarianism so then those arethe trollsandthe true believers but where does trump s new campaign chief fall in the alt right typology according to conservative writer and professor ronald radosh who met bannon at a book party in 2014 the breitbart chairmandescribeshimself as a leninist what did he mean by that lenin wanted to destroy the state and that s my goal too bannon reportedly told radosh i want to bring everything crashing down and destroy all of today s establishment bannon also described theconservative publications national reviewandthe weekly standardas left wing magazines that he wanted to destroy as well this destructive attitude which evokes the russian nihilist movement of the late 19th century which coincidentally or not also influenced vladimir ilyich lenin has also been endorsed by yiannopoulos hetold conservative writer james kirchickthat trump supporters don t care about the billionaire s policies they just want to burn everything down thus it appears the alt right is united by a kind of political nihilism the true believers want to destroy liberal democracy in order to bring forth a new fascistregime or re establish the feudalabsolutismof the dark ages the trolls simply get a kick out of watching the world burn as for donald trump heseems to believe in very little ideologically speaking and must be regarded as a troll himself like his minions on twitter and tumblr trump likely experiences some kind of twisted pleasure with each abusive tweet and shameless provocation conor lynch is a writer and journalist living in new york city his work has appeared on salon alternet
