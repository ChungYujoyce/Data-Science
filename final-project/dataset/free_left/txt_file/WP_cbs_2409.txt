watch cbsn live by camilo montoya galvez updated on may 17 2020 9 07 am cbs news u s immigration authorities said in a court filing late friday that one of the main reasons detained migrant children were not released this week as part of an order by a federal judge is because their parents did not agree to be separated from them in the filing u s immigration and customs enforcement listed several reasons why the agency denied parole to virtually all of the 185 minors in its custody this week one of them was labeled in spreadsheets as parent does not wish to separate friday s court filing indicates that migrant parents were recently asked among other questions whether they wished to be separated from their children so the minors could be released to relatives or other sponsors on thursday groups that provide legal services at the three family detention centers ice oversees in texas and pennsylvania said their clients were asked without their attorneys knowledge to choose between staying in detention indefinitely or allowing their children to be released to sponsors without them the advocates accused ice of presenting parents with this binary choice a policy which could lead to family separation and that the administration has reportedly considered in the past to deter families from crossing the border prior to friday s court filings an ice spokesperson said the agency had not implemented what has been referred to as binary choice at this time and was instead exploring all options in response to federal litigation in one of the court filings friday a top ice official said officers at the three family detention centers in texas and pennsylvania conducted parole determinations for all the children in its custody in response to an order late last month by the federal judge overseeing litigation related to the flores settlement agreement which governs the care of migrant minors in u s custody on april 24 judge dolly gee of the u s district court in los angeles found that the government was violating that agreement and ordered it to make every effort to promptly and safely release the children in its custody who have suitable sponsors don t pose a danger to themselves or others and are not flight risks ice s juvenile coordinator deane dougherty said in friday s filing that the agency complied with gee s order by questioning parents about possible sponsors for their children and other factors that would affect a decision to release detainees dougherty said officers used parole worksheets in use since 2017 and not any other forms during the review she also said officers did not ask parents to waive the rights their children have under the flores agreement spreadsheets included with the filings show the agency only granted parole to five minors at the family detention center in dilley texas it s unclear if the children granted parole will be released with their parents since the filings don t specify it the rest of the children were denied parole on the grounds that they were a flight risk that parents did not wish to be separated from them that they had orders of deportation and pending decisions from immigration judges or asylum adjudicators other reasons included that the children were involved in federal litigation or had purposefully evaded u s immigration controls reached for comment on friday s filings an ice spokesperson said the agency has not instituted binary choice or separated any parents from their child pursuant to binary choice and ice has not implemented any new forms to conduct the new parole determinations as required by the court any assertion to the contrary is plainly false ice officials said the form used during the custody review was created in the wake of an order from gee in 2017 peter schey one of the two attorneys who filed the original lawsuit that prompted the flores agreement in 1997 said the parole review ice conducted is not what gee asked for he said parents reported that they were given forms that were in english even though most of them do not read the language even though flores only covers migrant minors schey said ice has broad discretion to release their parents as well he said the government should be reviewing whether to release children under the terms of the flores agreement not under parole which u s laws say can only be granted in urgent humanitarian or public benefit circumstances parole is highly discretionary schey said whereas the flores settlement the release is not discretionary it says shall release unless the child is a flight risk bridget cambria an immigration attorney who represents families held by ice at the berks family residential center in pennsylvania said parents called her immediately after they were asked whether they would be willing to allow their children to be released without them it startled them and they all said no cambria said they were scared one mother told an officer there s no way you re taking my only child away from me cambria told cbs news most of the mothers became very emotional and cried most of the day because even though they said no there was a fear that it didn t matter what they said cambria said ice could have avoided alarming parents by advising their lawyers that it would ask them these questions for me to ask a mother which is what they did in berks to give up their one year old daughter to me is unconscionable i think that s why they need to be at least held to account in a separate filing on friday the justice department lawyer representing ice asked to file the spreadsheets under seal citing privacy concerns the flores agreement originally applied only to migrant children classified as unaccompanied but in 2015 gee ruled that accompanied children were also covered and that they should generally not be held in secure unlicensed facilities with their families for more than 20 days the trump administration has published a rule it hopes will supersede the flores settlement and allow it to detain families indefinitely in detention centers that do not need a state license gee has so far blocked it from taking effect according to spreadsheets submitted friday many of the children in ice custody with their families have been detained for more than 20 days some since august 2019 advocates have been urging ice to release all migrant families and most adults from detention during the coronavirus pandemic saying detainees are at increased risk of contracting the virus while in congregate settings the agency said in its court filings friday that no staff or detainees at the family detention centers have tested positive for coronavirus however more than 980 single adults in ice custody have tested positive for the virus according to the
