advertisement supported by by amy chozick when hillary rodham s high school government teacher in park ridge ill insisted she play the role of lyndon b johnson in a mock debate of the 1964 presidential election she protested ms rodham one of the school s standout debaters was a proud barry goldwater supporter she wore a hat with an auh2o logo and an active member of the young republicans but the teacher jerry baker was intent on challenging her to argue the other side always a dutiful student she agreed settling into the library to pore for hours over johnson s positions on civil rights foreign policy and health care she prepared with such ardor and delivered such a compelling case that she even convinced herself by the time ms rodham graduated from college she was a democrat whenever we would say well who could speak up for this or that for us it was always well let s get hillary to do that said ernie ricketts known then as ricky a childhood friend of hillary rodham clinton s mrs clinton does not possess the retail political skills of her husband former president bill clinton nor can she easily rouse a crowd with a lyrical speech like president obama but on the debate stage she displays an unusual talent and focus and appears at ease and comfortably herself the first democratic primary debate tuesday on cnn will provide mrs clinton with an opportunity to present her policies to voters policies that have been largely overshadowed in the news media by developments over her use of private email at the state department and by the rise of her insurgent opponent senator bernie sanders of vermont but more important the debate perhaps more than any late night appearances or social media gambit will provide mrs clinton with the largest platform yet to make a connection with voters and show off her genuine passion for policy it s who she is at her core said patti solis doyle who was an aide to mrs clinton from 1991 to 2008 and managed her last presidential campaign she s an avid studier she does her homework she s a massive preparer the characteristics that viewers will see in mrs clinton on tuesday are in many ways the same ones that mr baker spotted in his ambitious high school student a half century ago i loved to hone my debating skills with my friends she wrote in her memoir living history i would press poor ricky ricketts into daily debates about world peace baseball scores whatever topic came to mind since then mrs clinton has used debate preparation sessions her own and her husband s as almost cathartic experiences aides say while debating a mock opponent mrs clinton has been known to unleash tirades equal parts venting and joking only to dial it back to a more disciplined response onstage the key is to let her take out all her frustration before she takes that debate stage ms solis doyle said that tactic does not always work mrs clinton nods assiduously when fielding moderators questions and has a knack for reciting statistics and for pivoting smoothly to intricate policy issues whenever the conversation turns personal but there are times when she can hardly veil her sarcasm and disdain maybe we should ask barack if he s comfortable and needs another pillow she said during a debate in 2008 referring to a saturday night live skit in which debate moderators fawned over mr obama over the years mrs clinton has also demonstrated a deftness that has thrown off her male political opponents who are careful to avoid bullying the only woman onstage in one primary debate for the 2008 election she joked that she was wearing an asbestos pantsuit but her biggest victories have come in those fleeting and poignant moments when she allows herself to be vulnerable in her 2000 senate race the moderator tim russert asked mrs clinton how voters could trust her after she had sworn in a tv interview that her husband had not had an adulterous liaison in the white house her eyes welled up and her lips tightened mrs clinton replied i didn t mislead anyone i didn t know the truth and there s a great deal of pain associated with that later in the debate her opponent rick lazio approached her lectern and unsuccessfully insisted she sign a pledge against soft money a move that turned off female viewers mrs clinton cannot always rely on her paid political consultants to help her tap into that softer side however in 2008 the campaign s chief strategist mark penn who oversaw the debate preparation once joked being human is overrated after she finished third in the iowa caucus in 2008 she brought chelsea clinton into a preparation session relying on her daughter s advice and instincts as they both nursed hot tea the move irked some strategists but proved to be just what the candidate needed in the next debate mrs clinton had arguably her best moment of the 2008 primary debates when a moderator asked her about her likability problem she replied well that hurts my feelings to which mr obama quipped you re likable enough hillary she went on to win the new hampshire primary if mrs clinton s debate skills can be traced back to her formative years so can her reliance on politically safe platitudes and her lawyerlike manner as an undergraduate at wellesley college mrs clinton spent more than an hour debating her two opponents in a campaign for student government president according to the student newspaper the wellesley news all three candidates were equally vague as to exactly how they would implement the change in the power structure they had proposed mrs clinton went on to win the election john spencer who challenged mrs clinton in her 2006 senate re election race said the only time he got the best of her was when he was able to expose that she s like a palm tree blowing this way and that depending on what is politically expedient in the 2008 campaign mrs clinton wavered on her position regarding driver s licenses for undocumented immigrants an unforced error that went on to haunt her candidacy of all the many hours of debating that was in my estimation her one noticeable error said howard wolfson a former adviser who portrayed mr obama in some 2008 practice sessions when making her case at the podium mrs clinton often points a finger in the air and allows her voice to crescendo as she lays out data points to prove her argument but she has stumbled when attempting to land canned one liners at a primary debate in texas in 2008 audience members cringed when mrs clinton all but accused mr obama of plagiarizing a speech lifting whole passages from someone else s speeches is not change you can believe in she said it s change you can xerox mrs clinton seemed much more at ease in a debate in las vegas that year discussing the intricacies of the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository in nevada and the need for regulating predatory mortgage lending practices mr obama listened intently hillary s exactly right he said advertisement
