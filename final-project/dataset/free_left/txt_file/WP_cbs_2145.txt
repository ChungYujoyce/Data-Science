asserted he had the authority to do so even though the funding is appropriated by congress critics of the president disagree the administration is going through a 60 day review process to determine where to redirect the funding the officials said although they weren t aware of any entity actively investigating the who itself mr trump said the funding would be halted pending a review of the institution today i m instructing my administration to halt funding of the who while a review is conducted to assess the who s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus the president said tuesday night during his daily coronavirus briefing the u s still owes roughly 65 million in who member contributions after paying about 58 million of the roughly 122 million that has been assessed there is also an additional 300 to 400 million that the u s voluntarily contributes to the who that isn t earmarked by congress and the administration is looking for new partners on the ground to use that funding instead the u s pays more into the who which is a part of the united nations than any other country among other things the who is tasked with preparing for pandemics and other health emergencies and advising on the response when presenting options to the president the senior administration officials said that they told him he 100 has the authority to reprogram this money and to pause it right now to do that review because the funding doesn t have to be obligated until september 30 the senior administration officials said there isn t any specificity that the money must go to the who just that it must go to international organizations the fact that we were planning to spend 122 to the who isn t binding on us one senior administration official said congress statements notwithstanding we don t have to get their approval to change where we re spending it they put it as a broad bucket of money that gives the administration discretion on where to spend it while the officials said they don t need permission from congress to reallocate the funds they will comply with notification and reprogramming requirements the who is now assessing how its programs would be affected by any withdrawal of u s funds the united states of america has been a long standing and generous friend to the who and we hope it will continue to be so

global fight against the coronavirus pandemic is senseless house speaker nancy pelosi said in a statement we can only be successful in defeating this global pandemic through a coordinated international response with respect for science and data but sadly as he has since day one the president is ignoring global health experts disregarding science and undermining the heroes fighting on the frontline at great risk to the lives and livelihoods of americans and people around the world this is another case as i have said of the president s ineffective response that a weak person a poor leader takes no responsibility a weak person blames others she continued this decision is dangerous illegal and will be swiftly challenged patrice harris president of the american medical association
