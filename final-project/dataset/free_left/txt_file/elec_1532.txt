the big idea ted cruz had a super tuesday the texas senator has suffered through a string of rough news cycles from losing evangelicals to donald trump in south carolina to firing his communications director and finishing behind marco rubio in nevada get more must read campaign news and analysis delivered directly to your email inbox with the daily 202 but cruz finally caught a few big breaks last night and he could now emerge once again as the best bet to stop trump he won his home state of texas by 17 points the day s biggest delegate prize the neighboring state of oklahoma in a surprise and the caucuses in alaska underscoring his appeal to libertarians and in spite of sarah palin s support for trump he lost arkansas to trump by just 2 points rubio meanwhile had a very disappointing night and continues to not live up to his potential he won only the minnesota caucuses and wound up losing virginia which was fertile territory and where he campaigned hard besides the obvious reality check that the florida senator has won just one of the first 15 states that s a 1 14 record in football terms he finished third yesterday behind cruz in several states where he ought to have finished second including tennessee where he had the backing of gov bill haslam and sen lamar alexander and massachusetts top rubio campaign officials told donors before results came in yesterday that they might win outright in arkansas and oklahoma he finished third in both of those places too despite campaigning hard in alabama over the weekend rubio only pulled in 18 7 percent and he got a point less than that in texas where he campaigned and his team expected to do better this means he fell beneath the 20 percent threshold to collect any delegates from those states and it bears noting that in several states democrats voted for rubio to try embarrassing trump cruz today has far more delegates than rubio and he doesn t have gang of eight baggage he has well funded super pacs he s invested in building organizations for the upcoming caucus states and to collect delegates from places like guam and the virgin islands delegate count estimate trump 241 cruz 224 rubio 108 kasich 18 carson 3 nytpolitics 3 2 https t co gcqxzjx1hq to be clear on the day with the most delegates at stake trump won seven of 11 states he romped in the deep south while proving again that he s not a regional candidate his strongest performance actually came in massachusetts where he took 49 percent of the vote the post s dan balz declares that the window for stopping trump has now closed almost completely he explains that the demoralized anti trump forces are very unlikely to agree upon a strategy to stop the new york billionaire there s this fallacy that some small group can get together and decide the outcome of this former utah gov mike leavitt told him that does not exist that stipulated balz argues cruz can now claim with more credibility the mantle of the true conservative in a conservative party against a front runner with no clear ideology and views at odds with gop orthodoxy whether that s enough to win in northern states is an open question the fix s chris cillizza also declares cruz a winner and rubio a loser of the night suddenly cruz looks like the favorite to be the alternative to trump plus the votes between tuesday and the march 15 primaries louisiana kansas etc look like potential cruz wins the establishment loathes cruz but they may reconsider if faced with a binary choice between trump and cruz cruz is not my favorite by any means but we may be in a position where we have to rally around cruz as the only way to stop trump i m not so sure that would work sen lindsey graham r s c said on cbs asked if he would recommend rallying behind cruz to stop trump graham said yes i can t believe i would say yes but yes he said by all accounts the gop field will stay scattered which works to trump s advantage kasich came within three points of winning vermont we have absolutely exceeded expectations he said promising to fight on in michigan and ohio rubio in miami claimed a late surge and predicted he ll win florida on march 15 his home state is winner take all if he loses there he s done polls show him trailing and it s not a sure thing he can pull it out in the tallahassee and jacksonville dmas shared with georgia trump is beating rubio 49 6 to 17 2 supertuesday ben carson said he s not ready to quit quite yet which means he ll continue to dilute the anti trump evangelical vote as cruz himself correctly pointed out during his speech in houston so long as the field remains divided donald trump s path to the nomination remains more likely as of today the republican national convention in cleveland seems like theonly place trump can still be stopped cruz and rubio camps are no longer pretending they can win this nomination before cleveland both camps pushing convention scenarios consolidation is not going to happen candidates and outside groups need to keep hitting trump and let the chips fall where they may the you drop out no you drop out talk is as useless now as it was 2wks ago cruz and rubio need to continue the all out assault on trump importantly though cruz s success is showing palpable signs of galvanizing not just his supporters some of whom were thinking about jumping ship if he had a bad night but other movement conservatives david bossie the president of the conservative advocacy group citizens united told david weigel that it is now time for rubio to end his campaign and let cruz take trump on erick erickson formerly of redstate now at the resurgent it is time for rubio behind by double digits in his home state to accept he will not be the nominee it is time for cruz to accept we need a unity ticket and for rubio to agree to be cruz s vice presidential pick uniting the outsider and insider factions of the party and stopping trump in the process the non trump faction has the delegates to stop trump but now there must be unity conservative review s daniel horowitz cruz is the only one who can win back enough of the conservative voters trump is winning rubio lacks the ability to make inroads to those voters and many of cruz s voters would go to trump instead of rubio were cruz to drop out the florida senator dominated the media coverage and endorsements for the entire week yet he failed from the conservative washington examiner in terms of actually getting delegates to win cruz is probably the only hope and he s a longshot others might serve a tactical purpose bill kristol the executive editor of the weekly standard was a little more sanguine cruz and rubio together have won more votes and more delegates than trump so far he said so they just have to combine simple cruz rubio 2016 for democrats the political revolution is not to be hillary clinton accelerated her march to the democratic nomination she swept the south with the exception of oklahoma which has few delegates after getting whooped in new hampshire she showed she can win in new england by carrying massachusetts it was the closest contest of the night on the democratic side she prevailed by a point but a win is a win bernie sanders did not make the inroads he needed to among minority voters none of the states with large african american and latino populations were even close hrc extinguished the bern in alabama 78 19 arkansas 66 30 georgia 71 28 tennessee 66 32 texas 65 33 and virginia 64 35 but but but by winning four states sanders got a rationale to carry on he prevailed in the colorado and minnesota caucuses demonstrating that he can continue forcing clinton to spend money and tack leftward speaking in his home state of vermont which he won handily he pledged to stay in until all 50 states have voted delegates are awarded proportionally so sanders will still get some from the states where he got blown out the sanderscampaign invited reporters to a path forward breakfast later this morning where they ll outline a theory of the case by saturday the senator will campaign in maine michigan nebraska kansas missouri illinois and ohio and he ll have the money to stay in as long as he wants he raised 42 million in february including 6 million on monday alone still all the pundits are calling the race for clinton the sanders challenge was doomed by a fatal flaw democrats aren t as unhappy as he needed them to be dana milbank writes while 89 percent of republicans think we re on the wrong track only 34 percent of democrats do our exit poll in virginia found that six in 10 democratic voters wanted to continue obama s policies clinton won those voters by about 60 points while sanders held a 2 to 1 lead among those who wanted more liberal policies experience was the most desired quality about a third of voters picked it as the most important attribute in choosing who to vote for and hillary won nine in 10 of them every republican incumbent with a primary challenge survived alabama sen richard shelby avoided a runoff by pulling 65 percent of the vote so did gop incumbent reps martha roby and bradley byrne the birmingham newsreports and in texas house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady and rules committee chairman pete sessions each easily won kelsey snell rubio s suburban strategy did pay some dividends he came within 3 points of winning virginia because of his strength in the suburbs outside d c and richmond but trump overwhelmed his competitors in more rural areas including the shenandoah valley to the west and the tidewater region in the south and drew enough votes in the suburbs to emerge victorious paul schwartzman explains trump was able to hold off rubio in part because kasich also took votes in northern virginia including 16 percent in fairfax city and 12 percent in falls church my god there d be no finer metaphor than dc suburb republicans trying valiantly to halt trump and coming up just short from our virginia exit poll 55 percent of republican voters said they would be dissatisfied with trump becoming the party s nominee those who made up their minds in the past week broke for rubio over trump 39 19 trump won men by 10 points but lost women to rubio by five points trump won voters who have no more than a high school diploma by 29 points rubio won republicans with college degrees ken cuccinelli has relatively little juice in his home state the former virginia attorney general who nearly won the governorship in 2013 went all in for cruz he even showed up at a rubio event on sunday to criticize him wandering around the press pen unstaffed in the end cruz got just 17 percent he even finished third among evangelicals trump got 37 percent to rubio s 28 percent and cruz s 19 percent more record turnout numbers for republicans four times as many voted in virginia as in 2012 and more than twice as many as voted in 2008 trump tried to act like the presumptive nominee during a half hour press conference he painted clinton as a d c insider and called himself a common sense conservative i am a unifier he said when we unify there s nobody nobody that s going to beat us but in trump s always unorthodox fashion the first time candidate declared victory on his own terms there was no watch party with supporters jenna johnson notes no packed suburban hotel ballroom lined with televisions blaring results and commentary no open bar passed appetizers or themed drinks no lengthy victory speech with his wife at his side no balloons he still does not have a pollster or a speechwriter hillary also focused her victory speech on the general with an eye on trump america never stopped being great she said in miami we have to make america whole we have to fill in what s been hollowed out she added it s clear tonight that the stakes of this election have never been higher and the rhetoric we re hearing on the other side has never been lower in a taste of what the general election could feel like trump said during his speech that he thinks make america great again has a much better ring to it than make america whole again the most memorable moment of last night chrischristie s pained expression as trump spoketotally dominated the online conversation christiespent the entire speech screaming wordlessly alexandra petri writes i have never seen someone scream so loudly without using his mouth before it would have been remarkable if it had not been so terrifying it was not a thousand yard stare that would understate the vast and impenetrable distance it encompassed he looked as if he had seen a ghost and the ghost had made him watch mufasa die again he had the eyes of a man who haslooked into the heart of light the silence a man who had seen the moment of his greatness flicker and seen the eternal footman holdhis coat and snicker in short he looked afraid here s some reaction to a moment that will fuel the new jersey governor s fallfrom grace with conservatives just
