watch cbsn live by christina capatides april 17 2020 1 07 pm cbs news speaking with fox news sean hannity on thursday tv doctor mehmet oz ignited a social media firestorm by saying that reopening america s schools presented an appetizing opportunity because it might only kill 2 to 3 more people we need our mojo back oz said let s start with things that are really critical to the nation where we think we might be able to open without getting into a lot of trouble i tell you schools are a very appetizing opportunity i just saw a nice piece in the lancet medical journal arguing that the opening of schools may only cost us 2 3 in terms of total mortality and you know any life is a life lost but to get every child back into a school where they re safely being educated and being fed and making the most out of their lives with a theoretical risk on the backside it might be a tradeoff some folks would consider many viewers interpreted oz s comments as if he were alluding to 2 3 of the u s population the population of the united states is just over 328 million so to lose 2 3 of the population would mean anywhere between 6 56 million and 9 84 million deaths if as suggested in the lancet editorial that oz was referencing he was referring instead to a 2 3 increase in projected coronavirus deaths that would still equate to thousands of lives lost the backlash on twitter was swift and fierce propelling the hashtag firedroz into the platform s top trending phrases for hours dr oz schools are a very appetizing opportunity i just saw a nice piece in the lancet arguing the opening

gone from operating on hearts to not having one teamdl many twitter users misinterpreted dr oz s words as if he were condoning the sacrifice of 2 3 of american schoolchildren but he was actually referring to 2 3 of the disease s overall fatality rate since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic doctors and public health officials have consistently found that the mortality rate among children is very low everyone arguing that only 2 3 of children dying isn t a big deal to get the dow back on track needs to identify 1 or 2 kids that they are willing to offer up to death name them imagine being such a heartless ghoul that you think losing only 2 3 of children to coronavirus deaths is an acceptable number to sacrifice at the altar of the economy how much are your kids worth droz https t co yusss7a3ke on thursday evening dr oz posted a video to twitter responding to the criticism and wrote i ve realized my comments on risks around opening schools have confused and upset people which was never my intention i misspoke i ve realized my comments on risks around opening schools have confused and upset people which was never my intention i misspoke pic twitter com kq1utwicjr as a heart surgeon i spent my career fighting to save lives in the operating room by minimizing risks dr oz says in the video at the same time i m being asked constantly how will we be able to get people back to their normal lives to do that one of the important steps will be figuring out how do we get our children safely back to school we know for many kids school is a place of security nutrition and learning that is missing right now these are issues we are all wrestling with and i will continue looking for solutions to beat this virus oz is far from alone there seems to be a growing chorus of everyday americans and public officials who want businesses and schools to be reopened as soon as possible under the belief that some level of mortality increase might be better than the devastating effects a prolonged lockdown will have on the economy on tuesday republican congressman trey hollingsworth of indiana said it is always the american government s position to say in the choice between the loss of our way of life as americans and the loss of life of american lives we have to always choose the latter it is policymakers decision to put on our big boy and big girl pants and say this is the lesser of these two evils he continued in the radio interview and it is not zero evil but it is the lesser of these evils and we intend to move forward in that direction similarly in late march texas lieutenant governor dan patrick faced backlash after suggesting that he d be willing to die to restart the american economy and he thinks other grandparents would as well i just think there are lots of grandparents out there in this country like me he told fox news tucker carlson in a tv interview on thursday afternoon president trump unveiled a plan to start reopening the american economy in three phases depending on local conditions during a video call with governors from around the country and while it remains to be seen exactly how that will unfold one thing is for certain the debate over the morality of prioritizing economic concerns over american lives shows no signs of abating any time soon first published on april 17 2020 1 07 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights
