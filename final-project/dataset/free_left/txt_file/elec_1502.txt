 first read is a morning briefing from meet the press and the nbc political unit on the day s most important political stories and why they matter another american institution takes a hit a week out from election day here s the only thing we re sure of after friday s bombshell political news that the federal bureau of investigation is one again looking at hillary clinton s emails another u s institution the fbi has taken a hit it s especially true after all of the obvious leaks coming from the fbi and justice department and that news isn t good for the country s democracy back in 2014 our national nbc wsj poll looked at americans confidence in 15 different institutions and industries and majority had confidence in just two of them so this lack of confidence in american institutions was taking place before this presidential election and you can only imagine what the situation is going to look like afterwards as for comey and his decision to make his announcement 11 days before an election we understand he was in a lose lose situation if he withheld this information before the election it could have been equally damaging but the problem was how vague comey s letter to congress was as well as the fact that it was sent before the fbi even had access to the emails it s hard to reconcile comey being so transparent with a july press conference and then testimony to capitol hill over a matter where there were no charges and then so opaque in a letter to congress just days before the election this site is protected by recaptchaprivacy policy terms of service team trump deals with its share of negative stories while the clinton campaign is still dealing with the fallout from friday s news halloween night saw several tough stories aimed at team trump there was the new york times report on new tax documents showing trump used a legally dubious method to avoid paying taxes nbc news reported that the fbi has been conducting a preliminary inquiry into donald trump s former campaign manager paul manafort s foreign business connections and mother jones reported that a veteran spy gave the fbi information alleging a russian operation to cultivate ties to trump trump and pence to give health care speech today in pennsylvania meanwhile trump and running mate mike pence will deliver a policy speech to repeal and replace obamacare it s a smart move for the trump camp to focus on policy when everyone is paying attention a trump aide previews the speech to nbc s peter alexander the speech will be delivered along with several of those congressional leaders who the trump administration will work with to immediately repeal and replace it what s even more powerful is that we ll have gov pence there to address how he has successfully navigated indiana through this mess and created a model for other states to follow clinton s lead remains steady after comey s bombshell per nbc surveymonkey tracking poll this week s nbc surveymonkey tracking poll has clinton ahead by 6 points over trump in the four way horserace 47 41 which is exactly where it was last week moreover that six point 47 41 lead was identical in interviews before the comey news monday through friday and after saturday and sunday more from the poll likely voters were split on whether they thought the controversial announcement by the fbi was an important issue to discuss or more of a distraction to the campaign a slight majority of likely voters nationwide 55 percent said it was an important issue forty four percent said the news was more of a distraction to the campaign now the national washington post abc tracking poll has trump up a point though that s in contrast to the other tracking polls we ve seen after the comey news did the comey surprise hurt democrats downballot chances the comey surprise might not have hurt hillary clinton s presidential chances but it might have hurt downballot democrats who were counting on a large clinton margin over trump while fbi director james comey s email bombshell is unlikely to dent her white house chances democrats fear it might shorten her coattails and threaten their prospects of retaking the senate nbc s alex seitz wald writes it s certainly not helpful said missouri democratic party chairman roy temple it kind of pollutes the democratic brand in a way that s unnecessary simply because it doesn t actually involve any new information which is why the frustration at comey is so high right now more the slightest breeze in any direction can really push these races one way or another said ian prior of the senate leadership fund a deep pocketed gop super pac all you need is need is 01 percent in a close race by the way a monmouth poll from yesterday showed a tied race in indiana s senate race which isn t good news for
