the salespeople at ideal health were thrilled when they heard donald trump would become the new face of their company the new york real estate mogul whose reality show the apprentice made him famous licensed his name to the firm which was then rebranded as the trump network in 2009 oh my god people cried when they heard it was him says jenna knudsen who worked as a high ranking saleswoman for ideal health at the time they cried and looked at each other and said we re going to be millionaires knudsen and her colleagues sold customized vitamins and other health products as part of a controversial business model known as multilevel marketing in which companies pay salespeople commissions for selling products and recruiting more representatives trump whose presidential campaign is based in part on his reputation as a businessman is well known for licensing his name to golf courses hotels clothing wine and many other products but in this case he became involved in an industry that consumer advocates had long criticized as promising financial independence to sales recruits but rarely delivering it ideal health had already faced complaints about its practices trump says he was not involved in the company s operations but statements by him and other company representatives as well as a plethora of marketing materials circulating online often gave the impression of a partnership that was certain to lift thousands of people into prosperity in fact within a few years the company fell on hard times leaving some salespeople in tough financial straits it ultimately was acquired by another firm but when trump joined forces with ideal health he was enthusiastic about its future when i did the apprentice it was a long shot this is not a long shot trump told a trump network convention of at least 5 000 people in miami in 2009 his face projected onto a giant screen this is going to be something that s really amazing it s going to be our company as a group he added sales peopleaffiliated with the newly branded company also highlighted the relationship we re working on projects behind the scenes every single day with mr trump kim stone who was one of the highest level sales representativesin the company says in a videothat was posted onlinein early 2010 literally you will be able to set yourself up for the rest of your life financially speaking if you take advantage of the timing right now with this company in an interview stone said many salespeople believed trump would be more involved initially when the owners said we re all becoming trump network they kind of led the field to believe he was financially a part of it she said and technically it was just this branding deal trump attorneyalan garten said in a statement that trump has always been transparent about his relationship with the network some materials such as the company s website did contain fine print disclosures his role in the trump network was limited to licensing the trump brand and providing motivational speeches to its members mr trump was never an owner of the trump network he also was not involved in the manufacturing or sale of any of the trump network s products gartensaid to be clear mr trump s role in the trump network was clearly disclosed to everyone involved in the company and its members whether it be in the member s independent contractor agreements the marketing materials or on the products themselves interviews with nine former salespeopleandindustry and academic experts as well as court filings federal trade commission complaints and trump network documents and videos that remain online today tell the story of trump leveraging his name and reputation only to leave some disappointed when imagined benefits did not materialize trump network is not the first trump affiliated company to receive scrutiny another of trump s branding arrangements has become a topic in the campaign trump university which has been sued along with trump for promising to teach people unique ways to make money in real estate a program that would costthousands of dollars without actually delivering any effective lessons students also say they were misled about the extent of trump s involvement trump has rejected the allegations some of trump network s salesrepresentativeswho suffered after the company ran into trouble say the lack of commitment by trump and the trump network s owners let them down knudsen who had reached one of the company s top sales ranks had thousands of people working under her and at one point was earning thousands of dollars a month ended up losing her house her car purchased as part of the company s rewards program was repossessed in the middle of the night she said she was a single mother with no alimony and no child support and her kids were traumatized they changed us to the trump network so we thought we were his company he was invested in us but we were just an endorsement we were just paying to rent his name knudsen said was trump to blame we don t know but he certainly did not do what he said he did not support us he did not make this company his baby company and somewhere between the owners and donald trump they devastated thousands of people and no one ever apologized the road to the trump network when he set his sights on ideal health in the late 2000s trump did not hint at any qualms about the industry i m a big fan of network marketing trump said at the miami convention in 2009 which featured circus performers on stilts and a massive dance party ideal health was started in 1997 by scott stanwood his brother todd and lou decaprio who had worked together in the multilevel marketing business ideal health s flagship product later the trump network s was a multivitamin tailored for customers based on a urine test it cost 139 95 plus 69 95 a month for the vitamins plus 99 95 for additional testingevery six months former salespeoplepraised the product saying it helped customers live healthier lives but some experts say it was of questionable value there s very little evidence to suggest that this test is going to provide you with clinically meaningful information or that the supplements they provide are going to make you healthy said timothy caulfield a public health professor at the university of alberta and longtime analyst of alternative medicine but most of the controversy surrounding ideal health and later the trump network stems from how these companies rewarded and recruited sales representatives althoughmany multilevel marketing companies are legal the ftc has called some thinly disguised pyramid schemes scott stanwood said he couldn t comment because ofconfidentiality agreements with the trump organization he said he was speaking on behalf of ideal health and the trump network s other owners as is common with the model trump network sales representativesmade money when they sold products and when salespeopleworking under them made purchases they weren t employees so they weren t guaranteed a salary and because salespeoplepaid upfront for products each month they bore a lot of the risk a trump network compensation plan shows that those in sales were promised big rewards for recruitment a hypothetical example presented by the company showed that salespeoplecould build levels of salespeopleunder them and would earn commissions of 100 25 or 20 each time a new recruit bought a business starter kit for 497 extraordinary growth on level 7 the plan says 2 187 people x 20 a lot of money in one complaint to the ftc obtained through afreedom of information act request by the washington post one former salesrepresentativerecounted spending 1887 75 on starter kits and other materials t hey kept tricking me into believing that i will make money just by selling more products and inviting more people but the rate of return is so low the consumer who is not identified wrote in other words they are scamming and deceiving people making them believe that if they just hang in there they will make money garten saidthe trump network did not receive any complaints from the ftc katie baker an attorney with the ftc said that the ftc does not reach out to companies to resolve individual complaints but merely analyzes andcompiles them well before trump got involved ideal health had faced similar questions about its business practices according to documents made public by a 2004 freedom of information act request by the minneapolis law firm mansfield tanick cohen salesrepresentativessaid they paid thousands of dollars for leadership programs infomercials starter kits and other materials that they never recovered in sales one consumer said theyjoined the company expecting to make a five figure monthly income butinstead ended up spending 8 956 20 on promotional materials another claimed they were encouraged to mortgage their home for 70 000 to buy shares in tv advertising they try to use people s hopes and dreams to empty their wallets reads one complaint following in donald trump s footsteps trump was not new to multilevel marketing he already had been involved for several years with acn inc a company that sells phone and other services according to documents released earlier this year by his campaign in2014 and 2015 trumpreceived 1 35 million in fees for three speaking engagements with acn acn said that trump was a paid keynote speaker at several company events as were many other industry and business experts and that he was not involved in any other facet of the business trump was introduced to ideal health in early 2008 through dean blechman a former chief executiveof ideal health and another associate according to acourt documentfrom a subsequent separation lawsuit between blechman and ideal health ideal health was under capitalized blechman said and the companywas seeking a partnership to expand its recognition so he and two other business contacts arranged a meeting with trump at his office in manhattan blechman says trump liked the idea of promoting health as well as creating jobs and income for people through direct marketing i brought the company a hundreds of millions of dollarrevenue opportunity blechman said there was nobody in the world nobody not a single person in the world that was more perfect than donald trump at first trump considered taking a stake in the company according to the court document trump s attorneygarten said the billionaire became involved with the trump network because he believed in the strength of the management team but said only a licensing agreement was ever envisioned ultimately in march 2009 the parties settled on an agreement in which ideal health would license trump s likeness and trademarks and trump would promote its products trump s endorsement persuadedsome salespeople to quit their day jobs and recruit friends family and neighbors to join according to interviews and contemporary news stories the network grew to more than 20 000 people from 5 000 before his involvement the boston globe reported in 2010 as many americans were confronting the aftermath of the financial crisis and the great recession trump touted the network as a salvation the economic meltdown greed and ineptitude in the financial industry havesabotaged the dreams of millions of people americans need a new plan he said in an introductory video they need a new dream the trump network wants to give millions of people renewed hope and with an exciting plan to opt out of the recession sara harper a former trump network saleswoman in san diego said the overall message she and her colleagues received made it easy to think that trump was a substantial part of the business a picture was painted that he was involved at a level of business decision making that i don t think he really was she said several salespeople said that following in trump s footsteps was a major attraction people saw the trump network as an opportunity to be associated with the biggest business brand in the world says lenny izzo a chiropractor who was one of the trump network s top salespeople with trump coming in they hyped it up to make us believe oh it s not going to take us long now we re going to make money so much faster said yvonne zook who was a mid level sales representative but over the next few years according to several of the salespeople far fewer people started showing up at the annual conferences and by late 2011 some suddenly stopped receiving their payments and beganto leave the company garten said many people enjoyed financial success with the network but like with any business venture you get what you put into it he said headded that any problems at the trump network that came up were solely the result of the financial crisis others though suggest alternativereasons for why the company struggled including mismanagement and profligacy by the owners such as spending on anew office and flashy promotional events and an awkward fit between the trump brandand ahealth and wellness product some sales representativesdon t criticize trump for the business s struggles saying he did his best in a limited relationship he did exactly what he was asked to do and i think that s why people were excited because they thought that this could be the turnaround for the company because they felt that he had the business sense said carolyn connolly a top saleswoman according to public records the trump network s owners todd and scott stanwood and lou decaprio filed for bankruptcy the trio lost the 8 000 square foot home with an infinity pool where they lived together north of boston aroundthe end of 2011 trump s licensing contract ended and in early 2012 the business was sold to another company bioceutica for an undisclosed sum trump s attorneysays those in sales who signed on withbioceutica received outstanding payments bioceutica declined to comment izzo says that trump could have saved the company if he had stepped in but he didn t have good reason to do that izzo who also went bankrupt added could he have approached this differently absolutely could he have taken less fees could he have stepped in and guided the company differently he could have but that wasn t the choice alice crites contributed to this report see also the myth and the reality of donald trump s business empire
