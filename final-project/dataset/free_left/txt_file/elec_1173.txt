advertisement supported by she wants to purify capitalism so that it works as it should by michelle goldberg opinion columnist on tuesday night after the latest democratic debate ann coulter tweeted sen warren has convinced me that bernie isn t that worrisome he ll never get anything done she s the freak who will show up with 17 idiotic plans every day and keep everyone up until it gets done vicious reactionary that she is coulter cut to the heart of elizabeth warren s promise warren has an almost supernatural ability to identify problems before anyone else and to work relentlessly to solve them of all the democratic candidates she would make the most effective president full disclosure my husband a graphic designer and creative director works as a consultant for her in 2007 warren then a harvard law professor wrote an article in the journal democracy calling for the creation of what she called a financial product safety commission it is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one in five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house she wrote but it is possible to finance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same one in five chance of putting the family out on the street this was before a cascade of mortgage failures set off the financial crisis which she foresaw warren realized that complexity was being used against consumers pointing out that a typical credit card contract had grown from one page in the 1980s to more than 30 pages two decades later ordinary people didn t understand the terms they were agreeing to allowing lenders to fleece them four years later her brainchild now called the consumer financial protection bureau was a reality it s no small thing for someone who had little direct government experience to single handedly spearhead the creation of a new agency the c f p b has since provided 12 4 billion in relief to 31 million consumers i was one of them as i ve written before i turned to the c f p b after discovering that my bank had enrolled me without my knowledge in a dubious program that purported to protect users credit the bank had been fined 700 million in connection with it but that didn t get me my money back so i went to the c f p b website where i filled out a simple form a few weeks later my bank notified me that i was being refunded more than 11 000 that experience is part of why my husband signed up to consult with warren to design her logo he went to the statue of liberty to find the precise color of green what amazed me about the c f p b was its seamlessness as will wilkinson has written warren s agenda with its blizzard of plans and calls for big structural change has been painted as contentiously ideological and bureaucratically suffocating this perception is upside down warren s genius is using the regulatory process to make it simple for ordinary people to stand up to financial behemoths she knows how excessive bureaucracy can be a tool of domination and how to defend people from it even if a democrat wins the presidency in november democrats won t be able to pass significant legislation unless they both take the senate and eliminate the filibuster that will make warren s mastery of the levers of executive power particularly important as a senator she s known for zeroing in on seemingly obscure appointments understanding how say having the wrong person as an under secretary for domestic finance could translate into real world suffering she has plans to use executive action to address problems like student loan debt and prescription drug prices warren also has the most inspirational personal story of any of the contenders the daughter of a maintenance man she dropped out of college to get married then returned to school to become a special ed teacher when she lost her job after getting pregnant she went to law school and soared to the top of her field many candidates would present such an extraordinary rise as evidence of unique personal grit but warren sees it as a parable about how good government policy can enable social mobility unlike bernie sanders she doesn t carry the electoral albatross of socialism she wants to purify capitalism of stifling corruption so that it works as it should not for nothing is her dog bailey named after the virtuous small town banker played by jimmy stewart in it s a wonderful life under trump american government has become a squalid orgy of self dealing there is not a person on earth better suited to clean it up than warren if this were a jimmy stewart movie she d come from behind to win the nomination right now that possibility looks remote but as long as she s still in the race and most of america hasn t voted it s not too late for the nightmare of the trump era to give way to a
