advertisement supported by by alexander burns dallas vice president mike pence laid out a hopeful vision for the midterm elections this week as he campaigned for representative pete sessions of texas telling republican donors that candidates like mr sessions could stop democrats from winning the house in november the road they know to their majority comes right through pete s district mr pence said referring to this city s vote rich suburbs of undecided moderates he added make sure the red wave starts here mr pence was deploying a favorite image of both republicans and democrats this fall an electoral tidal wave of voters carrying their party to power in congress but the point of his trip was not to stir a wave it was to build a wall as they brace for losses in the house of representatives republican party leaders are racing to reinforce their candidates in about two dozen districts trying to create a barricade around their imperiled majority they are pouring money and effort mainly into moderate suburban areas like mr sessions s seat that they see as critical to holding the chamber by even a one seat margin and they have begun to pull millions of dollars away from republican candidates who have fallen substantially behind in once competitive races republicans steering the house effort who insisted on anonymity to discuss party strategy believe that by intensifying their efforts in a smaller number of districts they can limit democratic gains to perhaps 20 seats on nov 6 just short of the 23 seats democrats need to take over the house party leaders are counting on a surge of energy from conservative voters to repel democrats in many of the redder districts on the house map so that they can concentrate their advertising on teetering purple seats republicans in congress and the white house see a democratic takeover in the house as a mortal threat potentially allowing the opposition party to bring the republican agenda to a halt and launch far reaching investigations that could put the trump administration under siege there are between 60 and 70 republican held districts that are being seriously contested and democrats boosted by strong fund raising have been expanding their television advertising in conservative leaning districts in an effort to stretch republicans thin national polls have shown most voters favor a democratic led house over a republican one though the democrats lead has varied hey i m alex burns a politics correspondent for the times send me your questions using the nyt app i ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail in a tactical retreat republican groups have already withdrawn some or all funding from a few embattled incumbents mainly in suburbs where president trump is unpopular including representatives kevin yoder of kansas mike coffman of colorado and mike bishop of michigan they have abandoned more than half a dozen seats where republican lawmakers are not running for re election on wednesday they cut loose the tucson ariz based seat of representative martha mcsally who left to run for senate party strategists said several other incumbents must recover quickly or risk losing funding including representatives peter roskam of illinois and mimi walters of california who represent white collar suburbs near chicago and los angeles respectively former representative thomas m davis iii of virginia a former chairman of the national republican congressional committee said the g o p might be helped by the renewed energy of its base following the battle over justice brett m kavanaugh s nomination to the supreme court but he added that independent voters remained a challenge you want to hold your losses to 20 or 22 mr davis said underscoring republicans vanishingly thin margin for error this is the kind of year where republicans are going to have to give up on some races and they re going to have to make some hard choices matt gorman a spokesman for the republican committee said the party is continually evaluating the best way to use our resources and the best paths forward to defending the house our number one goal above all is keeping the majority mr gorman said in a memo circulated to republican donors this week corry bliss who helms the congressional leadership fund a super pac funded heavily by sheldon and miriam adelson laid out the party s precarious position mr bliss said the supreme court fight had boosted republican enthusiasm and a few vulnerable incumbents were looking stronger in polling including representatives will hurd of texas and andy barr of kentucky the adelsons who donated 30 million to the super pac last spring have given millions more from their casino fortune to mr bliss s group in recent weeks but mr bliss said republicans were facing a green wave of democratic money as democratic challengers raise enormous sums online and donors like michael r bloomberg the former new york city mayor pour millions into anti republican ads there are 20 races within four points that will determine the house majority and c l f will keep working to win them mr bliss wrote in the memo a copy of which was obtained by the new york times democrats believe republicans will not be able to shrink the house battlefield democratic groups have taken an aggressive approach to the map probing republican vulnerability even in districts that tilt to the right the democratic congressional campaign committee recently began advertising in six conservative leaning seats from rural pennsylvania to the suburbs of little rock ark where they see republicans slipping on thursday the group began spending money against two more targets representatives brian mast of florida whose red hued district stretches north from palm beach and mia love of utah in the salt lake city suburbs representative ben ray luj n of new mexico who chairs the democratic committee said the landscape of competitive races was already too broad for republicans to build an electoral firewall around a chosen few many of these districts are closing our way mr luj n said adding there are many paths for us to get to a majority mr luj n wryly pointed to mr sessions 63 as an example of republican distress noting that the republican candidate had suggested last year he would not need help from the national party now mr luj n said mr sessions is calling the cavalry home to see if they can defend that seat against colin allred his democratic challenger the dallas race reflects the territory where republicans plan to stand and fight it is a diverse district about half white and a highly educated one with more than two fifths of residents holding college degrees though it has long tilted toward republicans voters favored hillary clinton over president trump in 2016 and mr trump remains unpopular according to polling conducted by both parties the streets are dotted with beto for senate signs and republicans expect senator ted cruz s democratic challenger beto o rourke to carry the area but this is by no means a left leaning district many moderates here tend to be registered republicans and democrats have struggled in the past to mobilize its sizable latino black and asian american communities in congressional elections mr sessions a house committee chairman is in a close race with mr allred 35 a civil rights lawyer whom republicans have sought to brand as a liberal a poll conducted by the times and siena college found the two effectively tied and both parties are saturating the district with advertising house majority pac the main democratic outside group focused on the house began a 2 3 million ad campaign against mr sessions this week attacking his two decade tenure in congress and his vote last year to repeal the affordable care act dallas mayor michael s rawlings a democrat who holds a nonpartisan office said mr sessions was at risk of losing because voters wanted to rebuke washington and mr trump most of all mr rawlings a moderate who has avoided endorsing in house races said he was backing mr allred in part because mr sessions had failed to be a moral leader and challenge offensive trump administration policies like its ban on travel from several predominantly muslim countries this race represents a major part of dallas that is very centrist which i identify with and i m an example of business individuals families that have careers in commerce mr rawlings said he faulted mr sessions for his close alignment with the president saying i think the environment around him changed and he made his choices the way he decided to make them republicans are determined to contain their losses in areas precisely like the one mr rawlings described where most voters have supported republicans in the past private republican polling has shown conservative voters growing more enthusiastic over the last few weeks but democrats are still more energized and moderate voters are currently leaning their way republicans say they are prepared to make ruthless choices in these districts in the suburbs ringing philadelphia for example they may soon redirect money out of an open seat race where they are trailing in pennsylvania s 7th congressional district and funnel it to representatives brian fitzpatrick of pennsylvania and tom macarthur of new jersey who are in difficult races in races where they believe they can rescue embattled incumbents republicans must still overcome suspicion among moderate white voters especially women in pennsylvania for instance patricia hankins a retired computer programmer said she had supported mr fitzpatrick in the past but this year planned to vote for his democratic challenger scott wallace a wealthy investor ms hankins 56 said she still liked mr fitzpatrick but was frustrated by the lack of federal action on gun control and wanted democrats to take the majority the republican party has gone so far to the right that you can t even really have reasonable conversations ms hankins said after mr pence s event in dallas on monday maryann collins a local republican precinct leader expressed optimism that more conservative voters were finally getting energized to block democrats from gaining control ms collins who said she is 86 and proud of it said the supreme court fight had fired a lot of people up they re more determined than ever that they re not going to let the nuts take over ms collins said advertisement
