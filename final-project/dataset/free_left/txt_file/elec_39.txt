nominating conventions are designed to be infomercials for the respective parties it s three days of pomp and staged celebration while there are occasionally bitter fights over nominees or platform positions modern conventions have become highly engineered television spectacles the nominees are anointed future stars jockey for stage time and everyone pretends that the previous 12 months of in fighting never happened the democrats will likely follow this script in philadelphia this year sanders is still working to leverage his influence but he s already pledged to stop trump and he will almost certainly endorse clinton at the convention whatever happens the party will emerge on the back end united and ready to launch the general election campaign for the gop however the convention is shaping up to be a complete trainwreck nothing is working party leaders are contorting themselves every day as they support trump without actually endorsing him or even admitting he s qualified for the job and their nominee is doing everything possible to complicate things hurling racist accusations insulting muslim and lgbt americans and doubling down on positions he ought to be running away from the best indication that the republican convention will be unusual to put it charitably is that hardly anyone wants to speak a speaking slot at a national convention is tremendous opportunity for any politician it s the easiest way to introduce yourself to the country and the financiers who fund campaigns and yet this year republicans are scrambling to avoid being seen anywhere near the trump led convention politico contacted over 50 gop governors senators and house members to gauge their interest in speaking and nearly all of them offered reasons why they couldn t or wouldn t i am not attending said trey gowdy the republican congressman from south carolina i won t be there said florida rep carlos curbelo in the end only a few said they were open to it and everyone else said they weren t planning on it didn t want to or weren t going to cleveland at all or simply didn t respond the list of non attendees is even longer sen ben sasse sen mark kirk sen kelly ayotte illinois gov bruce rauner sen lindsey graham rep mark sanford and many others more will surely emerge as we inch closer to the convention it s hard to overstate how strange this is this is as big as the stage gets in american politics and hardly anyone wants to touch it it s not unexpected however something like 70 percent of country objects to trump s campaign as stuart stevens told politico that s as toxic as we ve seen unless you re shameless i e paul ryan or tucked away in a gerrymandered district supporting trump is a risky move however beneficial it may be in the short term it could be damaging a few years from now when the consequences of nominating trump are apparent to make matters worse the nevertrump forces are still vowing to stage a coup at the convention there are reports that an advance team is heading to cleveland this week in order to lay the groundwork for a contested convention the plan such as it is is to unbind the gop delegates so that they can vote their conscience which is another way of saying overturn the will of their voters this is a noble effort but it won t work the majority of delegates oppose the plan and the rnc knows how devastating it would be to usurp the party s democratically elected nominee at the convention even if many establishment republicans would prefer that trump disappear they aren t willing to challenge their base in such a glaring way but the anti trump forces can still make enough noise at the convention to keep things painfully awkward against the backdrop of a convention conspicuously short on relevant or respectable speakers the rnc will have a difficult time papering over the chaos no matter how they spin it it will be clear to everyone that this is a party without an identity or a prayer of winning in november sean illing is a usaf veteran who previously taught philosophy and politics at loyola and lsu he is currently salon s politics writer follow him on facebook and twitter read his blog here email at silling salon com copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
