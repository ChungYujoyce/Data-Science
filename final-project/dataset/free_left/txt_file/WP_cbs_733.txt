by sunday morning contributing videographer judy lehmberg in 2016 i wrote about whale sharks off the coast of mexico s yucatan peninsula as i was writing about them then i knew they were the biggest fish in the world and that i had to see one in person not just see one i wanted to swim with them that isn t such a crazy idea because whale sharks eat plankton and are therefore harmless to humans or anything else much bigger than a fish egg or small fish last week i finally got my chance i have a group of friends who all used to work with me at lee college in baytown texas we call ourselves either the harpies or the goddesses depending on our mood one of us francisca still teaches at lee another becki has moved to fort worth and way up in the administration at tarrant county college and another joyce has retired to missoula montana before joyce retired she suggested we get together at least once a year and go someplace fun together i didn t know if we would really stick to that or not but we have and we have had some great times together the first year because i was in charge and spend most of my year just outside yellowstone national park we rented a house north of yellowstone the second year becki chose a wonderful cruise along the coast of british columbia and alaska last year when joyce picked we went to long island new york where we visited beaches theodore roosevelt s house went to my first broadway play and ate a lot of lobster i wouldn t want to live in new york city but visiting was lots of fun the play was wonderful and we even got to go to the american museum of natural history and i got to see my first wild horseshoe crabs way bigger than i thought they would be this year francisca chose cancun years and years ago i spent some time on isla mujeres an island visible from cancun but i had never been to cancun proper when she announced her choice i started reading about the area and discovered whale sharks come there this time of year to eat fish eggs and that boats take tourists out to swim with them my swimming with whale sharks dream was going to come true i started looking for a company to take us to the whale sharks and do some snorkeling i found cancun mermaid was ranked well on trip advisor so we booked our excursions with them they provided us with great personal attention and even gave us suggestions of places to go on our own one day when it was too rainy to go snorkeling stacey our guide went snorkeling with me the last day while the rest of the group visited several cenotes the whale sharks were wonderful we boarded a boat with seven other tourists and headed an hour and a half off shore and there out in the middle of the open ocean were whale sharks the first thing i saw as we approached them was there tails they looked so floppy as they propelled the sharks through the water then i saw the rest of their bodies oh my gosh they really exist white spotted gray blue fish the size of cars and buses it is difficult to explain just how wonderful that experience was swimming next to a huge animal that didn t appear to give one wit about me and just went about its business slurping up fish eggs i will never forget it even though the photos i got were terrible luckily i have a friend who does a lot of scuba diving all over the world and had photos to share mexico is working hard to protect whale sharks who were officially listed as endangered in 2016 primarily due to both legal and illegal fishing being accidently caught in large nets and ship collisions there have been some studies that indicate there are around 7 000 whale sharks left but many biologists are not sure that number is correct there may be more than that we do know their numbers have significantly declined in the last 75 years to minimize the impact tourists have on the sharks only two people and their guide are allowed in the water from each boat and the number of boats is limited whale sharks are declining in some areas especially oman and china but they are actually increasing in the philippines taiwan india and the western hemisphere where they are protected i ve always said be careful what you dream because your dreams can come true that is certainly true in this case and i couldn t be happier judy lehmberg is a former college biology teacher who now shoots nature videos for more to watch extended sunday morning nature videos click here watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
