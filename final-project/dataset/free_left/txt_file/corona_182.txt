staying home will stem the coronavirus outbreak but what if you re healthy and bored is it ethical to go for a run in a crowded park go to the store or order delivery many americans in recent weeks have begun working remotely if they haven t been furloughed or laid off schools have canceled classes for weeks and restaurants retail stores bars gyms and other gathering places in dozens of states have shuttered major events were called off with a domino like effect including coachella and south by southwest march madness and virtually all national sporting events and many religious services across the country now at least 42 states have stay at home directives these closures are all attempts to force social distancing a crucially important public health intervention that can help stop transmission of the coronavirus with covid 19 many people in the us will at some point either this year or next get exposed to this virus the centers for disease control and prevention s immunization czar announced this month social distancing health authorities argue can dramatically slow the rate at which the infection spreads helping to ease the burden on the health care system best practices require maintaining at least a six foot distance between yourself and others the closures nationally are largely preventive in some places no one from work or school may have even been sick though increasingly these decisions are being made in response to the rapidly ballooning number of cases of covid 19 the risk that contact with large groups of people will exacerbate transmission of the virus and the growing understanding that the disease can be transmitted by those who are asymptomatic or appear to be relatively healthy at least one study estimated that about 25 percent of coronavirus transmissions may have occurred in pre symptomatic stages meaning it can be spread by people who don t yet know they have it in the united states these efforts have taken on particular urgency as of april 9 the us has the highest number of confirmed cases of the illness to that end the us government has warned against all gatherings of more than 10 people but even with so many public places shuttered for now simple acts in our daily lives even a run in the park raise questions about how social distancing works how should social distancing affect your workouts your weekly manicure play dates for your kids are those risky for an ostensibly healthy person like yourself what do you as a responsible socially conscious human being owe to your fellow men and women particularly those who are sick immunocompromised and older are you breaking the social contract by going to the grocery store or by not going are you overreacting and hurting the economy vox spoke with six experts in public health medicine psychology and bioethics for answers please remember that as the covid 19 landscape transforms week by week so too will the advice this story has been updated to reflect the latest closures as of april 9 vox s kelsey piper makes a strong argument for choosing to stay home as much as possible inconvenient as it may seem to help your fellow human if you are young and healthy you ought to take precautions because doing so can end up saving someone s life she writes leah lagos a new york city based psychologist and author of the upcoming heart breath mind train your heart to conquer stress and achieve success agrees now is the time to do something for your fellow community members she says staying home as much as possible even if you believe you aren t infected is the type of altruistic decision that when performed en masse has the potential to slow the infection rate lagos added it s a term known as flattening the curve and the way it works can be seen below considering and prioritizing the welfare of strangers is difficult lagos acknowledges but it helps to think of them instead as someone else s parent grandparent or child it can be an interesting experiment in compassion for people we don t know a lot of us might be relatively healthy and think we might be able to withstand the rigors of an infection adds jonathan kimmelman director of the biomedical ethics unit at mcgill university in montreal but there s the concern about spreading it to vulnerable individuals as well as the pressure this outbreak will place on our health care system kimmelman invokes the idea of social solidarity saying that we have an ethical obligation to curtail activities practice social distancing and substitute activities with safer alternatives like teleconferencing instead of in person work meetings or even if you live in a city where bars are still open changing a date from a wine bar to a walk outside or just facetime but should you even be going on dates period if the messages are confusing understand that there are different levels of social distancing in effect around the world and that local health departments recommendations currently vary depending on known cases says syra madad an nyc based pathogens specialist who was featured in netflix s docuseries pandemic how to prevent an outbreak still madad notes it is better to operate under the pretense that there is transmission in your community already there s going to be disruption to daily life but we want people to feel empowered by this the decisions you make will ultimately affect the trajectory of this outbreak kate vergara a public health and infectious disease specialist based in chicago and new york city has spent time fighting polio in ethiopia and helping ebola survivors in sierra leone without contracting either disease in order to even begin to approach the ethics of social distancing she says we must have a firm grip on how the virus is spreading covid 19 is not airborne she says it is transmitted through droplets being coughed on or touching something that someone coughed on for example and then touching your face and allowing that pathogen to get into your system through your eyes nose or mouth it s important to practice good hygiene like hand washing which protects not only you but also others when considering the ethics of spending time out and about vergara suggests reframing your view of hand washing in the following way wash your hands before you go out to protect others and wash them again after the activity to protect yourself that goes for visiting the atm the grocery store and the like the cdc has also advised people in certain public settings like stores selling essential goods to wear a cloth mask the cdc recommends several measures to help prevent the spread of covid 19 guidance may change stay informed and stay safe with vox s coronavirus coverage hub between the relentless news alerts social media memes and gossipy texts it s easy to feel overwhelmed anxious and scared we need self care more than ever says lamar hasbrouck a public health physician and former cdc medical epidemiologist it s important during these times to hold fast to any sense of normalcy that you can but try to find prudent ways to do so hasbrouck now picks off peak hours to exercise to minimize contact with others other options include walking jogging or biking outdoors while making sure to maintain distance from others the more ventilated an area the lower the risk of transmission plus if you cough nobody is around and the droplets just fall and hit the ground he says better yet breaking a sweat at home with help from an app or online video grocery shopping will need to happen but instead of going at noon on a saturday when the place is sure to be packed try going really early on a weekday morning if it s still possible order online wash your hands after handling any deliveries just to be safe hasbrouck encourages those who have access to services such as postmates grubhub lyft and instacart to use them it s a good way to social distance he says noting that two main factors when it comes to covid 19 transmission are closeness of contact and duration the handoff is five seconds you go inside and wash your hands or just have them leave it at your doorstep instacart uber eats and other delivery services are offering contactless delivery related this poses some ethical questions however having milk and bread delivered is convenient for you minimizing your exposure to the virus but what about the person doing your grocery shopping or picking up your thai food or the uber driver ferrying you to your significant other s apartment is it right to ask them to assume the risk of being out and about for now many services continue but some are questioning the ethics of ride hailing in particular both because of the impetus to stay home and the risk to drivers if you are sick or feeling unwell companies are urging you not to ride if you do need to use such a service remember that contaminated hands pose a risk to drivers and riders so be ultra diligent about hand hygiene washing or sanitizing your hands before getting in the car and not touching your face at all cracking a window is a smart move for both you and the driver as it promotes airflow if restaurants in your area reopen in coming weeks or if they remain open here are a few things to remember you mainly need to be mindful about the surfaces you touch menus the table condiments things that other patrons might have used says benjamin chapman a professor and food safety extension specialist at north carolina state university chapman says that while he might not know who touched that soy sauce bottle or pepper shaker before him i do know i can break the pathway of transmission by using hand sanitizer or washing my hands with social distancing in mind opt for establishments where it s easy to keep 6 to 8 feet between yourself and other diners and feel free to be a public health nerd like chapman and ask if they re using environmental protection agency approved sanitizing products which they should be in ireland public health officials are encouraging a no parties no playdates no playground policy per the irish times muireann n chr n n a consultant respiratory pediatrician at cork university hospital told the paper in most epidemics young children are the transmitters with covid 19 older people are most at risk but children can spread the disease and at least a small risk of severe illness is present for all age groups in the us school closures are smart vergara says it s a responsible practice for schools to shut down that s several hundred kids interacting in close quarters and kids aren t known for washing their hands very well but that leaves millions of working parents frantic about career responsibilities and unsure of whether it s appropriate to schedule play dates or try to split child care duties with friends lagos worries that play dates during school closures are essentially quasi quarantines defeating the purpose of social distancing kimmelman concurs and though he says no one knows the exact right answer we don t know how things are going to unfold and from my standpoint the risks of underreaction are so much more catastrophic than the risks of overreaction alyssa f westring and stewart d friedman co authors of parents who lead writing in the harvard business review recommended finding inventive ways for children to play together virtually while it may not be feasible to trade off childcare responsibilities depending on quarantine restrictions they wrote consider other ways in which you can make things easier for one another whether it s sharing creative activities to keep the kids entertained or taking turns grocery shopping be open to new ways of doing things the cdc has issued recommendations for travelers arriving from dozens of countries with widespread cases to stay home for 14 days the white house has also encouraged anyone who has been in new york in recent days and left to self quarantine for 14 days because of the rapidly growing number of cases there but if you have a fever or receive new information that someone you know was exposed you re also going to want to radically change your assessment hasbrouck says that likely means self quarantining because that s the ethical decision and you don t want to expose others it s a constant risk assessment and it s more of an art than a science it s about protecting yourself but also being socially responsible look at the trajectory of what s happening in italy we re 11 days behind italy where a national lockdown that began march 10 has curtailed all travel and shuttered nearly all shops schools museums movie theaters and bars says madad some states and cities are observing less stringent measures than others and a federal mandatory quarantine isn t likely but we can undertake distancing measures ourselves one of the things we ve learned from the h1n1 pandemic is that if you educate people they will listen you have to give them the facts
