to president george w bush and tom donilon national security adviser to president barack obama on the top national security and foreign policy threats likely to be faced by the next commander in chief donilon hadley and morell discuss the u s strategy to engage with china from a diplomatic economic technological and military perspective they exchange views on the way forward in nuclear talks with north korea they also evaluate options for dealing with iran in the aftermath of the u s strike on general qassem soleimani donilon and hadley stress the need for better communication and civic engagement among u s constituencies download rate and subscribe here itunes spotifyandstitcher donilon on countering china w e had moments when we thought we were actually in sort of technological competition with the soviet union but we really never really were we had an arms race right but in terms of the fundamentals of the society this is a much more much more direct challenge and it s across a range of technologies which are going to be the technologies the platforms of the future where first mover advantage will mean a lot where really kind of taking leadership positions will mean a lot in terms of our security and our prosperity hadley on north korea i would say to you one of the things i think the insight they had and that president trump had which was right was you re not going to solve this problem with a bottom up traditional arms control approach we tried that three times you re going to have to convince kim jung un to make a strategic shift and that s what the president was trying to do and i think he s right about that you can criticize the tactics all you want but i think that insight that he s got to make a strategic shift to go in another direction if you re going to solve this problem is basically right and the question is can we follow up on that hadley on iran the truth is you can t address effectively iran s activities in the region at the negotiating table you ve got to address them on the ground you have got to have strategies to check iran we had such a strategy in syria late in the game after we had allowed our position quite frankly to deteriorate considerably we ve had a difficulty pursuing and carrying that through iraq is a place quite frankly where the iraqis have had enough of iranian influence it s time for iran to reduce its influence in iraq donilon on technological challenges t echnology needs to be constantly at the situation room table we had obviously generations of policymakers in this country who haven t been as fluent in technology as the future policymakers are going to have to be and if i were back reorganizing the national security council right now i would have technology at the table i d have an assistant to the president deputy national secretary advisor for technology at the table every day because we have all these issues at first impression which are going to be really dominant going forward you really can t manage national security going forward without having some more expertise and more fluency in technology than we ve had to date intelligence matters stephen hadley tom donilon correspondent michael morell producer olivia gazis jamie benson jon miller michael morell steve tom welcome back to intelligence matters it s great to have you back it great to have you both together i m really looking forward to this conversation tom to give credit where credit is due it was your idea to get together some national security advisors at the start of the new year and have a conversation about national security and the challenges we face why did you suggest that tom donilon yeah yeah i suggested it because i think that the current president and the next president are going to face a really broad array of challenges in the national security and foreign policy area you know we re going through a period of significant change in the world we ve had a significant change in direction out of the trump administration in terms of our approach to foreign policy and that the issue of the list of issues is long the issues are in national security foreign policy but also on the domestic side i think that affect foreign policy so i thought it might be interesting to get together with former colleagues to talk about the full range of issues and how the next president whether it s president trump reelected or a democratic president might address those issues michael morell yeah and then steve i sent you a note saying tom had this idea and within five minutes you came back and said great idea you know count me in why did you so quick to say yes stephen hadley we have a lot of discussion that is heavily politically charged and is about the political implications of whatever the issue is of the day tom donilon yeah stephen hadley and i don t think there s enough discussion about the issues themselves what s at stake for the country and what we need to do if we are going to ensure the prosperity and security for the american people going forward that s a conversation that s getting lost in all the politics and i thought your show in particular was a way where we could showcase a bit of a more substantive discussion of what the issues are that are going to determine our future michael morell great so i have this kind of triangle concept of national security i m just going to run this by you guys which is at one corner you have the issues whether it s china or iran or north korea or whatever you want to put there and there the conversation s about objectives and strategy and tactics and at the other corner of the triangle are capabilities our military capabilities diplomatic capabilities intelligence capabilities to actually carry out those strategies and those tactics and then at the final corner of the triangle you have sort of political will to actually do what we need to do overseas so i want to if it s okay touch on each three of those corners as we go through this conversation for the next 40 minutes stephen hadley mike i think one of the things i would say that is new really in the last few years is it s clear it s not a triangle it s actually a four cornered play and the last corner is the communication and the american people and the domestic roots and domestic support for our foreign policy and national security i think there s an appreciation among national security types that the domestic element of having the support of the american people and whether we re addressing the problems here at home sufficiently so people feel comfortable playing the role that the united states has traditionally played in the world that s another element that has to be addressed i think now more urgently in a way that 10 15 years ago probably it was a triangle if you will or a tripod i think now we have to recognize there s a new fourth pillar to all of this michael morell well maybe this is where we should start right tom donilon i think steve s right about that because on the capability side it s not just you know we talk about the traditional capabilities what are our military capabilities what are our intelligence capabilities what are our diplomatic capabilities but i think it s also very important given the specific challenges we face you have to talk about what our domestic capabilities are indeed i think some of the most important things that we re going to be discussing in national security stephen hadley right tom donilon in the next period is going to be what kind of investments are we making for example in meeting the china challenge in terms of research and development and our technology capabilities what kind of investments are we making in terms of our infrastructure and our human capital these are really pretty critical and most importantly i think what are we doing to make our system work better so i agree with steve i think that it s kind of a new landscape here and these domestic capabilities that give us the strength to project our values and interests into the world are really important stephen hadley and i would say we need to start with those tom donilon right stephen hadley because if we step back and we ve sort of been on a holiday for the last couple decades in many ways about the national security challenges we face and really figure out what we need to do to get our economy going to get our innovation cycle going to in some sense get back to what put america in its preeminent position after the end of the cold war if we get back to those things and have a robust domestic agenda it will establish a platform which will allow us to deal with whatever comes in in the national security foreign policy whether it s china whether it s russia whether it s something we haven t foreseen really i think we have to understand that national security and foreign policy your tripod in some sense is going to start with the platform on which that tripod rests which is our domestic capabilities political economic technological you name it and social cohesion michael morell let me take both of those all right the communications piece to the american people and then the foundation piece of everything that happens here domestically and the communications question is how do we talk to the american people about the importance of the u s being engaged in the world when i travel around the country people say to me things like michael why does it matter to me in akron ohio what vladimir putin does in eastern ukraine or why does it matter to me michael in des moines iowa what the chinese are doing in the south china sea how do we do a better job talking to the american people about why its so important for us to play a leadership role in the world tom donilon you ve put your finger on a very important point i think it s not just the communication problems i think the elites up until the election of president trump thought it was all just a communication problems we re just not explaining to the american people well enough what is the why it redounds to america s prosperity and security to be active in the world i think after the trump election we realized that the problem was more fundamental and i think there have been accumulated grievances over the ten years that led to the election of president trump in 2016 people that feel victimized by globalization threatened by immigration abandoned by their politicians betrayed by the elites i think you won t be able to have a successful conversation with americans about america s role in the world unless you address these underlying grievances once you do that once people get some confidence that the american dream still is real that their children are going to have a more secure and prosperous life than they are then you can begin to reengage the conversation about why the united states needs to be engaged in the world and what values and principles we need to stand up for i think until you address these underlying grievances i think that argument is going to be an uphill argument with the american people stephen hadley i think we should engage in it but i think we have to recognize that the platform has some cracks and they need to be addressed and then you can start your communications effort tom donilon you know there are certainly obviously domestic challenges that have to be addressed and it s a complicated thing given the fast pace of change that the society and the world is facing but i actually think that the american people and if you look at the data it shows this really do understand the importance of united states engagement in the world really do want to have the united states have strong relationship with its allies do understand that what happens in trade talks and dynamics around the world actually impacts on their lives and they for sure want to see the united states admired in the world michael morell so in terms of shoring up the domestic piece is there investments that we need to make in ai or whatever it is is there a historical parallel to this or is this new territory tom donilon i think there s historical parallel i think that basically there s kind of a in some ways we ve had a bit of amnesia about how we ve gone about this in the past stephen hadley right tom donilon you know if you think about for example china front page of the papers the president s entering into a phase one trade agreement with china we ve been involved in this very difficult back and forth with china over the last couple of years on trade but also including broader issues including technology and defense issues and geopolitical issues but what is the real way we can have an impact right it basically would be investments here and revitalizing our own ability to compete there is a historical parallel to that and it s in the period after world war ii with the united states led by the government but in another triangle right in kind of a triangle there was the government and universities and private sector companies engaged in a determined effort to lead in technology and we were the beneficiaries of that for almost three quarters of a century we have obviously a famous moment right the sputnik moment which is almost a clich but it had a really big impact in this country and we haven t had a similar kind of moment in the fact of the chinese challenge that we had in the late 1950s and early 1960s just for ten seconds what happened we created in a year after sputnik we created nasa we have the defense education act we created arpa the forerunner of darpa we made investments in technology here that we basically lived off for a long time and we haven t had that same kind of focus and a joint public private effort that we had during the sputnik period so i do think there are historical parallels we have an american system that triangle i described i think which has been very successful and we ve let it languish to some extent including by the way serious reductions in the amount of money the government invests in basic r and d stephen hadley we ve also had though a political disaffection between the three pieces of the triangle tom donilon yeah stephen hadley the u s government is not popular on university campuses these days so that close connection between universities and government research is strained we ve had whole industries come of age initially the telecommunications industry and the computer industry now in terms of social media and internet companies and they have all had to learn that while they start in divine isolation where the united states government is the enemy when they get to the point that they become critical infrastructure for this country they suddenly become whether they like it or not national security players and national security assets and they have responsibilities to the american people to work with the government to work with universities in that triangle silicon valley is learning that lesson i think they went to the point of the government is the enemy i think you ve seen some recent statements for example by jeff bezos for example and i think the head of microsoft said of course we need to be working with the u s government and if employees don t like it they need to understand that s part of our responsibilities we need to move in that direction we need to knit back that relationship between government universities and business because it is innovation in the end of the day that is going to determine the american position that platform with which we are going to deal with the problems of the 21st century tom donilon yeah michael morell so this is you know getting the platform right is a huge issue tom donilon yeah stephen hadley huge michael morell right huge it s going to be extraordinarily challenging to accomplish what you guys just walked through is it going to require a sputnik like moment or is it possible to get there a different way tom donilon well we should have the sputnik moment i think i mean if you look we ve never really had steve you probably agree with this we ve never really had kind of the competitor we have in china right now stephen hadley that s it this is our sputnik moment is china tom donilon yeah yeah and it s very different from the soviet union stephen hadley right tom donilon now we had moments when we thought we were actually in sort of technological competition with the soviet union but we really never really were we had an arms race right but in terms of the fundamentals of the society this is a much more much more direct challenge and it s across a range of technologies which are going to be the technologies the platforms of the future where first mover advantage will mean a lot where really kind of taking leadership positions will mean a lot in terms of our security and our prosperity so we have that moment right now there really isn t any reason mike i don t know what steve would say to this beyond political will that we can t move forward we can afford it indeed i think that history will look back on this moment and ask us why given the cost of money which has been exceedingly low right for a long period of time and continues to be quite low why you haven t made investments in things that you know are going to have positive returns going forward so we have the resources we should have the motivation but we don t at this point have really kind of gotten ourselves organized around having the political will and that s the thing that really is most concerning to me which is this kind of system breakdown this inability to do things which are really quite obviously in the national interest stephen hadley i agree with tom tom donilon yeah stephen hadley we ve known that we need to make infrastructure investments we ve known actually that we have a problem with social security we ve actually really known what to do about it we know what we really need to do on immigration seal the border and then address the immigration issues at home we ve known the solutions for these things for about 20 years our politics is broken and not producing those kind of outcomes not solving problems that s what we ve got to do we ve been sort of on holiday and the interesting thing about china is we ve never faced a competitor that is as robust as china is politically economically diplomatically soon militarily but also a competitor with whom we are also intertwined in a series of relationships and i ve said that the issue is can we be both strategic competitors and strategic cooperators with china at the same time i don t think there are many historical parallels for something like that tom donilon no stephen hadley that is the challenge about how we get to a peaceful and prosperous world for our people and for the chinese people michael morell so what do you think our objectives should be with regards to our relationship with china and then the strategy that you would put together to achieve that stephen hadley i think we have to figure out for example i ll give you just an example in terms of the global infrastructure and technologies in which china clearly wants a dominant role in which we want to also be players because these artificial intelligence quantum computing autonomy these are the technologies that are going to define how our societies are structured how our militaries are structured michael morell how our intelligence is structured stephen hadley how our intelligence is structured tom donilon yeah stephen hadley so how are we going to manage this competition i think one of the things we have to do is one get our own house in order we need to get ourselves in a position so that we can compete two i think we have to prioritize we have to figure out those areas where we not only have to compete but we have to win for example digital infrastructure we cannot permit china and huawei to lay the digital infrastructure for the 21st century there are too many vulnerabilities associated with that so second find out areas prioritize areas where we really have to succeed third work with china and try and get it to embrace positive global standards where they do for example an infrastructure if they adopt global standards build infrastructure that is fiscally environmentally sustainable that benefits the countries in which it s built let them have at it we should support them we should cooperate with them i think that s the kind of analysis we have to get through put ourselves in a position to compete figure out those areas of priority where we have to succeed figure out terms by which we can cooperate with china and other areas because we have to recognize that a lot of the problems the world faces whether it s environmental management technology whether it s proliferation whether it s financial stability an awful lot of problems cannot be solved if the united states and china with the rest of the world do not cooperate together tom donilon yeah you know i think it s interesting and just a comment just a minute on that you know d chollet had a phrase called situations of strength right that you wanted to deal from when you re dealing with these problems and that s essentially what we re talking about on the first instance which is really building up the strength the platforms we talked about at home and making determinations about which areas are we going to lead in terms of technologies and the industries of the future going forward the second thing is that we don t really have a strategic dialogue with the chinese right now we have a trade negotiation and that s just not responsible frankly stephen hadley right tom donilon for the two most important countries in the world who are going to be the most important countries for this century not to have a broad discussion to understand each other s intentions to understand where each other s kind of concerns are where their red lines are and how you might engage in cooperative as well as competitive aspects the third piece of it from my perspective is allies and i think we have really underplayed the role of allies in all these situations we ve talked about whether it be china or north korea or russia not investing more in allied iran investing more in allied approaches has really i think hurt us badly and if i were the next president i think it needs to be a really important focus and last is the importance of values this is a strength for the united states around the world right it has been one of the reasons where we ve been seen as a kind of attractive power that we ve been seeing for the last 75 years and we ve lost the bead i think on this values leadership so those kind of situations of strength kind of in a strategic way along with a strategic dialogue with china i think is the way to go but we have to this can t just be a trade negotiation right between the united states and china that s not a responsible it s important it s a necessary thing to do we need to protect ourselves in the economic world we need to protect our workers and businesses we need to get fair play but that s not the whole story it s not even near the whole story stephen hadley and recently there s been press reports that we are going to open a resumption of what was called the strategic economic dialogue and that treasury secretary mnuchin s going to lead it and that s a good development but at least in the bush administration and even more so in the obama administration it was broadened it was not just economic and under the bush administration co chaired by the secretary of state and secretary defense to do both diplomacy and economic and in the obama administration they added explicitly a security leg as well and a security aspect to that dialogue that s the kind of robust full spectrum conversation we need to have with the chinese that s what tom s talking about tom donilon yeah stephen hadley and he s absolutely right michael morell underscore tom s point about allies stephen hadley yeah michael morell because history s pretty clear that the chinese do respond when a coalition of nations says something clearly to them tom donilon yeah michael morell and that s missing at the moment tom donilon yeah michael morell and i think that s the way you ultimately get them to play by the set of rules that we all want to get them to play by tom donilon i think that s right and in almost all these areas including china mike i think you re right and that is the history that when you have an opportunity to present kind of a set of factors to the chinese where they a unified global approach you have a much better chance i think at getting a better result we had that with the trans pacific partnership i think for example stephen hadley there s a book that bob blackwell and graham allison wrote about some conversations they had with lee kuan yew as the founder of singapore and they asked him whether chinese wants to displace the united states at the top of the world order and i m going to get this wrong but the gist of it is right and lee kuan yew said sure why not and they asked him well do you think they ll succeed and lee kuan yew thought about it for a while apparently said no but they ll give you a run for your money and why won t they succeed and he said well because they will draw from a population of 1 3 million and you will draw from the rest of the world and that s an important you know message about allies it s an important message about immigration it s important a message about values that s our strength and what tom is saying is right now we re not playing to our strengths and that s what we need to get back to tom donilon step back mike and think about kind of look at the globe kind of geo strategically and think about the potential platform both economically and politically that the united states can muster right in order to pursue the goals it has for how we think a fair international political and economic order should run and we re just not taking advantage of that the platform that we have access to on that we could lead michael morell so let s stay in the same neighborhood but move on to north korea we discovered the north korea nuclear weapons program in the early 1990s and not a single administration since then has figured out a way to stop the program or even to slow it down so how do we deal with north korea what approach makes sense to you guys tom donilon well steve go first because i m going to disagree with your premise but why don t you go ahead stephen hadley okay i would say we ve had michael morell not the first time stephen hadley we ve had three administrations clinton bush 43 and obama that got deals with north korea in which they agreed to give up all or a portion of their nuclear program and none of the three administrations were able to keep the north koreans in the deal and there are all kinds of reasons all a lot of blame to go around but that s the reality and i have reluctantly come to the conclusion that they re not going to give up their nuclear program in the short run and what we really need to do is we need to be prepared not to accept the legitimacy of that program but we have to with our allies in the region prepare to be able to deter their use of that program and to defend against it if it s used and not just defend the homeland the united states but to defend our friends and allies and if we take that position and make it absolutely clear to the north koreans that they get no leverage out of their program and instead will live in splendid isolation in what is really one of the most backward regimes in the world it may be at some point they will begin to try to move in a different direction but i think one of the things the trump administration got right is unless the north koreans make a strategic decision to move in a different direction to really give up this reliance on the military on the nuclear weapon an to reform their system to become part of the international community to open up the way china opened up 40 45 years ago i just don t see we re going to make any progress on this issue so i don t think we concede it i think we have our objective over the long term for a denuclearized north korea we have to recognize it s going to be a long way and take the necessary measures to both defend and protect our friends and allies in the interim and put the kind of framework in place that at some point may cause north korea to make that kind of strategic decision michael morell so does that mean you would not negotiate an arms control agreement with them stephen hadley i don t think michael morell that s accepting the program to some extent stephen hadley if you could get some kind of agreement that could show it was a step towards and progress towards capping or beginning to wind down that program i would consider it but at this point that s not on offer tom donilon yeah stephen hadley the administration has made i ve talked to the folks even steve biegun in particular they have a very sensible approach north koreans are not playing they re not playing tom donilon it s interesting i think i mean if you could achieve an arms control cap at some point during the pendency of negotiations that s a step i think that will be a positive thing to do why do i think that a couple points one is i think that the administration at the outset was on the right track in terms of the maximum pressure campaign i do and i think that they gave it up too early for the singapore summit in june of 2018 without getting enough in terms of the protections in terms of growing the program during the pendency of the negotiations i think that was a mistake of course that summit and we re trying not to be political here but i mean it s a fair assessment i think analytically that summit was agreed to impulsively when you had in march of that year a south korea delegation at the white house suggesting to the president that kim jung un may be willing to meet with him so i think that we took our foot off the pedal i think too early and didn t get enough for it the second thing is that there s a dangerous analytical mistake i think we re making here steve alluded to it which is that you know the president has said on a number of occasions i m not worried about time you know i m not in a hurry right that s analytically incorrect right why is it in incorrect because although there really hasn t been an icdm test or a nuclear test during the pendency of these on and off conversations the program is proceeding apace and it proceeds in of course a range of dimensions in which outside experts right indicates that they really could be building up enough material for additional weapons why do the numbers matter the numbers matter from a perspective of proliferation protection of our allies and a matter in terms of missile defense so i think that s an analytical error so if there s going to be negotiations they need to take place during a period where you have some sort of interim agreement on capping on capping activity i think that s been a mistake here now in history you said that you didn t think that stephen hadley yeah yeah yeah tom donilon yeah right stephen hadley yeah yeah tom donilon you said that you didn t and steve and i are going to disagree on this but i ll we did have a period from 1994 until the early 2000s and under the agreed framework where in fact at least the plutonium aspects of the program in north korea were frozen and then the bush administration discovered that there were other activities going on and the agreed framework fell part we walked away from it they walked away from it the question presented is a really interesting kind of it s a broader question and the broader question is if you find violations of an agreement do you keep the core agreement and move on to try to adjust the additional violations or do you pull back from the whole thing we faced a similar thing in iran i think that we re going through right now it s an interesting it s a statecraft question stephen hadley yeah tom donilon and it s an interesting question stephen hadley the problem is it s one thing if you get a half a loaf and they don t want to give you the other half do you accept the half a loaf the problem with north korea in that situation is they committed to giving up all of their nuclear programs only disclose the reprocessing which is one path to a nuclear weapon failed to disclose that they were pursuing an enrichment program which is another path to a nuclear weapon michael morell right right stephen hadley and so what is the penalty when a person denies to you and how credibly can you continue to deal with them tom donilon yeah michael morell right what they did in that case is they tore down the old yankee stadium only after they built the new yankee stadium tom donilon exactly stephen hadley right michael morell right stephen hadley yeah i think one of the things we have to say tom and i represent now between us three administrations which failed to be able to keep north korea in a nuclear agreement tom donilon yeah stephen hadley and it has to make us a little bit i think chastened before we criticize the trump administration i would say to you one of the things i think the insight they had and that president trump had which was right was you re not going to solve this problem with a bottom up traditional arms control approach we tried that three times you re going to have to convince kim jung un to make a strategic shift and that s what the president was trying to do and i think he s right about that you can criticize the tactics all you want but i think that insight that he s got to make a strategic shift to go in another direction if you re going to solve this problem is basically right and the question is can we follow up on that tom donilon that s fair and he hasn t made that decision stephen hadley he hasn t tom donilon he has not there has not been a strategic and steve biegun has spoken about that and the president s special representative now deputy secretary of state has been clear about that they haven t made the strategic decision but i do think it s an i do think that the pressure campaign was pulled back too quickly i think you couldn t have gotten to it put a lot more pressure on them and i do think that we should be careful about our assessments and our statements saying that we don t worry about time progressing here because time is not our friend here now we may have to get to the point where steve said which is basically that we ve got to be able to and we should be doing this anyway stephen hadley we should tom donilon be able to address whether a program here which is a real threat and build up our defenses for ourselves and our allies but i just think that analytical error is a serious one and not one the president should continue to repeat michael morell as unorthodox as it was the one aspect of the president s approach that i liked and i get the strategic point was i don t know if there was an understanding or not but it is hard to overstate the degree of distrust on the north korean side of us stephen hadley right michael morell and it s impossible i think for them to make a strategic decision without a building up of trust and in that society it is impossible for that to happen at lower levels it s got to happen at the top stephen hadley exactly right exactly right tom donilon yeah michael morell so steve tom you mentioned proliferation tom donilon yeah michael morell and i want to ask how do we deter north korea selling a nuclear weapon they have sold everything they have ever made including nuclear technology to the syrians they ve sold everything they ever made it s pretty easy to see how we deter use how do we deter a sale of a nuclear device stephen hadley it s tough tom donilon yeah stephen hadley if you read vice president cheney s memoir of his time in the administration probably the whole last third of it is devoted to this issue and he was of the view that that is the central problem and that because north korea actually worked with the syrians to build a reactor which was in syria which was to provide nuclear material for syria for ultimately a bomb we should have retaliated against north korea to make the point that you cannot sell the counterargument was we didn t only want north korea not to sell we wanted north korea to give it up and we were in the process in the middle of a process that we thought offered that prospect because the only way our friends and allies are going to be comfortable in the region is not if north korea just doesn t sell they re only going to be comfortable if north korea in the end of the day doesn t have it in the first place so this is a difficult issue and i think one you deter by denial that is to say you have your intelligence when you have an opportunity to show that they ve sold you whack the person who s bought you destroy the capability and you hold them up to sanction i think you do sanction i think that would be a good grounds to return to the maximum pressure campaign tom donilon yeah stephen hadley in some sense you almost wish north korea would make that mistake because it would allow the international community then to come back together to further isolated diplomatically impose sanctions which is an element i think of what our policy needs to be so i think that s where i would go rallying the world in the event there is proliferation rallying the world to re impose isolation and sanctions on north korea it s a much trickier proposition to threaten use of military force in retaliation for a proliferation incident tom donilon yeah would be a basis for global maximum pressure campaign and i think we need to make that clear to our partners in this process meaning the chinese stephen hadley right tom donilon but that would be a basis on which we would engage in global sanctions to the point of embargo including sanctioning chinese participation in north korean economic activity stephen hadley right michael morell okay so let s shift west to iran and i don t want get into the details of this soleimani strike and the aftermath i really want to try to keep this in kind of the 20 000 25 000 foot level but two fundamental issues here right nuclear weapons malign behavior in the region what s the best approach to dealing with them given where we are now right we ve pulled out of the jcpoa let s not debate that let s talk about where we go from here what makes the most sense tom donilon well i can start if you want stephen hadley sure tom donilon i think i d add a couple mike to the core interests that the united states has i think obviously you know a central concern of the united states over the course of both the administration steve worked in and the administration i worked in was iran s nuclear program and we worked our way to the point where we froze it and rolled it back through the nuclear deal remember and this was the overwhelming focus of u s policy in terms of our interest and the threat that it presented to the united states that s the first point the second point obviously iran s malign behavior in the region but i d add to that isis as well that s a core concern for the united states it begin again over the last two administrations the obama administration into the trump administration and that s been damaged i think in the last couple of weeks i mean the model that was put together initially in the obama administration and then carried over by secretary mattis into the trump administration was a very effective model in terms of kind of disestablishing the caliphate and putting continued pressure on isis with by the way kind of a modicum of u s forces right not a mass force but a very effective and well conceived force and i do worry that that core interest that second core interest in additional to the nuclear program has been diminished here so we ll see if we can that reestablished i hope we can that was also by the way harmed to some extent by the pullout from northeastern syria as well so i d look at this by trying to keep an eye on our core interests which in my view are really in terms of u s interests are the nuclear program the threat from isis and then the stability of iraq which i do think we have an interest in that would be the list that i would have and keep in mind if i were developing policy stephen hadley people have forgotten but the jcpoa the nuclear agreement negotiated during the obama administration was the second agreement nuclear agreement with iran there was an agreement negotiated by the eu3 which was britain france and germany michael morell right stephen hadley in 2004 and 2005 in which iran agreed to give up enrichment to give up reprocessing which would have insured that they did not have a route to a nuclear weapon at all and politics got in the way ahmadinejad was a candidate for president in 2005 he campaigned on a platform that the nuclear agreement that had been entered into by iran was a mistake that it gave up the birthright of iran for nuclear weapons that the place the iranians who negotiated that were traitors who should go to prison and when he was elected president through the intervention of the supreme leader i might add he took iran out of that agreement and resumed their nuclear program the complaints against the jcpoa really in my view were twofold one it did not involve the kind of comprehensive giving up of reprocessing enrichment and therefore could not assure that iran would not get a nuclear weapon you can argue whether half a loaf again half a loaf was better than the whole loaf what i pleaded with obama administration officials not tom i would point out was don t just do the nuclear deal have a parallel negotiation where you address the ballistic missiles and iranian activity in the region and when you roll out your nuclear deal make it part of an overall strategy for dealing with all three aspects of iranian behavior that without that it was going to make it very difficult to maintain the nuclear agreement unfortunately that is what happened i think the trump administration is genuine in its desire to return to negotiations at some point and try to address not only improving the nuclear deal but address the ballistic missile program and iran s activity in the region the truth is you can t address effectively iran s activities in the region at the negotiating table you ve got to address them on the ground you have got to have strategies to check iran we had such a strategy in syria late in the game after we had allowed our position quite frankly to deteriorate considerably we ve had a difficulty pursuing and carrying that through iraq is a place quite frankly where the iraqis have had enough of iranian influence it s time for iran to reduce its influence in iraq that s the effort we need to make we need to make efforts on the ground to help countries and help people resist external influence which in this case is iran and which is not benefiting them but it benefiting only iran tom donilon you know it s interesting but it does go back to your point earlier michael about allies and partners i think the right approach here and steve and i talked about it many times the right approach from my perspective would have been to keep the jcpoa in place and then to immediately move to a set of follow on negotiations why is that one because you did have for some period of time a freeze and a rollback of the program number one but number two we had in place at that point an anti iran or a counter iran coalition which could have been used in a negotiation i think to more effectively deal with some of the problems and i think that essentially i think what the trump administration would want to get back to ultimately which would be to have a baseline agreement with respect to the nuclear program and then move on to a negotiation around these activities unfortunately we ve paid a price with respect to the european allies for sure i think that s analytically correct and we ve paid a price with respect to other partners who could have been on the other side of the table in pushing those negotiations going forward but i ll go back where i started it is really important for us though to keep in mind core interests and not get distracted and the core interests are the nuclear program and its progress and the isis threat michael morell did the bush administration or the obama administration ever consider taking out soleimani i don t remember stephen hadley i don t remember any formal consideration of taking out soleimani and i noticed that stan mcchrystal wrote an articles in the winter issue of foreign policy saying that in january of 2007 he was tracking a convoy heading towards erbil in which soleimani was a passenger and he thought about whether to take him out at that point decided not to i don t remember that incident i may be wrong others of my colleagues may remember it i don t remember that tom donilon i don t remember it either stephen hadley coming to the white house either before during or after he was considering that i think it was a ground level activity tom donilon yeah stephen hadley we were worried about what iran was doing we wanted to send iran a message to knock it off in terms of their attacks on our men and women in uniform in iraq we were able to you may remember arrest michael morell we did stephen hadley and detail some quds force members michael morell not very long right stephen hadley to send that message that we know who you are we know where you are and we can reach you i hope that message i think that message had some effect unfortunately the iraqi prime minister intervened and forced us to let them go tom donilon yeah stephen hadley but that s the kind of thing i remember doing i don t remember formal contemplation about going after soleimani tom donilon we had obviously during the latter years of the iraq war had a lot of back and forth with the shia militias and really kind of vicious back and forth with the shia militias and inside iraq i don t recall a project along the lines that you re talking about but it is interesting though that i don t know that there was any serious attacks on u s forces inside iraq from around the end of 2011 until this past fall it s an interesting and we can discuss the reasons why but it s interesting michael morell interesting tom donilon it s a very interesting point and there s a lot of reasons for it but i do think that that was that period where you didn t have those kinds of sharp attacks from iranian backed and directed shia militias inside iraq for that period stephen hadley and that s a terribly important point because what s really going on and what i think a lot of people have missed is that in the fall there were demonstrations in iraq by even shia iraqis against iran saying out out iran and it s pretty clear that soleimani working with kataib hezbollah which is one of the iranian backed militias decided it was time to change the subject and so they started attacked bases in which u s personnel were present and it happened over a period of two months and finally resulted in a u s contractor being killed and four american service people being wounded and that began the process of action and reaction between the united states and iran but it was a calculated effort to try to change the conversation tom donilon yeah stephen hadley people would say well by striking kaitab hezbollah by killing soleimani we played into their hand that may be true but you can t stand by and let them resume killing our people on the ground tom donilon yeah yeah stephen hadley and so what the administration i think tried to do in a bold move by killing soleimani was to up the stakes and send a message to reestablish deterrence that we are prepared to if you kill americans you are going to pay a heavy price tom donilon yeah stephen hadley and i think that s what the administration was trying to do you can argue about the consequences and all the rest michael morell we went right to the top of the escalatory ladder there tom donilon yeah but it was a stephen hadley well we did not hit targets in iran there is a lot left on that escalatory ladder tom donilon although this was a near run thing stephen hadley and it s very interesting that pompeo made the comment that if the iranians do retaliate in a way that kills americans we won t just hit them in iraq we will be looking at targets in iran so i think was an effort precisely for the reason tom said in a calculated way they started going after our people again and the administration was trying to reestablish deterrence and get the iranians to knock it off tom donilon yeah it s an interesting point though because i chose a couple things number one there was a period from really january of 2012 until october of 2019 where you didn t have those kinds of shia militia attacks on u s interests it also shows by the way the direct control that iran has over these shia militias which was basically part of their response to the maximum pressure campaign stephen hadley right tom donilon and they had direct control over the tactics and the targets that these militia groups undertook michael morell so let me ask one more question we re running short on time what should we have talked about that we didn t stephen hadley i think it s hard to overstate the potential impact that technology is going to have on all these issues on the domestic platform we talked about on which our foreign policy is going to be based on the military competition that you re going to see between the united states china and russia on the capacities of non state actors like terrorist groups and i think also on state to state relations so i think one of the great areas where the new administration or the continuation of the trump administration one of the issues for the 2020s is going to be the issue of technology and interestingly enough the consequences of it domestically in terms of our own economies and our workforce and all the rest are going to be both the negative and the potentials for artificial intelligence to improve everything from medical exams to how you hail a cab there are positives and downsides tom donilon yeah stephen hadley and these are an area where even the united states and china despite their disagreements in other sectors this is an area where we should be working with china and other countries to try to identify how we re going to manage the diseconomies of technological change and how are we going to exploit the opportunities they present so this is one of these examples where china is a problem we have to manage but also an opportunity to help us deal with problems that we face in common tom donilon you know michael technology needs to be constantly at the situation room table we had obviously generations of policymakers in this country who haven t been as fluent in technology as the future policymakers are going to have to be and if i were back reorganizing the national security council right now i would have technology at the table i d have an assistant to the president deputy national secretary advisor for technology at the table every day because we have all these issues at first impression which are going to be really dominant going forward you really can t manage national security going forward without having some more expertise and more fluency in technology than we ve had to date stephen hadley one other issue we talk about a whole of government how do you mobilize the government pursuant to a common strategy to achieve a common objective a lot of these problems you need not just government you need whole of society tom donilon yeah stephen hadley you need the business community you need the ngo community you need the universities one of the real challenges for the national secretary advisor of the 2020s is how do you have not only a whole of government strategy hard enough how do you mobilize a whole of society strategy in dealing with some of these problems tom donilon yeah you know michael we haven t talked about the private companies right in this conversation and i just conclude with a couple of things from my perspective there really needs to be a serious conversation about the responsibility of the private sector companies and the technologies they ve brought to bear you know we talked earlier about past eras right the most important advocates with respect to arms control and understanding the impact of the atomic weaponry were the developers of atomic weaponry where they took responsibility for the societal impact of the technologies that they had brought to bear that s a really important point going forward stephen hadley yep tom donilon last is cyber i m concerned going into this year about cyber for a few reasons we re going to have an impact on the 2020 election we know that the russians and others are going to come and try to disrupt again second we know that we are now increasing tensions with cyber capable adversaries not just russia but including north korea and iran stephen hadley yeah tom donilon we have technologies that are developing we re moving towards a revolution in deception in terms of technologies we ve seen a rise in ransomware against weak links of states and local areas we saw stories recently about the vulnerabilities of cloud services and we have a massive expansion of iot devices which are going to michael morell internet of things tom donilon internet of things which are going to present challenges we have really not even come close to having the all of government focus we need i think on cyber security and on technology stephen hadley much less all of society tom donilon yeah michael morell thank you both very much tom donilon national security advisor to president obama steve hadley national security advisor to george w bush thank you both tom donilon thanks michael stephen hadley thank you end of transcript first published on january 29
