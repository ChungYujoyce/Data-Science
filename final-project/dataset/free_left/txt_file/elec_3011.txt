advertisement supported by transcript n a by matt flegenheimer and ashley parker donald j trump began this quadrennial exercise in campaign humility and self deprecation on thursday by comparing himself to the son of god just another carpenter working for his father in his youth by the end facing cascading and uncomfortable jeers from a crowd full of white ties and gowns he had called hillary clinton catholic hating so corrupt and potentially jail bound in a prospective trump administration i don t know who they re angry at hillary you or i mr trump said sheepishly from the dais turning to his opponent amid the heckling it seemed clear to everyone else mr trump was being booed at a charity dinner so it went at the alfred e smith memorial foundation dinner in manhattan a presidential campaign ritual of levity and feigned warmth upended like so much else in this election season by the gale force bid of mr trump breaking with decades of tradition at the gathering once he took the microphone mr trump set off on a blistering grievance filled performance that translated poorly to the staid setting stunning many of the well heeled guests who had filed into the waldorf astoria hotel for an uncommon spectacle an attempted d tente in a campaign so caustic that the candidates less than 24 hours earlier declined to shake hands on a debate stage relations did not much improve mr trump s set began typically enough he joked about the size of his hands and mrs clinton s comparatively small crowds he even very nearly poked fun at himself insofar as a zinger about his wife and her partly plagiarized republican convention speech qualifies when discussing the biased news media transcript n a you want the proof michelle obama gives a speech and everyone loves it mr trump said my wife melania gives the exact same speech and people get on her case some sharper jokes about mrs clinton seemed to edge just to the line just before taking the dais hillary accidentally bumped into me and she very civilly said pardon me mr trump said as murmurs filled the room i very politely replied let me talk to you about that after i get into office mrs clinton seeming to get the joke before some others chuckled hard before the punch line but quickly his remarks took a more menacing turn mr trump said mrs clinton was merely pretending not to hate catholics an allusion to hacked correspondences from clinton aides that appeared to include messages criticizing roman catholic conservatism he wondered aloud how someone like mrs clinton so corrupt he said could sell herself to the american people what s her pitch he asked the economy is busted the government s corrupt washington is failing vote for me he fake griped that all the jokes were given to her in advance by then he had decisively lost the room those on the dais with him seemed to almost visibly writhe away from him at points brows furrowing smiles turning to grimaces one man beside mr trump became a viral sensation on social media his face frozen and eye bulged by a quip gone awry as for mrs clinton she began with some easy self parody i took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here she said adding usually i charge a lot for speeches like this transcript n a but she soon turned to more cutting satire joking that mr trump was translating from the original russian on his teleprompters and wondering just how president obama might be able to visit the white house for a reunion of former presidents under a trump administration how is barack going to get past the muslim ban she asked noting that she was speaking second she riffed it s amazing i m up here after donald i didn t think he d be o k with a peaceful transition of power she also spoke of the statue of liberty recounting how for most americans the green lady of freedom represents a shining beacon of hope and a welcome symbol for immigrants arriving on the nation s shores but mr trump she added with a glint of steel looks at the statue of liberty and sees a 4 a not so veiled reference to his comments rating the physical appearance of women maybe a 5 if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair she continued before making an explicit if subtle pitch for becoming the nation s first female president you know come to think know what would be a good number for a woman 45 she concluded triumphantly at the dinner before the remarks the pair could be seen chatting at least briefly perched two seats apart with only cardinal timothy m dolan the archbishop of new york between them perhaps only a man of god could for a night soothe a campaign that has included an f b i inquiry overnight twitter binges multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and an international feud between the republican nominee and pope francis before the candidates spoke alfred e smith iv the chairman of the dinner which benefits catholic charities seemed to offer a preview of what may await mr trump as he tries to return to new york society life should he not win the white house in november before the dinner started trump went to hillary and asked how are you mr smith said waiting a beat she said i m fine now get out of the ladies dressing room even under the best of circumstances mr trump is not known for an eagerness to laugh at himself a veritable roasting at washington s annual nerd prom the white house correspondents association s annual dinner in 2011 may have hastened or even catalyzed his bid for the oval office and now a flagging presidential campaign most polls place him several percentage points behind mrs clinton nationally has done little to help then there was the guest list which included michael r bloomberg the billionaire former new york city mayor who has vocally opposed mr trump s bid and eric t schneiderman the new york attorney general whose office has opened an investigation into mr trump s foundation mrs clinton perhaps lifted by her rising poll numbers seemed exultant in her fuchsia dress often laughing first and loudest before being greeted by well wishers as she left mr trump even reached out to shake her hand as guests stepped off the dais she shook it briefly and turned away before mr trump did for much of the evening though he largely sat with his arms tightly folded as mrs clinton spoke a similarly taut smile across his face but when mrs clinton returned to one of his favorite themes her health he seemed momentarily buoyed mr trump mrs clinton said had chivalrously sent a car to ferry her to the dinner actually it was a hearse she said finally mr trump laughed with real joy advertisement
