two weeks ago i wrote that hillary clinton and the democrats could not afford to take anything for granted this year clinton i argued is too conventional too focus grouped herfear of unscripted moments has hindered her ability to connect emotionally with voters she s an unnatural politician whose penchant for moderation is a vulnerability in this political climate to be fair clinton has been on the ugly end of republican attacks for decades a little guardedness is pardonable but a play it safe approach seemed unnecessarily risky against an omnipresent juggernaut like trump the republican nominee s campaign depends upon free media in many ways what trump says or does with his airtime is irrelevant the point is to be seen and heard he can lie and distort with impunity his supporters don t care and he dominates headlines all the same with that in mind i suggested clinton s plan to lay low and let surrogates do her bidding was a bad idea and that she ought to steal the spotlight from trump whenever and wherever she can the same i reasoned was true for democrats and down ballot races well i was wrong democrats still shouldn t take anything for granted but i no longer believe there s any reason to compete with trump for airtime if we ve learned anything in the last couple of weeks it s that trump will never morph into a sane pragmatic candidate he was never going to conform to political norms but one assumed he would tone it down a bit as we approached november instead he s quadruple downed on his racist comments about a mexican american judge and more recently accused president obama of being a muslim manchurian candidate who may or may not be complicit in the recent terror attacks in orlando now that trump is speaking to a general electorate he s paying a higher price for his racist drivel indeed the latest nbc news surveymonkey poll finds hillary clinton now leading donald trump nationally by eight points 49 percent to 41 percent this gap will grow as democrats unify and the republican nominee continues unraveling in public even the political press is challenging trump in ways that appear to have stunted his momentum according to a politico report senate minority leader harry reid is now encouraging democratic senate candidates to sit back and watch trump discredit himself and everyone associated with him including gop candidates who ve endorsed him it s a time tested strategy when your enemy is imploding let him and that s what democrats are doing calling it a shock and blah campaign politico reporter burgess everett writes the blah comes from the democratic candidates themselves they re intentionally playing it safe and boring figuring their elections will mostly be a referendum on trump and that animosity toward the real estate magnate will put them over the top in key swing states to the extent that democrats are attacking at all they re keeping it simple every interview every question and every speech returns to a common theme look who s at the top of the republican ticket is this what the gop stands for is this a candidate republicans are willing to co sign if there was ever a national election said dem senator chuck schumer this is it trump s campaign is a dumpster fire riding a wave of nativist angst why not make every race on the ballot a referendum on him what works for democratic senate candidates will also work for hillary clinton there are obvious differences between senate races and a presidential contest but the general strategy ought to work in both domains clinton will have to face the cameras and engage much more than down ballot candidates however if this is who trump is going to be then merely looking and sounding like an adult will be enough for clinton sean illing is a usaf veteran who previously taught philosophy and politics at loyola and lsu he is currently salon s politics writer follow him on facebook and twitter read his blog here email at silling salon com copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
