gop voters the republican health care overhaul and the left s nascent resistance movement and the vote as of 11 15 p m tuesday night was not as close as some had anticipated read our condensed takeout of the race here for full coverage check out our live blog below and redesigned myajc politics page updated at 12 05 a m trump calls to congratulate handel karen handel was on the phone with our colleague kyle wingfield tonight when she had to quickly answer a call on the other line turned out it was president donald trump he wished me well said it was a great campaign that he was very proud of me she later told wingfield he said he knew i was going to win i m glad i did when trump visited the 6th district and campaigned for handel back in april he famously told her she d better win recounting that comment on tuesday handelchuckled and jokingly added i m not sure what the consequences would be if you did not meet the president s expectations updated at 11 05 p m a final thought on today s turnout kristina torres the ajc s point person on georgia s voting trends sent along this take putting tonight s final vote tally in perspective we already knew that while typical turnout during off year special elections is notoriously low georgia s 6th district special election on april 18 which decided who was in tuesday s runoff topped 37 percent nearly 194 000 people voted but tuesday s unofficial ballot count topped 241 500 that s more than the 210 000 votes cast in the district in 2014 putting the contest squarely in common with midterm contests not special elections many had predicted a 210 000 plus turnout although few were sure how high it would go one of those who got it right was mark rountree the president of landmark communications who predicted an overall turnout of 235 000 to 240 000 voters with a majority having voted early and that s what happened the 6th district itself has long been considered highly motivated in that sense turnout percentage wise didn t disappoint in a district with about 526 000 registered voters in all nearly half of them came out unofficial turnout stood at about 46 percent in the race updated at 10 55 p m handel thanks boisterous crowd our colleague mark niesse who s been posted up at handel s watch party tonight sent along this report describing the jubilant scene at the hyatt regency in dunwoody this was going to be a very very tight race it was going to be contentious and it was going to require all hands on deck and that s exactly what we had handel said handel thanked president donald trump and other prominent republicans who supported her in the nationally watched runoff leading to cheers of trump trump trump from the crowd she said ossoff was gracious when he called her to concede we may have some different beliefs but we are part of one community the community of the 6th district she said my pledge is to be part of the solution to focus on governing to put my experience to work to help solve the very serious issues we re facing in this country updated at 10 50 p m trump tweets congratulations the president had been silent for most of the daytuesday while 6th district residents hit the polls but donald trump was quick to congratulate republican karen handel on twitter after she defeated democrat jon ossoff the president also thanked fox news for saying that handel s victory represented a huge win for trump and the gop updated at 10 40 p m the fight goes on democrat jon ossoff conceded to republican karen handel in the hard fought race to represent georgia s 6th district ending a defiant address to hundreds of disappointed supporters with a pledge that the fight goes on ossoff a 30 year old former congressional aide shattered fundraising records and became a national democratic rising star with his bid to flip the suburban atlanta district but handel staved off his fierce challenge by consolidating gop support across the district the democrat said little about his political future namely whether he would seek to challenge handel next year in a brief address to supporters he has said repeatedly he would have to talk with his fianc e before deciding about another political run but his speech suggested he would not stray far from the political spotlight he thanks his supporters for providing a beacon of hope for people in georgia and he said his campaign showed the world that in places where no one thought it was even possible to fight we could fight this is not the outcome any of us would hope for said ossoff but this is the beginning of something much bigger than us so thank you thank you for the most extraordinary experience that i ve ever had the honor of being a part of updated at 10 25 p m ossoff concedes democrat jon ossoff called republican karen handel around 10 15 p m on tuesday night to concede the race his campaign said he is expected to speak to his crowd of supporters shortly bringing the race to an earlier than expected end updated at 10 20 p m an outpouring from republicans republicans from d c to marietta cheered karen handel after she was declared the victor in tuesday s 6th district special election things are looking great for karen h president donald trump tweeted roughly 20 minutes after the race was called house speaker paul ryan congratulated handel for a hard earned and well deservedvictory democrats from coast to coast threw everything they had at this race and karen would not be defeated the wisconsin republican said in a statement republican gov nathan deal who campaigned for handel on monday also tweeted his congratulations u s rep doug collins r gainesville said tuesday s results say exactly what we knew about this district it s a conservative district and if you re a democrat who spent as much money as they did and barely got what hillary clinton got it says the district was not for sale collins said and after a 30 million onslaught the district saw through it collins said expects handel to face a stiff challenge in 2018 whether from ossoff or another contender but karen handel as an incumbent with a record of support will win again he said in the last three months we ve had three moral victories from democrats and no wins state rep betty price said she s excited that handel will succeed the congressional seat that was previously held by her husband tom price who is now president donald trump s health secretary it s probably not unexpected price said of the result some people thought it was a referendum on trump but instead it was a comparison of the candidates experience updated at 10 00 p m other outlets declare handel the winner cnn has also called the race for republican karen handel updated at 9 58 p m first outlet calls race for handel a first outlet decision desk hq has declared republican karen handel the winner the ap and other news outlets have yet to declare updated at 9 50 p m fulton county surprisingly quiet well this is a headline we certainly didn t expect to see today from our colleague mitchell northam fulton quiet and somewhat boring on ga 6th district election day fulton is notorious in these parts for election day mishaps back in april its 6th district vote totals weren t reported until after 2 a m due to a memory card error but no major gaffs problems or mistakes have been reported tonight in fulton in fact richard barron the county s director of elections and registrations told northam that the most common complaint that fulton heard tuesday was from people who wanted to vote but didn t live in the 6th district it seems like an ordinary election day barron said it was quiet and somewhat boring which is good the window is beginning to close for democrat jon ossoff republican karen handel is racking up a notable lead in the election returns as early and today s in person votes have been tallied democratic strategists we re talking to say there s still a path for ossoff albeit a narrowing one their hopes hinge on mail in ballots those have yet to be tallied but tend to favor democrats ossoff will likely need to win anoverwhelming margin to stay alive that s a high bar but not unfathomable we re told dekalb s mail in ballots are expected to be tallied shortly that should be a big pickup opportunity for ossoff although he s been underperforming there re in person votes tonight updated at 9 25 p m ossoff slipping in cobb we mentioned earlier today how cobb would be an important bellwether in this race the county is deeply republican yes but just how well democrat jon ossoff does there will be critical in determining his performance overall a number crunching friend of ours predicted that ossoff needed to secure more than 45 percent of the vote there to win the contest so the democrat s campaign is likely not happy at all with the current numbers which have him trailing handel there by nearly 20 percentage points and notching only about 40 percent of the vote as we mentioned earlier ossoff is also underperforming in dekalb the most democratic part of the district he needs to rack up the score there to stay competitive meanwhile republicans strategists and even some democrats began to question whether ossoff still had a path to victory as precincts continued to trickle in updated at 9 05 p m major down payment john ossoff s supporters got a pep talk from rep john lewis the civil rights icon who helped launch the candidate s political career lewis who hired ossoff as an intern told the crowd that they ve made a major down payment in changing our nation when we send jon ossoff to washington we are all going with him he said this district the state of georgia will never ever be the same if jon ossoff is elected he said ossoff s campaign has already inspired other democratic candidates to step forward and run for office so i say to you more than ever before we need a leader we need someone like jon ossoff we need his kindness we need his leadership for these are the times that try a man s soul updated at 8 50 p m cautious optimism at ossoff party more than 500 people crammed into a dunwoody hotel ballroom to cheer on jon ossoff erupting into cheers each time cnn aired updates on the race and a deafening chorus of boos when president donald trump flashed on the screen the mood was cautiously optimistic as early vote totals showed a tight race melanie childers a structural designer said she was feeling nervous but good about the race i was out there today talking to folks and i saw a lot of thumbs up a lot of waves and happiness i think we can pull this off she said updated at 8 30 p m early returns looking positive for handel early election night returns in georgia s 6th district are sending positive signals about republican karen handel s chances of capturing price s old seat roughly 90 minutes after the polls closed democrat jon ossoff was leading handel only narrowly ossoff s campaign was counting on strong support from early in person voters and handel s campaign is doing much better than expected in that category early numbers from dekalb county also aren t where democrats would like them to be ossoff is expected to get a boost from mail in ballots which are typically not counted until later and tend to favor democrats what s unclear at the moment is how much the strong early turnout will cannibalize the in person votes that both campaigns were hoping to run up the score with today at handel s watch party dozens of supporterscheered and crowded around tv screens when fox news showed early results with about a 2 percentage point lead for handel matthew hardwick wearing a make america great again hat said he s confident handel would triumph we need to maintain the republican seat and she has a lot of experience said hardwick who lives in smyrna in cobb county so far so good updated at 8 00 p m handel makes first appearance our colleagues at karen handel s watch party in dunwoody mark niesse and jim galloway sent this dispatch after the republican made a surprise early speech to supporters the republican arrived to loud cheers at her campaign event just before 8 p m tuesday night as supporters showed enthusiasm for their candidate s lead inearly in person voting tallies handel said the early resultswere very encouraging it s still very very early she told the crowd to win in person early voting is big handel told her supporters to wait for more returns to come in and hope the trend continues whatever happens tonight this is the most incredible group i ve ever had the privilege of working with she said at least one couple wearing bikers for trump garb is here state sen kay kirkpatrick who won judson hill s district 32 senate seat is here ag chris carr is here as well but otherwise a notable lack of statewide republicans updated at 7 20 p m uncle sam awaits karen handel here s the first dispatch from our colleague mark niesse at republican karen handel s dunwoody watch party the dressed up man peter ludwinski said the choice was clear between handel and democrat jon ossoff people support him are misled and walking dead ludwinski said on the issues it s like they ve lost their minds he s against common sense and against the nation handel s backers surrounded a podium tuned to fox news while upbeat songs played including and don t worry about a thing by bob marley and spirit in the sky by norman greenbaum like ossoff s campaign event handel s party also offers a cash bar for donors to contribute a bit more to the most expensive congressional race in history costing more than 50 million updated at 7 00 p m most polls close polls have closed everywhere outside of two precincts in dekalb county per our colleague kristina torres those two precincts had received permission from a judge to extend voting by 30 minutes after they experienced problems checking voters in this morning read more here about how the votes are tallied and followalong with the election results as they come in live here updated at 6 40 p m 6th district geography as far as congressional districts go the 6th is compact it encompasses portions of just three counties north fulton east cobb and north dekalb here are a few things to keep an eye on as vote tallies begin to trickle in from this suburban stretch of north atlanta it s worth checking out our breakdown of how the three counties voted by party and neighborhood during the contest s first round on april 18 back then the 11 republicans on the ballot collectively won 51 percent of the vote with democrats picking up the remaining 49 percent if handel is able to hold onto the precincts her party won two months ago and prevent ossoff from winning any additional ones she ll be in good shape updated at 6 20 p m who will be hurt by the rain at least one local gop strategist thinks that karen handel will be aided by today s rain according to the ajc s torres elections officials are continuing to report a slow but steady turnout that s good news for handel according to gop strategist chip lake said if you re karen handel you want as many people voting on election day said lake adding that handel s margin over ossoff among people voting today could be as high as 20 points assuming they come out to cast a ballot updated at 6 10 p m the superpac offering free rides to the polls even before today s rain came into the forecast a super pac had raised more than 60 000 to offer free rides to the polls for 6th district voters my ride to vote has been offering voters of all political stripes a ride to precincts much as they did during last year s presidential race in pennsylvania florida and north carolina voters were able to use the service by calling or texting a

prices closed at 52 cents meanwhile ossoff opened at 60 cents and has trended down ever since dropping to a current price of 46 cents recent polling in this race shows handel and democrat jon ossoff neck and neck with only one tenth of a percentage point between them updated at 5 10 p m newly registered voters a federal judge in early may extended voter registration in the district by two months part of an ongoing lawsuit over how georgia handles voter registration ahead of federal runoff elections voters had until may 21st to register an extension that led to an extra 8 000 voters being added to the rolls most of those newbies did not vote early according to a recent ajc analysis only one in five of them voted early comprising about 1 2 percent of the race s total early vote mark rountree a local pollster from the republican leaning firm landmark communications recently posted this analysis to facebook yesterday when 7pm strikes on election night we estimate that maybe 2 750 or so of these voters will have voted probably split 3 1 for ossoff so maybe 700 of these votes will be for handel vs perhaps 2 100 for ossoff a 1 400 vote differential extra clarification a few people asked more than 10 000 new voters were registered during those 60 days in question and then processed i don t remember the number at the moment however just 1600 have actually voted in early voting so far and perhaps around a total of 2750 will have voted once election day voting has closed updated at 4 55 p m prominent democrats weigh in on race after entering the 6th district race on a pledge to make trump furious democrat jon ossoff has tacked hard to the center advocating for bolstering tech jobs and cutting government waste as a way to win over independents and unhappy republicans democrats have tried to walk a similar line before in georgia vouching for moderate sounding proposals while trying to keep a base of left leaning supporters energized it hasn t worked see jason carter the party s unsuccessful candidate for governor in 2014 our colleague jill vejnoska caught up with carter the grandson of former president jimmy carter during an event today on the roof yes roof of his grandfather s presidential library he said he s optimistic about ossoff pulling out a win but carter cautioned that political types shouldn t draw too many broader conclusions from tonight s race given all the outside money that s streamed into the district it s clear though that his demeanor his message of bringing people together of bringing some civilityback into politics hasresonated in that district carter said of ossoff and that to me is a great lesson state rep scott holcomb an atlanta democrat whose power center lies in dekalb said he also thinks ossoff will be victorious i only came to that conclusion in the last few days because this is not a district that a democrat should win based on the partisan breakdown of voters he said but i ve watched the race closely ossoff ran a better campaign and his supporters are far more enthusiastic updated at 4 10 p m poring over the early vote as we wait for the polls to close let s take a look at the votes that rolled in well before today early turnout in this race has been historic our colleagues torres and jennifer peebles report with more than 140 000 people casting their ballots early in person or by absentee by mail ballots that s a 150 percent increase over the number of people who voted early ahead of the race s original april 18 special election in dekalb county about 25 percent of eligible voters turned out early more than one in three registered people voted early in fulton county s portion of the 6th district while more than 23 percent came out early in cobb said torres over the weekend this time in round 2 many are expecting easily more than 200 000 voters with some saying it will go even higher in a district that has about 530 000 registered voters in all we also know that 37 percent of the people who voted in the runoff also cast ballots in the2016 republican presidential primary versus 22 percent for the democratic presidential primary read torres and peebles analysis of the early vote and what it could mean here updated at 3 50 p m breaking down the money as we mentioned above this 6th district contest has become the most expensive in the history of the u s house prompting more than 50 million in spending it s nearing the records hit by the most expensive senate contests of all time pretty impressive considering that we re talking about a three county district and not an entire state here are some key figures from the totals we reported yesterday much of the rest came from outside groups and the two political parties the nonpartisan advocacy organization issue one has a higher tally of money spent on this race 59 6 million if you want more detail on how the campaigns spent the rest of their money click here updated at 3 20 p m a little more about the candidates an inexperienced shill for nancy pelosi a career politician who would harm women s health jon ossoff karen handel the two parties and a handful of outside groups have spent millions trying to shape public perception of their opponents but in the hours before the polls close in the 6th district it s worth taking a step back check out our in depth profiles of handel and ossoff updated at 2 45 p m watch cobb returns tonight we included this item in our morning newsletter today but we think it bears reposting here one month ago the runoff was held for state senate district 32 most of that state legislative district and the cobb county portion of the sixth overlap republican kay kirkpatrick a physician with strong ties to former congressman tom price beat democrat christine triebsch a marietta lawyer the seat had formerly been held by republican judson hill in that runoff kirkpatrick pulled 58 percent of the vote to triebsch s 42 percent the latter was woefully underfunded our number crunching friend tells us that ossoff doesn t have to win cobb to pull out a victory tonight but he does have to do better than triebsch by his calculation if you see ossoff pulling 45 percent or better in cobb he ll win if he s pulling only 43 percent ossoff could still win but it ll be much closer if handel keeps ossoff under 43 percent in cobb then the night is probably hers and republicans retain a congressional seat they ve held since newt gingrich was a young man updated at 2 30 p m photos from the front our ajc photographers have been on the ground today snapping pictures of voters and the two campaigns check out a photo gallery of their work here updated at 2 25 p m voters weigh in on being in the spotlight the voters of the 6th district have been clobbered with non stop attack ads on television radio and in the mail for months now many have been on the receiving end of campaign canvassers at their front doorseveral times over it s hard to overstate how many of the locals we talked to who are anxious for things to get back to normal take keiko coghlin of sandy springs she told our intern martha michael that she voted for karen handel because jon ossoff s campaign just drove me crazy they called our house stuffed up our mailbox they even rang our doorbell we were really turned off by that coghlin said for anyone that was on the fence in this election this kind of stuff really pushed you towards handel some of jon ossoff s supporters said they see the national attention as energizing i ve lived in cobb county since 1998 i ve taught here and i know how deep the conservative roots run here but i ve been so encouraged by the way people have come out and come together said karen thorpe a former teacher who came out to wave signs for ossoff in roswell on tuesday morning this is democracy at its finest updated at 1 55 p m could weather dampen turnout 6th district voters who haven t already dashed to the polls should plan on getting very wet when they do cast their ballots our colleague ben brasch reports and it s only supposed to get worse as the day goes on the national weather service has issued weather advisories and flash flood warnings for the region the latter of which is expected to last until after polls close we don t have a great sense yet re how that will impact turnout yet in general though rain tends to dampen turnout which has historically hurt democrats ossoff s campaign said it s confident it has the edge in terms of voter enthusiasm which can help make up for any voters staying home due to the weather meanwhile georgia gop chairman john watson tweeted this about the fain updated at 1 35 p m dekalb voting hours extended and just like that dekalb county officials have received permission to extend voting hours at two precincts for 30 more minutes tonight torres has more updated at 1 15 p m fairly smooth at the polls so far it s been relatively smooth sailing so far at 6th district polling places torres reports voters at two polling locations in dekalb county reported slow check ins earlier this morning which could cause local officials to seek an extension of voting hours

handel cast her vote dozens of reporters and camera crews scrambled for a view of the candidate as she quickly filled out her ballot after the deed was done handel repeatedly mentioned how her opponent couldn t do the same i ve lived here for nearly 25 years and i think that s going to make a big difference to the voters in this district she said ossoff lives next door in the 5th district the democrat said it s so hisfianc can walk to work at emory university hospital congressional candidates don t have to live in the districts they represent but ossoff said he plans to move to the 6th if he wins handel predicted today s race is essentially a jump ball shewas nearly drowned out by roughly 50 ossoff supporters as they chanted flip the 6th flip the 6th at the entrance of the polling place updated at 12 20 p m ossoff s final pitch democrat jon ossoff held a host of rah rah rallies across the district tuesday including an event in sandy springs with about two dozen supporters and just as many reporters this is about this community at an extraordinary moment of time a coalition that we have built that s founded on the core values that bring people together in this community he said giving his volunteers a closing nudge it s close and those of us in the room right now and i know you ve been working hard for hours days months this is the final push let s give it everything we ve got updated at 12 05 p m recovering lawmaker gets involved u s rep steve scalise r la tweeted his endorsement of karen handel in today s contest writing that she is a great candidate the 6th district race took a tenser turn after scalise and other republican legislators including georgia rep barry loudermilk were ambushed at a baseball field in suburban washington last week scalise the

threatening letter with a white powder later deemed to be non hazardous by the fbi jon ossoff hired a security detail amid a spate of unspecified threats targeting him both condemned an attack ad by a fringe gop super pac that sought to politicize the shooting it s uncertain whether the shooting will help shore up votes for either candidate but a wsb poll released monday showed a majority of voters who had yet to cast their ballots said they had no effect on their decision about one third of election day voters said the attack would make them more likely to cast their ballots and most of those
