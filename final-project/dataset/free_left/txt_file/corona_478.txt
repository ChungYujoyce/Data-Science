protecting the parks and normal rules and regulations continue to apply those precautions are unlikely to keep visitors from coming into close contact said a lobbyist for an interest group that works to protect national parks many parks are designed in a way to move visitors keep them on trails and keep them on roads said kristen brengel vice president of government affairs for the national parks conservation association parks inherently funnel people to see overlooks and waterfalls and rivers people stop at various points to view the wonderful scenery they re more conducive to people gathering parks are built for visitation thousands of people are going into zion near las vegas every day brengel said they gather at one of its more popular lookouts angels landing accessed by a demanding hike up a narrow trail echoing officials at interior brengel said it s understandable that people want to get outdoors but the risk of spreading the coronavirus is a steep price for recreation she said practice socialdistancing cdc says to avoid groups larger than 10 and stay 6 feet apart you can help slow the spread of covid 19 we do not recommend hiking busy narrow trails like angels landing nps photo taken yesterday 3 21 20 on angels landing pic twitter com sxversucu2 our concern is that interior is practicing trial and error instead of being proactive where they know visitors are going to gather brengel said the conservation association supports closing crowded parks but favors waiving entrance fees to keep collectors safe officials don t know if free entry led to more weekend visitors picavet said among the parks that continue to provide limited access we are seeing a variety of fluctuations in visitation she said when visitors failed to adhere to public health guidelines more restrictions were implemented picavet said park officials announced monday that a portion of the angels landing trail was closed due to weekend crowding other parks also acted

said his colleagues at klondike gold rush grumbled when the park supervisor said he had authority to close portions of the park many wanted it to close entirely he said the national park service needs to recognize that the way they ve been behaving is irresponsible and send everyone home but security stone said not all parks are going to be a problem and not all areas in a park are going to be a problem but working out a nuance like that takes time and we don t have time those who live near national parks and normally like seeing out of towners arrive in droves to boost the local economy are
