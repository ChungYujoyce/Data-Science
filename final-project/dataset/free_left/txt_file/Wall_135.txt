advertisement supported by now that the pandemic is raging outside china s borders foreigners are being shunned barred from public spaces and even evicted by vivian wang and amy qin hong kong after 16 years in china a congolese businessman thought he knew what being black there entailed he had been subjected to racial slurs and denied apartments but he had also learned chinese and made local friends he loved the country he called it his second home but the businessman felly mwamba had not anticipated the coronavirus pandemic during which he would find himself sealed in his home prohibited from leaving and eyed as a carrier of the disease simply because he was african the way they are treating black people you cannot accept mr mwamba said by telephone we are not animals as china tames the coronavirus epidemic now ravaging other countries its success is giving rise to an increasingly strident blend of patriotism nationalism and xenophobia at a pitch many say has not been seen in decades a restaurant in northern china put up a banner celebrating the virus s spread in the united states a widely circulated cartoon showed foreigners being sorted into trash bins african residents in the southern city of guangzhou including mr mwamba have been corralled into forced quarantines labeled as dangers to the country s health some of the uglier manifestations of nationalism have been fueled by government propaganda which has touted china s response to the virus as evidence of the ruling communist party s superiority and recriminations from abroad including calls to make china pay for the pandemic that began there have triggered defensiveness on the part of many chinese whipping up national pride has long been a tool for solidifying the party s grip on power in the short term the nationalism may be useful to the central government as it seeks to quell lingering discontent over its early attempts to play down the outbreak but if left unchecked the vitriol risks isolating china internationally just as the communist party seeks to use the pandemic to promote itself as a global leader in recent days countries that are usually friendly with china have denounced chinese xenophobia while business leaders have warned of difficulties operating there the real risk that the nationalism poses is to foreign governments perception of threat from china said jessica chen weiss a professor at cornell university who has studied chinese nationalism china s heightened us against them mentality is perhaps most apparent in its recent strictures aimed at foreigners though the chinese government denounced racist attacks against asians overseas when the outbreak was centered in china it now casts people from other countries as public health risks last month china barred virtually all foreigners from entering even though it had criticized other countries for closing their borders officials emphasize that most of china s new cases are now imported often without mentioning that many are chinese citizens returning home fear of imported infections has at times exploded into or provided cover for xenophobia in beijing and shanghai foreigners have been barred from some shops and gyms supposedly as part of a campaign to combat the virus we are temporarily not accepting foreign friends and people whose temperature is above 37 3 read a sign in a hair salon near beijing s central business district a salon employee said she didn t see it as discrimination it is an epidemic after all she said john artman the american editor of a chinese tech publication said his office building in beijing reopened last month after closing during the outbreak but he was told that the building was not admitting foreigners by coincidence the company was already planning to move its office but when he tried to visit the new office two weeks later a colleague said the new site too would not permit foreigners to enter mr artman is still working from home in yiwu a city in zhejiang province lucky destiny a nigerian jewelry exporter said that whenever he went outside during the past two weeks locals would cover their noses or move away shopkeepers shooed him away and people got off buses when he boarded he has taken to buying food only at night when the streets are emptier i had a plan for business being able to build something for my family said mr destiny 28 if this continues i will try to leave the authorities have said their outbreak prevention measures apply equally to chinese and non chinese but they have sometimes singled out foreigners in the same breath a recent editorial in china daily a state run newspaper denied discrimination against foreigners even as it said that some foreigners choose to flout china s rules on containment some expressions of antiforeigner sentiment have made no pretense about public health concerns last month a porridge restaurant in the northeastern city of shenyang displayed a banner that read celebrating the epidemic in the united states and wishing coronavirus a nice trip to japan perhaps nowhere has xenophobia manifested itself more strongly than in guangzhou a manufacturing hub with a large african population in recent days african residents have reported being evicted from their homes and hotels after five nigerians there tested positive for the virus africans have also been ordered to undergo 14 day quarantines at their own expense even if they have no recent travel history or have already tested negative images shared on social media showed groups of black people sleeping on a sidewalk and a sign banning black people from a mcdonald s mr mwamba the congolese trader said he and other community leaders spent one night last week walking around the city looking for lodging for congolese students who had been ejected from their hotel soon after his apartment door was taped shut with mr mwamba inside and local officials told him he could not go out for 14 days he said the events in guangzhou have drawn sharp and unusual condemnation from officials in africa where china has cultivated close ties and economic reliance through billions of dollars in loans and investments ghana s foreign minister on saturday criticized the inhumane treatment of africans in china a group of african ambassadors wrote a letter to china s foreign minister denouncing stigmatization and discrimination foreigners are not the only targets of china s swelling nationalism chinese people deemed insufficiently admiring of the government have been subjected to vitriolic online attacks by china s army of little pinks a nickname for the generation of young digital warriors who pounce on any criticism of the communist party they recently targeted a novelist fang fang who for two months published a daily journal of life under lockdown in wuhan where the outbreak began she wrote of the bravery of ordinary people around her while also vowing to hold local government officials to account when news emerged last week that her diary would be translated and published in english she faced a torrent of abuse accusing her of helping foreign governments undermine her own country her writings are being used to blackmail china to demand that china pay compensation to bring china to trial to interrogate china sima nan a maoist scholar and well known defender of communist party rule said about fang fang in an interview she has become a political tool fang fang has likened the harassment to her childhood during the cultural revolution of the 1960s and 70s when anyone seen as even mildly critical of mao zedong risked torture or imprisonment a few prominent voices have warned of the dangers of excessive national pride in a recent essay hua sheng a respected economist urged more introspection some people say if we investigate our country s culpability we would be giving evidence to outsiders and giving them a sword with which to hurt our national interests he wrote i must say it s precisely the opposite there are signs that the nationalism already threatens to create a backlash that could undermine china s economic and diplomatic status j rg wuttke president of the european union chamber of commerce in china recently said that the scope of limitations on foreigners in china was much deeper than in other countries and excludes us from a lot of public spaces the chamber has called china s restrictions on arriving foreigners an unprecedented challenge for corporations further hostility could intensify existing pressure for countries to reduce their reliance on china last week japan historically a target of chinese nationalism announced a 2 2 billion fund to help companies shift production out of china the next day larry kudlow a top economic adviser to president trump suggested that the united states follow suit and pay the moving costs of american companies from china back to the u s mr mwamba who exports motorcycle parts and construction materials has been contemplating a move of his own despite his deep ties to the country this week made me really think a lot he said i love china but sometimes i m feeling tired transcript from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily today in the middle of the pandemic china has expelled journalists from the wall street journal the washington post and the new york times one of those reporters my colleague paul mozur recounts his final days there it s thursday april 16 paul mozur tell us about these text messages that you got a few weeks ago so it s late probably a bit after midnight and i am in shanghai in my apartment where i ve lived for the past three years and i m doing that thing where you re trying to read in bed but the phone keeps buzzing and i ve told myself this is the last time i m going to check and i look at the phone and for the first time ever when i ve picked up my phone while i m trying to sleep it s actually relevant and so what i see is one of my colleagues in our sort of private chat group for covering the coronavirus sends a message and it s a memo from the ministry of foreign affairs in china and the first bit it s all kind of stock language it s not too big of a deal but then i get to point two and i read point two and i have to read it again because what it says in this roundabout way is basically that the entire staff of the new york times all of our reporters in china have to leave the country in just a few weeks we ve effectively been expelled it s not just us that s been thrown out it s also a number of reporters with the wall street journal and the washington post so this is the greater part of the u s press corps in china being tossed so you re on your phone in bed looking at a memo that basically says your job in china is over yes our time is up as you re looking at this what are your colleagues and you saying to each other as you re digesting this information from the chinese government you know i think i m the first to weigh in and i say let me be the first to say this expletive expletive expletive and then that kind of starts it off there s some agreement about that there s various other kind of expressions of shock and then our asia editor adrienne carter weighs in and says we re still trying to figure out what this means we re going to have some calls tomorrow but it doesn t look good i think we knew for a long time that it was possible our days were numbered but even if you kind of know that the chinese government isn t happy with you the idea of kind of closing a chapter of more than 13 years of your life spent focusing on a place learning a language being there is just impossible to kind of deal with instantly it just felt totally surreal so i kind of wandered out to my balcony and it was a cool kind of the fog was coming into shanghai and it was sort of just a dark night and i just kind of spent the next hour or two just sort of outside and thinking i was sort of a nostalgic mess in a way wow so this is basically a large scale media purge i wonder what explanation the chinese government gives for this because it feels like this violates decades of journalistic tradition where the u s has reporters in china and china has reporters in the u s yeah ostensibly it s a tit for tat a few weeks ago the trump administration put a cap on the number of chinese journalists who work for state media that can be in the united states and china calls this an effective expulsion of 60 chinese media workers so this is the response from the chinese government to throw us out but there s a lot more to it than that it becomes really clear pretty quickly after because a commentary goes up on state media and asks the question why are these journalists being thrown out mhm and it doesn t bring up the united states what it goes into is or coverage and it says that we were overly critical and biased in attacking the chinese government in how it responded to the coronavirus that we were biased against china generally and then it also brings up xinjiang and it says that the stories that we told over the past year about uighurs being locked away in camps are exaggerated and false and just not the true narrative and so i think at that point you kind of see yes on the one hand this is a tit for tat but on the other hand it s about so much more so once you have more or less made peace with the fact that you re going to be kicked out what do you do well you do what you have to do when you have to leave very quickly i start buying plane tickets and you can t think of a worse time to be thrown out of a country because borders are closing all over and any flight has some level of virus risk and so right i get a flight ticket to the united states i get one to japan i get went to korea i get three tickets and then as borders are closing i actually buy two more wow more close to my date so i can get out quicker before these borders close but then i realize i have a few days left and i have a bit of this well this sort of dilemma because i was supposed to go on a reporting trip the day i heard about this thing and we canceled it but in my experience in journalism has been you always go out when you can and so i decided ok one last hurrah here we go and what is this reporting job well it s supposed to be a pretty routine article china at this point is getting back to normal life is starting to return to the rhythms that had been there pre epidemic so the idea is to find a sort of more middle class town and go there and talk to people and see how dazed they are how excited they are to be out that kind of thing and so we choose the town of hefei which is a city about three or four hours away from shanghai by train and my colleague and i planned the trip and we decide to go there for two days and see what life is like there so we go to this mall to try to do some interviews speaking chinese the checkpoints are out to get into the mall you need to have your temperature taken by a guard you need to write down your personal information speaking chinese and we start talking to a construction worker and within a few minutes a police officer comes in and sort of beckons him he basically disappears and we ask him what happened he said oh the police officer said no assembly here because of the virus so we move on and what becomes apparent is the police officer he s stripped off his jacket to go undercover and he is following us kind of diving into stores when we look back to see him and kind of peeking from behind clothing racks to look at what we re doing so we say all right well let s get out of here so we hop in a car and we go across town to a pedestrian shopping street we seem to have lost him we re like ok so we re walking down and we hear this beat the beat of pop music and there s this fantastic scene it s the storefront of china gold which sells jewelry and all of the staff are out in front doing these coordinated dance moves they re trying to drum up business and they invite us in they say oh yeah we re happy to talk and so one guy says you know for all of our dancing it s not helping that much people want to get out but nobody has any money to spend and we re starting to kind of sit down and sort of set up to talk to him longer and we look up and who s coming in the store behind him but that same police officer and he goes in the back has a word with the manager and just a few minutes later the guy kind of says you know what i m sorry i can t talk ah so the police are clearly attempting to block your reporting yeah so i get a little frustrated but you can t get rid of these guys and so they re basically on us for the rest of the time and it becomes almost impossible to talk to any regular person about what would be an overwhelmingly positive story paul i feel like being surveilled by the chinese authorities is now a somewhat familiar feeling for you when you go on a reporting trip yeah i was thinking about it and i think it s maybe been a dozen times over the past year that i ve had to deal with security but the thing is with something that s sort of a more basic story like this you don t normally get this kind of attention i mean that s the kind of thing you get in really really sensitive stories where they know you re coming and they ve prepared for you and they really don t want you to learn anything so the idea that just talking to regular people feels so dangerous to them that they re putting this kind of effort in i mean that s different and it s extreme for sure so what happens next well we go on walk across the park and we end up at a mcdonald s so we re talking about leaving and how frustrated we are by what s happened and a man is kind of eating behind us and he gets up and as he s walking out the door he turns to me and he says foreign trash wow we both kind of look up and we re sort of shocked and so we look at him and he says yeah you foreign trash what are you doing in my country and then he turns to my chinese colleague and he says you expletive what are you doing with him wow you expletive and so she starts wanting to kind of defend me and she s very upset and i have to basically tell her don t yell back he s menacingly hovering over us it does feel like it could get physical very easily and after a few minutes of kind of basically mumbling more nastiness at us he leaves nobody says anything and everybody goes back to eating and we try to calm ourselves down and paul what did you make of that attack from this random stranger well i mean as a foreigner you stand out in china and there s a lot of good attention that brings and there s some negative attention over the years but i think there had been a real uptick in xenophobia lately online we ve seen a lot more nastiness on the chinese internet about foreigners and a lot of foreigners are starting to talk about run ins they ve had the reason we went to hefei in the first place is it was one of the few places we could find a hotel that would accept a foreigner i called about 30 hotels and these are american chains the hilton and the marriott and none of them would accept a foreigner wow and so hefei was partially because we found a westin that would take us paul at this point you re describing a bunch of experiences that have happened to you in the past but are happening a lot more intensely in this moment government surveillance anti westernism and of course you re about to be kicked out of the country by the government so are you starting to suspect that this is all linked yeah i think it all feels a part of the same thing and everything has been so extreme with the virus there s so much fear and there s so much anger there s just so much that feels so heightened that it feels different and it feels like we re kind of at a point of change and it s not good it s not good for a foreigner in the country but it s also probably not good for the country itself it feels like there s a kind of rejection of what i had thought was an openness to the world in china we ll be right back paul where do you think rejection of the outside world this really heightened version of surveillance and xenophobia where s this coming from in this moment the chinese government and i think maybe one way that s interesting to think about it is through the lens of the virus so by all rights the virus appears to start in wuhan and kind of spreads out from there but i don t remember precisely when this was but a chinese scientist at some point comes out and says well we don t know precisely where it came from we don t know precisely the first patient or how the first person got infected and then what happens is chinese state media and chinese officials seize on this to say it seems like maybe it didn t come from china at all that it could come from somewhere else they re saying that this virus didn t come from wuhan they aren t that pointed about it at first they just kind of inject this skepticism speaking mandarin and so then what starts to happen is rumors start to spread one thing you hear is that oh well the u s has a really bad flu season and the u s doesn t even pay attention to it because the u s has a bad health care system and so it could be that it was in the u s for a while and then it came over and then there s this sort of more pernicious rumor that a number of chinese officials seem to endorse pointed to this tweet from a spokesman for china s ministry of foreign affairs saying quote it might be u s army who brought the epidemic to wuhan be transparent make public your data u s owe us an explanation which is that the u s military brought it to wuhan because wuhan had this military games last year the inflammatory tweet echoed a canada based conspiracy website s unsubstantiated claims that america was the real source of the coronavirus apparently linking it to the u s army s participation in the military world games and that during that a u s military representative might have brought it and released it into the city and these are not small things this is loud enough that a lot of my chinese friends are asking me hey what do you think about this could this be right oh wow and then what starts happening on state media is that you start hearing about cases being imported back into china from the world they re not specifying who s bringing these things back and oftentimes it s chinese who live overseas or who are traveling overseas who got infected and came back but oftentimes state media just describes this as foreign cases and so if you re seeing that every day and you re a regular chinese person you start to fear seeing a foreigner because you assume those foreigners right they re the ones who are bringing the cases back so i don t have to worry about anything but people coming from abroad and who else comes from abroad but foreigners so the chinese government s tolerance for and even promotion of these conspiracy theories that the coronavirus didn t start in china but perhaps started in the west in a place like america that in turn is going to foment xenophobia a fear naturally of westerners who chinese people think will be carrying the virus right and not just westerners too i mean anybody who could be perceived as not being from china at this point africans living in guangzhou say that they re being kicked out of their homes and face harassment as health workers step up testing for imported infections in southern china where there s a large african community a large number of africans are evicted from their homes out of fear and hotels won t have them so they re sleeping on the streets african diplomats are trying to deal with this but they re shouted down mcdonald s and other restaurants won t let black people in the united states issues an actual diplomatic warning to african americans saying avoid this area because of the xenophobia and racism and so you just see this sort of snowballing effect of this fear growing and growing all of the fear of the foreigners related to the virus starts to tie into nationalism and a national self image all of which has been carefully cultivated by the chinese communist party and the chinese government paul why would it be in china s interest to basically promote this xenophobia right now so this is an old trick that the chinese communist party has used in the past whenever there s a fear that the legitimacy of their rule is threatened if people start to point the fingers at top leaders they need to find somebody else to blame and the easiest is foreigners foreign influence and often the united states so if we go back to last year one of the biggest stories here was the hong kong protests right and for month after month the front of newspapers on tv we just saw fiery clashes tear gas police shooting protesters this is hugely embarrassing right and so what does the chinese communist party do they blame the protests on the united states and on the west they say the united states is fomenting this and it s an aggressive act against china and so then throughout the year as well we did a lot of coverage of what was going on in western china in xinjiang more than a million uighurs and others belonging to various muslim minority groups are believed to be detained in the xinjiang region into a vast network of detention centers for what china calls re education where more than a million minority uighurs have been held in camps and for that too it gets tons of attention and right people talking about it all over the world and so again they have to find an excuse and they say well the foreign forces and the western media are making this up and they re trying to blacken china and tar china and so then we get to this year and out of nowhere comes this virus and what becomes very clear is that there s quite the cover up at the beginning and so again we re relentless in our coverage we put this right on the front page we dissect meticulously how this happened and what happened and again the chinese government sees this as uncompromisingly aggressive and just an embarrassment and so once again how else can you kind of explain it all except to kind of turn the tables and blame foreign influences and so we see this pattern where we are a thorn in their side and they ultimately blame us and under chinese leader xi jinping there s been this idea that china is now a superpower and that the world needs to take china into account they need to listen to what china has to say china will be at the table and they should respect china and i think over and over again we see in xi jinping s china that there s less and less room for anything that challenges that idea and so now we re at a place where one more group of people who would challenge this idea are gone meaning the foreign media yeah what the chinese government wants to tell is a story of triumph they ve emerged from the virus as the rest of the world is under siege and under lockdown and the story they want to tell is that the reason they were able to beat the virus is the superiority of the chinese system this sort of enlightened authoritarianism that is able to technocratically manage every variable and fix everything and make things right and when they look around the world they can point and say look at all of these democracies they re suffering terribly more people are dying more people are sick they re in crisis and we ve gotten through this we succeeded that means we are the new superpower we are the sort of country in ascendancy and everybody must pay their respects now right and of course the one thing that could get in the way of that that idealized version of that story that china conquered this virus and did better with it than the west are a bunch of western reporters poking around finding examples of failure or finding the reemergence of the virus i mean that just is incompatible with that story exactly paul correct me if i m wrong at this point there s still an order telling you that you need to leave china this unsuccessful reporting trip has come to an end so where are you in your process of being expelled so this is sort of the end of march and the thing is the virus is spreading around the world and countries are closing their borders to foreigners so if i want to go anywhere outside of the united states and be in the same time zone and continue to cover china i need to leave quicker and so i actually end up leaving just a few days later much faster than i thought i would and so i pack up my stuff indistinct clatter i walk out the door taking one last look door closing i leave my apartment speaking mandarin and i head for the airport for a final flight out of a country that has held my imagination and just captured my attention and just been so incredibly interesting that it s been impossible to leave for 15 years i get on a flight and leave it for what will probably be the final time in a long time and i find myself a few hours later ladies and gentlemen we have landed at narita airport inaudible with our time difference between shanghai and in japan and i get through just before the borders are closing to americans it s been our pleasure to serve you on this flight thank you for flying with inaudible your china flight and start a two week quarantine and a new life outside of china i mean i can t imagine that it s easy or even really possible to cover china from outside of china right yeah it s a different sort of thing i think one of the really important things about having journalists in china is that for all of the propaganda and all of the intimidation chinese people still want to talk they love telling stories they love talking about what their experiences are and one of our best ways to just find out what was happening is to go to places and talk to regular people and now that avenue is cut off to us and so we re going to be reliant on filings and government documents and we re just going to have a vaguer picture a far less precise picture of what s going on in the place right at a moment when it would seem like the eyes and ears of journalists would be as essential as ever so how are you feeling about this you know it feels like it couldn t be at a worse time because now is the most important and most interesting moment to be in china because china is as powerful and as large as it s ever been and it s on this steep path of authoritarianism xi jinping will not step down the way previous presidents did he will continue to push this triumphalism and where that goes and what it means for chinese people and for the world is probably in my mind the most important story to not be able to be there to see it just feels like an irreparable loss and it makes me feel i guess grateful for the time i had there do you think paul that when this is all over this pandemic and perhaps china reaches a point where this triumphalism has been achieved that things might return to the way that they were before all of this for journalists like you and for the relationship between china and the west i really do think we ve crossed a point in the u s china relationship that will be difficult to come back from i think both countries have made it clear the way they view the world is at odds and it s unfortunate because the one way we could get back to where there is more understanding is to have exchanges and to have people on the ground trying to explain china to the united states and the united states to china and that s not happening yeah that s not happening and i don t see it getting better anytime soon paul thank you very much i know you don t really want to be in the position that you re in but we wish you the very best of luck thanks we ll be right back here s what else you need to know today u s retail sales which include purchases in stores and online as well as in restaurants and bars experienced their largest monthly decline in three decades in march as lockdowns changed consumer behavior the depth of the decline nearly 9 percent according to the commerce department is significant because the retail industry accounts for 1 out of every 10 american jobs april s retail sales may be even worse because state lockdowns have only intensified since march and among all of the other candidates i competed with in the democratic primary there s no one i ve agreed with 100 percent of the time over the years but one thing i appreciate about joe biden is he will always tell you where he stands in a video released on wednesday elizabeth warren became the latest former rival to endorse joe biden for president as the democratic party moves to coalesce around his candidacy when you disagree he ll listen and not just listen but really hear you and treat you with respect no matter where you re coming from in the past week both bernie sanders and former president barack obama have also endorsed biden that s it for the daily i m michael barbaro see you tomorrow vivian wang reported from hong kong and amy qin from
