 beijing china s currency slid for a second day on wednesday sending more shockwaves through global financial markets and raising fresh questions about the credibility of the country s economic management the surprise moves by china to allow more market forces to set currency rates an effective devaluation at the moment have also deepened speculation about the true strength of the world s second largest economy after recent jolts including a stock market plunge the sense that the communist party was an almost infallible steward of the nation s economy took a battering during the stock crash in june and july a few weeks later china s economic data showing growth steady at 7 percent despite widespread signs of a slowdown were widely derided by analysts as inaccurate and overblown now fresh concerns have surfaced about the stewardship of the central bank after a shock decision to allow market forces to play a greater role in setting exchange rates over two days china s currency known as the yuan or renminbi was down 3 5 percent sparking headlines about a global currency war and threatening to fan trade tensions with the united states china devaluation of yuan prompts u s outcry the currency shake up has spilled far beyond china to drag down world financial markets the dow jones industrial average was down 1 3 percent at midday wednesday after shedding 1 2 percent on tuesday but it recovered in the afternoon erasing its losses and edging into positive territory european exchanges took a beating for a second day led by a 3 4 percent drop in france s cac 40 and a nearly 3 3 percent fall in germany s dax china s central bank set a central rate for the yuan on wednesday at 6 3306 to the dollar slightly below the previous day s closing rate the yuan then slid further during onshore trading to close at 6 3870 to the dollar on tuesday the bank said it would adjust the mechanism by which it sets the yuan s central rate to give the market a greater role the yuan can then trade 2 percent higher or lower than that central rate while experts said some of the criticism could be wide of the mark the people s bank of china may now have a tough job on its hands to prevent the currency s decline from spiraling china s remedy to slowing economy cheaper currency the central bank s credibility will be put to the test said andrew polk resident economist at the conference board china center for economics and business in beijing after the recent flubbing of the stock market fall this is arguably a somewhat dangerous course of action china s decision to free up its exchange rate appeared to come in response to repeated urging from the international monetary fund as well as from the united states it appeared designed experts said to bolster the case for the yuan s acceptance as a global reserve currency and specifically its inclusion in the special drawing rights basket alongside the dollar euro yen and pound but the move was also probably timed to support the nation s slowing economy and critical export sector many economists agree the currency had become overvalued and efforts to keep it stable had kept domestic interest rates higher and monetary policy tighter than economic conditions warranted what the chinese devaluation means for the world economy the yuan hit a four year low on wednesday reaching 6 45 to the dollar within china and as low as 6 59 in international trade ironically japan and the euro zone have overseen much sharper depreciations in the yen and euro respectively this year as part of efforts to stimulate their economies but they have escaped without the volley of criticism from u s politicians that greeted china s decision tuesday in china senior commerce ministry official zhang yuzhong was reported as saying on wednesday that the currency s decline would help exports a backbone of the chinese economy reuters news agency quoted unnamed sources as saying there was growing clamor within government circles to allow further depreciation in coming months for that reason but trying to manage a steady decline in a currency can be a dangerous game said chris weston chief markets strategist at ig in melbourne explaining that expectations of depreciation will only encourage more capital outflows if they get this wrong it can go bad he said they need to plant a seed that speculators are not going to get their own way that at some stage there is going to be stability and that we will be there stock market crash lands heavily on chinese leadership while investor george soros was famously said to have broken the bank of england in 1992 by speculating against the pound and forcing sterling out of europe s exchange rate mechanism the people s bank of china is unlikely to face anything like those pressures and has a much stronger hand in the form of 3 65 trillion in foreign exchange reserves still the bank will have to keep its fingers crossed said chen long an economist with gavekal dragonomics in beijing who sketched out three scenarios the worst scenario is that the yuan continues to slide perhaps toward 7 to the dollar that would put enormous downward pressure on other asian currencies raise a further firestorm of criticism in the united states about efforts to steal american jobs and give substance to those alarmist currency war headlines about nations engaging in competitive devaluations to boost their economies the central bank also could do a u turn and give up on the idea of letting markets determine the exchange rate which would also damage its credibility or the currency could stabilize in a day or two chen said foreign exchange traders told wire services that state owned banks began selling dollars on wednesday on behalf of the people s bank of china to help stem the currency s slide looking at the international and domestic economic situation currently there is no basis for a sustained depreciation trend for the yuan the central bank said but markets have a habit of overshooting china s stock market has lost around a quarter of its value since a mid june peak after rising 150 percent in the previous year in an effort to stabilize that market the authorities damaged their own standing by taking extreme measures banning major shareholders from selling shares and launching criminal investigations into malicious short sellers arthur kroeber managing director at gavekal dragonomics said this week s move to a market driven exchange rate would be good for china and the world in the long term supporting the government s efforts to reform its economy and its intention to give markets a decisive role in allocating resources but the timing is problematic he wrote in a note on wednesday the currency is being let off the leash right at the moment when market sentiment on china is pessimistic because of a continuing economic slowdown an increase in private capital outflows and entrenched producer price deflation he wrote market confidence was also shaken by the authorities clumsy intervention to prop up the stock market after the popping of the equity bubble in june in this context it is no surprise that many traders and analysts have interpreted the currency move wrongly in our view as a last throw of the dice by a government panicking about an economy in free fall
