as coronavirus continues to ravage the country striking majority minority communities one of the hardest hit has been the city of chicago which has emerged as one of the leading areas where african americans are suffering infections and deaths disproportionately chicago news station wbez reports that while blacks make up 23 percent of the cook county illinois population they make up 58 percent of deaths from covid 19 based on data from the cook county medical examiner s office in chicago proper where blacks are 29 percent of the population largely concentrated on the south and west sides 61

inequities already exist report report reveals michigan s staggering number of black covid 19 positive patients chicago joins other cities including milwaukee just 90 minutes north detroit new orleans and philadelphia who have reported an increased number of covid 19 cases affecting the black community a report from propublica shows coronavirus mushrooming in black communities as a result of the higher rates of hypertension diabetes asthma and heart disease and a report from the new york city department of health and mental hygiene revealed that the most concentrated areas of covid 19 cases were found in low income communities of color in brooklyn queens and the bronx while new orleans now has the dubious distinction of having a higher death rate per capita than even new york city
