 the politico caucus republicans are focused on the race for second place by steven shepard 02 09 2016 05 16 am est illustration by politico getty image bernie sanders and donald trump are overwhelming favorites in new hampshire but that doesn t mean tuesday s primaries are devoid of drama the new hampshire operatives strategists and activists who comprise the politico caucus most of whom are backing hillary clinton or one of the more traditional republican candidates don t believe that anyone can threaten sanders and trump for first place according to a survey conducted on the eve of the first in the nation primary roughly 90 percent of new hampshire insiders picked sanders and trump to win their respective primaries on tuesday with only a handful giving clinton or any of the other gop hopefuls namely marco rubio or ted cruz much of a chance the insiders are closely watching the margins by which both front runners prevail they expect that clinton will spin a closer than anticipated race as a moral victory in the democratic race and they anticipate that a close second place finish from one of the gop candidates could give that candidate momentum headed into south carolina and the rest of the primary calendar by nick gass advertisement i am a realist said one democrat who like all respondents completed the survey anonymously as a strong hillary supporter i would love to say she will win but i think bernie sanders has the advantage however he will not win by the margins the polls are showing i think it will only be 3 or 4 percentage points which is great considering he is practically a native son in new hampshire this is a real test voters taking ballots and voting in an election a gop insider said of trump and the republican primary it will be interesting to see if survey voters turn into real voters i think largely they will but i don t see trump winning by more than 5 points here are takeaways from each party s primary most new hampshire democrats think sanders can t be beat but some hold out hope that clinton s organization will make it close if clinton who trails by between 7 and 23 points depending on the poll keeps the race close or even catches sanders from behind it will be because of a stronger ground game insiders said i know all the polls say bernie said one democrat i know he has an advantage particularly in the western part of the state where we share media markets with vermont i know he has drastically outspent her here i know he s able to fuel his ground operation with thousands of vermonters getting bused in all reasonable data points should point to a big big sanders win that being said it does not feel that way on the ground i still believe bernie s lead is single digits another democrat added and i still believe that if it s single digits hillary s superior field operation can close the gap but would a close finish fuel clinton s efforts to beat back sanders in other states starting with the nevada caucuses and south carolina primary later this month one democratic insider said sanders would win new hampshire but the race would be closer than polls are showing and enough for hillary clinton to claim a strong comeback and get the resulting momentum sanders backers meanwhile insist that defeating clinton in new hampshire would be a momentous victory regardless of the margin 2016 by katie glueck this local politico expects a sanders victory to be in single digits but his campaign has already won in new hampshire said one democrat sanders has denied the clinton coronation sought by democratic party leaders he has utilized opportunities presented by his candidacy to jumpstart a national conversation about the systemic shortcomings of our system of government sanders continues to highlight the struggle for the soul of the democratic party republicans don t see anyone toppling trump and are focused on the race for second place trump is poised for a wire to wire victory in tuesday s gop primary republican insiders said this question has not been in doubt for the last six months said one republican sadly unless we get a lot of snow the donald will still win added another significant snow accumulation isn t expected on tuesday there were a couple of gop holdouts who maintained that trump would fall short historically new hampshire has always given the race to the surging candidate over the plateaued front runner said a republican who picked rubio to win trump could still win but it would be going against history another republican backing cruz on tuesday night suggested trump may have severely damaged himself over eminent domain in last saturday s abc news debate one republican suggested trump after finishing second in iowa last week needs to run up the score in new hampshire to sustain his image trump needs to win big as the polls show a double digit lead said the republican or his message of being the best greatest winner ever wears thin a number of republicans in addition to a handful of democrats used the survey to project the gop field beyond trump and which candidates would continue on to south carolina 2016 by kyle cheney trump wins but under 30 percent said a republican who picked john kasich and jeb bush to finish second and third respectively with rubio cruz and chris christie fourth through sixth the other winner will be the winner of the governor primary another republican added highlighting bush christie and kasich the highest finisher assuming he s in the top 3 can move on the others will be finished one democrat wondered how far rubio would fall following last saturday s uneven debate performance rubio did real damage to himself at the debate the democrat said with still so many undecided it will make a difference i expect him to come in third now these are the members of the politico caucus not all of whom participated in this survey new hampshire charlie arlinghaus arnie arnesen patrick arnold rich
