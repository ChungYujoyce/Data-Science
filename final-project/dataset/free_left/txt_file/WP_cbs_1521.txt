breathing a sigh of relief now that the tariffs were not going into effect it was unclear whether there were enough votes to block the tariffs from going into effect in congress a tariff deal also had not seemed certain the white house did not publicly identify what targets mexico needed to meet and said mexico wasn t offering enough to curb illegal immigration top white house officials had insisted the tariffs were imminent if mexico didn t drastically crack down on the flow of migrants mr trump appeared to muddy the waters even more friday afternoon while tweeting from air force one that mexico would buy more agricultural products from the u s even though the white house insisted the proposed tariffs were about immigration not trade if we are able to make the deal with mexico there is a good chance that we will they will begin purchasing farm agricultural products at very high levels starting immediately mr trump tweeted if we are unable to make the deal mexico will begin paying tariffs at the 5 level on monday for months mr trump has vocalized his frustration over illegal immigration levels and sought ways to stem the tide of migrants as he attempts to keep his campaign promise to build a border wall and handle illegal immigration more effectively than his predecessors but those attempts have been fraught with hurdles both legal and political with the 2020 presidential election just around the corner senate minority leader chuck schumer issued a statement saturday criticizing mr trump for backing down from his threat of tariffs schumer said the new deal would only make a small impact on solving the root causes of central american migration because many of the components are things mexico is already doing house speaker nancy pelosi was also critical of mr trump saying that he had undermined america s preeminent leadership role in the world by recklessly threatening to impose tariffs on our close friend and neighbor to the south we are deeply disappointed by the administration s expansion of its failed remain in mexico policy which violates the rights of asylum seekers under u s law and fails to address the root causes of central american migration pelosi said in a statement adding that threats and temper tantrums are no way to negotiate foreign policy in december mr trump s insistence on border wall funding led to the longest government shutdown on record but the president ultimately gave in when the impacts of the shutdown became visible first published on june 7 2019 8 34 pm 2019 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
