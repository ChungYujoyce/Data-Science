 win mcnamee getty over the last few weeks the news for scott walker s presidential campaign has been getting grimmer and grimmer the last of those points above is particularly ominous word of money problems often serves as the canary in the coal mine signifying an imminent campaign collapse and they can start a downward spiral leading supporters to jump ship and fundraising to dry up because the candidate looks more and more like a loser for instance it got out in early august that rick perry s campaign was no longer paying staffers due to poor fundraising perry managed to hang in the race for one more month but everyone could see he was a dead man walking he finally quit after failing to qualify for this week s debate if walker already isn t paying his consultants fundraising has likely fallen well short of expectations and the campaign has committed to much more spending than it can afford johnson and gold report that there are 90 full time staffers if so it would be possible for walker to radically downsize his operation and stay in the race john mccain did just that in 2007 and won the nomination but it would be a tough road ahead the next debate is a long way away and there s no indication that donald trump is going to stop monopolizing media attention anytime soon meanwhile the host of that debate cnbc hasn t announced how it will determine who qualifies but if it uses national polls like fox news and cnn did walker could be in serious danger of failing to make the cut as far back as 2014 and especially earlier this year scott walker has seemed on paper to be a fantastic republican candidate he was elected three times in a blue state and while governor of wisconsin he fought hard for conservative priorities in a way that impressed both the gop s base and its elites but presidential campaigns aren t fought on paper and in person scott walker simply isn t compelling or attention grabbing i argued nearly a year ago that walker s lack of charisma would be his biggest problem in a world where primary candidates rise and fall in the polls based partly on their performance in televised debates indeed walker led the polls in iowa up until just before the first presidential debate august 6 afterward he plummeted as you can see in this realclearpolitics chart realclearpolitics walker s lack of charisma isn t his only problem he s also proven unexpectedly feckless on the issues changing his position on topics like immigration in various insincere seeming ways but it was when republicans got a look at all the candidates onstage seeing walker live rather than on paper that his position in iowa collapsed he hasn t stopped falling since still i d be surprised if walker dropped out any time soon he s built his political brand on his willingness to fight and he seems to bea true believer indeed he s now vowing that he ll stay in the race andfocus entirely on winning the iowa caucuses all the recent caucus winners rick santorum mike huckabee barack obama and john kerry surged in the polls quite late he s invested so much of his reputation in the race already so he might as well stick it out a few more months get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
