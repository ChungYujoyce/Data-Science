the 2016 gop hopeful most helped by jeb bush s early stumbles or so the pundit wisdom goes is florida sen marco rubio the two men share the same home state both are expected to appeal to latino voters and bush was expected to soak up a lot of the florida money that might have buoyed rubio s presidential hopes but lately with bush looking ever weaker thanks most recently to his awful answers on iraq rubio was thought to have an argument that he s a stronger candidate than the nominal front runner until sunday that is that s when rubio joined bush in the latest iraq war quagmire there s got to be some karmic justice in the fact that two leading gop presidential candidates have humiliated themselves trying to figure out how to handle the war politically confronted by fox s chris wallace about his own seeming flip flop on the question of whether if he knew then what we know now he d have invaded iraq rubio tried to deny he d given different answers then he challenged wallace for asking the question at first rubio tried to insist it s unfair to use hindsight to critique president george w bush s decision based on what we know now i wouldn t have thought manny paquiao was gonna beat in that fight rubio seemed unable to recall the name of paquiao s opponent victor floyd mayweather or else he realized it was a mistake to compare a war that killed 4 000 american soldiers to a boxing match nah he probably just forgot the name for a while he held fast to his assertion that it was not a mistake it s not a mistake he said repeatedly i still say it was not a mistake because the president was presented with intelligence that said iraq had weapons of mass destruction it was governed by a man who had committed atrocities in the past with weapons of mass destruction when wallace pushed him to say whether he d call it a mistake even knowing about the faulty intelligence he still seemed to say no the world is a better place because saddam hussein is not there he began then he seemed say yes i don t think george bush would have moved forward on the invasion and he certainly wouldn t have gotten congressional approval wallace missed the chance to say that george w bush did not in fact admit the invasion was a mistake once he knew the wmd intelligence was faulty there are things we got wrong in iraq but the cause is eternally right he wrote in his memoir most criticism of rubio as of bush has focused on his bone headed performance on a question both men had to be prepared for and it s true they both looked like nincompoops but in fact the problems for the two are deeper than performance neither can say clearly that the war was a mistake because they remain close to the neocons in their worldview and as i showed friday the neocons don t believe it was a mistake many either knew saddam didn t have wmds or weren t mainly invading because of it as a british intelligence official famously said about the bush administration s manipulation of evidence the intelligenceand factswere being fixed aroundthe policy fast forward a dozen years andrubio s been trying to challenge bush for neocon support check out his campaign tagline join marco s fight for a new american century which suggests homage to the project for a new american century peddlers of the iraq war jeb bush signed their founding document florida s junior senator was thought to have less chance to win solid neocon support with george w bush s brother in the race but bush s stumbles might have increased his standing that s why he worked so hard not to say it was a mistake even if he looked like an idiot in front of chris wallace joan walsh is the author of what s the matter with white people finding our way in the next america copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
