a prominent republican consultant who isn t working for any of the 2016 presidential candidates and has been right more times than i can count said something that shocked me when we had lunch recently he said that sen ted cruz tex had about the same odds of becoming the republican presidential nominee as former florida governor jeb bush jaw dropper right after all the conventional wisdom is that bush the son and brother of presidents is the republican standard bearer while cruz a conservative s conservative is a factor sure but not someone who could actually win the nomination how i asked the consultant could he say such a thing he explained it this way think of the republican field as a series of lanes in this race there are four of them establishment tea party social conservative and libertarian the four lanes are not of equal size establishment is the biggest followed by tea party social conservative and then libertarian obviously the fight for the top spot in the establishment lane is crowded with bush and possibly wisconsin gov scott walker leading at the moment ditto the social conservative lane with former arkansas governor mike huckabee ben carson and rick santorum pushing hard there the libertarian lane is all sen rand paul s but as i noted above it s still not that big this leaves the tea party lane which is both relatively large and entirely cruz s while paul looked as though he might try to fight cruz for supremacy in that lane at one time it s clear from his recent moves that the senator from kentucky is trying to become a player in a bunch of lanes including social conservative and establishment so cruz is without question the dominant figure in the tea party lane what that means particularly in the early stages of the primary process in places such as iowa new hampshire and south carolina is that he will probably be able to win place or show repeatedly racking up enough strong ish performances to keep going even as the establishment and social conservative lanes thin out cruz s ability to raise money which remains a question is less important for him than it is for other candidates especially those in the establishment lane his people are going to be for him no matter how much or little communicating he does with them the trick for cruz the consultant said is to hang around long enough to be the preeminent figure not only in the tea party lane but also in the social conservative lane cruz is decidedly conservative on social issues and talks regularly on the campaign trail about his faith the complicating figure in that consolidation effort is huckabee who is a likely to run b an ordained southern baptist minister and c likely to be able to stay in the race for an extended period because of the number of early southern primaries but let s assume for the sake of argument that cruz is able to outlast huckabee as well as carson and santorum if you combine the tea party and social conservative lanes that s a pretty wide berth for any candidate hoping to be the gop nominee is it as wide as a consolidated establishment lane behind bush or walker or sen marco rubio fla no one knows just yet but it s probably pretty close so watch cruz the combination of his running room as the race s one true tea party candidate his debating and oratorical skills and his willingness to always on every issue stake out the most conservative position make him a real threat the 10 candidates with the best chance of being the republican candidate in 2016 are ranked below the no 1 candidate has the best shot as of today 10 indiana gov mike pence pence hasn t ruled out a run though he s probably got to choose between running for president and reelection in 2016 one recent development pence expanded medicaid in indiana after negotiating some concessions from the obama administration though we re not sure whether this would help or hurt him in 2016 9 huckabee the former arkansas governor is giving every indication he is running if he does he will be a factor because of his strong following among social conservatives an nbc marist poll released sunday showed him on top of the field in iowa 8 louisiana gov bobby jindal jindal is the r sum candidate in the gop field he s shown us little besides that though apart from occasionally tossing some red meat to the conservative base the latest example not backing down from his comments on no go zones for non muslims in europe 6 tie cruz see above remember that although he is roundly derided by his colleagues democrats and republicans in the senate he may be closer to how the gop base feels on most issues than anyone else running 6 tie ohio gov john kasich after lying dormant for a few months after his convincing 2014 reelection victory kasich will spend two days this week in south carolina that trip will spark some buzz about whether he will run but kasich may have waited too long walker another midwestern governor from a swing state is on the rise 5 new jersey gov chris christie increasingly it s looking as if christie missed his window for running for president in 2012 a new rutgers eagleton poll shows that his favorable rating in new jersey has dropped to 37percent after topping out at nearly 70percent and it s not just his home state polls of likely gop voters in iowa and new hampshire show that he is the most unliked republican not named donald trump 4 paul speaking of people whose stock is dropping the senator s vaccine comments continue to baffle us especially because he continues to play the victim card yes there is a segment of the gop that probably likes the idea that paul is taking on the liberal media but there s also a much bigger portion of the party that will look at his vaccine flap and see ron paul 2 0 3 rubio yes his path to the nomination is complicated by bush s all but announced candidacy but if republican voters are looking for a fresh face who could theoretically expand the party s appeal then rubio could be the dark horse in the race 2 walker the wisconsin governor is clearly ascendant right now thanks in large part to his strong speech at an iowa confab a few weekends ago his ham handed handling of an evolution question however and his decision not to answer questions in london during a trade mission are not good signs 1 bush the former florida governor remains the top dog and he got a big break when mitt romney opted not to run bush probably would have remained no 1 even if romney had got in but the 2012 nominee s exit makes bush the obvious choice for gop establishment types read big donors
