robby mook hillary clinton s campaign manager appeared on msnbc s morning joe in the middle of the week former bush white house communications director nicolle wallace asked him about the fact that clinton hasn t held a news conference since early december here s the full exchange mook well first of all hillary s done over 300 interviews this year alone wallace i m not i didn t talk about and i know the difference between a three minute ground ruled interview and a press conference because i i ve put on a couple of each but why wouldn t you have her do a press conference today just to you you have a perception problem on the question of honesty and trustworthiness why wouldn t you put her out there to your traveling press corps who knows all the intricacies of sort of the defense you laid out which is which is legitimate but this is about the perception why wouldn t you put her out there to answer questions that she could certainly handle if if your defense is true mook well we are she is out there answering questions wallace she s going to do a press conference today mook as i said she she s done over 300 interviews this year and she she takes questions in a variety of formats and we re going to we re going to keep looking at that a few things 1 i don t doubt mook s numbers on how many interviews clinton has granted over the past year but as wallace notes sit down one on one interviews aren t the same thing as a freewheeling news conference there are lots and lots of ground rules that govern sit downs most notably a typically strict time limit that makes pursuing any particular line of questioning in any real depth almost impossible and then there is the fact that an interview with say jimmy kimmel isn t the same thing as a news conference with reporters from the washington post the new york times and the tv networks kimmel is a comedian not a reporter 2 the idea that she is out there answering questions is so nebulous as to be meaningless from whom about what and it s worth noting here that clinton unlike president obama does not allow reporters into her fundraising events meaning that if major donors are asking her questions we have no idea a what they are and b how she answers them 3 we re going to keep looking at that we aren t going to do anything i have a political spin translator it s almost ready for public launch clinton later in the week offered this to reporters when asked about doing a news conference stay tuned i ll wait with bated breath look mook is in a tough spot the reason clinton hasn t done a news conference since dec 5 is because she doesn t want to she s not great in that format and knows it need proof her presser at the united nations aiming to explain her private email server didn t go so well i am under no illusion that even if clinton doesn t give a news conference all the way through the election a span of 339 days lots and lots of voters will make their minds up based on this issue alone they won t but it s beyond debate that clinton has honesty and trustworthiness issues with the general public in anaugust wapo abc poll 62 percent of voters said clinton was neither honest nor trustworthy that number includes 69 percent of independents who say that clinton isn t honest or trustworthy refusing to hold a news conference plays into that distrust and might even magnify it but put even the political calculation aside clinton is without question the favorite as of today to be elected the 45th president of the united states given that she owes it to the public to demonstrate how she thinks on her feet and how she responds to unwanted or tough questions the best and maybe only way to do that is via news conferences simply avoiding them because a clinton doesn t like them and b donald trump continues to generate day dominating negative headlines isn t a good excuse when we are talking about someone who is running to be the most powerful person in the world there s a responsibility that comes with the job clinton is running for a responsibility that goes beyond simply winning her resistance to any real engagement with the media in the campaign sets a dangerous precedent for how accountable and transparent she might be as president
