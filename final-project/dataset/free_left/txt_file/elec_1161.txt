advertisement supported by by nicholas confessore and nick corasaniti donald j trump all but erased his enormous fund raising disadvantage against hillary clinton in the span of just two months according to figures released by his campaign on wednesday converting the passion of his core followers into a flood of small donations on a scale rarely seen in national politics mr trump and the republican national committee raised 64 million through a joint digital and mail effort in july according to his campaign the bulk of it from small donations all told mr trump and his party brought in 82 million last month only slightly behind mrs clinton s 90 million and ended with 74 million on hand suggesting he might now have the resources to compete with mrs clinton in the closing stretch of the campaign she s been doing this for 20 years said steven mnuchin a new york investor who is mr trump s finance chairman we ve been doing it for two months more than two thirds of the 64 million had come online mr mnuchin said the new figures indicate a major shift in mr trump s campaign which until recent months was largely funded by hat and t shirt sales and by mr trump s wallet and they suggest that mr trump has the potential to be the first republican nominee whose campaign could be financed chiefly by grass roots supporters pitching in 10 or 25 apiece echoing the success of senator bernie sanders of vermont during the democratic primary the numbers released by the trump campaign wednesday are preliminary official figures including money spent on direct mail which is typically expensive and a precise breakdown of total cash raised in small increments will become available when mr trump and mrs clinton file formal reports with the federal election commission this month moreover mr trump s surge is coming very late in the campaign at a point where advertising rates climb and the chance to invest in a long term digital and campaign infrastructure is long past and mrs clinton s own fund raising operation is rapidly expanding as well in a twitter post on wednesday a spokesman for mrs clinton said that her campaign and a joint fund raising operation with the democratic national committee had 102 million on hand not including cash held directly by the party but mr trump s announcement suggests that after months of dithering and false starts he has begun to exploit an opportunity marrying his powerful credibility among grass roots republicans with targeted small donor fund raising particularly online where mr trump s website features buttons soliciting 50 25 and even 10 contributions at the end of may mr trump reported barely more than 1 3 million in cash alarming republicans who feared a financial rout by mrs clinton mitt romney the party s 2012 nominee and a wealthy man in his own right was never able to stoke intense enthusiasm among small donors and relied disproportionately on big ones during july of that year for example mr romney and the republican national committee reported raising a total of just 19 million from contributions of less than 200 mr trump was able to ramp up quickly in part through a digital operation set up by the r n c since that campaign even before mr trump was the nominee the party built out its email list and tested ways of targeting small donors with that in place party officials unleashed a pent up desire by rank and file republicans to donate to a candidate who has bluntly attacked lobbyists and big donors while mr trump accepted online donations during the primary season he did not send out an email solicitation until late june which brought in 3 million alone an indication of the well of money available to him the campaign has also raised money by promising to match small donations out of mr trump s pocket a tactic available only to wealthy candidates there was always that potential but you didn t have candidates who were as uniquely positioned in the same way that trump is said patrick ruffini a republican strategist who ran digital fund raising at the republican national committee under president george w bush transcript the campaign is doing really well it s never been so well united i would say right now it s the best in terms of being united than it s been since we began you have bernie sanders people are going to be voting for trump something just came in they like trump they like trump but mr trump s surge also emphasizes the complication for republicans in having him at the head of their party he is relying more on small donor fund raising in part because he has faced opposition from some of the party s biggest patrons such as meg whitman a california business executive who said monday that she was so disgusted with mr trump that she would vote for mrs clinton to bolster his low dollar fund raising mr trump and his team are now working to assuage the broader pool of affluent republican donors and fund raisers in recent weeks mr trump has laid off his criticisms of the party s donor class and scheduled an array of formal fund raising events for republican donors in money centers like florida and new york moreover even as his name and followers are helping fund republican get out the vote efforts around the country mr trump is feuding with the party s senior leadership pointedly refusing to endorse prominent republicans facing trump inspired primary opponents such as the one challenging representative paul d ryan of wisconsin the house speaker and it is the republican national committee that is providing much of the technical expertise that has allowed mr trump to quickly increase his low dollar fund raising some republican officials said even as relations fray between mr trump and some fellow republicans the party and mr trump each needs the other and mr trump as the nominee and the fund raising tent pole for the party may have the upper hand under normal circumstances the party would have money as leverage mr ruffini said they could cut off fund raising to a candidate who misbehaves and that leverage has been taken completely away advertisement
