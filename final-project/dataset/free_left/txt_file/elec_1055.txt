hillary clinton moved to capitalize tuesday on a sharp edged debate performance that exposed vulnerabilities for donald trump excoriating his values and character in an effort to expand her coalition of women minorities and young voters trump meanwhile scrambled to move his campaign forward while the republican nominee insisted that he was not unnerved he and his advisers grasped at excuses to explain why he did not perform better at the first presidential debate monday night trump on tuesday was unrepentant and eager to defend his past denigrating a former beauty pageant winner whom he targeted as his latest foil and vowing to attack clinton over her husband s marital infidelities in their next showdown in a country divided over two historically unpopular candidates trump s turn is unlikely to shake his core support but democrats said they felt assured that trump s hot temperament scattered demeanor and series of statements that left him exposed to further scrutiny would make it increasingly difficult for him to win over the undecided voters he has been courting especially moderate white women i look back as a former practitioner and say is there anything donald trump did to convince somebody who wasn t in his column to be for him said david plouffe president obama s former campaign manager i have a hard time thinking there s many of those people i don t think he lost anybody but that s not his challenge now he s got to add clinton was ebullient as she returned to the campaign trail tuesday in raleigh n c and strove to keep alive the controversies that marred trump s debate performance the real point is about temperament and fitness and qualification to hold the most important hardest job in the world and i think people saw last night some very clear differences between us clinton told reporters aboard her campaign plane en route to north carolina trump did little to change the subject in a tuesday morning interview on fox news channel he said debate moderator lester holt the anchor of nbc nightly news was biased and the republican complained about the quality of his microphone clinton jabbed him for that telling reporters anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night trump s attacks on her weight are a bad dream for former miss universe trump also disparaged a former miss universe pageant winner alicia machado for her physique in the debate clinton raised trump s past comments about the venezuela born woman who was crowned miss universe at age 19 in 1996 he called this woman miss piggy and then he called her miss housekeeping because she is latina clinton said in one of the debate s more electric exchanges the next morning trump offered an indignant defense of how he dealt with machado when he was a partner in the company that owned the miss universe contest she was the worst we ever had he said on fox adding she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem the clinton campaign sought to advance the story across media platforms releasing a web video featuring the beauty queen turned actor now a u s citizen who lives in california and arranging a conference call for reporters with machado who described the election as like a bad dream like trump s feud this summer with the muslim parents of a dead u s soldier the machado episode rapidly emerged as a microcosm of the campaign and a test of whether trump can expand his support beyond his base of aggrieved white voters most of them men mike murphy a veteran republican strategist who has been critical of the party s nominee said trump s comments about machado were hugely tone deaf the debate overall he said was for many republicans an oh crap moment if you thought he had a spring in his step for the last few weeks and was getting back in the hunt that s pretty much gone few of trump s supporters went so far as to crown him the victor house speaker paul d ryan r wis who has been a weather vane for the republican leadership during this election season was supportive though muted at a tuesday news conference he told reporters that trump gave a unique donald trump response to the status quo i think he gave a spirited argument ryan said and i think he passed a number of thresholds trump s backers insisted that the debate would not damage his standing in the close race with clinton rep peter t king r n y said as far as the temperament that s how he s been for the last 15 months it got him to the top he does have the feistiness that i think 51 percent of the american people will like william j bennett who served in president ronald reagan s cabinet said of trump when he loses his temper a little bit many people see that as passion and as someone who s engaged in the fight and in what he believes people forgive that and a leopard can t change his spots why even republicans think clinton won the first debate it will take several days before the political impact of monday s debate becomes clear but many republicans said they were bracing for clinton to get a bump in the polls an estimated 84 million people watched the clash at hofstra university in hempstead n y making it the most watched presidential debate in history the event reverberated around the globe former mexican president vicente fox said trump s behavior should alarm world leaders because he revealed himself to be ignorant and dangerous when he speaks about the geoeconomic situation and the geopolitical situation and terrorism he s absolutely ignorant and he s only provoking us democratic leaders from around the world to reject everything he s proposing fox who watched the debate on mexican television said in a telephone interview he is an imperialistic gringo in the united states the risk for trump is that a negative impression sets in on shows such as nbc s saturday night live on social media and in workplace conversations democrats sought to taunt trump on his uneven performance particularly given his regular attacks on clinton s stamina and appearance he seemed unable to handle that big stage and i really did feel that by the end with the kind of snorting the water gulping and the leaning on the lectern that he just seemed really out of gas said clinton campaign chairman john podesta trump previewed an even more combative second debate oct 9 in st louis by saying he might hit her harder perhaps over former president bill clinton s affairs i really eased up because i didn t want to hurt anyone s feelings trump said on fox saying he would have brought up the many affairs that bill clinton had but held back because the clintons daughter chelsea was in the audience i didn t think it was worth the shot he said i didn t think it was nice hillary clinton shrugged off the threat telling reporters he can run his campaign however he chooses i will continue to talk about what i want to do for the american people clinton campaigned at a community college gymnasium in raleigh to whoops and loud applause one down two to go she said of the debates during a campaign rally in melbourne fla tuesday evening trump said that clinton is a woman that i think is virtually incompetent certainly as secretary of state he called her incompetent repeatedly throughout the rally we re going to get rid of that crooked woman she s a crooked woman she s a very very dishonest woman trump said for democrats trump provided what plouffe called an embarrassment of riches at the debate a series of controversial statements and unresolved damaging questions he seemed to affirm that he paid no income taxes he made side remarks and pained expressions while clinton praised the vibrancy of african americans he said it was a smart business strategy to profit from the housing crash vice president biden seized on that last point at a rally for clinton in philadelphia where he charged that trump has no moral center this is a guy who said it was good business for him to see the housing market fail biden said what in the hell is he talking about clinton and a brigade of high profile surrogates plan to continue using trump s debate comments against him she will campaign in new hampshire on wednesday with sen bernie sanders i vt hoping to energize young voters there with a discussion of college affordability while first lady michelle obama will stump across pennsylvania on thursday he put a lot on the table a lot of things that are not true and a lot of views that we think are counter to where most voters are said jennifer palmieri clinton s communications director it won t end tomorrow there s a lot that will live on from this debate anne gearan in raleigh n c jenna johnson in melbourne fla and jose delreal in washington contributed to this report anne gearan
