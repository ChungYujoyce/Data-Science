watch cbsn live june 26 2019 6 13 am cbs news intelligence matters chris krebscorrespondent michael morellproducer olivia gazis jamie benson michael morell chris welcome to intelligence matters it is great to have you here chris krebs thank you it s great to be here michael morell you have a very important job at the department of homeland security but before we get to that i want to spend a little time asking about you and your background when i look at your resume it seems to me that you were groomed for the position that you re currently in can you walk us through some of the experiences you ve had where you ve learned about cyber security and the cyber problem chris krebs yeah i came about it in an unconventional way in fact if you had asked me if i was a technical person i m not i came up post 9 11 in the bush administration within the department of homeland security focusing on critical infrastructure protection issues but less from the guards gates and guns physical side more thinking through risk management and how do private sector organizations work with government to better enable risk management decisions and then as the bush years wore on and then shifted out into the private sector was engaging much much more closely with boards of directors and senior executives one of the victims in the western district of pennsylvania chinese hacking indictments of the early obama years was one of my clients and we worked with them to help again better enable and better engage with the various parts of the intelligence community dhs and law enforcement community michael morell and that was focused on cyber chris krebs yep that was focused on cyber and that was really the first time the us government stepped out and called china out for its bad behavior in intellectual property theft and by others in the intelligence community and general alexander i think said it s the greatest transfer of wealth in human history could ve been hayden michael morell that s absolutely true chris krebs yeah and it s really not slowing down so over time then shifted over to microsoft and led some of the us cyber policy work but again really focused on how can give best help the private sector recognizing that ultimately the private sector owns and operates the majority of critical infrastructure shared responsibility we ve got to do this together but if we learned anything i think through 2016 and the russian interference with our elections it s no single organization no single state no locality can go at this problem alone when you re facing a concerted effort from the russian military the gru the svr the fsb it s going to take a team effort to push back and harden the underlying infrastructure harden our people our citizenry and then strike back when we have to michael morell chris one more career question so cyber security one of the top issues of the day is going to be with us for a long time i run into a lot of young people who want to get into this space and they always ask me what should i study what kind of experiences should i pile up what would you tell them chris krebs well stepping back a little bit i think what benefits us the most the united states is our diversity of experiences the diversity of our people the diversity of the education system it takes all kinds to be successful in this space my background environmental science undergrad and then law school so it really takes a wide range of skill sets i think the number one trait that i d encourage people to really focus on is their critical thinking and ability to communicate those two aspects when you pile together put you in a position to be successful particularly in government but also in the private sector and being able to navigate between the technical community and the executive suite michael morell being able to translate from the technical to the policy chris krebs i think one of the challenges we re having right now particularly with cyber security election interference the information and influence operations is that we ve over rotated a bit into the technical sphere and we talk about things that we can t really grok we mentally struggle with in understanding the scope the impact the risk so nuance is not our friend in this space is really where i m going with this so if we can clean up the way we talk about things to be much more clear and concise and take out some of the bureaucracy the bureaucratic language and the technical jargon and make it just cleaner for the american people to understand michael morell we d be better off chris okay to your agency what s its mission what are your core functions what are you supposed to accomplish chris krebs so when you really strip it down to what we re supposed to be doing and what we re trying to do and what congress has entrusted us to do we re the nation s risk advisor and i use those words pretty carefully and i m not saying we re the nation s risk manager i ve already talked about now i don t have original sourcing for the 85 number that s long debated but look the way we work in this country is that private sector government if you own the network it s your responsibility to secure it my job is to again help those network defenders the blue team folks make the right decisions make sure they have the information to enable them to make the right security decisions and then help provide policy makers the decisions to shape the policy in regulatory and legislative space so that comes at it from an over the top we are risk advisors whether it s physical cyber whatever it is at this point three main mission areas one is cyber security leading efforts across the federal government the civilian agencies to help protect federal networks second is working with the critical infrastructure community to help protect their networks as well so that s the cyber side on the physical side really focused right now on a number of issues including soft target security and that s working with places of worship schools stadiums sporting venues places where people gather and i think as we step back a little bit and we look at the post 2000 the 9 11 world the department of homeland security was established as you recall to be a counter terrorism organization really focused on the physical threat from terrorist over the intervening 15 16 years since 2003 when the department was stood up the threat landscape has shifted dramatically we have peer and near peer adversaries great power competition is a thing again so as we were structured for physical security risks now we are much more focused in addition on cyber security threats so we re taking a lot of those relationships we ve built over the years where physical security relationships with key strategic infrastructure we re now working with them at hard infrastructure that matters we re working with them on cyber security issues too michael morell so you re cisa s first director chris krebs yes michael morell so it s now an agency and it was elevated in dhs from a previous incarnation as the national protection and programs directorate why did the administration make that change and what does it mean from a day to day perspective how is life different today than before chris krebs well it s funny because it s actually a thing that the prior administration tried to get going day one we had to kind of demonstrate our ability to deliver success and i think that took time plus you also had to figure is there a real demand for a primary cyber security agency so that was one of my top priorities when i came in how things are different what this really means so this puts us on par with tsa with fema as a true operational agency within the department of homeland security there s some more mundane organizational issues where now we have to have our own hr functions we have to have our own cfo functions we re not drawing on the headquarters support elements but from a day to day perspective it puts the button on us when it comes to leading cyber security defensive efforts across the united states government we ve always been in that position statutorily the secretary was now it s much more clear we have stepped into that role we re owning it and we re making a lot of progress over the last couple years and i think if anything our ability to step up after 2016 and help lead the nation s efforts to protect our elections i think that really shows that we have a role we can deliver success and value to our stakeholders michael morell so chris you ve identified china supply chain and 5g as some top priorities that you need to address in the immediate term those are all interrelated of course but maybe we can just take them one at a time so china is china the biggest cyber threat we face or are they competing with that label with russia how do you think about where china falls on the threat spectrum here chris krebs so from a strategic perspective i think they re certainly the top if not one two with russia threat i look at russia as trying to disrupt the system particularly from an elections and undermining democracy perspective they re trying to knock us off our global position as a leader of the free world and lead democracy and that s really what it comes down to russia s not trying to win the game they re trying everyone else to lose and that s kind of the gerasimov doctrine michael morell that s a great way to put it chris krebs the chinese are thinking much more strategically i think there s probably some debate here but they want to ultimately be a peer if not a dominant position to us and have us more in a client state where they re the primary economic power and we re so interdependent with them and dependent on their supply chain so they re not trying to disrupt us necessarily they re trying to manipulate us put us in that again that client state position and to do so though they re going to have to overcome our ability to innovate they re going to have to overcome our ability to be out in front of the next technological revolutions and they re getting there by intellectual property theft acquiring us companies requiring us companies to come into the chinese market to join in jvs and tech transfer but i think if anything i ve learned in the last couple years is that it s possible that china s overplayed their hand a little bit that they have over exerted influence internally and particularly us companies that were looking at china as a big market to go into they re not getting the returns they expected maybe four or five years ago michael morell where are we in terms of intellectual property theft are they going after it as much as they ever have or has the pace slowed what s the story there chris krebs so i think if you asked the f b i and some of their ongoing investigations in the counter intelligence efforts while it s probably kind of ebbed and flowed and waxed and waned over the last half decade or so i think they re as active probably as they ve ever been it s hard to kind of quantify really michael morell because you don t know what you don t know chris krebs yeah but look they re active i think the apt 10 indictments from this past december and that was the department of justice indicted a couple of chinese actors that had been jumping into managed service providers and cloud service providers in these points of aggregation and pilfering all the intellectual property that they wanted that shows that they re still at it and they re as effective as they ve ever been if not they re improving their tradecraft and rather than going that whack a mole onesie twosie approach they re going to the points of aggregation and they re just sweeping up a whole bunch of information while they re doing it michael morell can you talk a bit about the huawei issue and why it s so important from a cyber security perspective chris krebs so i step back and think about huawei and really other chinese companies what we re seeing here more than anything is these companies these tech companies and other companies coming out of china they re just an extension of the chinese state they re being operationalized they re being weaponized in a certain sense president xi has even said that they don t walk the western road of constitutionalism they look at the world differently and they are using all instruments and tools of the state including their private sector i m using my air quotes to get what they want and so what happens when we know that china has attempted over the last decade plus and not just attempted but been successful to extract the intellectual property from the united states and our partners and allies we know that they are aggressive and increasingly aggressive in cyber operations so we know them for what they are because we have experience and they ve demonstrated intentionality these are adversaries second we are building out the next generation of communications technology that is going to empower innovation the likes of which we ve never seen michael morell so we call it 5g chris krebs 5g telecommunications networks i think we re still trying to figure out what it really truly means but it is going to again empower all sorts of innovation machine to machine communication automation things that we haven t even contemplated across our economy and the third piece is we know that the quality of their engineering is not great the united kingdom has established because they ve been working with huawei for a decade or more an oversight board where they pretty stringently review the tech product and they ve said that the quality of the engineering is objectively worse than their peers so we ve got a state that s demonstrated hostility to the united states our peers and our allies we have a tech sector that they ve operationalized that is in a lead position to build out the next telecommunications networks and we know that their product s not great that just puts me in a position from a risk management perspective that says we need other options we have got to go a different direction i am not confident comfortable with that roll out michael morell so what direction should we go chris krebs well we need to look at a number of things first is what does 5g really mean and this is obviously a much longer drawn out conversation but we need to take a look at what s the rest of the market look like how do we encourage vendor diversity how do we use the other tools of the us government to incentivize additional players in the market or bolstering more reputable trustworthy players one thing we can look at is why are certain chinese companies successful on the global scale it s because they come in with an integrated tech stack they have low to no cost financing and they re subsidized by the chinese state those are all market advantages that in some cases are inconsistent with the world trade organization we need to look at holding them accountable to the agreements they said they would adhere to and there needs to be a degree of reciprocity they don t let us companies go into the chinese market with an integrated tech stack why would we let them come here and do the same so we need to take a hard look at the way they operate within the markets in the us and elsewhere and provide others options i was in nato in brussels a couple weeks ago our allies are very clear eyed about the threat from china the challenge that we have is there in some cases are economic entanglements that even if the security services say hey we know what s going on here but we don t have any other options how do we get those options michael morell so your experience in talking to the allies about this is they get the security risks chris krebs oh yeah oh yeah michael morell but they re stuck because they ve got economic relationships that would be put at risk if they went in a different direction is that fair chris krebs yes that s part of it another part s people just like hey i m little old me i don t have much to worry about here i m not the us we also do not want to encourage the export of digital authoritarianism to the rest of the world we want democracy to grow and that s really kind of what this is boiling down to right now is there s a self sorting mechanism going on between democracy and the rise of authoritarian states michael morell so chris the concern about supply chain can you let people know what that means from a security perspective chris krebs sure the more things we connect the more interconnected we become between sectors and functions in the economy what we re discovering is the less we actually know about the provenance of the things that we re plugging in who is writing the code who s building the hardware do we have the right level of attestation and certification across the componentry that s going into these products at the same time we re finding that nation states are able to exploit a number of these supply chain dependencies for their own intelligence and operational gains so what we are trying to do working with the it sector the comp sector and the rest of the federal interagency is get everybody on the same page in terms of intelligence and threat information sharing we took a step two years ago september 2017 issuing a directive across the federal government that said you know what we ve taken a look at kaspersky anti virus products and determined them to be too risky to be deployed within federal networks and the decision or the rationale behind it was anti virus operates at a pretty broad level across systems below which we usually monitor in fact the av is the thing that actually does the monitoring sweeps for data and really effective avs anti virus products take the data or the files the anomalies they find and they send it back to a central collection point in the case of kaspersky that was moscow and we also know the legal system in russia it s not really known for meaningful judicial review the balance and checks and balances that we have here in the us and we know that there are laws that compel telecommunications companies and tech companies to comply with the intelligence service so we kind of added this all up and then you kind of look at the relationships between kaspersky leadership and the putin regime and we said all right theoretically we ve got a company that is delving into the depths of the us federal government that the fsb or the svr or gru could operationalize that s just not acceptable so it gives us a good framework of looking at the technical piece the legal piece and the relationship piece which we can look at kaspersky and we can look at frankly any organization to do a risk assessment of a product as it would be baked into the federal government and we can help export that into the private sector and help them understand what their risk is michael morell so chris let s talk a little bit about critical infrastructure first how do you define critical infrastructure chris krebs so it s historically been defined across the lines of 16 well at one point it was 18 and then it was 17 and then it was 18 now it s 16 but it s those pieces of the economy that drive our country and our economic engine and would include things like there s the energy sector banking and finance emergency services nuclear power oil and natural gas again 16 sectors but again it s these artificial buckets of the economy and how to group common players what we ve done over the last year is take a different look it s not just the big buckets of the economy because we tend get more focused on specific organizations specific assets and as i mentioned with the interconnectedness and the interdependencies between pieces of the economy for instance the banking and finance sector they re dependent upon power water and a number of other sectors so how do we tease out these interdependencies so what we ve done is drilled down to say all right let s do less on the specific organizations and more on the functions and services that are being delivered across the critical infrastructure community and we ve bottomed out at this point it s a living breathing list but 55 national critical functions so when you look at the banking and finance sector it kind of nets out to five critical functions including wholesale payments capital markets and it gives us a more granular view of risk michael morell it s more refined now than it used to be chris krebs it s evolved it s certainly evolved i think we were in a little bit of a rut in terms of our risk management approach and it gives us that more evolved approach michael morell so chris the public hears a lot about our adversaries accessing or trying to access our critical infrastructure with cyber tools right with the idea that if they ever want to use those tools to do damage they re ready to go how much do you worry about that is that something we need to worry about have we been compromised have we been able to keep them out can you talk about that a little bit chris krebs yeah so we certainly have been targeted if we saw anything in the 2016 elections that the russians were attempting to get into our election infrastructure there s probing scanning whatever you call it mapping the internet happens every single day if you go talk to some of the energy sector folks there are companies that ll say that they get probed or whatever millions of times a day i think as we ve seen the russians have been active in this space the chinese have been active dni coats recently talked about pipelines in the worldwide threat assessment that s hard strategic infrastructure that s being targeted and then the russians we issued an alert last year in fact about their attempts to map and get into the energy infrastructure so we know what the adversary is doing we know they re trying to understand and identify and get into our strategic infrastructure and that s why it s so important that we build strong relationships with those critical infrastructure players we can share with them the intelligence we collect and the risk management strategies but we also need to do a better job i think of working with those infrastructure partners to get a real understanding of the things that they view as risky what are the things that they are worried about and then we can pull the understanding back and send it to your old shop and general nakasone at the nsa and say look when your collectors go out your guys don t necessarily know what the domestic infrastructure space looks like rightly so but i m going to tell you these are the things from an intelligence perspective that you need to go collect against so that we can lay the right trip wires to help inform the network defenders back here in the us because again we ve got to do a better job of informing and tuning the intelligence collection mechanism michael morell chris i know you can t respond directly to the recent new york times report that said that us cyber command was being more proactive and putting our tools in other nations infrastructure so that we re able to act i know you can t comment on that but what i want to ask you is does it make sense from your perspective that we have something like mutually assured destruction when it comes to cyber and critical infrastructure chris krebs i think the nuclear deterrence model in the escalation ladder kahn and all that it works when you have a small set of players and there are barriers to entry including cost and technological development which is just not reality in cyber it s a commodity game right now and honestly we focus a lot on the big four of china russia north korea and iran but every country is developing tools if they re not they re not trying so what i am increasingly thinking about and this is coming up through my team is we need to be thinking more like the british in the battle of britain in wwii they did three main things one they hardened their underlying infrastructure they were getting hit every day so they really hardened their buildings their facilities they hardened their buildings and then they hardened their people too they said here you ve got to understand what the threat is and you have to take your own steps to protect yourselves we ll do what we can but also there s a shared responsibility here and the third piece is based on information based on intelligence based off their radar their early warning system they were able to also go take strategic selective strikes against the adversary and put them on their back foot so this is a blended operation space of enhanced defense enhanced resilience and then offense when it s appropriate michael morell offense for the defensive purpose chris krebs they play off each other michael morell they play off each other chris krebs yeah we have a great relationship with cyber command and the intelligence community i think we saw that in 2018 and the defense of the midterm elections secretary mattis secretary nielson signed an mou a memorandum of understanding that dod and dhs would work together to protect our critical infrastructure including the elections and we really operationalized that in a way that i don t think had ever been done before and that included support from cyber command operators to the dhs defensive mission potential incident response capabilities michael morell so chris i d love to get you to talk for a couple minutes about maybe what is a philosophical issue it makes sense to everybody that the government is responsible for protecting gov right a question though is what should the government be responsible for in terms of protecting com right what s the role of the government in protecting the private sector how do you think about that chris krebs well i ll even add a little bit to this conversation what about state and local governments we have a system of federalism here where elections are a great example i keep coming back to elections it seems that s what i talk about most of the time now article one section four of the constitution states that states will determine the time place and manner of how elections are conducted and why is that well it s because the people the states decide who to send to the congress and to the federal government to represent them represent their interests it s not the other way around it s not the federal government saying this is how you re going to do this so what we ve got to do is strike that right balance of collective defense and that s really where we re going we need to be able to put the information as we collect it into the hands of those that can do something with it actionable intelligence into the hands of the network defenders when we understand that there is an active adversary whether it s a criminal group a proxy group a nation state the us government needs to act using a range of tools both overt and covert offensive legal sanctions diplomatic we have a broad range of tools and we have used those in the last two years expansively and extensively against the russians i think we re still trying to figure out what the true pain point is for president putin and his regime but there s no question that we ve inflicted an increasing amount of pain upon him so again we are putting information in the hands of people that can do it we are working to build capacity for the private sector we re looking at the com the private sector the critical infrastructure community kind of along a maturity model think about a scatter plot with an x and y axis the x axis is awareness and the y axis is capability so awareness is something that s the independent variable capability is going to be dependent upon how much you know and how much you invest what we re finding is at the very top of that or the top right hand of that graph we re finding banks and energy companies that make significant investments the big banks invest close to 1 billion a year in their cyber security so we re going to tailor a set of capabilities and tools to them that s going to be much more advanced that includes really finely tailored intelligence but at the bottom left close to that zero zero on the x y axis is where we re putting a lot of thought of how do we raise capability just baseline capability when we get out there and we do vulnerability assessments for state and local governments and small and medium sized businesses we re finding a lot of just legacy technology michael morell what can they do better those places that need to do better what are the handful of things that they can do that would make a difference chris krebs so what we re finding particularly again for elections but just state and local governments small and medium businesses is run modern systems patch and update systems aggressively so get on the latest operating system patch your stuff when the updates become available i ll talk about the bluekeep microsoft bluekeep vulnerability right now i ve got shades of 2017 and want to cry and not patch it if you haven t patched from the bluekeep vulnerability yet you need to do that now so patch run modern systems two factor authentication make it harder for the bad guys to get into your stuff we do the basics 90 to 95 of the problem set i don t want to say goes away but we make the bad guys move they re not using zero days today because they don t have to because we re still not doing the basics right we re making it too easy for them to spearfish us we re making it too easy for them to exploit mis configuration again let s do the basics right but i have got to say this doing the basics is hard it takes commitment understanding and investment michael morell you have got to stay at it right chris krebs yeah you do and when you look at building a company or doing a startup or a small mom and pop shop you don t naturally think of i need a dedicated it director that s thinking everyday about how our systems are running so my hope is that we get into a space in the next couple years where there are easy buttons out there and the products that come from the big tech companies are just inherently more secure michael morell so chris you ve mentioned the 2020 elections a number of times obviously cyberattacks played a role in 2016 2018 they didn t stop we did a better job i think in 2018 what s cisa s role with regard to 2020 chris krebs yeah so we are working every single day with our state and local partners those that run elections at the state level and the local level we re working with all 50 states and approaching about 2 000 local election jurisdictions the challenge here is that there are 8 800 or so election jurisdictions throughout the country and a lot of them are small jurisdictions that don t have a lot of technological investment and sophistication and that s okay we can work with anybody we re actually in the midst of the second annual tabletop the vote it s kind of a goofy thing that we do but a three day exercise we have 48 states playing in 1 000 or so jurisdictions get everybody together and work through what does a bad day look like who are you going to call what are your communications strategies and what are your response plans so what we are doing is working with these election folks and helping them get to a more secure posture including retiring legacy systems getting that old stuff that may be 15 years old or out of support making sure that auditability is achievable and that they are in fact auditing we ve got to get to a position where you can go back and you can audit the process and that includes some kind of paper back up michael morell so because of the constitutional issues you talked about do you have to wait for them to come to you or can you go to them chris krebs we can go to them we can t compel action but that s the ethos of cisa is that we are public private partnership embodied in the federal government and we have to go out and we have to provide something of value and two or three years ago we didn t have much of value directly for the election community now we do and that includes intelligence information sharing vulnerability assessments regular vulnerability scans we are providing capabilities that states and local jurisdictions just haven t invested in historically because they never thought they needed to prior to 2016 who would ve thought that a random county in the midwest was going to be targeted by the russian gru it just beggared belief michael morell so if i were the russians or chinese i would be all over every presidential campaign so are you providing any kind of support to the presidential campaigns chris krebs yeah we ve met with every single campaign both sides provided them here are the things we offer here are the things you need to do call us if you need any of these assessments the dnc and the rnc bob lord over at the dnc has done a great job of again saying this is not about going and buying some silver bullet cyber security tool it s about doing the basics it s running on a commercial enterprise grade email multi factor authentication secure messaging apps it is that simple the basics they can do michael morell and do you get a sense that people are listening chris krebs i think so yeah i mean gosh if you didn t learn from 2016 then you re not listening i still think of the three pronged attack of the russians between targeting election infrastructure targeting the political campaigns and then just the broader structure information or the influence ops i think the second prong that hack and leak against dnc and other political organizations that was the most impactful that was the most visible part of their strategy and shame on us if we re not ready this time around michael morell chris thank you very much for taking the time to be with us and most important thank you for the work that you and your folks do every day to keep the country safe chris krebs thank you
