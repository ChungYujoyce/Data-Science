brennan and there are some bright spots with treating the virus the fda gave emergency authorization for the drug remdesivir to be used intravenously for hospitalized patients after trials showed a quicker recovery and the administration launched operation warp speed in a rush to find and manufacture a vaccine for covid 19 but are we flattening the curve some experts say that with the books

country widespread covid infections have closed twenty two meat and poultry processing plants the virus has killed at least twenty workers and at least two hundred seventy nine have been infected in maryland governor larry hogan r maryland any disruption or interruption to processing at our poultry processing plants could lead to significant national supply chain issues mark strassmann most health experts worry about a shortage of covid testing as april ended the u s had conducted 6 2 million covid tests but a harvard study concluded the country needs five million tests a day by early june to reopen safely and maryland and colorado plan to hide their ppe from the federal government governor jared polis d colorado a global free for all we re just worried about them cutting them off

nationally to reopen but on friday new covid infections jumped again the state reported a thousand new cases in twenty four hours margaret margaret brennan mark strassmann thanks china claims that the coronavirus outbreak began in an animal market in wuhan the u s intelligence community is investigating that theory and the possibility that it was accidentally released from a lab either way u s china relations are at a new low cbs news senior foreign correspondent elizabeth palmer reports on covid 19 hot spots around the world elizabeth palmer cbs news senior foreign correspondent elizapalmer margaret china was the very first country to enforce radical isolation and widespread testing an approach we now know to be the most effective way to control a covid outbreak begin vt elizabeth palmer and it s paid off almost fifteen weeks since wuhan went into lockdown if not for the masks life this may day weekend looks pretty normal even retail shops are open south korea acted fast too and now says it has the outbreak under control there is still social distancing here at an exam for job applicants but with just a handful of new cases every day koreans are at last relaxing at the other extreme there is brazil these are fresh graves in sao paulo the country is south america s covid epicenter with a rampant outbreak limited testing and a president who when confronted with the numbers said so what do you want me to do in europe rules are easing but at different speeds spaniards gratefully took to the streets after forty eight days indoors but only to exercise adults in the morning kids in the afternoon austria has opened up more widely shops and crucially even hair salons are up and running poland is due to reopen its borders today but care homes are still strictly

a drive in disco in germany and here is the finnish folk group indistinct celebrating international dance day in isolation end vt elizabeth palmer here in the u k prime minister boris johnson s fianc e had a new baby last week but he is not taking any paternity leave instead he is hard at work on a plan to gradually reopen things in britain margaret margaret brennan elizabeth palmer thank you we go now to chicago illinois and governor j b pritzker last week he extended the state s stay at home order until the end of may good morning to you governor governor j b pritzker d illinois govpritzker good morning margaret brennan why is the number of hospitalizations in your state still increasing governor j b pritzker well it s increasing barely it s true but we have really bent the curve significantly we re not through this yet there s no doubt and we ve been looking to see those numbers flatten we are seeing them flatten now my great concern at this point is that we make sure we ve got our contact tracing up and running we have increased testing significantly so we are getting ready for a point where we can begin to reopen the economy margaret brennan but there s some pressure on you i mean you had the mayor of chicago say that residents aren t abiding by these calls to stay at home you ve had protests in chicago in southern illinois as well is the politics of this complicating things for you governor j b pritzker not at all i m not thinking about the politics i m thinking about saving lives and keeping people healthy in our state the fact is that there is there are millions of people in the state of illinois who have been following our stay at home rule and they are the ones who have bent this curve for us it is true there are outliers the mayor and i have talked several times about the challenge of people wanting to break the rules but the truth is those are real outliers and even the protesters there were only a few hundred protesters and although you know they sometimes carry reprehensible signs and you know are attacking what we re trying to do we re still trying to keep them healthy as we are the 12 7 million illinoisans across the state margaret brennan the presidential adviser jared kushner gave an interview this week you heard a clip of it in the beginning of the show and he said the country is on the medical aspect side of this improving and that the federal government rose to the challenge did the federal government rise to the challenge and meet your state s needs governor j b pritzker well it s the governors that have risen to the challenge you know i talked to my fellow governors republicans and democrats we have shared ideas with one another about how to keep people safe we ve gotten some guidance from the cdc that s been helpful but much of what came out of the white house for many weeks was not helpful we needed the white house to lead on the defense production act to help us get swabs to help us get vtm to help us get reagents that really hasn t much happened although recently we got a call from the white house telling us that in may they re sending us six hundred thousand swabs and i m very grateful for that we ve of course overcome our challenges more recently and increased testing significantly we re now among the top ten states in in america we re number two for testing we ve got to get our contact tracing up and going and then as i say we can reopen the economy as we see our hospitalizations begin to wane margaret brennan so do you agree then with kushner when he says the biggest thing holding testing back is the state s ability to collect more samples governor j b pritzker you know a couple of weeks ago or maybe a week ago the white house said that we have all the capacity we need well they re right in the sense that there are plenty of machines that exist in the state of illinois but there weren t enough swabs vtm and reagent there still aren t but the white house is helping and i appreciate that margaret brennan is it enough governor j b pritzker but re it s not enough it s not enough today but again as a state we re having to go out in the market and compete with every other state to get swabs and vtm and reagents i wish that the white house had stepped up earlier and i think they still have the opportunity to do so when it comes to reagent but the fact is that we re going to overcome this i believe by mid summer we ll be able to do tens of thousands more tests and just again in may we ll be able to do more than we re doing today which is in the high teens margaret brennan governor you know i i know that you have said and other governors have said that they will need more federal aid because of this crisis but i want you to respond to to this because before the crisis illinois had one of the worst pension problems in the country by your state s own admission the pensions were underfunded by hundred and twenty nine billion in 2019 citing numbers like this republicans have characterized any emergency help now as essentially a bailout of of poor management i mean the president slammed you this week in a presser as well is is it reasonable for congress if they put together the emergency aid you re asking for to attach strings that restrict how you spend it governor j b pritzker well let s point out that that all fifty states are suffering from a failure of revenues to come in over the last couple of months coronavirus has caused that all of us are having to spend more on social services and health care to take care of people and as far as illinois goes we balanced the budget this year we were on our way to a balanced budget for next year as well so all we ve asked for and frankly the other forty nine states too as far as i know is just help to replace those revenues that we all lost margaret brennan you governor j b pritzker as a result of this invisible killer margaret brennan so so do you think you ll get the money and will there be strings attached governor j b pritzker i don t know whether there ll be strings attached i hope there aren t too many because the fact is every state has a problem and it s different in every state where they need to put the dollars so putting more strings on it makes it much more difficult for us to move forward to get our economies going remember illinois has one of the most important economies in the world not to mention in the nation margaret brennan certainly governor j b pritzker so the federal government is really the only entity that can step in and help us out margaret brennan we ll be watching that governor good luck to you governor j b pritzker thank you margaret brennan we turn now to former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb who joins us from westport connecticut this morning good morning to you scott gottlieb m d former fda commissioner scottgottliebmd good morning margaret brennan so these federal social distancing guidelines expire this week it s a a different story state to state over what s opening up but you tweeted this week that you saw some worrying worrisome signals specifically when it comes to hospitalization rates what is the direction of the epidemic scott gottlieb well when you look across the country it s really a mixed bag certainly cases are falling in the tri state region around new york city but when you back out what s happening in new york and new york is really driving a lot of the national statistics because it was such a large outbreak around the nation hospitalizations and new cases continue to rise so there s about twenty states where you see a rising number of new cases illinois texas maryland indiana virginia north carolina tennessee have a lot of new cases on a daily basis and so while mitigation didn t fail i think it s fair to say that it didn t work as well as we expected we expected that we would start seeing more significant declines in new cases and deaths around the nation at this point and we re just not seeing that margaret brennan this morning doctor deborah birx was on another network and she said our projections were always that we would see between a hundred thousand and two hundred and forty thousand americans lives lost due to the virus on monday of this week the president said it s probably sixty to seven seventy thousand dead the week before he said fifty to sixty thousand are these white house numbers reliable at all scott gottlieb well the white house was looking at the ihme model out of washington state and that model initially showed at the high end two hundred and fifty thousand deaths and a base case of a hundred thousand but it s come down since then to about seventy thousand it s starting to creep back up when you look at the updates of that model over the last two weeks i think we have to look out to what s going to happen by the end of june it s really hard to predict beyond june where this goes because we could have large outbreaks or it could become quiescent in the summer but i think when you look out to the end of june it s probably the case that we re going to get above a hundred thousand deaths nationally i think the concerning thing here is that we re looking at the prospect that this may be a persistent spread that while the doubling time has come down dramatically to about twenty five days so the amount of days it takes for the epidemic to double in size is about twenty five now from day days or less than a week at the outset of this epidemic we may be facing the prospect that twenty thousand thirty thousand new cases a day diagnosed becomes a new normal and a thousand or more deaths becomes a new normal as well right now we re seeing for about thirty days now about thirty thousand cases a day and two thousand deaths a day and if you factor in that we re probably diagnosing only one in ten infections margaret brennan mm hm scott gottlieb those thirty thousand cases are really three hundred thousand cases margaret brennan persistent spread is what you called it so if we re going back to reopening business and life in america what does that look like you had airlines this week issue new guidelines they re asking people to wear masks giving them to them when they board if someone has asthma if someone has diabetes something that makes them vulnerable is it safe for them to get on a plane when there s persistent spread scott gottlieb well this may be the new normal and we need to know what that looks like and it s going to be a case where people who have comorbidities have conditions that could lead to a bad outcome if they get infected are going to need to be very careful that may be the future that we re looking at you know the challenge is that if we see this slow simmer through this summer maybe this summer s a backstop to spread i think it will be but we see this sort of persistent twenty thousand cases a day maybe thirty thousand but it probably comes down a little we see a persistent one thousand or more deaths a day that s through this summer but what happens when we come back in the fall and schools are back in session colleges are back in session residential college campuses people are letting their guard down a little bit more people are back at work after an august recess and then you can see this slow simmer explode into a new epidemic or large outbreaks that s the concern that if we don t snuff this out more and you have this slow burn of infection it can ignite at any time margaret brennan you ve been warning of looking ahead to the fall that that hasn t been addressed yet you ve also talked to us about this drug remdesivir that the fda gave emergency authorization for this week is that one of the tools in the tool box that you say will exist in the fall that could make this better scott gottlieb that s right i think the more that we see persistent infection the more we re dependent upon a technological change to really be an inflection point in this epidemic remdesivir is an effective drug it s going to help some patients especially when used early in the course of disease to reduce hospitalizations and reduce death there s also the antibody drugs that we talked about that could be available by the fall and vaccines may be available by the fall in doses sufficient to ring fence infections in cities while we continue to study them to make sure they re safe and effective for mass inoculation i think the more that the government accepts the fact that there s just going to be persistent spread and they want to open the economy against that backdrop the more they better be doubling down on the technology and make sure that we re doing margaret brennan yeah scott gottlieb everything we can to get those drugs in time for the fall margaret brennan you said there may be a vaccine by the fall that the trump administration has set january in this operation warp speed as their goal for three hundred million doses do you think it will be ready before that scott gottlieb well i think what we re going to have in the fall is hopefully multiple manufacturers that have cleared early stage safety trials and have millions of doses that could be deployed in large large scale studies inside cities and so what you would do is deploy the vaccine in the setting of an outbreak in a city to both test whether it s safe and effective so you re continuing to study it but you re also using it potentially therapeutically to ring fence an outbreak i think we re going to be in a position to do that and i know companies are working on protocols designing trials to engage in that kind of deployment of vaccines what we need right now is more than one manufacturer to be successful we need multiple manufacturers u s based manufacturers to have vaccines ready to deploy in time for the fall margaret brennan you know the country s two largest known coronavirus clusters are in prisons in ohio you hear about clusters in nursing homes also in meat processing plants there s a school of thought that says because these are highly concentrated that somehow they re more manageable what do you make of that argument scott gottlieb well it s true to some extent it might not be more manageable but it s more vulnerable and i think we need to understand that disadvantaged communities and certain kind of institutional settings where people can t naturally social distance are hotspots they re very vulnerable and we need to be putting resources into those kinds of settings and it s not just the shop floors and warehouses and workers who are vulnerable to infection because of the way they work that s certainly part of the story but it s also people who come from communities where they have to take mass transit they can t naturally social distance they don t have access to good health care to begin with and can t get access to testing those communities are very vulnerable and the data now supports that we re seeing pockets of intense spread in these kinds of settings in these kinds of communities and we should be pouring resources in to help those people margaret brennan doctor gottlieb thanks as always for your insight scott gottlieb thanks a lot margaret brennan face the nation will be back in one minute stay with us announcements margaret brennan joining us now is daniel o day chairman and ceo of gilead sciences that s the pharmaceutical company that makes remdesivir good morning to you daniel o day chairman and ceo gilead sciences good morning margaret thank you for having me on margaret brennan so this drug shaves about four days off the recovery time of someone hospitalized with coronavirus according to the government study now that your company has this emergency use authorization how quickly will the drug get to those people who need it daniel o day well you know i think i speak on behalf of all of us at gilead that we are grateful and really humbled that everything has moved so quickly you know it s only been three months since the first case was diagnosed in the united states to the emergency use authorization that was provided this past friday that s thanks to a lot of patients and caregivers that participated in our clinical trials margaret brennan mm hm daniel o day and we are now firmly focused on getting this medicine to the the most urgent patients around the country here in the united states and margaret we intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week beginning to work with the government which will determine which cities are most vulnerable and and where the patients are that need this medicine margaret brennan i think that s important you re saying you ve you ve donated some of this drug to the federal government and you will work with the federal government to decide where the drug goes or is that up to the federal government to decide daniel o day right margaret so we ve donated the entire supply that we have within our supply chain and we did that because we acknowledge and recognize the human suffering the human need here and want to make sure that nothing gets in the way of this getting to patients and what we will do is is provide that donation to the u s government and they will determine based upon things like icu beds where the course of the epidemic is in the united states they will begin shipping tens of thousands of treatment courses out early this week and be adjusting that as the epidemic shifts and evolves in different parts in different cities here in the united states margaret brennan okay okay well we have more to talk about with you but i have to take a quick break here so stay with us and stay with us all of you as well please more with daniel o day in a moment announcements margaret brennan with all the news focused on the tragedy of covid 19 you d never know it but election day is six months from today we have a new cbs news poll out this morning and that will be coming up in our next half hour announcements margaret brennan we ll be right back with more from daniel o day and later we ll talk to the head of the federal reserve bank of atlanta raphael bostic for a snapshot of the economy and is it safe to fly southwest airlines ceo gary kelly joins us announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we want to pick up where we left off with daniel o day the head of gilead sciences which produces the drug remdesivir which was just given emergency use authorization i want to pick up on this you said the the supply of one and a half million doses of remdesivir has been donated to the government that s enough for what a hundred and fifty thousand patients or so daniel o day right margaret just to be clear what we ve done is we ve donated the entirety of our supply which is around 1 5 million vials and that turns into around a hundred thousand to two hundred thousand treatment courses depending on whether it s a five day or a ten day and this donation will be made available to patients here in america and the united states and across the world as other regulatory decisions are taken for those countries margaret brennan this drug is clearly going to be in demand since it s the the first sort of promising development we ve had you were at the white house has the trump administration talked to you at all about using the defense production act to somehow mandate that you prioritize the u s market over foreign markets daniel o day yeah let me say something on the supply and the demand because you know i am so proud to work with the scientists at gilead that you know that quickly moved and mobilized themselves in january long before we knew whether the medicine would be available to increase the supply this is a long supply process it used to take around twelve months and now it takes around six months and because of the steps we took in january we ll have significantly more supply in the second half of this year to serve the suffering and the human needs out there we ve been working very closely with the u s government with other governments around the world in terms of the allocation question i think we re aligned with the u s government to both serve the patients here in the united states and then to be able to also make sure as a global company based here in the united states that we can serve other countries around the world as well we ve had very good dialogues with the government margaret brennan mm hm daniel o day and that s going well margaret brennan so they haven t talked to you about mandating the u s market be prioritized or taking it for the stockpile for example you can still export it daniel o day that s correct we have been exporting for clinical trials and for compassionate use thousands of treatment courses and and our collaboration with the government has been such that we ve been very transparent with them here in the united states and we have a good relationship on on future allocation margaret brennan this drug you have to get through an i v right now so it works for hospitalized patients will you develop other mechanisms does this ever become a pill someone can take at home daniel o day yes it s important to note that this medicine is really right now for the most severe patients in the hospital and it s given by i v either through a five day treatment course or a ten day treatment course depending on the stage and nature of the patient but our scientists have been working since earlier this year to say are there other ways that we could deliver this medicine potentially as doctor gottlieb mentioned to earlier patients margaret brennan mm hm daniel o day and in order to do that we re looking at formulations such as subcutaneous formulations that may be given outside the hospital setting and possibly an inhaled version this medicine is not suitable for oral administration because of the way it s metabolized but there are ways we can look at formulations potentially that would get us to earlier patients and patients outside the hospital setting that research is still ongoing yet hasn t yet read out and we ll certainly keep you up to speed on that margaret brennan all right we will be watching thank you very much mister o day daniel o day thank you margaret brennan well the trump administration predicts a significant comeback for the economy by the end of the year but last week federal reserve chairman jay powell was blunt jerome powell both the depth and the duration of the economic downturn are extraordinarily uncertain i think everyone is suffering here but i think those who are least able to to bear it are the ones who who are you know losing their jobs margaret brennan chairman powell also urged the trump administration and congress to take more emergency action and he announced a loan program for medium sized companies to help keep them running we turn now to the head of one of the twelve banks that make up the federal reserve system raphael bostic he is in atlanta this morning good morning to you raphael bostic president and ceo federal reserve bank of atlanta raphaelbostic good morning margaret margaret brennan we just heard that very bleak assessment in some ways from the federal reserve chair in the past six weeks alone thirty million americans have filed for unemployment claims are we headed for a depression raphael bostic well when i when i think about this question i think the first thing to be mindful of is that the federal reserve is acting boldly and decisively to try to provide support for markets all across this country look we knew that coming out of this public health crisis our that the response was going to do damage to the economy and that was required if we were going to get to the other side what we ve tried to do is really provide support to give people a bridge from that pre virus situation to the post virus situation and let me just say in terms of the numbers i think we knew that the jobless numbers were going to be bad for march they re going to be tough again this friday but i think the real question the thing i m focusing on is how many of these these jobs are going to job losses are going to be permanent as opposed to those that are going to be temporary losses and a lot of the margaret brennan and what is the answer to that question raphael bostic well we re going to we re we are a lot of the the responses that we ve been doing have been aimed to try to provide support and relief and what i would tell you is right now it s too soon to tell margaret brennan mm hm raphael bostic the the pay paycheck protection program that money is just getting into the system the economic impact payments those are just going into the hands of families and households and what we re going to do over the next week and several weeks is continue our outreach call businesses talk to people and really try to find out whether the relief that s been offered has is sufficient margaret brennan mm hm raphael bostic or whether they need more and also whether there are pockets that are missing and if there are we will talk to policymakers and make sure they re aware of it to see if there are other things that might be done margaret brennan the the actions the fed have taken are pretty unprecedented in terms of things that you are forecasting and warning about i know you personally last month said that the month of may could be make it or break it for many businesses it s not just about cash anymore it s about staying solvent does that mean you re predicting a large number of bankruptcies in the weeks to come raphael bostic no it doesn t mean that at all and let me just provide some context we know that for many businesses and for many families they don t have six or seven or eight months of savings instead they may only have one or two months of savings which means we re getting about to the time when those savings are going to be depleted this is why so many of the actions that have been taken have been so important getting relief into families and so what we re trying to do right now is understand to what extent is that relief providing its service and keeping people away from those bankruptcies because it is not in our interests for those bankruptcies to happen that will mean that much more of this is permanent than temporary and we re going to do all we can to make sure that doesn t happen margaret brennan so you re president of the atlanta fed that means you monitor closely what s happening in the american south states like florida and georgia are reopening what do what do these initial days and weeks indicate to you i mean just because consumers can go out does that mean they re actually going out and spending raphael bostic well we ve talked we ve talked to a lot of folks a lot of consumers and a lot of businesses and what we re hearing is that many are actually being quite thoughtful in terms of how they re approaching this you know one of the things that is very important as you look through the south is that the virus is presenting itself differently in different populations we know that african americans are being hit much harder by this and so the response of how we reopen the economy has got to be thoughtful what i ve been encouraged by is that many businesses that have the option are choosing not to do that where i ve talked to a number of leaders of of important and small businesses that say we re going to keep doing our restaurant our curbside delivery we re going to keep doing our social distancing to try to make sure that as we open up we don t do it in a way that adversely impacts the population and leads to another spike in terms of infections margaret brennan the fed chair was clear that he is watching closely what s happening in the mortgage market so many americans have had to put off their monthly payments what level of risk is there you know the housing market what level of risk is there that we are facing a banking or a financial crisis in the months ahead raphael bostic well i i was in in the government through the last crisis when it was a housing crisis and fortunately this is not that right now what i would say is this is that there have been some policies put in place margaret brennan but could it be in the months ahead is that what this warning that you re watching closely the mortgage servicers is that what you re saying raphael bostic well what i m saying is that we re going to do what it takes to make sure that doesn t happen that we we know where there are stress points we know where there are tensions and if we see those tensions start to get to a higher level we re going to we re going to encourage policymakers across the spectrum to do that one other thing i would say is that the banking sec sector coming into this crisis is much stronger than it was in 2007 and 2008 there s much more capital margaret brennan yeah raphael bostic we ve taken a lot of steps to make sure that that banks do have resources available so that they are not in that insolvency space and i m hopeful that they re going to be able to be part of the solution in terms of extending capital mod modifying the mortgages margaret brennan mm hm raphael bostic and loans and financial relationships they have with businesses and households in ways that reduces the tension and allows families to be able to forbear for even longer than they can right now margaret brennan so one of the things that the fed did this week was say that it ll essentially buy more debt of of local governments to help them out as we ve been hearing from governors and local leaders they are under a lot of financial stress right now but the fed chair also said that s basically not the fed s job is to lend money not to spend money he he pointed right at congress and said it s up to you to do something at this point what is it that the states need in terms of relief from your point of view from what you are seeing raphael bostic well first i would just say that as the federal reserve we stand ready to act as much as we can within the limits of the law and the chair was exactly right we are we have limits as to what we can do and how much support we can offer i think it s an open question as to how much more is going to be needed and we re going to continue as we engage with governments and helping them with their financing to understand the depth of that need margaret brennan yeah raphael bostic and then communicate that to policymakers so they can decide how much extra support might be necessary but you know for us we are very much in a situation margaret brennan mm hm raphael bostic where we re going to do what we can what we re legally allowed to do as much as we can margaret brennan right raphael bostic and then take information and get that to policymakers margaret brennan okay raphael bostic so they can decide the next step margaret brennan all right thank you very much we ll be right back with gary kelly the head of southwest airlines announcements margaret brennan the airlines are just one of the many industries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic with the number of air travelers plummeting ninety six percent half the u s fleet of planes is grounded and the planes that are taking off are nearly empty averaging just seventeen passengers per domestic flight congress has given the industry fifty billion dollars in financing either as loans or grants despite that assistance the four biggest carriers reported massive first quarter losses last week one of those airlines is southwest air gary kelly is the company s chairman and ceo and he joins us from dallas this morning good morning to you gary kelly chairman and ceo southwest airlines gary kelly hi margaret margaret brennan is it safe to fly again gary kelly it is you know we re we re we re doing everything possible to encourage people to come back and fly we re cleaning airplanes we re requiring masks of our employees and our customers we re using very deep cleanings every night we re using electrostatic misters which will kill the virus on surfaces for up to thirty days we re exercising social distancing and on board the aircraft we we won t be booking airplanes full so that people can spread out so absolutely we re doing everything we can to make it as safe as humanly possible margaret brennan and you stopped things like food service and the like i mean those sound like good measures but you know we had a guest on our program last week barry diller who is is a big investor and he said it s just absurd if you do things like remove the middle seat to have some spacing i mean to his point you still have a confined space you still have a shared bathroom you still have people who are walking down the aisle going to their seat walking past you how i mean how much risk is there what do you think the measures you re taking do to offset everything else gary kelly i don t think the risk on on an airplane is any greater risk than anywhere else and in fact you just look at the layered approach that we use it s it s as safe as an environment as you re going to find we re using hospital quality disinfectants hepa air filters to make sure that the air is is properly filtered and clean we re not going going to remove middle seats or prohibit people from sitting in middle seats but at the same time we won t book the airplanes full so you know if you choose all the middle seats can be open margaret brennan so i know you said at one point that that what you re going through now was worse than after 9 11 which is extraordinary but i mean is the bottom line here that cheap travel is over for americans for the future that the business is just completely changing and that the future is uncertain gary kelly well sure the future is uncertain but you know right now we re we re at a low point and so i just don t think it s right to extrapolate today in into perpetuity margaret brennan mm hm gary kelly so we ll get through this but in the meantime i think it s actually the the opposite after 9 11 herb kelleher was famous for saying that we re all low fare carriers now because that s what it s going to take to get people flying and that is certainly the case today and i think we re very well prepared for that we ve got a strong balance sheet we ve got a lot of cash we ve got a great business model and a low cost structure but we re going to have to fight our way through this and obviously i m anxious to see how the travel demand develops here in the summer margaret brennan it s picking up gary kelly well i yeah i think we ve seen the bottom here in in april each week after the first week of april has gotten successively better i think may will be better than april was and i i don t think june will be a good month but hopefully it will be a bit better than may and then we re looking forward to july and august and we ll just have to see there are bookings in place but those could easily be canceled so it s it s really one day at a time margaret brennan southwest has taken about 3 2 billion in federal aid do you expect to take more gary kelly you know i mean the first thing is to re really thank the congress the administration secretary mnuchin secretary chao because what was needed for our country was a lot of liquidity and the cares act was exactly what we needed to avoid a a really serious depression we ve applied for another government loan i don t know that we ll take it i think what the government has done for us with this cares act is it really has opened up the capital markets margaret brennan mm hm gary kelly a month ago we couldn t have borrowed money we couldn t have raised equity and we were able to raise six billion dollars last week so i think that we ve got what we need to see our way through but if we have to seek another government loan we will do that we have until september to make that decision margaret brennan and we know because of the first round you took that you can t lay off anyone until after september 30 that was part of the the cares act provision i know though you recently told employees that if business doesn t pick up by july that you ll become a dramatically smaller airline what does that mean are you laying the groundwork for job cuts gary kelly well you know i think you summarized it well with your with your comments the the planes are virtually empty and we ve got at southwest alone we ve got close to four hundred airplanes that are parked the the the demand is just not there so obviously if things don t improve we have to downsize we ve never had a furlough in our history we ve never had a pay cut in our history and i m extraordinarily proud of that and we certainly don t want to break that record what i promised our people is i don t know what the future holds but i do know that we re very well prepared margaret brennan mm hm gary kelly and the very last thing that we ll do margaret brennan yeah gary kelly is have an involuntary furlough margaret brennan okay gary kelly so we ll just have to see how things play out and do our best to avoid those those those kinds of results margaret brennan thank you very much for your time we ll be back in a moment announcements margaret brennan it s six months until election day and there is news from the campaign trail presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden publicly denied a former aide s accusation that he sexually assaulted her in 1993 our cbs news political correspondent ed o keefe reports begin vt joe biden in every case the truth is what matters and in this case the truth is these claims are false ed o keefe cbs news political correspondent edokeefe joe biden on saturday once again denied accusations of sexual assault his accuser tara reade worked for him for nine months ending in 1993 last year she was among several women who recounted what they called inappropriate touching by biden she began detailing more serious allegations for the first time in march tara reade northern california i remember his hands underneath my bust underneath my skirt and his fingers penetrating me as he was kiss trying to kiss me and i was pulling away woman indistinct going to win today ed o keefe reade supported bernie sanders during the democratic primary and began speaking out again as biden was on the verge of securing the nomination cbs news has spoken multiple times with reade and we have requested an on camera interview she is the only individual who has accused biden of sexual assault some of her acquaintances former colleagues and her brother tell cbs news they recall her mentioning the alleged biden episode in the 1990s but details of her brother s account have differed in interviews with other news outlets several former biden senate aides have said that they never heard about reade s allegations while working for him and attorney bill jeffress who led the vetting of biden for barack obama s 2008 presidential campaign tells cbs news that his investigation never turned up allegations of sexual misconduct end vt margaret brennan and ed o keefe joins us ed it s good to see you and to talk about politics again this story i mean it it opens up a lot of questions but and and it s important to investigate these kind of allegations politically if president trump faces accusations from more than twenty individuals about sexual harassment and abuse does it hurt biden if it didn t hurt trump i mean is there a political cost ed o keefe we ll see a lot of this is going to boil down to whether or not there are any records of a complaint that reade says she made to a senate personnel office back in the 1990s about general harassment concerns with biden he s called for their release but republicans especially this morning are making a hypocrisy argument that if it was a big deal for donald trump it was if it was a big deal for brett kavanaugh s supreme court confirmation shouldn t it also be a big deal for joe biden s presidential prospects you re right trump won the white house kavanaugh got confirmed we ll see ultimately whether or not it matters for biden and his fortunes margaret brennan all right well i want to ask you about some of our cbs news polling because we have new data out today and this new national poll shows that in the head to head matchup biden is ahead of president trump by six points forty nine percent versus forty three percent and since the biden campaign started officially vetting vice presidential possibilities last week he s pledged to name a female running mate so we then asked who democratic voters would like to see on the ticket alongside him massachusetts senator elizabeth warren is the top choice among democrats polled at thirty six percent followed by california s senator kamala harris at nineteen percent former georgia gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams at fourteen percent senator amy klobuchar comes in at thirteen percent so it s interesting but when it comes to the guy at the top of the ticket biden himself what does this indicate why is trump behind him ed o keefe well he s always been either pretty much tied or very close with biden in head to head head to head matchups and he is known nationally as well as in a lot of these battleground states part of the issue here is the economy he wanted to run on a strong economy he can t do that anymore and if the economy continues to crater it s going to be really difficult for him to continue making that argument margaret brennan well it s difficult to campaign period these days president trump tweeted this morning hopefully our country will soon mend we re all missing our wonderful rallies is the country missing political rallies ed ed o keefe well look the president may be itching to get back out there but a new poll out this morning our new poll finds that voters say they re seeing the president too much just eleven percent saying they re seeing the president enough and while biden has been holed up in his delaware basement doing tv interviews and holding virtual rallies voters say they d actually like to see more of him forty seven percent say they d like to see him more often perhaps the good news for both of these men they like to campaign they re strong retail politicians and overwhelming eighty four percent of voters in our polls say that just because they re out there they re not out there doing rallies won t affect their final decision in other words voters telling the candidates it s okay stay home margaret brennan and there is nothing typical about this race this year this moment ed o keefe not at all margaret brennan and ed i know ed you ll be watching it closely for us thank you we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan that s it for us today thank you all
