fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin and is now available on the internet and can be delivered through the mail by now you may know a family shattered by the opioid epidemic in 2017 there were 47 000 opioid deaths that s more americans than were killed in vehicle accidents or by firearms one drug fentanyl is like rocket fuel in the sharp rise of the crisis fentanyl is a painkiller invented in the 1960 s and used to relieve the agony of advanced cancer it is 50 times more potent than heroin but today fentanyl can be ordered on the internet by drug dealers and addicts for an online overdose as we first reported in april tracking the source of this illicit trade is a story that begins with james rauh like most in akron ohio he d never heard of fentanyl until the police told him his son was dead james rauh they told me that the drug was so powerful that he was unable to finish his injection and then he died immediately scott pelley he didn t even finish the injection james rauh he d only only just started the injection he didn t even have a chance james rauh s son tom was 37 when he died in 2015 he d started opioids years before after an injury when his prescription ran out he turned to heroin he d been in and out of rehab more than half a dozen times when fentanyl inundated ohio james rauh there was something extremely dangerous going on because tom was a veteran addict you know he knew how to dose himself he knew how much he could he could handle i was wondering how in the world this would get here and who would be selling it one week after tom rauh s death the mother of 23 year old carrie dobbins grabbed her phone 911 operator akron 911 what is the location of your emergency mother my daughter is dead i just went got home from work a little bit ago and i went down in the basement she s dead 911 operator please stay on the line with me ma am you need to be very specific mother i think she did drugs two deaths in akron in seven days made assistant u s attorney matt cronin wonder where all the fentanyl was coming from the target of an investigation a low level drug dealer had the answer matt cronin the target said that he can get any drugs he could ever imagine over the internet from china cronin s investigators went online and discovered overseas labs offering most any illegal drug matt cronin we just said hey according to the source s instructions we re interested in buying fentanyl and the result was to say the least surprising we have dozens probably over 50 different drug trafficking networks reaching out to us saying we have fentanyl we have even more powerful fentanyl analogs whatever you want we ll get it for you for cheap we ll get it for you in bulk scott pelley you got 50 replies matt cronin at least scott pelley and all of these came from where matt cronin it was universally china scott pelley what did you do next matt cronin instead of tryin to find our way to a target we had far too many so we decided to do was go through the list and see any that popped out and one name in particular struck out out of the list scott pelley what was that name matt cronin gordon jin scott pelley when gordon jin was making claims about what he could provide what did he tell your undercover agents matt cronin what gordon jin said he could provide to you was essentially any drug you could imagine those that exist those that don t even currently exist he called it custom synthesis what it really meant was made to order poison we ll track down the man prosecutors say is gordon jin in a moment but first have a look at fentanyl and its derivatives justin herdman is u s attorney in cleveland he told us some of this was seized by the dea the rest was found in the mail by u s postal service inspectors justin herdman this is essentially enough fentanyl and carfentanyl to kill every man woman and child in the city of cleveland scott pelley just this justin herdman just this carfentanyl is a derivative used by veterinarians to tranquilize elephants justin herdman carfentanyl is another 100 times more potent than fentanyl here you ve got 300 grams of powder that could deliver a fatal dose to 150 000 people here you ve got only five grams of powder which could deliver a fatal dose to over 250 000 people scott pelley so if you touch this stuff it could kill you justin herdman yeah scott pelley just touch it justin herdman there s a reason we have a medic standing by scott and that s because an overdose is unfortunately it s something that we have to be prepared for even even dealing with it in an evidence bag herdman showed us pills that look like prescription opioids but are dangerous counterfeits justin herdman whether it s cocaine or you think it s heroin or you think it s pills it s gonna have fentanyl in it scott pelley why justin herdman it s cheaper to buy fentanyl and because it s so potent you can cut it in a way that you can deliver far more doses with a little bit of fentanyl so it s a profit motive for them scott pelley where did all this stuff come from justin herdman it s from china it s manufactured in china these are all related to cases that involve the mail or the use of the postal system so this somebody put this into a box sealed it up and sent it through the postal system the united states postal system has been for many years the most reliable way to smuggle drugs from china to the u s rob portman that has to stop it should ve stopped years ago ohio senator rob portman s staff investigated the traffic scott pelley what did your office s investigation find rob portman shocking what we found which was that people who were trafficking in fentanyl told us if you send it through the post office we guarantee delivery if you send it through a private carrier not so that s because after 9 11 all private carriers like fedex were required to give u s customs advance descriptions and tracking of foreign packages the postal service was allowed to delay because of the cost rob portman they gave the post office some time and said you need to give us a report as to how you can also comply with this that was 16 years ago scott rob portman in congress it s primarily produced in laboratories in china and it s primarily coming to the united states through the united states mail system portman sponsored a bill to force the post office to send advance notice of shipments from china last fall the bill became law rob portman we now have this legislation in place they need to implement it quickly they need to do everything possible to screen these packages coming in but the postal service was supposed to do that by the end of last year it says china is not cooperating about a third of the packages from china shipped by the u s postal service still do not have advance content information matt cronin the gordon jin drug trafficking organization in their own communications and advertisements online say that they ship to five continents in all 50 states they advertised and it seemed accurate they had special ways to bypass customs in the u s the uk the eu and russia assistant u s attorney matt cronin told us that gordon jin would often slip fentanyl past u s customs by shipping it to a co conspirator in the united states posing as a legitimate chemical company shipments between chemical companies weren t considered suspicious a large crate would arrive at the u s company but inside there would be as many as 50 individual drug packages each addressed to the person who d ordered them matt cronin so they take out these 50 different parcels and send it across the united states and as i mentioned even the world scott pelley they were going out to the door of the individual people that ordered them online matt cronin that s right we realized that we found gordon jin s drug trafficking route essentially his camouflage to get the drugs into the united states according to prosecutors gordon jin is an alias for a father and son drug lab in china matt cronin briefed chinese authorities on the evidence but the chinese failed to act later a grand jury in the united states indicted the father and son and they re now wanted in the u s but enjoy freedom in china 60 minutes producer bob anderson found guanghua zheng the father outside a shanghai grocery store robert anderson this is you and your son this is put out in the u s to arrest you in the u s when anderson asked zheng if he was still selling fentanyl in the u s zheng answered with an emphatic no no the woman with him did not like our questions she tells him don t speak don t speak she tells us don t come back robert anderson will the chinese government ever arrest you will the chinese government ever arrest you he said the chinese government has nothing to do with it robert anderson what do you say to parents what do you say to parents whose children died from taking your drugs zheng had no answer for that but he had had enough of 60 minutes prosecutors say the fentanyl that killed carrie dobbins and tom rauh came from the gordon jin lab in china and arrived in akron via the u s postal service matt cronin the thing that got me the most though was how brazen they were they wrote a blog and posted it on a website about how they create a certain type of synthetic narcotic and they stated in that blog that it s tied to overdoses in other words that it s so potent it can kill you scott pelley why would they want to associate themselves with people who d died using these drugs matt cronin the unfortunate truth is that when you have an addict sometimes they re seeking the greatest high possible and that can be the high that comes closest to death scott pelley and so they were bragging matt cronin absolutely scott pelley that their drugs were so potent that people had overdosed and died matt cronin they were the best out there that s right their boast was tragically true for the son of james rauh james rauh it destroys families because what happens to a family is a person gets sick and you re trying to help them and you re trying to do everything that you can and then you lose them and so you suffer you suffer up to that point and then you suffer when they die and then you suffer afterwards because you coulda stopped it you feel that every single day you think what could i have done to stop this from happening to my family i was in charge i didn t do this right and it s it s breaking my heart the u s has sealed off the overseas bank accounts of guanghua zheng and his son the feds also shut down what prosecutors say were the zheng s 40 websites selling illegal drugs in 20 languages we don t know if their lab shut down but the network has been at least for now matt cronin it is a fact that the people s republic of china is the source for the vast majority of synthetic opioids that are flooding the streets of the united states and western democracies it is a fact that these synthetic opioids are responsible for the overwhelming increase in overdose deaths in the united states and it is a fact that if the people s republic of china wanted to shut down the synthetic opioid industry they could do so in a day china had promised to do that but last month president trump accused china of not following through and the u s treasury announced further sanctions on the zhengs designating both father and son as foreign drug kingpins preventing american citizens from doing any business with them produced by pat milton robert g anderson and aaron weisz correspondent 60 minutes copyright 2020
