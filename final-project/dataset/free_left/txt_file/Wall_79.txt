advertisement supported by mr musk opened his california factory this week in defiance of local orders he has also criticized the response to the pandemic as dumb and fascist by niraj chokshi a few months ago everything seemed to be going elon musk s way as he presided over an upstart electric car company that was worth more than general motors ford motor and fiat chrysler combined that company tesla had reported profits two quarters in a row proving that it could earn money even as it grew its stock was surging mr musk opened a factory in china and was planning another in germany and his other business spacex was poised to become the first to ferry nasa astronauts to orbit from american soil since 2011 a trip scheduled for the end of this month mr musk also claimed vindication by defeating a defamation lawsuit filed by a british diver he had called a pedo guy he was staying out of trouble on twitter where he has long antagonized critics and regulators who fined him 20 million in 2018 for statements he made there his girlfriend was pregnant too with a son born this month but the coronavirus set mr musk off society s response to the pandemic was dumb and a panic he said arguing that the threat is overstated and government stay at home orders were in his view unnecessarily stalling his plans to revolutionize the auto industry and help solve climate change he attacked local officials in the san francisco bay area for not letting him reopen tesla s factory which he did this week anyway in defiance of their instructions mr musk the billionaire entrepreneur who co founded paypal has always been volatile his latest attacks and statements have raised questions about tesla s financial health and his own judgment but they also reflect a recognition of the influence he wields as one of the technology industry s best known iconoclasts this is somebody who knows that what he says gets heard across the globe and tries to make a point about why he doesn t take system level constraints as a given said rahul kapoor a professor of management at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school mr musk s anger was stoked in march when local officials ordered tesla to close its factory in fremont calif just as the company was poised to accelerate production of a highly anticipated new sport utility vehicle the model y less than a year earlier the company had been desperate for cash and wall street had grown increasingly skeptical that tesla could become anything more than a maker of luxury cars that only a sliver of humanity could afford but tesla s fortunes had started to turn before the pandemic in october the company announced a quarterly profit a sign that it had solved production problems tesla s stock began a long astonishing rally shares peaked at 917 in february up from 350 only three months before despite suffering along with the broader market in march and april the stock closed at 790 96 a share on wednesday valuing the company at about 146 billion by contrast investors value g m which produces many more cars than tesla at less than 31 billion by march tesla was on a tear despite being slowed by the outbreak in china the new shanghai factory had reopened in europe tesla s model 3 sedan was outselling cars made by automakers like volkswagen the carmaker had just begun deliveries of the model y which starts at about 53 000 in the ballpark of comparable s u v s from bmw and mercedes benz but mr musk s dreams of dominating the car industry were put on hold when alameda county forced the fremont plant which brings in most of the company s revenue to shut down in late march that frustrated mr musk who had long dismissed the seriousness of the coronavirus he has promoted unproven research suggesting that deaths from the virus are overstated and around the time the factory was closed predicted that there would be zero new cases in the united states by the end of april there were almost 32 000 new cases on april 30 mr musk resisted closing the plant and in a late april call with analysts called stay at home orders fascist they re breaking people s freedoms in ways that are wrong and are not why people came here or built this country said mr musk who is a native of south africa that week he posted several odd messages on twitter tesla s stock was too high he said and added that he would sell almost all physical possessions including his homes a few days later mr musk said his new son would be named x a 12 musk he and his girlfriend the singer and songwriter claire boucher better known as grimes have offered differing pronunciations of the name last week mr musk s anger about the factory boiled over and he threatened to move the factory out of california and sued the county in federal court on monday mr musk officially reopened the fremont plant to the frustration of some workers and county officials who had been negotiating a reopening plan with tesla for weeks i will be on the line with everyone else he wrote on twitter on monday if anyone is arrested i ask that it only be me later that day the county asked tesla to cease operations until it reached an agreement with local officials on tuesday the county said it had reviewed the plan and held productive discussions with tesla the county said that it had made safety recommendations and that if tesla included them and public health conditions didn t worsen the company could reopen next week county officials did not suggest that they would hold tesla to account for ignoring the order but noted that the fremont police would verify that tesla was adhering to safety measures as workers prepare for full production on tuesday trucks were leaving the factory carrying cars and s u v s as masked workers milled about new cars were also parked in rows outside the parking lot for employees was full tesla and mr musk did not respond to requests for comment president trump who has been pushing states to allow businesses to restart voiced support for mr musk writing on twitter on tuesday that california should let tesla reopen the plant now but the president s statement is unlikely to sway california s governor gavin newsom a democrat who has deferred to counties on such issues the state has authorized manufacturing but mr newsom said monday that if a county doesn t want to go as far local orders would prevail mr musk s decision to reopen the factory has put employees in a difficult position in an email sent on monday the company told employees that they may remain home but would not be paid if they had already used up their time off and might also lose unemployment benefits as determined by local government agencies on wednesday the company said employees who chose not to go in would not be penalized several tesla employees who asked to speak anonymously for fear of retribution said the company was putting a priority on profits over people one man who worked at the factory on tuesday said the company had checked employees temperatures at the start of his shift distributed masks and rearranged a break room but he said little had changed on the production line where it is hard to avoid coming within six feet of others as the factory reopened mr musk thanked employees for making the factory come back to life i have vastly more respect for someone who takes pride in doing a good job he said in an email
