watch cbsn live by caitlin o kane april 6 2020 3 01 pm cbs news a number of countries around the world have been lockdown for weeks in an effort to flatten the curve and reduce the spread of coronavirus flattening the curve does not necessarily mean seeing a decrease in total cases right away it would first produce a decline in the number ofnew cases which should result in fewer hospitalizations and death in the weeks that follow by flattening the curve officials hope to ensure that the health care system doesn t become overwhelmed and unable to help those who need it with some of the most affected countries like spain and italy on lockdown for weeks many are wondering if their efforts are actually working here s what data from johns hopkins can show us italy has been under a nationwide lockdown for about four weeks and the country has begun to flatten the curve italy hit its apparent peak in daily cases on march 20 with more than 6 000 new cases that day on march 29 and 30 italy saw a drop in daily cases for two consecutive days since then the number of daily cases has stayed between 4 000 and about 4 800 when looking at the growth of the virus over time in italy it appears the curve is flattening spain now has more confirmed cases than italy with over 135 000 a peak in daily cases occurred on the march 24 with more than 9 000 cases reported that day however the daily increase has continue to drop in recent days starting on april 1 spain saw a drop in daily cases for four consecutive days similar to italy when looking at a graph of the virus spread over time it appears spain is starting to flatten the curve france has been on lockdown for about the same amount of time as spain the growth of the virus has been steady recently except for a spike on april 3 which could have been caused by new reporting measures last week the country also saw a spike in deaths after the health ministry began including nursing home fatalities in its data according to reuters after the spike on april 3 the number of daily cases dropped substantially with just about 3 000 new cases on april 4 if this steady number of daily cases continues the country will flatten its curve china saw a huge spike in new cases on one day with over 15 000 new cases on february 12 however the growth significantly slowed after that hubei province where the virus originated went on lockdown at the end of january more and more areas of the country were later locked down but restrictions in some areas have already been lifted wuhan s lockdown is set to be lifted on april 8 nearly two and a half months after it was imposed there has been doubt raised by president trump and health officials around the world about whether china is releasing accurate data on its number of cases austria has managed to prevent a huge spike in daily cases since march 29 the country has been shut down for about three weeks and its government says that may be enough austria plans to start reopening shops next week although it will require residents to wear masks according to reuters we reacted faster and more restrictively than in other countries and could therefore avoid the worst but this fast and restrictive reaction now also gives us the possibility to come out of this crisis more quickly chancellor sebastian kurz said like austria germany plans to reopen soon the country has been under a lockdown since march 22 and became the fourth country to top 100 000 cases still officials hope to return to normal life on april 19 that s just under a month of lockdown according to reuters germany would implement a list of steps including mandatory mask wearing in public and limits on gatherings the earliest statewide stay at home order began in california on march 19 and new york soon followed the majority of states have since done the same although a few governors are stillholding out u s health officials predict the peak lies ahead with president trump warning of a hell of a bad two weeks to come the u s has more cases confirmed than any other country with over 337 000 as of monday according to johns hopkins only some parts of the country like california have showed evidence of flattening the curve right now the california department of public health reports 10 000 cases since early march and 237 deaths and it looks like the numbers of new cases right now is actually pretty steady dr jeffery klausner ucla professor of medicine and public health told cbs sacramento in new york the current epicenter of the virus governor andrew cuomo said on april 2 that the state s apex or battle of the mountaintop could come this week or next cbs new york reported on monday cuomo said the number of new cases appears to have leveled off in the last few days it could still go any way we could still see an increase cuomo said monday it still depends on what we do first published on april 6 2020 12 13 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
