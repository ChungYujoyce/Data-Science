now that the coronavirus has infected more than 3 million people worldwide the question of how sars cov 2 spreads has become increasingly relevant experts remain confident as of now that the virus is passed from individuals through respiratory droplets but a new study out of italy first covered by the guardian suggests more research on whether it can be spread through the air published on the health science site medrxiv the study analyzed air pollution particles in bergamo italy from late february to early march scientists there found the presence of a specific covid 19 gene in the air pollution particles concluding that it s the first preliminary evidence that sars cov 2 rna can be present on outdoor particulate matter researchers note that no assumptions can be made about the presence of the virus in air pollution particles and the fact that northern italy experienced a high volume of coronavirus cases dr ameshadalja an infectious disease expertandsenior scholarat the johns hopkins center for health security stresses that the findings should not be cause for alarm if you look in air samples and air pollution particles there have been many studies that have shown different microorganisms traveling along with them adalja tells yahoo life noting that other coronaviruses such as sars or severe acute respiratory syndrome have been found in air particles as well there are lots of examples where you can find this type of dispersal pattern of microorganisms but that doesn t necessarily translate into an infection risk dr william schaffner an epidemiologist at the vanderbilt university school ofmedicine agrees the authors don t know that the virus is living so this may be only viral fragments you know schaffner tells yahoo life let s just say it is living just for the sake of discussion because that s the kind of the worst case scenario even then is there an infectious dose schaffner says the mere presence of living sars cov 2 particles the virus that causes covid 19 in the air wouldn t necessarily be enough to cause someone to get infected you have to get a certain amount of virus in your body before it can establish an infection schaffner says and even if it were living it s not clear to me that this would be an infectious dose of the virus adalja bolsters this by noting that if the virus were spread through contaminated particles the current number of infections would likely be drastically different you would have a lot wider spread infections you would have a lot more people who are inexplicably infected he says it would really be a different dispersal pattern the cases wouldn t be connected to each other because they wouldn t be caused through contact so while adalja finds the study interesting he s not at all concerned about its implications this is an interesting finding and not surprising but is it a major way that this virus is using to infect people he asks the answer is no as of now the centers for disease control and prevention maintains that the best way to prevent the coronavirus from spreading is to wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds with soap and warm water as well as wearing a mask around others and following social distancing guidelines for thelatest coronavirus news and updates follow along athttps news yahoo com coronavirus according to experts people over 60 and those who are immunocompromised continue to be the most at risk if you have questions please reference thecdc s andwho sresource guides what to do if you think you have the coronavirus what are the symptoms of coronavirus glossary of public health terms to stay informed the most common ways the coronavirus is transmitted how to maintain your physical and mental health during the pandemic taking care of a loved one with covid 19 here s how to stay healthy covid 19 and pregnancy what we know so far how to find a job unemployment insurance q a with dr kavita patel how to keep your family safe and maintain your mental health opening and cleaning delivery packages tips for grocery shopping how to deal with potentially contaminated money how to do your laundry safely read more from yahoo life cdc says increased use of bleach and hand sanitizer to fight coronavirus is prompting more poison control calls here s how to safely disinfect your home and yourself we are proud to be taking care of people philadelphia nurses go viral dancing to ciara s level up hydroxychloroquine expert suggests doctors should halt prescriptions for covid 19 patients after concerning study want daily lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox sign up herefor yahoo life s newsletter
