and the health of its economy major market indexes in the united states ended the day down more than 2 percent earlier chinese stocks plunged by more than 7 percent forcing officials for the second time this week to halt trading for the day in this case after just 29 minutes after the market mess the chinese authorities made a stark reversal suspending a market mechanism known as a circuit breaker that halted trading when losses reached a threshold the measure put into effect just this week and intended to help stabilize stocks may have instead intensified investors concerns the big question now is how much of the turmoil reflects rule changes and other policies at the chinese stock market and how much is based on broader economic fundamentals that might have a further impact on global growth the market aftershocks spread to europe and the united states the benchmark standard poor s 500 stock index closed down 2 4 percent to its lowest level since the start of october for the last four days the s p 500 is down 4 9 percent producing the worst start to a year in the history of the index the narrower dow jones industrial average ended down 2 3 percent while the nasdaq composite index finished down 3 03 percent the selling was in shares in nearly all industries still american investors appeared to be less panicked than during a similar sell off in august also set off by concerns about chinese growth market indexes in the united states are still above the lows they reached during the summer and many strategists have been arguing this week that the current problems in china are unlikely to become a major issue for the american economy we don t see this as an issue for a major sell off in the markets said timothy m ghriskey chief investment officer at the solaris group people are responding like there is nothing new here china s economy is faltering prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets it has been a rocky start to the new year in global markets the big fear is that china s economy the world s second largest after the united states is slowing down and crimping growth in other countries markets are in a panic over what s happening in china said derek halpenny european head of global markets research at bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj in london people are saying whoa growth is way worse than we were expecting this year a downbeat chinese manufacturing report sent stocks spiraling on monday previously prompting the country s market to close early it also set off a global rout with stocks in europe and the united states getting hit china s currency the renminbi continued to be a sore spot on thursday the chinese government which closely controls the renminbi has been allowing the value of the currency to decline steadily as a way to bolster the economy a weaker renminbi helps exporters a key engine of growth transcript soundbite mandarin 81 year old retired man surnamed chang saying this action the circuit breaker does harm rather than good to ordinary stockholders information is not disclosed to the public with something not transparent soundbite english ceo of geo securities limited francis lun saying this circuit breaker rule not only did not reduce market fluctuation it actually exacerbated the market fluctuation because when the market falls everybody will fall over each other trying to sell soundbite english ceo of geo securities limited francis lun saying well i think the outlook is for the market to decline further because what happened this week because of suspension a lot of the sell orders have accumulated especially in a shares people wanting to sell could not sell so when the market reopens tomorrow i think investors will fall over each other to sell their stocks but it is a difficult process to manage a falling currency is pushing companies and individuals to send money out of the country at a rapid rate putting additional pressure on the renminbi and unsettling investors on thursday morning before the stock market opened china s central bank set the rate for the renminbi at 6 5646 to the dollar its lowest point in almost six years when stock trading started investors dumped shares once again shutting down the market people are worried about whether they are using currency depreciation to stimulate growth said steven sun head of china strategy and hong kong and china equity research at hsbc at the end of the day the question is do they have control everyone is asking that question the currency problems risk setting off a chain reaction as the renminbi also known as the yuan keeps sliding day after day traders start to expect ever greater declines the falling currency can then propel further stock losses in china that in turn can ripple through to the global markets a surprise currency devaluation in august helped prompt a sell off around the world it s getting into a stage where it is self fulfilling the weaker the yuan gets the more selling there will be said hao hong the chief market strategist at bank of communications international the price of benchmark west texas intermediate oil continued to fall on thursday dropping to 33 27 a barrel down over 2 percent as recently as may oil was trading at nearly 65 the eurozone s blue chip euro stoxx 50 index fell 1 7 percent on thursday the ftse 100 stock index in london was off 2 percent for the day the impulse when the stock market falls hard for a few days in a row is to do something but it probably doesn t make much sense to overhaul an investment strategy based on a blip of market activity asian stocks broadly stumbled japan s benchmark nikkei 225 index fell 2 3 percent and the hang seng in hong kong shed 3 percent the renminbi and the global repercussions will provide a crucial test for the chinese government in coming months in theory a weaker renminbi addresses two of china s problems it makes china s exports more competitive in foreign markets offsetting part of the surge in the country s blue collar wages over the last decade and it makes foreign companies houses and other overseas investments seem more expensive the trick is preventing a gradual decline from turning into a rout managing the currency is becoming harder for china investors most of them domestic are moving money out of the country before the buying power of the renminbi slides further china s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the united states and europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world china s economy has also been steadily slowing making it a less attractive place to invest fourth quarter growth which will be reported this month is expected to be 6 9 percent although some economists have expressed skepticism about the reliability of such figures the clearest indication of investor sentiment about the renminbi lies in the currency s value in unrestricted trading here in hong kong traders have been selling renminbi in hong kong for a significantly lower price than the bottom of the government authorized trading range in shanghai the falling value of the renminbi in hong kong undermines confidence in the mainland s currency it then puts pressure on the central bank to keep pushing down the official trading range taken together the currency weakness the economic slowdown and the stock market turmoil could force the government to take action when stocks sold off last summer china organized large scale purchases by government linked brokerages and investment funds some of those measures may have added to this week s pain though under the circuit breaker rule suspended later thursday trading was stopped for 15 minutes when losses hit 5 percent both times the circuit breaker was activated this week the losses continued once trading resumed taking stocks down 7 percent and forcing a stop in trading on thursday trading was suspended after just 14 minutes when it resumed 15 minutes later the indexes almost immediately fell to the daily limit trading was then halted for the day on thursday economic policy makers in china issued two statements meant to indicate that officials were taking matters in hand first the foreign exchange markets unit of the central bank said that current conditions are supportive of a relatively stable exchange rate the comment was interpreted by some traders and economists as signaling that the central bank might intervene more heavily in currency markets to support the renminbi there were indications that it had already begun to intervene more to prop up the renminbi in hong kong trading subsequently the china securities regulatory commission announced that it was extending for three months a ban on stock sales by large shareholders a previous ban imposed in early july during a steep plunge in share prices at the time had been scheduled to expire on friday erwin sanft the head of china strategy at macquarie group based in sydney australia predicted further declines in chinese stocks but he said that the fall might not continue for long china is quite good at defensive measures he said the options for the government go far beyond the market to shore up the economy china could further reduce interest rates so as to help the real estate market it could also further increase its already considerable stimulus spending on infrastructure still while such measures might help in the short run they would only add to one of china s biggest problems in the long run a huge overhang of debt that was used to finance poorly judged investments many of those investments like high speed rail lines built in smaller provincial capitals for political reasons may struggle to generate enough of an economic return to cover the interest on the money that was borrowed to finance them the more you try to alleviate the worse it gets in the long term said viktor shvets the head of asian strategy at macquarie as for the broader effects of china s problems mr halpenny the london analyst said there has to be a point when the market sensitivity to chinese devaluations declines we don t expect this degree of volatility to continue mr halpenny said but it looks like it s going to be an interesting year advertisement
