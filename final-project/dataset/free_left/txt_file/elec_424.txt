what did we learn about the republican party at the ronald reagan library debate wednesday night we discovered that leading gop candidates think reagan s administration was part of a wild left wing conspiracy to cripple american business over the hoax of climate change also there in a shrine to the man who reached out to the soviet union s mikhail gorbachev and helped negotiate an end to the cold war nominal debate winner carly fiorina said she ll refuse even to talk to the leader of russia if she s elected president of course all the contenders genuflected at the memory of reagan while trashing president obama s iran deal yet nobody mentioned reagan s role in bolstering the iranian hardliners by violating an embargo to sellthem arms in exchange for help to the nicaraguan contras and a possible hostage release we learned as well that when it comes to donald trump vs the right wing media it s trump 2 conservative media personalities 0 just like trump got fox to bow to him after he savaged megyn kelly following the last debate he humiliated radio host hugh hewitt unbelievably a panelist at this cnn debate by getting hewitt to say that it wasn t trump s fault that he confused the kurds with the quds force it was my fault hewitt told msnbc s morning joe and he seconded that thursday night hewitt also lobbed a softball question to trump which he actually kind of flubbed giving him a chance to blast president obama s syria policy and some of his 2016 rivals for not supporting military intervention in 2013 it looked as if trump s campaign against hewitt as a third rate radio host asking gotcha questions backed by rush limbaugh and ann coulter actually worked oh if you re waiting for me to tell you definitively who won the debate and who might begin to rise or fall in the polls as a result i m sorry i really have no idea dr ben carson looked like he confused his one a day vitamin with lunesta he was barely able to keep his eyes open and talked in sleepy non sequiturs but i thought carson blew the last debate and he rose in the polls so what do i know jeb bush clearly had another mediocre night which he can t afford he came out kind of peppy even trump praised his energy and accused trump of exactly the kind of special interest lobbying he rails against saying the real estate mogulgave him money back when he ran for governor and then unsuccessfully lobbied to place casinos in florida but trump denied it and loudly talked over bush there was brief confusion about whether the former governor was telling the truth politifact later confirmed it and the moment faded likewise bush was later given a chance by cnn s jake tapper to call trump out on a twitter insult to bush s mexican born wife columba bush started strong demanding an apology but then faded again as trump filibustered but bush s worst moment was when hewitt asked him in another kindness to trump about the fact that a lot of his foreign policy advisors worked for his brother the last gop president who got us into disastrous wars in iraq and afghanistan trump then jabbed bush your brother and your brother s administration gave us barack obama which led bush to retort my brother kept us safe as if he didn t remember his brother was president during the sept 11 attacks it was that kind of night for jeb trump didn t have a great night either but he has one thing in common with reagan so far he s seemed to share an impermeable outer political coating with the teflon president he engaged in a juvenile spat with rand paul early on that ended in his insulting paul s looks and looking kind of silly carly fiorina absolutely owned him when she was asked about the episode when trump clearly insulted her appearance look at that face he told rolling stone would anyone vote for that then insisted he was actually talking about her persona women all over this country heard very clearly what mr trump said fiorina shot back i think she s got a beautiful face and i think she s a beautiful woman trump countered with characteristic sexism but looking uncharacteristically sheepish this was an establishment crowd heavy on donors and they were tougher on trump than the fox audience was perhaps most damaging trump himself seemed relatively low energy his constant jibe against bush he told reporters later that it was his attempt at looking presidential but whatever he was much less a factor than in the last gop go round still pundits have predicted trump s decline before including after his boorish performance in the last debate and they ve been wrong trump himself crowed about a drudge report poll showing him the winner of the debate again that poll was right last time so who knows once again lots of the punditocracy claimed sen marco rubio was one of the debate winners but that s crazy the young florida senator fell flat on his face with an early joke about the california drought i brought my own water he said with a big dumb smile that was a twofer he made fun of a local tragedy on a day when the death toll of the state s drought fueled wildfires continued to mount and he reminded everyone of his humiliating big gulp moment when he got to reply to obama s state of the union address two years ago when trump dinged rubio accurately for having the worst absentee record in the senate rubio essentially defended it by saying congress isn t getting anything done so he stopped doing his job because it was frustrating in the real world he d get fired score one for trump anyway lots of smart ish folks thought rubio did well in the last debate to0 but he went nowhere in the polls fiorina probably had the best night if you don t fact check anything she said she flat out lied about what the doctored bogus planned parenthood videos showed claiming they featured a still living intact aborted fetus killed for its organs when they did no such thing when she insisted she d call iran s supreme leader to call off the recent nuclear deal on her first day as president the cnn moderators missed a chance to ask her why as ceo of hewlett packard she skirted anti iran sanctions rather like the night s patron saint ronald reagan and sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment to the anti u s regime she was allowed to misrepresent her awful hp record and inaccurately trash hillary clinton on benghazi and her controversial email practices still she s a poised practiced debater and she may get another small bump in the polls i don t think any of the rest including the occasionally statesmanlike john kasich did enough last night to significantly change their campaign standing gov scott walker was a bit more energetic but probably didn t make enough of an impressionto reverse his sinking fortunes sen ted cruz and gov mike huckabee continued stridently narrow casting to the far right evangelical community which might matter if trump suddenly left the field but the twice divorced libertine billionaire and born again republican is leading among that group too whoops i haven t mentioned the pumped up inauthentic it s not about me guys flailing new jersey gov chris christie oh well now i have at any rate theseemingly interminable three hour debate i accidentally typed three month debate because that s how it felt worked against anyone who had a good moment or two still remember that most post debate predictions were wrong last time once again we learned that the gop has moved far to the right of ronald reagan but little else joan walsh is the author of what s the matter with white people finding
