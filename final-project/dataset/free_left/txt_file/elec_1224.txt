 coronavirus up for reelection this fall north carolina gov roy cooper has to decide whether to allow trump s coronation to proceed amid a pandemic north carolina gov roy cooper robert willett the news observer via ap by maya king 05 08 2020 06 55 pm edt link copied north carolina roy cooper has got a doozy on his hands he s a democratic governor up for reelection in a republican leaning southern swing state pushing a go slow approach to reopening the economy as protests intensify and neighboring states move quicker advertisement but that s just the start how the first term governor handles his state s reopening will likely dictate whether president donald trump and the republican party can forge ahead with a full fledged convention in charlotte this summer between the governor and the mayor of charlotte who is also a democrat they really do control whether or not the republican convention will happen said david mclennan director of the meredith poll a statewide public opinion poll of north carolina voters as one of a handful of democratic governors in a trump friendly state cooper s handling of the coronavirus is a test of his leadership and political savvy so far his wait and see approach to reopening north carolina has boded well for him a late april meredith poll showed two thirds of north carolinians including a plurality of republicans approve of his job performance those numbers have made cooper a slight favorite to win a second term but his popularity surge could be short lived if the health crisis grinds on for months some republicans have pushed cooper to accelerate statewide reopening measures as other southern states such as georgia tennessee and neighboring south carolina are doing in the face of skyrocketing unemployment and economic stress but what makes cooper s situation unique is the authority he wields over the other party s national convention trump has been adamant about having a full scale in person convention but as those plans forge ahead cooper will have to walk a fine line between protecting and alienating his constituents the governor could ban such a large gathering outright or he could limit the number of people allowed to gather in any given place but any moves to curb the convention could inflame trump and his base and prove politically costly to cooper in november it would be horrible for the governor to get out and try to clamp down on a nominating convention said daniel barry the former chairman of the union county republican party it would take something very dramatic for the state or the city of charlotte to react in such a fashion and pull the plug the republican national committee is still scheduled to hold its convention in charlotte n c in late august chuck burton file ap photo cooper has steered clear of predictions about the fate of the convention aides and democrats in the state who work closely with him say he sees the event which was expected to inject 200 million into the state s economy as a boon to north carolina if he s forced to call it off or scale it back they said it will be because public health officials whose advice he has heeded say it s too dangerous republican officials said they haven t had extensive discussions with cooper about the convention most of the talks have been between charlotte s mayor vi lyles a democrat and gop brass but they said they re not concerned that cooper will pump the brakes on their convention plans on april 28 charlotte s democratic dominated city council voted 6 5 to accept a 50 million grant from the justice department to cover insurance and security costs for the convention marking an important step forward opponents said holding a 50 000 person convention would be impossible to pull off and dangerous to public health during an april 3 twitter town hall lyles hesitated to echo the gop s full speed ahead message but said the city is proceeding in that direction of hosting the convention and has a contractual agreement with the republican national committee to do so lyles addressed growing concerns during a second online forum on april 17 saying i don t have an answer to say yes or no about whether the convention will occur i have an answer to say we will be guided by the best decisions for our residents democrats in the state who want the convention mainly point to the economic lift it would provide republicans see it as a needed boost for trump s base and means of propelling cooper s challenger lt gov dan forest in the fall governor s race north carolina lt gov dan forest chuck burton file ap photo according to a report from the governor s office north carolina is flattening its coronavirus curve but if north carolina sees a second wave of infections close to august cooper will have to make a decision on whether or not trump s show will go on neighboring states like south carolina georgia and tennessee relaxed stay at home orders as early as april 30 allowing residents to begin dining in restaurants and shopping in retail stores cooper by contrast has taken a more measured approach he s employed a three phase reopening strategy that allows nonessential businesses to reopen as early as saturday but keeps a stay at home order in place for two to three more weeks well beyond the edicts of other deep south states i know people want their lives and their livelihoods back cooper said at an april 23 news conference at which he unveiled his reopening plans and i have a plan to do that but first we need to hit certain metrics because the health and safety of north carolinians is our no 1 priority cooper declined an interview request but a senior political adviser morgan jackson said the governor is not making any decisions based on facebook comments and angry tweets or signs that people are walking around carrying he s making them on health experts data science and also in consultation with business leaders and economists cooper 62 has been a fixture in north carolina for more than three decades including four terms as state attorney general in 2007 he made national news in the infamous duke lacrosse case declaring that three players accused of sexual assault were victims of a tragic rush to accuse in 2016 cooper defeated republican gov pat mccrory after an uproar over the state s bathroom law becoming the first person to defeat a sitting governor in modern state history coronavirus may lead to a comeback in disposable plastic products to environmentalists chagrin cooper s admirers describe his leadership style and personality as low key and steady his critics led by his republican opponent forest say lethargic is a more apt description it is time for governor cooper to have a sense of urgency to reopen our economy and allow people to return to their livelihoods forest said in an april 22 statement citing southern governors who had already reopened their states north carolina must have a sense of urgency to reopen we can do two things at once protect lives and livelihoods the citizens of our great state deserve nothing less in late may charlotte is still planning to host the coca cola 600 nascar race an event that typically draws 100 000 people but which will take place this year without fans it s being watched closely for signs of whether the city can host a major event albeit one not nearly as large as a normal republican convention dr mandy cohen north carolina s health and human services secretary has been a leading adviser to the governor in his coronavirus response several of cohen s health initiatives have won broad bipartisan support in the state particularly her approach to medicaid reform but she s also a former obama administration official and for a time she helped run obamacare itself that background could fuel even more controversy in a volatile fight over the safety of a gop convention democrats who have begun floating ideas for a scaled back or virtual convention in july
