up to your front door isolated and empty streets roads devoid of cars and lockdown at 10 p m this is the new regular in the most populous country in the world usually bustling busy and around the clock activities make it a far cry from how life used to be just a month ago in china if one does dare to trek outside they must take caution face masks and rubber gloves are mandatory with a common formality of staying a good five meters away from another person that is if you ever happen to run into someone else on the now desolate streets this is china during the coronavirus outbreak of 2020 during china s new year of the rat one person city pt 3 a post shared by nicoco nicolattes on feb 12 2020 at 10 51am pst it was early january when news first broke out over a mysterious virus from the same family assars that was proving lethal reports mostly stemmed from the city of wuhan in the hubei province of china the news and virus which had fever like traits quickly escalated and on the last day of the month the coronavirus covid 19 was officially declared a global health emergency by the world health organization from the china end of the spectrum my city seemed relatively detached and far from the central infected area the government enforced a lockdown on the city of wuhan lasting nearly three months stemming from the rest of the country schools and work offices were closed down until further notice trains metros and busses limited their services we were encouraged to stay home with most apartment complexes enforcing a curfew by 10 p m and a two time a day limit to leave our homes army personnel and security were amped setting up tents outside municipalities and checking temperatures of each person entering the complex this quickly turned into the new normal a somber silence came over most of the city anxiously waiting for the next news or reports of the infectious virus within a month and a half into the news first breaking out of the mysterious respiratory virus most of the city sat in quarantine a state quite uncommon for the busy city streets not only has tourism taken a toll but businesses of all kinds big and small have suffered economically this was the beginning of a long and declining road back at home my personal reality check was an extended holiday trip from work as our extra duties slowly started to cancel one by one i was no longer required to return at the beginning of february a winter camp during the last week of january was canceled i suddenly found myself with infinite amounts of time for reasons beyond my control and fault it was like having a guilt free pass indefinite amount of stay at home from work sick days of course that fleeting joy ride quickly came to a stop markets closed shop malls were closed regular eateries and restaurants were closed the convenient delivery service also took a short break only to return with tripled delivery fees my gym was closed and any salon appointments would have to wait with no one knowing when life will resume as normal my friends and other foreigners fled mostly to closer asian countries like thailand and malaysia everyone seemed to find refuge in our extended holiday until the holiday overstayed its welcome now people were trying to get home booking their flights until their home countries and china both stopped air travel those who were able to leave left in the beginnings of february days before flights from china were closed off despite the setbacks the beginning of february brought some changes the chinese persevered and were determined to not allow the deadly virus to set them back from continuing business work resumed as best it could most of the staff was encouraged to work at home expats were asked to teach from home make video lessons and join online teaching forums it was not until just recently small corner shops and restaurants opened again it s not to say i don t realize my luck and privilege of being well away from the bulk of the danger i am grateful i am quite away from wuhan and therefore didn t feel as much of the magnitude of effects but there are several others who were not as lucky as march came to a near end the country seemed ready to move forward and having faith in the precautionary measures to contain the virus by april the ban on wuhan was lifted and schools announced reopen dates life seemed to be returning back to the new after corona normal as the deadly coronavirus has now spread throughout the rest of the world many countries are now understanding the true tribulation that china went through in the past three months the same conditions are starting to become a reality for other nations around the world isolation looks like people dancing and singing in unison on their balconies in countries like italy and spain lockdowns have been regulated and the importance of social distancing has become a constant daily reminder in all media channels suddenly the issues that seemed so far away in china are now seemingly at your front doorstep it s easy to lose sight of the seriousness of the epidemic from far away if it s not affecting you it s easy to overlook the lives taken the difficulties faced and the setbacks of an entire nation and it s population it s easy to think it s not my country so it s not my problem i now realized though despite whether or not something is close to home it s effects ripple throughout the world and throughout humanity living in china during this coronavirus outbreak has helped show me that it has helped open my eyes to a new reality firieba sarwarzadah is
