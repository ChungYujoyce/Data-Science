advertisement supported by editorial by the editorial board small and mostly rural overwhelmingly white and unusually religious iowa is not a microcosm of america but it s the undeniable birthplace of political success stories that few saw coming from jimmy carter to barack obama iowa s esoteric caucus system is a crucible where a long shot without much money and a lot of time to shake hands can make it onto the nation s radar screen it s easy to grouse about iowa s outsize role it forces candidates who never stood in a cornfield to pay homage to farm subsidies of questionable merit it skews republicans stances to the evangelical right and democrats to the far left given its vigorous progressive element its system of caucuses in which precinct voters turn up in a school gym or social hall to vote under arcane rules is not a traditional primary at all and isn t even called one but iowa matters particularly for this year s national front runners in an election whose subtext is the anger of the fringes in both parties iowa is the epicenter of disaffection for hillary clinton just a hair ahead of senator bernie sanders and still twitchy at her third place finish in 2008 the state is a psychological test many iowans again seem to have doubts about her and she s virtually tied with mr sanders a 74 year old whose backers insist he s a fresh face a big turnout will boost mr sanders who needs young people and independents to win his surprising challenge has prompted a big change in mrs clinton s game she has adopted a more forceful up close and personal approach that could help her in a race that promises to be a longer slog than she anticipated the republican candidates who see themselves as mainstream compared with donald trump and senator ted cruz like jeb bush and gov chris christie are mostly focused on new hampshire senator marco rubio however hopes for a third place finish in iowa and is working the state nonstop this leaves mr trump the developer and mr cruz the texas senator as the top competitors mr cruz s entire primary strategy is aimed at very conservative voters and few states have more of them than iowa he has spent nearly a year wooing the evangelicals who make up nearly two thirds of the typical republican caucus vote he has cultivated pastor organizers in each of iowa s 99 counties and enlisted his father a preacher to join him on the trail he sounds like a minister himself in his town hall meetings at one point inviting attendees to get on their knees and pray for the supreme court not to recognize the legitimacy of same sex marriage his prayer was not granted if the race s most unwavering most undiluted conservative loses iowa s conservatives he s got big problems transcript n a iowa is a tough test for mr trump but promises a big payoff he ll need the vote of angry independents to win and in iowa they don t reliably turn out as henry olsen a conservative political analyst who has spent months modeling the iowa republican caucus told the times cruz wins among all groups that dominate the caucus so if trump wins on record turnout it shows he can do what he says which is to motivate nontraditional republicans and independents to get out and vote for him a win in iowa would send mr trump into the new hampshire primary which follows iowa by a week with the wind at his back a loss though hardly fatal would be embarrassing for a man who is all about winning iowa is an odd duck of a contest with its old fashioned focus on handshaking and town halls its cantankerous engaged voters and its evening long caucus process as such iowa is an early important test of candidates organizational and political mettle and a showcase of how on a good day our democracy functions advertisement
