watch cbsn live by rachel layne june 5 2019 4 56 pm moneywatch as president donald trump s trade war with china intensified last year and u s tariffs on imported chinese goods rose this spring some companies turned to mexico as a good alternative location to move production that shift became even more attractive when the u s mexico and canada reached a deal last fall to replace the 25 year old north american free trade agreement now however mr trump is threatening to slap tariffs of up to 25 on all mexican imports starting at 5 on june 10 unless mexico changes immigration policies and that s creating havoc with companies already shifting production some experts said the president s latest threats even put the new u s mexico canada agreement in jeopardy upending the stability businesses crave the usmca needs to be ratified by legislative bodies in all three countries such a mix creates a molotov cocktail of policy jay timmons president and ceo of the national association of manufacturers said in a recenttweet that may be especially true for smaller manufacturers or suppliers that have a harder time absorbing costs from the new tariffs essentially taxes paid by companies that import goods into the u s without charging customers more shifting a manufacturing base to another country can be costly and take months or much longer to set up hire workers and start making products for smaller suppliers that sell to bigger companies offering a good price can be key to survival last year scottsdale arizona based universal electronics amakerof remote controls sensing and smart home software began moving a good percentage of production out of china to avoid the 25 tariff on its products some of that production was moved to mexico universal electronics ceo paul arling told investors at a presentation tuesday so last week we were a little surprised unpleasantly surprised arling told investors if the white house does impose these new tariffs on mexico and the dispute drags on like the china trade war universal electronics may have to shift production to yet another low cost high quality country like the philippines or vietnam arling said even using a subcontractor to make its products can take months to establish and reach production speeds that match what china offered he said one thing that s highly unlikely moving production back to the u s that s because labor costs here are just too high compared to places like mexico china and vietnam arling told investors universal electronics sells its products to a range of bigger companies like directtv adt and sony we actually looked at this a few years back could we open up a factory in a location here arlin said the answer you wouldn t be able to compete he said last year manufacturing labor costs in china were estimated at 5 51 an hour versus 4 45 in mexico and 2 73 in vietnam according to statista the average goods producing wage in the u s as of april was 23 17 per hour according to the bureau of labor statistics keeping costs low can be especially crucial for smaller businesses which are getting hit hard by the trump tariffs said nathan resnick ceo of sourcify a two year old firm that matches small to midsize companies with factories around the globe in 2018 about 75 of the factories sourcify used were china based this year that s down to 60 resnick told cbs moneywatch previously most companies weren t talking about moving their production out of china this year it comes up in pretty much every single conversation we have resnick said and you know we probably have two dozen conversations a day with different companies still some companies were already starting to shift production out of china because its labor costs were climbing even before the u s imposed tariffs that has boosted competition for expanded space in countries like vietnam malaysia and the philippines from companies based outside the u s too resnick noted you can t just pick up a factory and there are certain products that are very challenging to move outside of china like watches and sunglasses he said sourcify and universal electronics are hardly alone gopro announced just last month that it would proceed with shifting u s bound production to mexico to avoid the tariffs on chinese goods just days before mr trump s surprise threat to mexico gopro didn t respond to an e mailed request for comment on its plans if the latest u s tariffs take effect tariffs are paid for by the companies that import goods even when they re from their own factories located overseas companies either absorb the tariff costs by cutting expenses like jobs or pass the higher costs onto their customers whether they re other companies or american consumers executives like resnick find mr trump s tweets that erroneously say china or mexico pay for tariffs mask the pressure on companies american consumers should know that it s actually american businesses and the american people that are paying for these tariffs because these american businesses are the ones paying our government when the product come into port paying these duties resnick said and then they re either having to increase prices which the american consumers have to pay for or try to better negotiate with their factories resnick continued it s putting a lot of pressure on mid market american businesses first published on june 5 2019
