giuliani on nbc s meet the press well the actions would be even worse if they were actions talk and action are two different things giuliani said i m not implying it was made up i said we re talking about things that he was talking about i don t know how much he was exaggerating i don t know how much is true giulianiadded i certainly don t know the details of it but i do know that this is unfortunately the kind of talk that goes on among a lot of people and they shouldn t talk about this giuliani was pressed on that point during a separate interview on abc s this week during that conversation giuliani appeared to acknowledge that trump s description during the conversation suggested sexual assault the problem isn t just the words as both senator mccain and vice president biden pointed out what trump is describing in that tape is sexual assault george stephanopoulos told giuliani on abc s this week that s what he s talking about whether it happened or not i don t know how much exaggeration was involved in that i don t know i do know there s a tendency on the part of some men at different times to exaggerate things like this i m not in any way trying to excuse it and condone it giuliani responded giuliani alsosignaled that trump had not ruled out using bill clinton s marital infidelities to attack hillary clinton during the second presidential debate meanwhile trump once again tweeted sunday morning about juanita broaddrick whose accusation that the former president raped her in 1978 was never litigated in criminal court and has been denied by the clintons trump also appeared to lashout at politicianson social media who were critical of his lewd remarks exclusive video interview bill clinton accuser juanita broaddrick relives brutal rapes https t co 9j7f8vk9md so many self righteous hypocrites watch their poll numbers and elections go down during a tense exchange on cnn s state of the union host jake tapper tore into thedefense that trump had merely engaged on locker room talk giuliani at one point suggested that many others have had similar conversations which tapper aggressively dismissed first of all i don t know that he did that to anyone this is talk and gosh almighty he who hasn t sinned cast the first stone here giuliani told tapper tapper responded tersely i will gladly tell you mr mayor i have never said that i have never done that i am happy to throw a stone i don t know any man i ve been in locker rooms i ve been a member of a fraternity i have never heard any man ever brag about being able to maul women because they get away with it never giuliani said on meet the press that trump would definitely attend sunday night s debate and that he is as prepared as he s ever been he said that trump feels bad and that he d like to move beyond the controversy to turn his attention to an issue focused campaign asked by todd if trump would bring up bill clinton s infidelities giuliani initially said that he believed trump would not but he volunteered that he believed hillary clinton s situation her role in questioning the character of the women who her husband had affairs with was on the table to an incredulous todd

originally campaign manager kellyanne conway and republican national committee chairman reince priebus were supposed to appear on the shows i don t think anyone was going to defend his remarks is

pretty darn shocked that he had said such terrible things and he feels terrible about it giuliani said on meet the press he feels terrible for his family and how embarrassing it is for them he feels terrible from his own point of view but he also realizes he has a responsibility and i think the last 14 months have driven that into him receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox
