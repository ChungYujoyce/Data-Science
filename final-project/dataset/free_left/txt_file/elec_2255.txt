 chicago when bernie san ders launched his long shot bid for the presidency 10 months ago there were two words that rarely crossed his lips hillary clinton now he can t seem to stop talking about her and not much of what he has to say is very nice during a boisterous rally here the senator from vermont dinged clinton for supporting a series of disastrous trade deals he mocked her for refusing to release transcripts of paid speeches she gave to wall street firms he said she was wrong to vote for the iraq war in 2002 the transformation has been stark what s less clear is whether sanders s rhetoric helps explain his lasting power in a nominating contest that appears likely to drag on for weeks considering the mounting number of victories he has scored in key states so far the evidence is mixed in michigan last week sanders won a surprising though narrow victory after closing a gap of more than 20 percentage points in the polls he was relentless in the days before the election in criticizing clinton on trade but sanders also got trounced the same day in mississippi albeit a state where he didn t mount much of a campaign tuesday a day when five states hold primaries should give a better indication of whether sanders s tough talk is paying off one of those contests is in illinois and sanders isn t holding back as he campaigns here in chicago on friday sanders even took aim at clinton for her close association with mayor rahm emanuel d whose approval ratings are in the tank particularly among black chicagoans i want to thank rahm emanuel for not endorsing me i don t want his endorsement sanders screamed to the delight of a crowd estimated at 9 000 people i don t want the endorsement of a mayor who is shutting down school after school and firing teachers to drive home his point san ders held a news conference the next day devoted entirely to emanuel he told reporters that if he were clinton he would have refused the mayor s support compared with the republican presidential race and other elections in past years the democratic contest remains relatively tame but the bernie sanders who is fighting to remain relevant in the delegate chase against clinton sounds quite different from the sanders whose chief antagonist was the billionaire class when he debuted on the campaign trail last spring be careful bernie trump threatens to send supporters to sanders rallies analysts say sanders s decision to attack clinton more aggressively is understandable it s what candidates who are behind tend to do but in sanders s case he risks damaging his brand as ananti establishment politician who has boasted about never running negative television ads and pledged to stay positive in his bid for the democratic nomination when you re promising to run a different kind of campaign it s never good to look like you re running the same kind of campaign that other politicians do said mo elleithee executive director of the institute of politics and public service at georgetown university it s a risk but it s a calculated risk and one they seem willing to take in an interview sanders acknowledged that he s adopted a tougher tone but said he has tried to stick to the issues and not engage in character attacks to the extent that the race has turned more negative sanders said clinton is to blame we re responding sanders said i find it disappointing when the secretary mischaracterizes my record sanders was particularly galled he said by clinton s assertion during their recent debate in flint mich that he had opposed releasing funds to bail out the automobile industry an issue of keen interest to voters in michigan given detroit s long history as the capital of the auto industry most fact checkers who looked into clinton s statement concluded she wasn t telling the whole story in 2008 sanders voted for an unsuccessful stand alone bill to provide aid to the auto industry the bill clinton referenced came later and its primary purpose was to bail out wall street something sanders staunchly opposed some money authorized in the bill wound up flowing to major u s automakers though to say that bernie sanders who has perhaps the strongest pro worker voting record in the united states congress does not support automobile workers in their time of need is totally absurd sanders said it s unfortunate that she made that statement sanders and his aides have tried to argue that none of his tv ads mention clinton by name but some leave little to the imagination on friday sanders debuted a pair of ads in illinois and north carolina another state that votes tuesday that say that while his opponent has flip flopped on trade deals bernie has fought them and stood with american workers clinton s positions on some trade deals including the pending trans pacific partnership have in fact evolved as secretary of state she called the tpp the gold standard of trade deals last fall she announced her opposition which she stated even more strongly over the weekend she has said she now has a fuller picture of what s being proposed in the interview sanders said voters have a right to know where he and his opponent diverge the differences are becoming fairly clear to the american people and the more the differences between her views and my views get out there the better we ll be he said clinton doesn t see it that way during an appearance saturday in st louis she said sanders has decided to close this election by attacking me and misrepresenting my record and his clinton spokesman jesse ferguson said clinton s campaign thinks sanders has broken his word about running a positive race during a rally saturday in springfield mo sanders continued to hammer clinton on trade saying their views diverged on the north american free trade agreement which was approved when her husband was in the white house in the 1990s i understood at the end of about three seconds that what this trade deal was about was forcing american workers to compete against very very poor people in mexico sanders told his audience i have voted against every one of these disastrous trade agreements he said secretary clinton s position has been different she has supported virtually every one of these trade agreements boos filled the arena at the mention of clinton s position sanders has also raised questions about clinton s judgment zeroing in on her decision to deliver a series of paid speeches to corporate interests in the run up to her presidential bid that included some addresses to the wall street firm goldman sachs which paid her 225 000 for one speech on that subject sanders hasn t hesitated to take a snide tone the way i see it if you re going to give a speech and get 225 000 it must be a really brilliant speech sanders told a crowd at the university of illinois on saturday it must be opening new vistas of human thought he also knocked clinton for refusing to release transcripts of those speeches to the public she has said she would do so when other candidates are held to the same standard let me make a dramatic announcement to all of you here today sanders sarcastically told his crowd saying he was ready to release transcripts of his wall street speeches he swung open his arms to reveal nothing here they are he said the danger for sanders elleithee said is not that he will lose die hard supporters with his tougher tone but that it could be harder to attract new ones including some who like clinton and are still weighing whether to vote for her some sanders fans including samuel nebinger who turned out saturday night to see the candidate in springfield say they re not bothered by the more pointed rhetoric nebinger said he welcomes it nebinger 21 recently dropped out of missouri state university he said because it was too expensive and he now works at a local call center he was wearing a shirt that said help us bernie you re our only hope he wanted to run it clean at first nebinger said but he needed to go on the offensive because she s been doing so many corrupt things she did that to herself
