private e mail server when she was secretary of state hillary rodham clinton decided last september to reset her presidential campaign as amy chozick wrote in the new york times the new hillary would display her humor and her heart the qualities that her friends say rarely come across in public appearances the reset reached its zenith on october 3 when hillary appeared on saturday night live as val a bartender to whom kate mckinnon as hillary clinton pours her heart out the six minute segment ends with hillary and val bonding as they sing stand by me the ben e king classic hillary gets so carried away with her manic crooning that she doesn t realize val has disappeared and been replaced by cast member cecily strong playing a character known as huma i was just hanging out with my best friend val hillary says huma tells hillary there is no one there i think you ve had one too many hillary let s go huma says huma as anyone who follows politics knows is 40 year old huma abedin hillary clinton s shadow as politico once described her she began working for hillary in 1996 when she was a 19 year old intern fresh from george washington university assigned to the first lady s office abedin had wanted to be a journalist like her hero christiane amanpour and was hoping to work in the white house press office take a chance her mother told her don t fall in love with plan a huma took the advice sixteen years later i wouldn t change a thing she told a dinner audience in 2012 at a fortune conference and i got to meet christiane amanpour over the years huma has served in several positions with increasingly important sounding titles she has been hillary s body woman her traveling chief of staff a senior adviser and a deputy chief of staff when hillary was secretary of state now based in brooklyn she is the vice chair of hillary s 2016 presidential campaign but whatever the title the job she performs for hillary has always been essentially the same confessor confidante and constant companion it s safe to say that over the years abedin and hillary have spent more time together than either has with her husband a former adviser to bill clinton describes her as a mini hillary wherever hillary goes abedin goes in november 2008 when hillary flew to chicago to meet with president elect barack obama to discuss becoming secretary of state she took huma along during hillary s grueling nearly 11 hour congressional testimony in october about benghazi abedin was there she has been referred to as a second daughter to the clintons others have described hillary and huma as like sisters whoever wants to curry favor with hillary has to go through abedin as thousands of recently released e mails make abundantly clear for the quotidian matters of the schedule she speaks for hillary and people adept at getting access to hillary know it everybody fights to be at the center the former adviser says and huma controls a lot of that dynamic i m not sure hillary could walk out the door without huma clinton adviser mandy grunwald told vogue s rebecca johnson eight years ago she s a little like radar on m a s h if the air conditioning is too cold huma is there with the shawl she s always thinking three steps ahead of hillary it s still true today nothing hillary related is too big or too small for abedin s purview take for example the secretary of state s december 2009 struggle to get a faxed document abedin can you hang up the fax line they will call again and try fax clinton i thought it was supposed to be off hook to work abedin yes but hang up one more time so they can reestablish the line clinton i did abedin just pick up phone and hang it up and leave it hung up clinton i ve done it twice now still nothing in january 2013 abedin was concerned that clinton might miss an early morning call from manmohan singh the prime minister of india abedin discussed the call with monica hanley another clinton aide abedin have you been going over her calls with her so she knows s ingh is at 8 hanley she was in bed for a nap by the time i heard that she had an 8am call will go over with her abedin very imp ortant to do that she s often confused in her new position as vice chair of hillary s campaign huma has even taken to being a stand in for her boss at campaign related events in october she and vogue s anna wintour were off to paris together for a 1 000 a person fund raiser at the home of james cook an american businessman but for all her proximity to the white hot center of american politics abedin is every bit as unknown to the general public as her boss is world famous abedin and presidential candidate hillary clinton at a campaign rally 2008 abedin was born in kalamazoo michigan her mother saleha mahmood abedin is pakistani her late father syed zainul abedin was indian both were intellectuals when abedin was two years old the family moved to jidda saudi arabia where with the backing of abdullah omar nasseef then the president of king abdulaziz university her father founded the institute of muslim minority affairs a think tank and became the first editor of its journal of muslim minority affairs which stated its mission as shedding light on minority muslim communities around the world in the hope of securing the legitimate rights of these communities after syed died in 1993 his wife succeeded him as director of the institute and editor of the journal positions she still holds she has also been active in the international islamic council for da wa and relief which is now headed by nasseef and was banned in israel on account of its ties to the union of good a pro hamas fund raising network run by yusuf al qaradawi google abdullah omar nasseef the man who set up the abedins in jidda and a host of right wing screeds pop up though he is a high ranking insider in the saudi government and sits on the king s shura council there are claims that nasseef once had ties to osama bin laden and al qaeda a charge that he has denied through a spokesman and that he remains a major figure in the muslim brotherhood in his early years as the patron of the abedins journal nasseef was the secretary general of the muslim world league which andrew mccarthy the former assistant u s attorney who prosecuted the blind sheik omar abdel rahman in the wake of the 1993 world trade center bombing claims has long been the muslim brotherhood s principal vehicle for the international propagation of islamic supremacist ideology google yusuf al qaradawi and you ll find even more right wing hysteria says mccarthy who has conducted something of a personal crusade on the question of the abedin family s purported connections the union of good is a designated terrorist organization and qaradawi is the leading global jurisprudent a term mccarthy prefers to cleric of the muslim brotherhood who has issued fatwas calling for suicide bombings in the palestinian territories and in israel and has called for the killings of american soldiers in iraq it turns out the journal of muslim minority affairs is an abedin family business huma was an assistant editor there between 1996 and 2008 her brother hassan 45 is a book review editor at the journal and was a fellow at the oxford center for islamic studies where nasseef is chairman of the board of trustees huma s sister heba 26 is an assistant editor at the journal in june 2012 then congresswoman michele bachmann and four conservative congressmen wrote to the state department warning that the muslim brotherhood had infiltrated the highest levels of the u s government the letter specifically cited abedin huma abedin has three family members her late father her mother and her brother connected to muslim brotherhood operatives and or organizations they wrote but a month later senator john mccain no friend of the clintons took to the senate floor to denounce bachmann s letter as an unwarranted and unfounded attack on abedin i know huma to be an intelligent upstanding hard working and loyal servant of our country and our government there are few things that president obama and john mccain agree on one is that bachmann s lies about huma are baseless and bigoted fear mongering says clinton campaign spokesman nick merrill the washington post once described abedin as notoriously private that s a fiction of course like many other political operatives she appears in the media when it suits her agenda appearing in vanity fair is not on it the clinton campaign declined to make her available despite repeated requests the campaign has put the fear of god into many who might speak about her one longtime clinton observer explained that along with chelsea abedin is the third rail of the clinton political world i m being very candid with you this person says it s a situation where everyone s afraid to comment for fear that they ll be misquoted for fear of saying something they may think is laudatory that others may not you can t imagine the paranoia it s a paranoia that clearly affects how everyone responds to huma there is a long list of usually chatty clinton surrogates and supporters who have gone mute on the subject of huma abedin the ones who didn t get the memo or choose to ignore it stick close to the prescribed script michael feldman the managing director of the glover park group a communications consulting firm says that after 20 years abedin has become part of the institutional memory and now occupies a really important and unique place in an organization bob barnett the lawyer who brokered the clintons multi million dollar book deals says huma is now one of the key glues that holds clintonworld together she knows everyone and everyone knows her she knows their strengths she knows their weaknesses she knows the roles they ve played and that history is priceless to a person in public life huma is a terrific leader she s multifaceted has a great strategic sense and she s a wonderful colleague she s an integral part of the team and her competence is only exceeded by her humility says clinton campaign chair john podesta when anthony weiner then in his second term as a congressman from queens new york first saw abedin around washington in 2001 early in hillary s senate term i was like wow who is that he told the new york times magazine s jonathan van meter in 2013 for an in depth story about their courtship and marriage at a democratic party retreat on martha s vineyard in august 2001 he asked her out for a drink she said she had to work but hillary promptly gave her the night off and urged the two young folks to go out and have fun in the event abedin who doesn t drink alcohol ordered tea and then retreated to the bathroom she was slow to return she ditched me weiner recalled to van meter they kept running into each other but abedin wasn t interested she thought he was a brash ambitious camera hogging new yorker but opposites began to attract during george w bush s 2007 state of the union address at which weiner found himself sitting between senators clinton and obama i appreciate you looking out for my boss huma texted him by 2008 their relationship had become romantic and they were married on july 10 2010 with president clinton presiding abedin with husband anthony weiner in new york city 2013 in may 2011 abedin accompanied hillary and obama on a trip to london that included a state dinner at buckingham palace abedin was invited to the festivities and afterward in her spectacular room at the palace wrote to weiner i cannot believe what an amazingly blessed life that we live these incredible experiences we ve both had it was like a fairy tale a few days later though the fairy tale became a nightmare when weiner called and left a message for his wife who was in washington my twitter was hacked in fact despite what he told abedin and the media weiner had mistakenly tweeted a photograph of his erection meant for a 21 year old college student in seattle to his 45 000 followers reporters besieged him desperate for privacy he and his wife then pregnant spent the first weekend of june at a friend s house in the hamptons as they were packing up the car to return to new york city weiner confessed it s true it s me the picture is me i sent it abedin was devastated it was every emotion that one would imagine rage and anger and shock she told the times at a news conference on june 6 weiner tried to come clean he admitted he had sent explicit messages to six women during the previous three years but said he had never actually met any of them one longtime state department official says that inside foggy bottom some people s initial reaction was that abedin might have driven weiner to sexting because she was never around she gave so much to hillary clinton what did she have left for him it was politically incorrect but we did wonder abedin turned to hillary after all who better to give advice on a husband s extramarital escapades the next day huma returned to work at the state department my compass was my job she said it was where i could go and life was normal huma didn t really want me to resign frankly weiner told van meter her frame was we ve got to get back to normal somehow but between majority leader nancy pelosi s call for his resignation and the fact that the clintons were now disgusted with him according to politico he believed he had no choice he resigned the following day which meant the end of his 174 000 salary leaving the couple to make do with abedin s 155 000 state department compensation after the scandal broke clintonworld seemed to go into overdrive to help huma financially a key first step was finding the family a new place to live soon after he resigned from congress weiner sold his forest hills condominium for 430 000 then abedin sold her washington condominium for 620 000 at a loss of 29 000 thanks to the generosity of jack rosen a longtime clinton supporter and new york developer the couple moved into a sunlit 12th floor 2 120 square foot four bedroom apartment in one of rosen s buildings at 254 park avenue south the monthly rent has been estimated to have been at least 12 000 in an interview rosen says the apartment was made available to the couple in part because of his relationship with the clintons and they paid a market rental rate how weiner and abedin could afford the rent had the press wondering although weiner had started a consulting firm woolf weiner associates the couple reported a combined income of 496 000 for 2012 while woolf weiner remains a corporate entity last july weiner joined mww a public relations firm two months later he was gone i was either not consulted or ignored on every part of this excellent summer adventure he tweeted the next step was to sign off on abedin s 2012 request to become a special government employee or s g e at the state department this would allow her to continue to get paid while working from home in new york city as a consultant with expertise that no other person could supply on a myriad of policy administrative and logistical issues according to her application for s g e status at the same time she could care for her new baby son jordan born on december 21 2011 she became an s g e in early june 2012 and was paid 62 06 per hour by then abedin was also acting as a consultant to teneo holdings a global strategic consulting and investment banking firm co founded by her old friend douglas band who did the same thing for bill clinton that she did for hillary for the seven months she worked at teneo she was paid 105 000 in addition to the state department and teneo jobs huma was hired as a consultant to the william j clinton foundation to help plan for hillary s post state philanthropic activities and as a personal employee of hillary s the potential for conflicts cropped up immediately in april 2012 after her maternity leave and while she was waiting to get her s g e designation teneo asked her to intercede on behalf of its client judith rodin the president of the rockefeller foundation in obtaining a seat on the president s global development council that year the rockefeller foundation paid teneo 5 7 million for public relations work rodin is expecting us to help her get appointed to this reads the subject line of an e mail between two teneo officials senior obama adviser valerie jarrett s team is aware of the request but has not made a commitment another e mail explains a few months later band e mailed abedin judy rodin huge clinton foundation cgi clinton global initiative supporter and close pal of wjc bill clinton teneo reps her as well can you help there was no reply from abedin in the e mail chain and rodin did not get the appointment in july 2012 huma weiner and jordan then six months old posed for people magazine in their park avenue south apartment which had been listed for sale at more than 3 million in the piece abedin proclaimed anthony has spent every day since the scandal trying to be the best dad and husband he can be i m proud to be married to him soon thereafter weiner announced he was running for mayor but it turned out he had again sent sexual messages to a woman on social media starting in july 2012 after the people story appeared he ended up losing badly in the democratic primary for many in clintonworld this was the end of their involvement with anthony weiner the clintons have put him in exile one longtime clinton insider says but not huma she quickly returned to hillary s side daniel halper online editor at the conservative weekly standard and the author of clinton inc an unflattering portrait of the clintons theorizes huma had little choice after the second sexting fiasco but to stick with hillary she started sort of easing her way out he says it would have helped if she was the first lady of new york and would ve had her own gig going but of course her husband completely fucked her over but at that point there was no way for her to exit gracefully in june 2013 huma s various roles caught the attention of iowa republican senator charles grassley then the ranking minority member of the senate judiciary committee in a june 13 letter to abedin he claimed that teneo had paid her for gathering political intelligence on behalf of its clients teneo disputes this assertion he noted that in addition to her 135 000 state department compensation she had also been paid as much as 355 000 for her other consulting he said he was concerned that her s g e status blurs the line between public and private sector employees he asked her to provide him information about her various jobs in her july 5 response she denied providing any advice or insights to teneo clients about the state department but these answers did not mollify grassley specifically he objected to abedin s becoming an s g e because he believed she provided no irreplaceable expertise and therefore her designation as one had violated congress s intent when it created the program in 1962 the state department dismissed his concerns her appointment as an s g e was consistent with employment and ethics rules it said she was retained for her expert knowledge of policy administrative and other matters grassley now the chairman of the senate judiciary committee remains unsatisfied and has cited another abedin related beef he claims she had worked 244 days as an s g e far more than the 130 days allowed by the federal s g e law if there s a reason for more than 130 days then she shouldn t be an s g e he says she ought to be a full time employee but according to someone close to abedin the state department s office of inspector general miscalculated the amount of time huma worked as an s g e and grassley and his staff are wrong about the implications of her working more than 130 days as one in her interview with the o i g abedin recalled receiving verbal approval for the time she spent working grassley continues to probe abedin s potential conflicts of interest when she was getting four different paychecks at once we know she set up dinners for secretary clinton and her private sector employers and e mailed private sector employees from government accounts he says during the course of his looking into abedin s s g e status the senator stumbled upon an o i g criminal inquiry commenced in october 2013 about whether abedin knowingly got paid for hours she did not work while she was on vacation and maternity leave the heavily redacted report of the inquiry dated january 2015 is titled huma abedin embezzlement essentially the o i g found that abedin was paid 33 140 03 or 20 331 42 after taxes in a lump sum as a result of her possibly submitting false or inaccurate time records resulting in pay received for work hours which should have been charged to sick and or annual leave the department of justice declined to prosecute the report makes clear that there was confusion about whether she had been authorized to take a maternity leave and whether she should have been paid for a babymoon an august 2011 trip abedin then pregnant and weiner took to italy during that trip she said in an interview with investigators every day we had calls we had emails i was i feel like i was constantly on conference calls i have clear memories of walking around and just being on a conference call the whole time as we were walking the 161 page report concludes that the state department wants her to repay 10 674 32 which equates to 62 days of work as of this writing abedin has not done so pending an administrative appeal in clintonworld the reaction to grassley s relentless assault on huma is one of resignation it s understood that if you live in that white hot center in clintonland you ll be the subject of investigations you ll be the subject of personal attacks explains the longtime clinton observer you expect it to come and it s handled she s done nothing wrong and has nothing to be apprehensive about it doesn t mean she still won t be attacked another says simply senator grassley would not be pursuing huma if she was not a key senior aide to secretary clinton grassley says that charge is ridiculous and that he has no plans to give up this fight until he gets more information from abedin and the state department the judiciary committee s lawyers have been trying to schedule a meeting with abedin s lawyer miguel rodr guez but that meeting keeps getting postponed each side says the other is to blame i have to go by my reputation grassley says i don t give up you know the old saying there s more than one way to skin a cat but rodr guez says neither the law nor the facts support senator grassley s baseless allegations and extrapolated conclusions it is disappointing that the senator and his staff continue to focus a politically motivated campaign on ms abedin who has been known her entire professional life for hard work integrity and her sterling reputation it is people like ms abedin whom we should all want in public service whether it s palatable for the vice chairman of hillary s presidential campaign to be embroiled in allegations of conflicts of interest obtaining patronage jobs or misrepresenting time worked remains to be seen asked if at some point huma becomes a liability to hillary the long term clinton insider replies it s like anything else i don t think so but you know i don t have any idea hillary is very loyal but she s obviously pragmatic it s all gotten more complicated since the simpler days of 2011 when one saturday morning just before noon huma sent hillary a copy of an a p story about gunmen who tried to assassinate the head of the libyan army hillary replied about an hour later did you get info from chelsea about the wall lamps chelsea had sent huma the link huma replied they are beautiful but way out of my price range did you look at all the ones in the link to the brand hillary asked later that afternoon can you call me at home ed note this article has been changed from its original adding an attribution to the new york times in the opening paragraph related how hillary clinton s loyal confidants could cost her
