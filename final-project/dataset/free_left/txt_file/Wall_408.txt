advertisement supported by g o p lawmakers have enabled all of the president s misadventures up to now they can t disavow his response to the coronavirus by michelle cottle ms cottle is a member of the editorial board as the coronavirus pandemic creeps deeper into the election cycle president s trump campaign team has a message for republican lawmakers don t even think about trying to socially distance yourself from the president s handling of the crisis mr trump s leadership during this national emergency has not wowed the american public at least not in a good way the republican faithful may continue to back him unconditionally but polls show that a majority of the electorate gives him negative reviews and the shakier the president s numbers look the more nervous fellow republicans become on monday the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell whose moral compass points always toward keeping his grip on power cautioned that this year s battle for the chamber would be a dogfight and a knife fight choose your own bloody metaphor even with a favorable electoral map mr mcconnell co fear that the president s pandemic performance could hurt them in november at the same time mr trump s enduring popularity with the base means that his teammates cannot risk looking anything less than 100 percent loyal what s a self serving republican to do the national republican senatorial committee recently distributed a memo with guidance on how to split this political baby when discussing the coronavirus candidates should fully embrace the president s efforts to shift the blame fully onto china but and here s the part that caught team trump s eye don t defend trump prepared by a top party strategist the bulk of the 57 page memo provides tips talking points timelines and background data geared toward making this crisis all about china the short version summary suggests condemning china not only for causing the pandemic but also for stealing jobs tossing religious minorities in concentration camps and flooding the united states with fentanyl democratic opponents are to be tarred as soft on china and unwilling to stand up to the chinese communist party they recommend while republicans vow to bring our manufacturing jobs back home and to work to punish china with sanctions drugs religious persecution stolen jobs commie lovers the vilification blueprint offers something for every leg of the republican stool and fits nicely with mr trump s trademark scapegoating the weaker and less competent this president looks the more vigorously he and his allies endeavor to gin up anger at an external enemy the trouble arises when the memo offers defenses to a couple of likely attacks questions no 1 being isn t this trump s fault republicans are urged in italics note don t defend trump other than the china travel ban attack china one bullet point suggests expressing gentle disappointment over the delayed response i wish that everyone acted earlier that includes our elected officials the world health organization and the cdc gentle or not team trump was peeved at the prospect of his senate team treating the administration s response as anything less than perfect and even more arrogantly thinking of their political fortunes as somehow separate from the president s this could not stand top officials from the trump campaign swiftly moved to let the republican senate committee know it had messed up on monday a trump political adviser justin clark warned the senate campaign committee s executive director kevin mclaughlin that any candidates engaged in such treachery should not expect support from the president s campaign and risked losing the love of the base candidates will listen to the bad advice in this memo at their own peril mr clark told politico confronted with this threat mr mclaughlin backpedaled furiously there is no daylight between the nrsc and president trump he responded senate republicans have worked hand in glove with the trump administration to ensure a highly effective federal response to covid 19 it is tempting to criticize the trump campaign for its heavy handed tactics and its demand for total obeisance from ostensibly independent lawmakers in reality why should the president expect anything less most republican senators made their pact with the devil long ago letting mr trump get away with pretty much whatever he wanted even so it has been their response to mr trump s handling of this pandemic that has shown what his republican enablers are truly made of day after day the president has come before the nation in news briefings and on twitter spreading not simply nonsense but dangerous nonsense downplaying the risks of the virus peddling quack remedies misrepresenting the availability of diagnostic testing and protective equipment picking fights with governors struggling to protect their states and of course deflecting blame onto everyone from the world health organization to the obama administration through it all few republicans have managed to muster even a peep of protest and they have been happy to promote the president s story that everything is china s fault just as they have supported his efforts to turn an apolitical pandemic into a partisan battle between red and blue states senate republicans have sold their souls to donald trump and it s absurd for them to pretend otherwise when they try they deserve to be smacked by democrats by the media and yes by the president himself voters will have their say soon enough the times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the
