now that we re nearly at the end of the summer of trump you could be forgiven for feeling like you and the donald needa break but before you really devote yourself to purging this cherisher of women from your mind do yourself a favor and read evan osnos s recent new yorker piece on the loose alliance of scared and angry americans who are driving the trump phenomenon as osnos understands trump s supporters who are part of a nativist resurgence throughout western politics are more important than the man himself and regardless of trump 2016 s ultimate fate these people aren t going anywhere i ve written previously about the trumpites or trumpeteers if you prefer and how they re defined as much by their authoritarianism as their ethno nationalism but while those characteristics are certainly present among the people osnosspoke to for his report another trait jumps out too and it s one that helps explain why the republican party establishment is so out of touch and so incapable of defeating trump in a zero sum battle for influence the trait is a lack of belief not in god or country both of which trump supporters rather enjoy but rather in the fundamental legitimacy of american society s most powerful and entrenched institutions the government the banks the media the academy etc because aside from one extremely notable exception which we ll talk about in a bit there s not a single major institution of american political life that these folks wouldn t like to see trump conquer the republican party itself very much included for a sense of how this plays out in the real world think of the now infamous opening question of the gop s first top tier presidential debate in truth the question was more of an order any candidate who would not promise to support the gop in 2016 regardless of the candidate was asked to raise their hand the request was ostensibly directed toward all of the debate participants but everyone knew its real target was the only candidate who hadn t ruled out a third party run trump the question was an attempt to bring trump to heel by leveraging the republican party s institutional prestige against him the goal was simple expose trump as a bad team player and if we lived in a time when party loyalty mattered it probably would ve worked but the devoted reactionaries who now comprise the gop base don t trust much less like the rinos among them the patent anti trump bias of the fox news republican party borg only made them love him more that s certainly the impression you get reading osnos s piece or this time report on a recent focus group run by frank luntz one woman tells luntz that she is frustrated beyond belief she says she feels like she s been lied to because despite republican gains in the 2014 midterms n othing s getting better her sentiment was widely and deeply shared we ve got to show the republicans that we ve had it with them another woman said they treat us like crap she added that s why we want trump it s hard to imagine there s anything the republican party can do in this climate to win the favor of trump s supporters but staterepublican partyefforts in north carolina south carolina and virginia to compel trump to swear loyalty to the gop are especially doomed such an ultimatum is not only t he kind of thing that could make trump bolt the gop as ex trump advisor roger stone tweeted it s the kind of thing that could make trump supporters in those states vote for a third party or simply not vote so the gop is in quite a bind if it goes after trump it will only bring him and his supporters closer together but if the republican party tries to ignore him or allow him to transform it into an american version of ukip then it will no longer be able to serve its fundamental purpose of winning elective office for republican candidates especially the ones aiming for the white house and if you re looking at this from the perspective of the gop as an institution that s unacceptable for conservatives trying to win the trumpites back to the gop it seems the holy grail would align the party with an institution that has even more gravitas and authority than donald trump and as i said earlier polling suggests there is at least one institution that fits the bill using it as a wedge to separate trump from his admirers however would raise some major ethical questions for example what if the cure for trumpism is somehow even worse because the institution in question is the military which americans trust far more than the media organized religion and the rest of the government that s a real concern it was when he spoke of the armed forces that luntz s focus group adored trump the most t he military is going to be so strong he promised nobody is going to mess around with the united states he got nearly unanimous 100s for that boast apparently a seldom occurrence among focus groups according to time perhaps the world should be thankful then that there is no war hero or celebrity general for the gop to task with destroying trump thanks paula but if we assume that trump is succeeding mainly because he reaches voters who felt otherwise ignored and not because of any extraordinary political talents then there s no reason to think the problem trump represents will go away once he does it could just as easily come back again and again and again each time in a slightly different form and if the gop eventually does find a military figure who is acceptable to the establishment while simultaneously bringing the trumpites back into the party tent well then there may be a time in the not so distant future when we ll pine for the relatively benign and innocent days of the summer of trump elias isquith is a former salon staff writer copyright 2019 salon
