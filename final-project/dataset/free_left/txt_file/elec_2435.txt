well prepped for the debate ap photo in a shift of strategy hours before the third democratic debate hillary clinton s campaign went for bernie sanders jugular accusing his team of stealing valuable campaign data misrepresenting what happened and inflicting damage here that cannot be undone the offensive came after the sanders camp admitted its staffers reviewed searched and saved data from clinton s voter file made accessible briefly wednesday because of a data breach and it represented a complete shift of tone in the democratic race where the hits have remained impersonal and focused on the issues advertisement this was not an inadvertent glimpse into our data campaign manager robby mook charged on a conference call with reporters friday night the staffers did not make a mistake they made 25 intentional searches of our data he said the breach struck at the heart of the campaign s data that took millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of volunteer hours to build the voter file is the fundamental basis of our strategy and clinton s team was angry that sanders tried to fundraise off the incident by acting like he was a victim of the democratic national committee stop politicizing and work to ensure that what took place is remedied mook said even dropping that sanders campaign may have broken the law the offensive play didn t end there by gabriel debenedetti and annie karni clinton spokesman brian fallon followed with more personal attacks accusing sanders team of undertaking a deliberate effort to muddy the waters as to what is going on here and said their top campaign officials were leaving wiggle room in their answers as to whether they have retained any data that was accessed during the 40 minute breach the attacks from clinton s top campaign officials represented a rare moment of punching down against a candidate who is trailing them in national polls by more than 20 points and foreshadowed an about face in her debate strategy until friday clinton aimed to push sanders aside by diminishing him as one note candidate incapable of handling the demands of a crisis a day presidency clinton insiders had pointed with alarm to a recent campaign trip to baltimore where a sanders spokeswoman warned reporters don t ask about isis today compared to the other candidates her bandwidth on the issues is extraordinary said terry shumaker a loyal clinton ally who chaired bill clinton s two presidential campaigns in new hampshire she s done 18 town halls in new hampshire and i think i ve been to all of them i have not seen a question yet that she hasn t been able to master the proposals clinton highlighted in the walk up to the debate had no binding theme other than showing off her ability to handle multiple issues simultaneously on monday she announced a plan to cut fees for immigrants seeking citizenship at a national immigration conference in brooklyn in minneapolis tuesday the former secretary of state gave a foreign policy address building out her three part plan to defeat isil less than 24 hours later clinton arrived in omaha to campaign with billionaire warren buffett and talk tax reform backing the buffett rule that would make individuals earning over 1 million pay 30 percent of their income in federal taxes that s the sort of thing that someone should be able to count on from the president and that s the sort of thing she can do campaign spokeswoman christina reynolds said referring to clinton s ease in toggling between national and international issues she declined to comment on sanders sanders campaign dismissed clinton s policy tour leading up to the manchester debate as the moves of a candidate lacking an overarching message is this the attempt to be spontaneous this week said sanders spokesman michael briggs scoffing at the implication that sanders is a one dimensional candidate he s answered questions on isis over and over and over again and frankly has a better answer than some other people do briggs said he s been out there talking about the middle east regime change terrorism and judgment in foreign policy is her vote for the iraq war the foreign policy they want to talk about sanders has repeatedly charged that clinton s 2002 vote in favor of the invasion of iraq led to the rise of isil and al qaeda in the region but when his spokeswoman warned reporters don t ask about isis today as sanders toured the neighborhood where freddie gray was killed in police custody clinton s allies pounced by nick gass campaign surrogate jennifer cunningham a partner at the consulting firm skdknickerbocker who sits on clinton s new york leadership council posted a washington post article about sanders one dimensional campaign on twitter and wrote great guy wrong office wrong time until the data breach ramped up tension cunningham s comment was a rare direct shot at sanders by a clinton ally indeed her campaign sees no upside in overtly targeting a liberal popular with the party s base but the ghosts of 2008 also have them on high alert about being taken by surprise by sanders near native son status in new hampshire where he is currently leading by double digits in the polls and his war chest of 26 2 million in iowa sanders remains within striking distance clinton leads by just 9 points the goal for her is to continue to do what she s done be strong on foreign policy be strong on domestic policy and don t let them land any punches said south carolina democratic party chair jaime harrison whose state will host the next debate in january it is up to bernie sanders and martin o malley to land something she can be above the fray in a defensive posture and use some of her time to beat up on the republicans with the energy of the race on the republican side
