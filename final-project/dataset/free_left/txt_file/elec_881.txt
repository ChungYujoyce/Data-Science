the impression is fast setting in that scott walker former king of iowa is a nonsense person and a ridiculous presidential candidate what s been the hot topic over the past week ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants that s what donald trump wants to do either through constitutional amendment or aggressively court challenging statute this isn t a new conservative idea and it s something that plenty of other candidates have happily subscribed to for a conservative leg up in the field it s definitelynotwhat rnc chairman reince priebus wants them talking about right now but reince priebus can go suck an egg where s scott walker been on this unclear while many outlets interpretedhim earlier this week saying that hedidsupport ending birthright citizenship in an interview with nbc s kasie hunt to us it read as more of a dodge the yeah belowwasmore of an acknowledgement that a question was directed towards him rather than a positive reply to that question kasie hunt do you think that birthright citizenship should be ended scott walker well like i said harry reid said it s not right for this country i think that s something we should yeah absolutely going forward hunt we should end birthright citizenship walker yeah to me it s about enforcing the laws in this country and i ve been very clear i think you enforce the laws and i think it s important to send a message that we re going to enforce the laws no matter how people come here we re going to enforce the laws in this country hunt and you should deport the children of people who are illegal immigrants walker i didn t say that i said you have to enforce the law which to me is focusing on e verify his campaign later clarified walker s rambling messby certifying the nonsensical dodge we have to enforce the laws keep people from coming here enforce e verify to stop the jobs magnet and by addressing the root problems we will end the birthright citizenship problem scott walkerhad a whole several days to sharpen up that position before he was asked again does hesupport ending birthright citizenship or not this is a yes or no question on a constitutional issue or whatever just pull a chris christie and say we ll have to reexamine it that s fine either yes no or maybe would ve been a better answer than the one walker gave cnbc s john harwood late last week like any great leader he boldly defiantly bravely ardently held his ground that he has absolutely no opinion about this thing that he should have an opinion on i m not taking a position on it one way or the other the 2016 republican presidential hopeful said only after securing america s borders he explained is it appropriate to address the issue of birthright citizenship only after the border issecure whatever that even means will heshare his opinion on the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment this is among the better whiffs we ve seen recently perhaps going back to jeb bush sayinghe couldn t give his opinion on the iraq war because it would offend the troops what s with this dope it s even odder because his team had just made a big show of telling the new york times that it was adjustingfrom a laconic walled off posture to a more assertive trumpian anti establishment one in a blunt self critique the times reported mr walker acknowledged on a private conferencecall with donorson monday that voters had found him passionless he announced a reset of his campaign according to a participant in the call in which he would take on the republican establishment to show that likedonald j trump he too strongly opposed the status quo and how did that reset play out in the first few days of his launch kasie hunt do you support ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants scott walker i uhh snarf vomits three days pass jim newell covers politics and media for salon copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
