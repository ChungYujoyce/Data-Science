do not sell he s made it clear that if he becomes president the u s will no longer lose big to china to fight back he talks often of slapping a 45 tax or a tariff on chinese goods coming into the u s as trump frequently points out there s a huge imbalance in u s china trade last year the u s bought almost 500 billion worth of goods from china in contrast the u s sold only 165 billion worth of stuff and services to the chinese many experts say trump is right that china isn t playing fair on trade but they warn his massive tariff would be a mistake it would start a trade war and wouldn t solve the critical issue there s a lengthy list of ways china plays by its own rules but the no 1 problem is the theft of u s business secrets and technology by chinese companies china doesn t want to be the manufacturer of cheap shoes and shirts forever it wants to go head to head with the u s in the high tech economy china is doing everything it can to catch up china is trying by any way possible to take advanced technology says derek scissors a scholar at the american enterprise institute they will buy it if they can they will coerce u s companies then there is the outright theft related china is crushing the u s in economic warfare how to bring jobs back from china chinese companies illegally steal over 200 billion worth of american business secrets known as intellectual property each year according to a bipartisan commission report from 2013 the chinese try to copy movies electronics and software and churn them out at a cheaper rate over 2 million jobs would return to america if china had laws to protect business secrets like the u s does the report from the commission on the theft of american intellectual property concluded it s become a key campaign issue both trump and hillary clinton talk tough on china if china does not stop its illegal activities including its theft of american trade secrets i will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes including the application of tariffs he said in a speech outlining his trade policy in late june clinton vows she ll throw the book at china for their illegal actions related yes china has won big from u s trade more ways china doesn t play fair theft is just one headache the chinese government has developed a reputation for changing rules on a whim and heavily favoring domestic companies china has made no secret of its intentions to dominate certain industries for example it has regularly been accused of dumping really cheap steel on world markets china denies those claims but u s and european steel makers say the intent is to drive them out of business the chinese government has also heavily subsidized certain industries something that is against the rules of the world trade organization which china joined in 2001 a scathing report from the information technology and innovation foundation a u s think tank details how china s government plans to pump 100 billion into the chinese semiconductor industry and restrict u s imports foreign companies that play by the rules can t compete with that kind of government intervention and that s to say nothing of the heavy censorship of foreign businesses like google goog and apple aapl trying to operate in china this spring china shut down apple ibooks and itunes movies with little explanation china s cheap currency then there are the frustrations over china s currency many countries believe china purposefully kept its currency the yuan at a very cheap level that makes chinese goods inexpensive for customers in the u s europe japan and elsewhere trump and clinton both want to formally label china a currency manipulator this is one area where china has been showing some signs of shaping up it has actually lifted the value of its currency in the past two years the international monetary fund even says the yuan is no longer undervalued still the issue could easily come back china just devalued its currency after brexit related give me safety u s bond yield hits record low what the u s can do to push back so what should the u s do numerous experts told cnnmoney that trump s tariff solution is too extreme it s akin to hammering a nail with a 18 wheeler truck an across the board tariff doesn t make sense it punishes chinese firms that don t cheat says scissors who worked for many years as a consultant to u s companies trying to enter the chinese market a sweeping tariff would also make a lot of stuff more expensive for poor and middle class americans when they shop a typical american family would pay between 800 to 2 200 more a year if trump s policies went into place according to economists instead of a big tariff robert atkinson president of the information technology and innovation foundation says the next president should start with some level playing tactics stop letting china invest in the u s unless it makes it easier for u s companies to set up in china deny china access to the u s banking system and or u s stock market put sanctions on companies that have stolen u s technology refuse to give chinese patents protection in the u s until china honors american patents there cut off scientific and other cooperation with china bring more world trade organization cases against china form a coalition with europe and japan to push back imagine if the chinese were shooting down our airplanes in their airspace would we just sit there and go meh asks atkinson he s one of many hoping the next president will get a lot tougher most stock quote data
