party s attention to the fall mr sanders s supporters showed no sign of backing down on tuesday in interviews several threatened to disrupt the party s convention in philadelphia in july with protests

900 vote edge according to complete but unofficial returns mrs clinton spent monday campaigning in kentucky showing how the battle against mr sanders continues to distract her campaign even as she

not to anger mr sanders by urging him to quit the race senator barbara boxer of california said she had reached out to mr sanders about the need for unity i have placed a couple of calls to bernie ms boxer said he s my friend he s been my friend for many many many years and i haven t heard back from bernie and i would hope that bernie will be a leader and make sure that everybody understands what is at stake and what is at stake is the future of our nation nothing less ms boxer who was in nevada for the convention on saturday as sanders supporters erupted in anger called what she witnessed terrible we just can t have a repeat of that in philadelphia because it s distressing ms boxer said i have a message to the bernie people who are planning to be disobedient because the system is rigged here is the thing they should support the democratic candidate who got the most votes they should support the democratic candidate who got the most delegates there is nothing to protest but sanders supporters remained defiant raising the possibility of unrest on the streets outside the convention you are going to see a variety of tactics said elizabeth arnold 32 a former staff member for the sanders campaign in philadelphia who said she planned to demonstrate i personally don t like being arrested but it s essential that we speak our minds and assert our first amendment rights our system is terribly flawed and terribly unjust so very just actions often end in arrests ms arnold who helped found edge an environmental justice group based in philadelphia said she did not condone violence and hoped that people would find a way to voice concerns peacefully but she said that mrs clinton and other democratic leaders attending the convention should worry about what is going to happen nina turner a prominent surrogate for mr sanders said that she had seen several emails from people planning acts of civil disobedience and that talk of dissent in the republican ranks over mr trump masked the searing divisions among democrats people are talking about the republicans having a brokered convention i think we are sleeping on the democrats ms turner said and if democrats believe that that s not going to happen they are just sadly mistaken they have blinders on it is going to be progressives who will disrupt she said and when i say disrupt i don t mean in a violent or a terrible way but i just mean upset the apple cart april mellody a spokeswoman for the democratic national convention said in a statement that the convention s security team would work with the philadelphia police and the secret service to ensure the safety and security of all of our delegates and participants after the meeting of nevada democrats on saturday ended in mayhem when many

behavior of mr sanders s supporters representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida the national party chairwoman also expressed her concern tuesday we will be reaching out to the leadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the democratic party in denouncing and taking steps to prevent the type of behavior on display over the weekend in las vegas she said but the protest effort enjoys some institutional support roseann demoro executive director of national nurses united a union that has endorsed mr sanders and that has been busing its members across the country to campaign for him also said her group planned to take part in demonstrations at the convention we will be a significant force inside and a significant force outside she said the focus is going to be
