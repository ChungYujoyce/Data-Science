advertisement supported by by trip gabriel ames iowa donald j trump who is rarely at a loss for words admitted i don t know what s going on when confronted by ben carson s surge past him in early voting iowa where mr trump had led the republican presidential field for months mr trump has derided mr carson for lacking the vigor and fortitude to be president but voters here are drawn to the retired neurosurgeon s low pitched manner that smile and his soft voice makes people very comforted said miriam greenfield a farmer in jewell iowa in an election season that has confounded party leaders and experts the rise of mr carson is another unexpected twist his supporters cite mr carson s character not his positions as the main reason they back him and they say his low key approach is precisely what would tame washington s bitter partisanship rather than mr trump s swagger he is kind when he speaks and he doesn t have an agenda to set himself up as wonderful said donna christiansen a retiree in ames what is more mr carson s provocative comments on topics like nazism and slavery which pundits and commentators regularly denounce seem only to deepen the enthusiasm his evangelical base feels for him he has connected with republican women here who prefer him to mr trump and he has built momentum far from the political establishment which was unimpressed with his debate performances and his lack of governing experience he conducts chats on facebook and visits medical clinics and churches rather than the usual political stops in a des moines register bloomberg politics poll released friday not only was mr carson the top choice among republicans with 28 percent but he was also described by those surveyed as the most presidential candidate the most pragmatic and the one they would trust most with a finger on the nuclear button and unlike some other candidates popular with the party s grass roots mr carson has built a muscular financial base his 20 8 million raised over the summer most in small donations was more than the total of any other republican candidate on friday he released his first television ad in the four early nominating states on facebook mr carson answers nightly questions from his 4 3 million friends covering personal topics his ailing mother is much better policies like a recent suggestion that he would end medicare he denied it and the campaign the debates are just a boxing match book sales are another below the radar means of cultivating support he is on a 26 day book tour notably wending through iowa florida and south carolina that critics derided as a campaign vacation but mr carson attracts buyers by the hundreds who exchange a few words with him as they stop for a signature jason walke a trial lawyer in des moines said neither mr trump nor another fiery outsider senator ted cruz of texas has a snowball s chance of changing things in washington the way ben carson does i believe someone as mild mannered and gentlemanly as ben carson is just about the only kind of person that could said mr walke who heard mr carson speak to a modest crowd on the lawn of a fraternity house at iowa state university on saturday similar views surfaced in a focus group of republicans last week in indiana many criticized mr trump as divisive while praising mr carson as wise and a gentleman trump is rough carson is reassuring said peter d hart the pollster who led the focus group and the unknown elements of carson are calming and the known elements of trump are disturbing mr carson s events have a distinct feel voters approach him with something close to reverence and he appears gracious and unhurried when interacting with them one on one on saturday his wife candy a yale trained classical violinist sang an a cappella version of the national anthem on the lawn of the fraternity house pausing midmeasure to tell the crowd hands over hearts please history suggests that each party s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions as measured by endorsements fund raising and polling mr carson swept past mr trump in two polls of iowa republicans last week despite infrequently visiting the state now he is promising to return at least twice monthly leading up to the feb 1 caucuses the key thing for me is i don t sit down and strategize like politicians because i m not a politician he told reporters i don t want to be a politician i think we need some authenticity we need some honesty in our country right now mr carson s support has not been dimmed by his statements on the unsuitability of a muslim to be president his linking of gun control and the holocaust and his likening of president obama s health care law to slavery on the contrary 57 percent of republicans in the register poll rated as very attractive his comparison of the health care law to slavery and 73 percent said his opposition to a muslim as president made him more attractive on sunday mr carson gave critics more fuel by opposing abortion in cases of rape or incest saying on nbc s meet the press that i would not be in favor of killing a baby because the baby came about in that way mr carson s rise in iowa is driven by his consolidation of evangelical voters who constitute close to 60 percent of republican caucusgoers a trend that could carry him strongly into later voting states in the south with similar demographics people are very attracted to ben carson s bedside demeanor said bob vander plaats a leader of the christian right in iowa traditionally a single anti establishment candidate has emerged from the state finishing in the top two or three around whom conservative republicans rally mr carson mr trump and mr cruz are all vying for the role in two surveys last week mr carson led mr trump soundly by eight and nine percentage points a third survey by cbs news released sunday showed the two tied in the state but mr trump held a robust lead in two other early voting states new hampshire and south carolina i don t understand iowa because frankly i just left and we had tremendous crowds and tremendous enthusiasm mr trump told cbs s face the nation on sunday frankly even to be tied i m a little surprised mr trump appeals to a somewhat different demographic from mr carson s working class voters with high school educations for whom social issues and religious beliefs are less important the rally he described which drew thousands was in the democratic leaning eastern side of the state where he has done most of his campaigning many of those drawn to mr carson and mr trump have not participated in iowa s caucus system before making them more difficult to organize the two are undertaking among the most aggressive efforts by any of the 15 republicans running to encourage caucus participation much of mr carson s organizing is done by a super pac which stationed volunteers at the books a million store in ames where he appeared saturday they buttonholed customers collecting email addresses and phone numbers the super pac known as the 2016 committee began training supporters how to caucus recently people that are following ben a lot of them support him but have never caucused and they need to know what to do said rita davenport a county chairwoman for the super pac we have the resources to go into each community and do these types of things she said the campaign would be stretched far too thin to even think about going to each of these small towns and doing caucus training darren westercamp who emerged from the store with a signed book said he became curious about the candidate when he visited his father and noticed a carson sticker on his vehicle i grew up in a family that did not have stickers on their vehicles he said when i saw that i said i need to listen to this man advertisement
