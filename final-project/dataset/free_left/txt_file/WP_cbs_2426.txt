last updated mar 19 2020 8 11 pm edt editor s note the fda on april 24cautionedagainst the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial the agency said it is aware of reports of serious heart rhythm problems in patients with covid 19 when treated with the drugs and that they have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing covid 19 one of the reasons health professionals are so worried about the coronavirus pandemic is that there is no specific medicine to treat or prevent the disease if a patient gets sick all doctors can do is provide supportive treatment to help them breathe but in thursday s coronavirus task force briefing from the white house president trump touted two preexisting treatments that have been floated as potential ways to help patients fight back both drugs are still in clinical trials for coronavirus but cbs news medical contributor dr david agus joined cbs evening news anchor norah o donnell to break down what we know about the medications read norah o donnell s interview with dr agus below norah o donnell dr david agus so good to have you one of the drugs is actually a half century old anti malaria drug how does it work dr david agus it s pretty wild right hydroxychloroquine is used for malaria and rheumatoid arthritis and it works by two mechanisms one is it blocks virus and the second is it tempers down inflammation both of which play a role probably in how it s benefiting patients with covid 19 the other drug that the president mentioned was created to treat ebola how would that work so that is another antiviral this one is intravenous compared to the first one hydroxychloroquine is oral and remdesivir is an intravenous drug that blocks the virus you know this is a virus it s not alive the virus actually goes into our cells and uses our own machinery to divide and drugs like remdesivir can inhibit those processes enabling the virus to stop dividing and that s how we benefit from it if you have covid 19 right now what do these potential treatments mean for you if somebody has covid 19 now i want them to talk to their doctor about the potential role of using hydroxychloroquine today it is an fda approved drug for other indications and they could write a prescription today for this drug and use it in the right setting that doesn t mean every patient needs to be on it but it s a discussion to have with your doctor there is hope and this drug is hope personified to every person with the disease we saw cases spike in just the last 24 hours where are we on this curve i m optimistic i m hopeful with the behavior changes our country has made as well as with these medications announced today that we re really at a new point and a point where i could see at some point light at the end of the tunnel what s the most significant behavioral changes you ve made you know my children and my wife we re staying home and we re going out for things like this where it s a very controlled environment we re eating together as a family both of my children are home from college and every night i have dinner with them to me it s a gift i mean you have to find positive in some small places in this horrible tragedy that hit our country watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
