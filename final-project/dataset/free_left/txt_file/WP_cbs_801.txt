correspondent ed o keefeobtained an 18 page document from a person familiar with the call that laid out recommendations for governors and employees to reopen their state s economy the guidance says that before states and employers move to phases of reopening they first need to see evidence of a downward trajectory of documented cases and influenza like illnesses within a 14 day period it also says they need to see a robust testing program in place for at risk healthcare workers and the ability to treat all patients without crisis care the document adds the recommendations are implementable on statewide or county by county basis at governors discretion you re going to be running it we re going to be helping you we re going to be supplying you as needed if you need something that you don t have trump said at the beginning of the call according to audio obtained by cbs news the president grew defensive as the call went on blaming china for not stopping the spread of covid 19 this could have been stopped at the source it could have been stopped and it should have been stopped and we did a lot to do that by the way but we re going to get on with this it is what it is he said mr trump added that the work of the federal and state governments helped curb the potential death toll which he said was at 2 2 million in the initial estimates nobody has to hang their head because you ve all worked really hard and we have made the best out of a horrible situation and i m very proud to have worked with you and we re going to continue to work together the president told the governors the document also says the three phase approach is based on up to date data and readiness mitigates risk of resurgence and protects the most vulnerable one participant on the call said the recommendations are all guidelines no directives and are what states are already doing and focused on cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarrosays one example of this is in the midwest where a group of governors from seven states announced a partnership thursday to work on gradually reopening their economies similar to the groups ofgovernors on the east and west coasts the seven states illinois michigan ohio wisconsin minnesota indiana and kentucky will be looking at four main factors sustained control of new infections and hospitalization an enhanced ability to test and trace a sufficient health care capacity to handle any surges and best practices for social distancing in the workplace we recognize that our economies are all reliant on each other and we must work together to safely reopen them so hardworking people can get back to work and businesses can get back on their feet the statement says the regional agreement also points out that it doesn t mean every state s economy will reopen at once or that they ll all take the same steps ohio governor mike dewine said his state will reopen in phases starting may 1 i am an optimist and am confident that ohioans will also live up to the challenge of doing things differently as we open back up beginning on may 1st dewinetweeted from the candidates joe biden after the announcement of last week s unemployment numbers joe biden

financing paid for by a mix of conditioned assistance and additional incentives the trump administration has been given a number of extraordinary tools to make this happen to keep people employed biden said in a statement yet they are failing to use them effectively for more people to stay in their jobs donald trump has to do his job the democratic presumptive nominee was also endorsed today

former vice president s posture on china reportscbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga the attack ads will begin airing tomorrow as part of a previously announced broadcast and cable buy in the battleground states of michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania our internal polling has shown us the vast majority of americans blame the coronavirus pandemic on china and joe biden s track record on china has been weak america first action spokesperson kelly sadler told cbs news this announcement comes in the wake of similar attacks on biden s diplomatic record with china launched by the trump campaign we have data that shows that among joe biden s many weaknesses his soft on china record is a major vulnerability trump communications director tim murtaugh told cbs news biden campaign spokesperson andrew bates said in a statement the former vice president publicly urged trump not to believe china s spin about the worst public health crisis in over 100 years and to insist that our cdc experts be given access there instead despite repeated warnings from our intelligence agencies and public health experts trump spent vital weeks praising china s response as successful and transparent while deceiving the american people about the extreme threat we faced and failing to prepare our country two weeks ago the president told reporters in a white house briefing i like china the chinese people are phenomenal people on february 7 trump tweetedthat chinese president xi jinping was strong sharp and powerfully focused on responding to covid 19 mr trump s re election campaign

california senator announced the votesafe act thursday new legislation that according to harris would expand voting options and improve safety in the wake of the covid 19 outbreak the bill would authorize 5 billion to expand vote by mail and early voting efforts this would include states being required to maintain an early voting period of at least 20 days the bill would also provide grants to improve safety at polling locations like implementing curbside voting and the bill would ensure voting access for american indians alaska native and rural voters during an interview with msnbc harris said and it s very exciting because it s about the federal government encouraging states to actually make voting in this moment safe and accessible for all voters harris added when you look at wisconsin the most recent election and you look at the fact that they had to close over 100 polling places because they didn t have the workers because they didn t have the infrastructure to accommodate voting in this era of a pandemic and so it s only the smart thing to do and it should be non partisan it s about patriotism in fact cbs news campaign reporter tim perryalso notes during the same interview harris built more suspense about the possibility of her joining presumptive nominee joe biden s ticket while harris has been asked several times in the last week about the possibility she has normally said she is honored to be part of the conversation but she s primarily focused on handling coronavirus today harris said i mean obviously i d be honored to serve with joe but i m just telling you that my focus right now is really on what we re dealing with right now elizabeth warren elizabeth warren on thursday criticized the federal reserve and treasury department s implementation of two bailout programs for businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic saying they were inadequately enforcing worker protections the federal reserve is handing out billions of dollars with little oversight and failing to require basic protections that companies retain workers and maintain payroll failing to include protections against outsourcing and failing to retain basic protections for union workers warren wrote in one of two letters she sent to federal reserve chairman jerome powell and treasury secretary steve mnuchin cbs news campaign reporter zak hudaksays warren is also calling on the top white house ethics official to ensure covid 19 related decisions are not made to benefit president trump and jared kushner s personal interests and to make sure that banks end the seizure of stimulus checks and that the va eases medical marijuana restrictions warren made the calls in three letters written with other lawmakers that she released thursday the first also signed by senators richard blumenthal and tom carper raised concerns about a shadow task force being run by kushner to oversee the white house response to the covonavirus pandemic they noted that one of the largest shareholders in a company that produces hydroxychloroquine a drug president trump has said shows great potential to stop the pandemic these potential conflicts raise obvious questions regarding whether the actions of white house and other trump administration officials during the covid 19 pandemic are consistent with federal criminal conflict of interest law the senators wrote in another letter warren and senator sherrod brown sent letters to half a dozen trade organizations for banks and credit unions asking that they not seize stimulus checks from recipients to pay their debts a process the new york timesreportedyesterday had already begun they wrote that the stimulus payments can be a financial lifeline for americans during the crisis and will also provide a much needed boost to the economy but only if spent by american families instead of siphoned off by predatory banks and debt collectors in a third letter warren senator ed markey and five representatives from massachusetts urged the department of veterans affairs to allow health providers to recommend medical marijuana to veterans during the pandemic marijuana is legal in massachusetts but only dispensaries for those with a prescription have remained open as this global pandemic continues to adversely affect veterans behavioral and physical health conditions we believe that veterans who legally use cannabis in the commonwealth to treat their ailments deserve to receive more robust assistance from qualified medical personnel at their local va they wrote to va secretary robert wilkie

stockpile conservative protesters gathered around the state capitol in lansing michigan on wednesday to protest whitmer s stay at home order amid the coronavirus pandemic whitmer addressed the protesters in a briefing on wednesday saying her decisions on executive orders on the coronavirus are not political decisions in a briefing whitmer said we know that this demonstration is going to come at a cost to people s health tiffany brown whitmer s press secretary said in a statement that the governor understands that citizens may be frustrated under the stay at home order but cautioned
