 the politico caucus ted cruz impressed nonpartisan caucus members the texas senator was always focused on message according to one by katie glueck 11 11 2015 05 06 am est updated 11 11 2015 04 25 pm est politico illustration getty marco rubio won the fourth republican debate and john kasich lost that s the assessment of this week s politico caucus our bipartisan survey of the top activists strategists and operatives in iowa new hampshire south carolina and nevada nearly 40 percent of republican participants said rubio won the debate in a survey taken immediately following tuesday night s contest no other candidate had more than 12 percent advertisement energy said an iowa republican of rubio he wants the job by every measure marco rubio won the night a new hampshire republican said strong and informed on every issue inspirational presidential he actually moved the ball down the field added a nevada republican rubio gave a compelling vision for a hopeful future contrasting his youthful vision to a tired older take on the country epitomized by hillary for the second republican debate in a row the politico caucus named the florida senator the biggest winner of the night noting his vigorous defense of a muscular american foreign policy one of the biggest applause lines of the evening and forceful remarks concerning wall street as evidence of a strong and articulate candidate forty two percent of democrats also agreed that rubio won the night he is engaging articulate comfortable in his own skin and has a hopeful positive message he packages well for a party that is looking for change but still wants a foot in policy and politics a new hampshire democrat said but several respondents from both sides of the aisle who said rubio had a good night also argued that while they saw him as the winner it wasn t a blowout performance other candidates also had solid showings several candidates had a good night but rubio had strong substance and presentation a south carolina republican said jeb was probably good enough to stop some of his bleeding added a nevada democrat who selected rubio rubio trump bush paul and cruz all seem to have held their own but i wouldn t say there was a clear winner the runners up for best performance according to the survey were jeb bush and carly fiorina with 12 percent each followed by rand paul with 8 percent and ted cruz and ben carson both at 6 percent according to republican insiders jeb was most in need of a strong performance and he was much improved a new hampshire republican said at a minimum he has bought himself more time to reset and start advancing cruz was the favorite of several nonpartisan participants one of whom from new hampshire called him the most articulate of all the candidates another from nevada called him always focused on message as for the biggest loser of the night 38 percent of republican insiders pointed to kasich looked completely unhinged and out of touch with gop electorate a new hampshire republican said of the ohio governor petulant is not a winning strategy said another kasich had a contentious evening as the moderate conservative tussled with donald trump over immigration reform and was booed when he suggested there was room for government involvement in saving big banks from going under kasich s awkwardness was on full display and his ideas are getting lost in the power of his peevishness a south carolina republican said he was whining about not getting to speak but actually had one of the highest speaking times said a nonpartisan respondent from iowa he came across as angry and kept trying to inject himself in the conversation not a good night for him among republicans bush came in second for the title of the candidate with the worst night with 31 percent of respondents giving him that designation despite his runner up status for best night jeb did ok but ok is a loss for him a new hampshire republican said added a south carolina republican he just seems sluggish and stumbles through too many answers more than a third of democrats also called bush the biggest loser of the night too polite too nerdy for the 4th debate in a row a new hampshire democrat said this is like the debate over who s an elite qb in the nfl you see the reasons why you should think bush is an elite qb but then he plays the game and he stinks these are
