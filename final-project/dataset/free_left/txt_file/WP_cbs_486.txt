watch cbsn live updated on october 23 2019 10 07 pm cbs ap google said it has achieved a breakthrough in quantum computing research saying an experimental quantum processor has completed a calculation in just a few minutes that would take a traditional supercomputer thousands of years the findings published wednesday in the scientific journal nature show that quantum speedup is achievable in a real world system and is not precluded by any hidden physical laws the researchers wrote google ceo sundar pichai said in a tweet he is excited about what quantum computing means for the future it gives us another way to speak the language of the universe and better understand the world not just in 1s and 0s but in all of its states beautiful complex and with limitless possibility quantum computing is a nascent and somewhat bewildering technology for vastly sped up information processing quantum computers are still a long way from having a practical application but might one day revolutionize tasks that would take existing computers years including the hunt for new drugs cnet reported they could also create solar panels help developartificial intelligenceandself driving cars and even manage investment portfolios the technique relies on quantum bits or qubits which can register data values of zero and one the language of modern computing simultaneously big tech companies including google microsoft ibm and intel are avidly pursuing the technology quantum things can be in multiple places at the same time said chris monroe a university of maryland physicist who is also the founder of quantum startup ionq the rules are very simple they re just confounding president donald trump last year signed into law a congressional proposal to spend 1 2 billion over five years for quantum research across the federal government google s research was centered at a university of california santa barbara laboratory but relied in part on a department of energy supercomputer and experts at the national aeronautics and space administration to verify the work ivanka trump the president s daughter and adviser on wednesday called google s breakthrough a remarkable scientific achievement that will help usher in future u s industries we re proud to have contributed to this major milestone she tweeted it s official the us has achieved quantum supremacy in a collaboration between the trump admin google and uc santa barbara quantum computer sycamore has completed a calculation in 3 min 20 sec that would take about 10 000 years for a classical comp pic twitter com ybv2tpcp1a google s findings however are already facing pushback from other industry researchers a version of google s paper leaked online last month and researchers caught a glimpse before it was taken down ibm quickly took issue with google s claim that it had achieved quantum supremacy a term that refers to a point when a quantum computer can perform a calculation that a traditional computer can t complete within its lifetime google s leaked paper showed that its quantum processor sycamore finished a calculation in three minutes and 20 seconds and that it would take the world s fastest supercomputer 10 000 years to do the same thing but ibm researchers say that google underestimated the conventional supercomputer called summit and said it could actually do the calculation in 2 5 days summit was developed by ibm and is located at the oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee google has not commented on ibm s claims whether or not google has achieved quantum supremacy or not may matter to competitors but the semantics could be less important for the field of quantum research what it does seem to indicate is that the field is maturing the quantum supremacy milestone allegedly achieved by google is a pivotal step in the quest for practical quantum computers john preskill a caltech professor who originally coined the quantum supremacy term wrote in a column after the paper was leaked it means quantum computing research can enter a new stage he wrote though a significant effect on society may still be decades away the calculation employed by google has little practical use preskill wrote other than to test how well the processor works monroe echoed that concern the more interesting milestone will be a useful application he said the promise of such future applications in commerce and national security has attracted interest from governments including the united states and china that are increasingly investing in the expensive basic research needed to make quantum computers useful one feared outcome of quantum computing though experts say it s likely still decades away is a computer powerful enough to break today s best cryptography first published on october 23 2019 11
