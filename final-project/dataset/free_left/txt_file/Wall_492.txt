mcilroy who played with trump in 2017 in a recent interview with the mckellar golf podcast mcilroy said he accepted the invitation to play with trump out of respect for the office of the president but would not likely do so again i will sit here and say that the day i had with him i enjoyed but that doesn t mean i agree with everything or in fact anything he says said mcilroy who also criticized trump for trying to politicize the response to the pandemic mcilroy the top ranked player in the world has in recent seasons embraced an off course leadership role among professional golfers who are typically a conservative cautious group mcilroy added it s just not the way a leader should act and there is a bit of diplomacy that you need to show and i just don t think he s shown that especially in these times but trump said he relished his time in the presence of pga tour pros some like my politics very much and probably some don t the president said i guess the ones that don t i don t get
