tuesday here are some of the things we will be watching and where you can find our live updates the republican presidential campaign will not end next week or even next month but voters in the five states casting ballots on tuesday will go a long way toward determining whether donald j trump can win the 1 237 delegates necessary to claim the party s nomination if mr trump loses ohio possible or florida less likely and wins less than commanding victories in illinois missouri and north carolina he would face the strong possibility of falling short of a delegate majority and entering a contested republican convention this summer but with victories in the home states of two of his rivals he could end the campaigns of gov john r kasich of ohio and senator marco rubio of florida leaving senator ted cruz of texas as the only candidate still standing in his way no two states loom larger on the general election map than florida and ohio and the results there could offer clues to the mood of the bellwether voters going into the fall campaign if mr trump dispatches ohio s two term governor and florida s young senator it would suggest that he is close to wresting the republican nomination and that would quickly force other elected republicans there to decide how tightly they want to embrace a candidate who even with his victories in the primary could prove repellent to the sort of up for grabs voters most coveted in these pre eminent swing states this calculation could also prove consequential in the senate campaign as both states have republican held seats at stake that could determine the balance of power in that chamber even as ohio s economy has recovered since the great recession manufacturing jobs have continued to vanish should mr trump and senator bernie sanders of vermont on the democratic side win ohio it will be in part because of their ferocious assault on the united states international trade agreements a line of attack that also lifted them in michigan the economic conditions in the state have undermined support for free trade among voters and leaders in both parties that augurs for a general election where the eventual party nominees will confront immense pressure to abandon the bipartisan free trade consensus that has shaped every modern presidential administration illinois and missouri have a lot in common besides being midwestern states that share the mississippi river both have been obscured by the action in florida and ohio which are winner take all contests for republicans and elimination races for mr kasich and mr rubio but illinois and missouri which allocate a handful of delegates to the statewide winner and the rest to the top vote getter in each of their congressional districts could be just as important if mr trump overwhelms his competition in each capturing every congressional district he could effectively turn them into winner take all states but mr kasich has aggressively campaigned in the chicago area and mr cruz has stumped in nearly every corner of both the states if together they can win a substantial number of the combined 26 congressional districts in both contests it would limit mr trump s haul and mitigate the impact of his winning florida ohio or both the biggest wild card may be the heavily black congressional districts in chicago st louis and kansas city they offer the same number of delegates as the most conservative republican districts in the rural reaches of each state mr rubio has fared best in cities so far but his collapse offers opportunities to the other republican hopefuls mr rubio entered super tuesday with high hopes after a wave of high profile endorsements two weeks later he is on the verge of a decisive defeat in his home state he trails mr trump in every survey and often by a wide margin with the latest polls showing him down by nearly 20 percentage points florida s 99 delegates are enough to cover an eighth of those mr trump needs to reach the majority count but there is a silver lining for mr trump s opponents mr rubio s decline and the possibility that he could withdraw after florida is good news for them elsewhere mr cruz has picked up a lot of mr rubio s former supporters in firmly red states like louisiana and mississippi mr cruz lost states like these by a wide margin on super tuesday but he nearly won in states where mr rubio s support was reduced to the single digits the same phenomenon has given mr cruz a chance to squeak out wins in missouri and north carolina farther north mr rubio s weakness helps mr cruz and mr kasich but perhaps not by enough to allow either to overtake mr trump that seemed to happen in michigan where mr trump won a much smaller share of the vote than he did in louisiana or mississippi but because his opposition was more divided still won by a larger margin the same phenomenon might help mr trump win illinois mr sanders can prove his upset victory in michigan last week was not a fluke he has a real chance of winning in ohio missouri and illinois where the polls show a much tighter race than they did before michigan like michigan the three states might be particularly receptive to his message on trade and they are less diverse than the nation a few more wins in the midwest would strengthen the case for mr sanders to stay in the race and compete in the delegate rich blue states that dominate the final two months of the primary season but the challenge for mr sanders is not simply to win in the region it is to win big hillary clinton could win florida and north carolina by more than 20 percentage points making her likely to add to her big pledged delegate lead narrow victories by mr sanders will not do much to cut into mrs clinton s growing edge one advantage for mr sanders is that the midwestern states hold open primaries where voters of any political affiliation can cast their ballots mr sanders tends to fare best among independents especially because younger voters are likely to identify that way exit polls in michigan found that mrs clinton won self identified democrats by 18 percentage points but she lost the state nonetheless because of a 43 point disadvantage among independents there is a flip side to open primaries democrats can vote in the republican contest that might help mr sanders too it has been argued that mrs clinton was hurt because some of her supporters voted to stop mr trump in michigan self described democrats represented 7 percent of the michigan republican primary electorate according to the exit polls mr sanders will not always have this advantage and he will not have it in florida the biggest delegate prize of the night where only registered democrats are allowed to participate when the votes start coming in from florida and north carolina after 7 p m most of the results will be from early voters they tend to be older than the voters who turn out on primary day which might bode well for mrs clinton and mr trump but if mr trump does much worse among primary day voters than early voters it might be a sign that recent controversies like the protests and violence at his events are taking a toll on his support the early vote might also provide a clue about strategic voting if mr rubio closes strong in florida at the expense of mr cruz and mr kasich it might be a sign that voters are choosing to coalesce behind an anti trump candidate even if he is not their preferred one that would be a bad sign for mr trump s chances in a one on one race which states are voting and how many delegates are at
