the summer of trump officially closes with its silliest episode yet the spectacle of trump truthers an assortment of trump friendly media figures who insist that the man who said president obama is a muslim and not an american and that muslims must be gotten rid of at a new hampshire rally was some kind of opposition plant not an actual trump supporter first out the gate was ann coulter early friday morning i say he s a liberal plant she tweeted brian kilmeade of fox friends echoed coulter insisting the anti muslim questioner sounds like a plant to be honest fox s kimberly guilfoyle and eric bolling continued peddling that theory all day laura ingraham agreed tweeting that the man sure sounded like a put up cartoon presentation bad acting media matters ran down the list of right wingers trying to bail out trump who was uncharacteristically media shy after the controversy erupted even canceling a scheduled public appearance on friday allegedly to close a business deal but it wasn t just official right wingers bloomberg s mark halperin peddled the notion on saturday he doubled down on his questions it s only ok to use theclich doubling down when talking about halperin in a long twitter debate with journalists who challenged him insisting the guy sounded like the travolta mumble in the dance scene in pulp fiction it s one thing for paid right wing propagandists to suggest trump s questioner wasn t an actual supporter it s another for an allegedly serious journalist to push the claim with zero proof to be fair my friend chris hayes raised the question on his show thursday night immediately after the trump rally but it was more in the vein of telling viewers the theatrical questioner hadn t been found so no one could decisively say whether he was an actual trump supporter but it shouldn t be hard to believe a trump supporter holds those views trump personally took the birther nonsense from the fringe of politics to center stage in 2011 and he revived the claim in 2012 even as he was endorsing mitt romney trump has also suggested obama was muslim telling fox s bill o reilly in 2011 that it s possible obama doesn t have a birth certificate he may have one but there s something on that maybe religion maybe it says he is a muslim besides the man s claim that obama is a muslim and also not american puts him squarely in the mainstream of the republican party a recent public policy polling survey found that only 29 percent of republicans believe obama was born here and more than half say he s muslim those numbers climb among trump supporters two thirds say he s a muslim and 6 in 10 believe he wasn t born in the u s i don t know why is so hard for anyone to believe that a man at a trump rally would ask that kind of question to his credit trump is denying claims that the questioner was a plant i don t think he was a plant he said monday i knew that question was going to be a controversial one i have no obligation moral or otherwise to defend the president then he brazenly blamed the entire birther issue on hillary clinton s2008 campaign what i ve said is nothing compared to hillary claimed the man who so dogged the president with birther bs he released his long form birth certificate at a public event let me concede it s possible the man at the trump rally was a plant so far nobody has found him to interview him at least not yet but i don t know who d bother to plant him what would they have to gain the kind of people who d be upset that trump failed to rebuke the anti muslim birther aren t likely to support trump in the first place most actual trump supporters agreed with the guy s premise joan walsh is the author of what s the matter with white people finding our way in the next america copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
