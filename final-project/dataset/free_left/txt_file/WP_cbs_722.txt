the following is a transcript of the interview with nasa administrator jim bridenstine that aired sunday july 14 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan we are joined by nasa administrator jim bridenstine thank you and good morning nasa administrator jim bridenstine good morning it s great to be here margaret brennan this is an incredible anniversary week for nasa bridenstine it is margaret brennan the last man to walk on the moon was 1972 bridenstine jack gene cernan yes margaret brennan yeah you you get an a tell me though about your plans for artemis the plan to put humans back on the moon just five years from now bridenstine that s right so we want to go back to the moon sustainably in other words to stay but we also want to keep our eye on what is president trump s goal what is his vision he wants to put an american flag on mars so we go to the moon so that we can learn how to live and work on another world and ultimately have more access to the solar system than ever before so that we can get no kidding to mars but here s i think the important point about artemis specifically in the 1960s we we love apollo what an amazing program a contest of great powers the united states of america in the cold war and of course we came out on top but i think the important thing is in those days all of our astronauts came from test pilots and fighter pilots and there were no opportunities for women today under the artemis program we have a very diverse highly qualified astronaut corps that includes women and artemis in greek mythology happens to be the twin sister of apollo so now when we go back to the moon and she was the goddess of the moon by the way so now when we go back to the moon we go with all of america and i think that s a great message margaret brennan so the first steps in 2024 will be by women bridenstine that s the goal margaret brennan a female astronaut bridenstine yes margaret brennan but all of this requires a a rocket that s never flown a space capsule that hasn t flown a lunar lander hasn t even been designed yet given the track record how realistic is that five year timeline bridenstine so the way i talk about this there s two risks there s technical risk and then there s political risk we would be on the moon right now if it weren t for the political risk we would be on mars quite frankly by now had it not been for the political risk but as you ve identified we did 16 margaret brennan what do you mean political risk you mean funding bridenstine i m talking about funding so in the past in the 1990s and in the early 2000s we made efforts to go back to the moon and onto mars and in each case the program was too long it took too too long and too much money what the president said is in order to retire the political risk we want to go faster we want to go within five years the vice president delivered a message at the national space council and he said we want to go back to the moon within five years then they amended the president s budget request to give us the resources necessary to make it a reality and that s where we are margaret brennan but then the president tweeted nasa should not be talking about going to the moon we did that 50 years ago we should be focused on much bigger things is he fully onboard with what you just laid out bridenstine a hundred percent i talked to him after that tweet i wanted to make sure we were in alignment we absolutely are he understands and in fact he said to me i know we ve got to go to the moon to get to mars but he said what is that generational achievement that will inspire all of americans it s putting an american flag on mars he said make sure you re committed to the to the flag on mars margaret brennan you ve said before you believe in science and you believe that humankind is contributing to climate change have you suggested some kind of major earth initiative what is nasa doing about the planet we are currently living on bridenstine so what nasa s job is is to study the earth and every part of the electromagnetic spectrum and we have been doing that we continue to do that and we share that data with the entire world and we do it for free to the entire world margaret brennan and you share that with president trump who has been a skeptic of bridenstine it s available margaret brennan human contribution to climate change bridenstine it s it s available to the entire world for free it s online anybody can have access to it and of course margaret brennan does he believe you when you lay this out to him bridenstine so i m i m one agency there are other agencies in the federal government epa noaa others when i talk to the president i m talking about space exploration in general but we do have a role to study the earth and it is changing and the president is very committed to clean water and clean air know this nasa is spending as much money on studying the earth as we ever have and of course when you look at the comparison between what we re investing in studying the earth and what others are investing look at all of our partners on the international space station 15 countries the european space agency russia canada japan we are spending as much as the rest of them combined margaret brennan america s rivalry with the soviet union helped to fuel some of the initiative 50 years ago do you see a scenario where either china s feeling that for the united states or there is a chance to partner with china bridenstine so quite frankly at this point neither one of those but you re right apollo was a contest of great powers we were trying to demonstrate technological prowess and the the goal was to demonstrate that our political system and economic system was superior and in fact we achieved that but know this we re doing amazing things we re so far ahead of china right now it s not even a comparison just recently we had the crew drag and attach to the international space station before that we landed on the far side of mars for the eighth time in human history we landed on mars the united states of america is the only country that s been able to achieve that we re now entering orbit around bennu for the first time in human history doing an asteroid margaret brennan okay bridenstine return mission and then of course brilliant images of pluto and that same spacecraft now four billion miles from earth giving us more science than ever before we re margaret brennan thank you bridenstine we are winning margaret brennan thank you and we will be watching we hope all of you will all this week on
