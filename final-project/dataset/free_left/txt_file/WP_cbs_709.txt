watch cbsn live by megan cerullo february 28 2020 4 08 pm moneywatch the centers for disease control and prevention this week called on americans to start preparing for a potential coronavirus outbreak in the u s raising questions about what measures employers large and small may need to deploy to protect their workers while staying open for business americans should expect quarantines and ready themselves for a new normal over the next several weeks cbs news contributor dr david agus told cbsn thursday warning that our way of life will change the cdc on its websiteoutlines steps employers can take to help curbthe spread of the virus yet some of these recommendations like restricting employee travel conflict with the demands of conducting business both domestically and abroad others are at odds with the often cutthroat corporate culture in the u s the federal agency s top recommendation to companies work from home actively encourage sick employees to stay home the cdc advised dr agus echoed that point of view and also took it one step further saying companies should be planning for their whole staffs to work remotely there are going to be areas of quarantine in the u s and workflow is going to be dramatically changed so the great companies of the world will start policies for employees to work from home he told cbs moneywatch you then have to think about how they will work from home and questions like how do you deal with supply chains do you arrange for equipment for employees working from home this is a wake up call for companies he added such guidance could usher in a mass work from home experiment akin to those taking place in china and other countries where coronavirus outbreaks have occurred not working for an indefinite amount of time is unsustainable for individuals businesses and the national economy providing an opportunity for efficient work from home alleviates the damage caused by the pandemic said alex konanykhin co founder and ceo of transparentbusiness a digital platform that help companies manage remote workers the virus which causes the coronavirus disease officially called covid 19 was first detected in wuhan city in hubei province in china late last year there are currently 60 coronavirus cases in the u s a number that public health officials expect to grow soon experts warn it could spread particularly fast in cities like new york where residents rely heavily on public transportation to commute to work mass transit shutdowns or at the very least a limit on the number of passengers per subway car for example could be on the horizon i take the metro here in d c every day and it s like a sardine can that s probably going to be something we have to stop because if you are in close contact sharing all sorts of surfaces it s probably a great opportunity for transmission said christopher mores global health professor at the milken institute school of public health at george washington university public health officials have repeatedly emphasized the importance of what the cdc has referred to as social distancing to mitigate person to person transmission of the coronavirus experts say companies will need to be especially stringent in telling sick employees to stay home starting immediately but enforcing such a rule even for workers that can perform their job functions remotely might not be as easy as it seems the u s work culture is such that at some companies you go to work even if you are sick it s either the expectation or a point of pride and that kind of organizational attitude can make it difficult said danielle ompad an associate professor of epidemiology at the new york university school of global public health if employees have symptoms encouraging them to stay home and not penalizing them in some way is the biggest thing a company can do she added for many workers of course interacting with customers is an essential part of the job such as in the restaurant business and employees could be vulnerable physically and financially if they aren t eligible for paid sick leave too many people go to work when they are sick because they don t have paid leave and it becomes a public health hazard olga jonas senior fellow at harvard global health institute told cbs moneywatch some workers also get fired for calling in sick so there s nothing incentivizing them to stay home without sick leave she added ompad reiterated the importance of companies not penalizing workers for calling in sick especially during a viral outbreak don t put people in a position where they are worried about their paycheck or income because that may drive people to go out when they are sick which won t be good for them or the community even employees who seem healthy should consider staying home given that individuals with the virus may not display symptoms immediately or ever experts said in california this week authorities reported that a woman with no known exposure to someone with covid 19 had tested positive for the illness stoking fears that more people could become infected through what health experts call community spread if this kind of cryptic community transmission continues to propagate we will certainly see a whole bunch of approaches to try to break transmission mores said columbia university epidemiologist dr stephen morse suggests policies for companies that include staggering work hours implementing generous sick leave policies and only requiring that essential personnel be physically present offices and cubicles are not conducive to staying healthy and i ve talked to companies who are seriously thinking about having their employees stay home he said multinational companies from banks to technology firms are banning non essential employee travel to those countries where outbreaks have occurred including china italy and south korea they are also requiring that employees who ve already traveled to those nations or been in close contact with someone who has self quarantine for a period of 14 days government mandated travel restrictions are also impeding some workers from attending industry events and conferences ravin gandhi founder and ceo of gmm nonstick coatings a provider of coating products to cookware and appliance makers is concerned that some of the company s china based employees will miss an upcoming housewares show in chicago we have a lot of tech service people chemists and meetings with our american based clients and none of these people who are the must crucial can come gandhi told cbs moneywatch so he s devised a workaround we have sent a few people to visit clients in other countries thailand vietnam indonesia to burn off the 14 day quarantine period gandhi said his u s based workforce mostly telecommutes which in the context of the coronavirus these days is an advantage first published on february 28 2020 4 08 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the know get the latest breaking news
