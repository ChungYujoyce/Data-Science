margaret this is a critical moment for the trump administration but one that has been marred by mixed messages and missed opportunities to prepare and make tests widely available after days of saying he didn t need one president trump revealed that he has been tested for coronavirus begin vt paula reid the white house revealed yesterday that the president has tested negative for coronavirus after coming in close contact with at least two foreign officials who have tested positive president donald trump i decided i should based on the press conference yesterday people were asking did i take the test paula reid but friday night when the president says he was tested the white house released a memo from his physician insisting testing for covid 19 is not currently indicated it s the latest in a series of mixed messages from the administration as it continues to defy its own guidance on shaking hands president donald trump because it almost becomes a habit paula reid and social distancing but on saturday members of the press had their temperatures checked before attending a presidential briefing over the weekend the house passed legislation that includes free testing paid sick leave food assistance and expanded unemployment benefits but no cost estimate has been provided for the bill which now heads to the senate the president has also declared a national emergency freeing up to fifty billion dollars to combat the outbreak that announcement made alongside top business executives in the rose garden helped stocks rebound friday after their worst day in thirty years end vt paula reid

palmer for an update on what s going on in europe elizabeth palmer cbs news senior foreign correspondent elizaplamer good morning italy still has by far the highest number of positive coronavirus cases in the world but just last week the who named spain as the new epicenter of the pandemic because the number of cases there suddenly rocketed up tenfold begin vt elizabeth palmer normally crowded spanish streets are empty the government has ordered people to stay home unless absolutely necessary and spain s prime minister confirmed on television that his own wife has tested positive all across europe cities are eerily quiet in france italy and belgium as well as parts of germany cafes bars and restaurants are closed as officials scramble to slow the spread of the virus schools are closed too and even the great landmarks like rome s trevi fountain and the eiffel tower though paris being paris the tough new rules didn t slow down left wing protesters yesterday facing off of a police it s iran that has the second highest number of cases on earth and it s now struggling to treat victims in ill equipped hospitals but notably nowhere is there panic instead displays of solidarity crowd singing elizabeth palmer like locked down italians singing from their windows and in spain a mass ovation for health care workers manning the hospital frontlines applause end vt elizabeth palmer here in the u k we ve still got far fewer positive cases than in most of europe so the government hasn t yet closed the pubs and the restaurants and the schools but it is clearly hedging its bets for example it s announced that it s planning to buy as many ventilators as it can get its hands on margaret margaret brennan liz thank you and we ve just learned that the u k is now advising against non essential travel to the u s we turn now to doctor anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at nih doctor fauci thank you for making time i know you re quite busy you said this week we are not at the peak anthony fauci md director national institute of allergy and infectious diseases right margaret brennan and this is going to get worse how much worse anthony fauci yeah margaret brennan what are the numbers anthony fauci well i can t give you numbers because it s really going to depend on the effectiveness of our response and our response i mean if you just leave the virus to its own devices it will go way up like we ve seen in italy that s not going to happen if we do what we re attempting to do and are doing and that s margaret brennan how do we get ahead of it anthony fauci well the the way you get ahead of it is that as i as i try to explain to people that i want people to assume that i m over or that we are overreacting because if it looks like you re overreacting you re probably doing the right thing because we know from china from south korea from italy that what the virus does it goes percolates along and then it takes off so what we ve got to do is a couple of things and we re doing it one is preventing new infections from coming in hence the travel restriction and the other is doing containment and mitigation within the country and it is correct that the infections are going to go up our job is to make sure it doesn t do the maximum peak and actually blunts within that blunt there will be many new infections we want to make sure we don t get to that really bad peak margaret brennan and americans lives have changed dramatically anthony fauci right margaret brennan in the week we just went through and they are going to continue to change people aren t supposed to be visiting nursing homes anthony fauci right margaret brennan people are being told to work from home schools are shutting down anthony fauci right margaret brennan give us the reality check though what is the mortality rate and what is the recovery rate anthony fauci right well the issue is if you look historically right now in the united states we re collecting data looks similar to what we ve seen in some other places if you look at the totality china dominated that previously the mortality was about three percent okay that s quite high for any kind of respiratory disease if you look at the other countries it s somewhat less if you count all the people who are getting infected and are not being counted because they re not coming to the attention of a health care provider then mortality will likely come down to somewhere around one percent or less but even that is serious and that s why we ve got to take this seriously because if you look at the typical seasonal flu it s 0 1 percent so this is a virus that transmits readily it s a virus that has a high degree of morbidity and mortality and that s the reason we ve got to do all of our forces now if you look at the recovery rate the recovery rate is minus what the mortality is so if if the mortality is one percent it s ninety nine percent recovery rate if the mortality is even less overwhelmingly more people recover from this than get into serious trouble there s no doubt about that but we want to make sure that we not only decrease the rate of infection we protect the vulnerable people who are within that percentage that have a much higher degree of morbidity and mortality margaret brennan the president indicated that he is looking at travel restrictions including anthony fauci right right margaret brennan within the country should americans get on a plane right now anthony fauci well it depends on what the reason for getting on the plane anything that s to my mind particularly if you are a person who s elderly or who falls within the category of underlying conditions you should really think twice before putting yourself in a situation where you re in a crowded place for an extended period of time margaret brennan you wouldn t get on a plane anthony fauci right now me for there are a number of reasons why i wouldn t get on a plane but if i were not doing the job that i m doing because of my age i would very seriously think about not doing any travel like that margaret brennan should americans get up and go to the office tomorrow anthony fauci well you know it depends on the situation that you re in to the extent possible teleworking should be done to the extent that you could do it i mean there are some jobs you can t telework let s be real but if you can you should you should avoid crowded places and then that s the things that we ve been talking about all along right now the cdc has a nice website you go in you talk about the different kinds of mitigations at different levels of involvement margaret brennan don t go to crowded places france is trying to close down restaurants anthony fauci right margaret brennan and cafes and bars anthony fauci exactly yeah margaret brennan should that happen here in the united states anthony fauci you know every single day we meet with the task force and we take a look at what s going on and you don t want to make a pronouncement that no one should ever go into a restaurant i mean i think that might be overkill right now but everything is on the table it may come to the situation where we strongly recommend right now myself personally i wouldn t go to a restaurant i just wouldn t because i don t want to be in a crowded place i have an important job to do i don t want to be in a situation where i m going to be all of a sudden self isolating for fourteen days margaret brennan for those americans who are now returning from europe how do we make sure that that doesn t allow for further spread anthony fauci yeah margaret brennan how do you screen them anthony fauci you know i think the issue is if you look at what s happening now for people who are coming back from like the european countries when they get back in here they re having en enhanced screening when they come back margaret brennan what does that mean taking their temperature anthony fauci well no actually just looking at them seeing if they re sick giving them a piece of paper here s a telephone number here s what you need to watch out for watch out for these symptoms and importantly fourteen days of self isolation if you come from one of those countries that are on that list margaret brennan period anthony fauci period you come back fourteen days of voluntary self isolation margaret brennan now the federal government could invoke authorities to do things like quarantine anthony fauci right margaret brennan for places that are hotspots like new rochelle anthony fauci right margaret brennan like seattle anthony fauci right margaret brennan would you like to see that anthony fauci well it depends on the individual circumstance the problem margaret with my making a pronouncement what should be done you ve got to look at what the situation is at the local level i mean for example in new york city in in new rochelle it s a very difficult situation up there so governor cuomo made some important decisions which in my mind looking at what he did were the right decision margaret brennan the american college of surgeons has told hospitals that they need to prepare to cancel particularly elective surgeries anthony fauci right right margaret brennan that implies that hospitals are about to get overwhelmed anthony fauci right yeah margaret brennan do we have the hospital capacity to deal with what is coming anthony fauci right margaret brennan and if we don t what is the plan anthony fauci okay margaret brennan is it to use military hospitals anthony fauci well well first of all again you ve got to look at what the the bracket is of the possibility if in a worst case scenario and i don t want to scare people that you always got to consider there s a worst case scenario there s a best case scenario and there s something in the middle we re doing everything we can to not allow that worst case scenario to happen if it happens which i don t think it will because i i can see the effort that we re putting in margaret brennan you don t think hospitals will be overwhelmed anthony fauci no no i don t say that i say it s possible that they could be but when you say that people get frightened but concentrate on what you can do to not make that happen but if in fact there s a scenario that s very severe it is conceivable that will happen and that s the reason why you have things like strategic national stockpile for for ventilators and things like that margaret brennan there s concern about shortages of key supplies like that ventilators anthony fauci we we margaret brennan cotton swabs anthony fauci margaret we would be unrealistic if we were not concerned that that possibility exists what we need to do is to margaret brennan but can you reassure the public that there is planning for those eventualities anthony fauci there is absolutely margaret brennan i know you re saying it s the worst case anthony fauci planning there s absolute hundred percent take that to the bank there s planning to address that but we would be unrealistic to not pay attention to the possibility that it could happen margaret brennan so millions of children across this country are looking at the possibility of not being able to go to school for at least a few weeks anthony fauci right margaret brennan possibly longer anthony fauci right margaret brennan their parents are going to try to figure out what to do with them anthony fauci right right margaret brennan can they take them to playgrounds is that safe anthony fauci well you know it depends if you have a bunch of kids in the playground i don t think it s a good idea to congregate anybody anywhere to the extent that you margaret brennan of any age period anthony fauci yes of course yes margaret brennan because there is that perception that if you re younger anthony fauci no margaret brennan you re not as anthony fauci well margaret brennan at risk anthony fauci yes indeed but if a if a young individual a child gets infected they may do perfectly well from a physical standpoint but they may bring it home to a person who is susceptible so we can t discount the the issue of children need also to follow certain of these rules margaret brennan so if i were standing next to someone who was later diagnosed with the coronavirus anthony fauci right margaret brennan what do i do do i have to wait until i m exhibiting symptoms actually ill anthony fauci yeah margaret brennan before i can get a test anthony fauci no right now if you feel if you are in a high risk situation and remember just being in the room you know six feet apart or whatever from someone margaret brennan sitting having dinner anthony fauci yeah margaret brennan shaking hands anthony fauci well see dinner is different it depends if you re having dinner for multiple hours with someone who has symptoms and finds out that that person is sick that puts you in a higher risk that s something that you really need to essentially hunker down get a physician call them up get instructions of what to do if you walk into a room and you find out three days later that somebody in that room was infected and was asymptomatic when they were infected your risk is very low very low margaret brennan and in the circumstance i need that test anthony fauci right margaret brennan when will it be available i know you ve made the point it s not just shipping them out it s getting them operational anthony fauci exactly margaret brennan how long before that happens anthony fauci you know i would hope based on what we ve heard from the ceos of the companies that are now getting involved that they re going to be getting those tests out there in an easy way not only to be out there but to actually get them quite soon they re talking within a several days to a week to start to see it rev up margaret brennan so that means testing within several days or a week anthony fauci right but that doesn t mean you re going to be maximum because nothing goes from zero to maximum so if the companies are going to get involved the laboratory groups that do this for a living when they get involved it s going to go like this so that you re going to start seeing tests more and more available until pretty soon they re going to be quite available but in the next day or so you re going to find people are going to say you know i wanted to get a test margaret brennan yeah anthony fauci and i couldn t get it that s going to happen but the future as opposed to looking back the future is going to be like this as opposed to the inhibitions we ve seen before margaret brennan several days or a week anthony fauci you know again margaret brennan that s your timeframe anthony fauci the problem with the pinning down to days margaret brennan right anthony fauci it s going to be gotcha if you don t have it margaret brennan well no we we we hear from a lot of viewers on twitter and elsewhere saying they are concerned about being able to get this anthony fauci and and they should be concerned but what we can say that now that we have the private sector involved we re going to see an entirely different scene than we ve seen the weeks previously for sure margaret brennan doctor fauci thank you for your time anthony fauci good to be with you margaret brennan and we will be back in a moment with doctor scott gottlieb stay with us announcements margaret brennan and we re back now with former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb good to see you here back for another week scott gottlieb md former fda commissioner scottgottliebmd thanks margaret brennan and you ve been telling us sort of what to prepare for next and i want to dive into some of that with you you heard doctor fauci say they re coming but they re not really here yet in terms of kits and availability to actually go and have it processed if you need a test what s the timeline scott gottlieb well i think we re going to see a dramatic increase in diagnostic capability this week so i think by the end of the week tests are going to be readily available they were they approved tests on what we call high throughput systems meaning systems that can run literally tens of thousands of tests a day inside academic labs or the large clinical labs like labcorp and quest once those facilities have those systems online they re going to be able to process an awful lot of tests and they ll have them online at some point this week so by friday i think tests testing is going to be pretty ubiquitous margaret brennan now hospitals are trying to plan for the future here how are they positioned are there enough medical supplies scott gottlieb not if we have a wuhan style outbreak in a major city or multiple cities which is my concern that we can have outbreaks of that proportion in multiple u s cities if you look at wuhan at the peak margaret brennan a wuhan style scott gottlieb a wuhan margaret brennan so you re saying the numbers that we are seeing and have seen in china scott gottlieb right in in a major u s city remember wuhan was the size of new york city at the peak of that epidemic they hospitalized about twenty thousand people ten thousand were in serious or critical condition and two thousand were intubated to give you a basis of comparison new york state the entire state has fifty thousand hospital beds and about three thousand critical care beds and about twenty thousand of those beds are in new york city so if we have a wuhan style outbreak in new york city that s going to overwhelm the system so they need to be building surge capacity right now in anticipation of that possibility now there s ways to avert it but that s the risk that we face right now margaret brennan tens of thousands scott gottlieb we ll certain we ll hit we ll certainly hit tens of thousands of cases in the u s hopefully we won t hit hundreds of thousands of cases but right now if you look at some of the good research out of the hutch by trevor bedford and others they re they re saying that there s probably ten to forty thousand cases right now distributed across the u s i think the risk that we have in the u s is we re a much more mobile population china was able to confine their out their epidemic largely to wuhan the risk here is that we have multiple cities that are seeded right now and so we ll have multiple wuhans that s the bad case scenario margaret brennan multiple wuhans is an incredible thing to say the pentagon came out and put travel restrictions on u s troops traveling domestically they can do something like that scott gottlieb right margaret brennan do you expect to see other government agencies and should americans be expected to essentially be on lockdown scott gottlieb look there there s no question that the steps we re taking right now or is changing the course of this epidemic we re already impacting this but i think we need to do much more and so think steps like banning government employees from nonessential travel or state employees that will have an additional impact we need to be doing all of these things leaning very hard into this the best case scenario is we look back a month from now and we say to ourselves well we overreacted you want to be in a position and doctor fauci made this point as well you want to be in a position to say we we we overreacted it wasn t as bad as we thought it was going to be but this is a once in a generation pathogen we have never seen anything like this before in modern times this is going to this is going to be historic right now margaret brennan so should cities like seattle and new rochelle that are hot spots be on lockdown scott gottlieb i don t think we can quarantine a u s city and lock it down and deny people their liberty in this country i think what we can do is slow economic activity to a point where people have no place to go if you close the theaters and you close the restaurants you close large gatherings you tell people not to have dinner parties you tell businesses to have nonessential workers telework people stay home there s no place to go i think that s the solution in the united states not to not to put a city on lockdown i don t think we re going to get there we might i hope not margaret brennan is a is what new york state doing a model for the rest of the country scott gottlieb i think andrew cuomo has been leading very far ahead i think he s been very aggressive in doing a good job i m concerned that the city hasn t closed public schools private schools are closed public schools are not margaret brennan yeah scott gottlieb and you do start to worry that people s ability to protect themselves is going to break along socioeconomic lines where lower income americans will not have the same opportunities that middle wage and higher wage earners will because they can telework they send their kids to private school they re in suburban districts that closed margaret brennan right scott gottlieb that s got to be a concern margaret brennan and we will talk about that ahead with with larry kudlow and others but i want to take a quick break and come back on the health risks more conversation with doctor scott gottlieb and some of your questions answered ahead stay with us announcements margaret brennan for more information on what you can do to stay safe during the coronavirus crisis please go to our website facethenation com or check with the cdc announcements margaret brennan coming up more on the health risks of coronavirus plus a look at its impact on the economy stay with us announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we are back now with more from the former head of the fda doctor scott gottlieb and then we will take a look at the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis as lives across this country have changed in the course of this week doctor we were talking about hospitals being basically able to help people if they get the virus or anything else are they going to be overwhelmed we are starting to see things like pictures of tents set up outside of hospitals is that something other hospitals should be doing either isolating or changing triage or is this about simply not having enough beds scott gottlieb well hospitals have emergency protocols and they re implementing those right now and that s very prudent trying to build facilities to offload some of their capacity from the hospital on to other sites so that ers don t get overrun we have about a million hospital beds in this country about a hundred thousand are critical care beds fifty thousand of those are medical intensive care unit beds at any one time most of those icu beds are filled and hospitals are about seventy eight seventy percent occupied so we don t have a lot of excess capacity we also don t have a lot of capacity with excess respirators there is about sixty thousand full featured respirators in the country about eighty nine hundred in stockpile so if we do have multiple epidemics in multiple large u s cities the system will become overwhelmed i think we can handle a a wuhan in one major u s city and pulse resources into that what i worry about again is multiple cities having that kind of an outbreak margaret brennan because if you don t have enough ventilators or other equipment doctors have to start making choices about who gets what scott gottlieb unfortunately there s about margaret brennan how do you do that scott gottlieb there s about a hundred thousand other ventilators that aren t full featured ventilators but could be used in a pinch and so what we need to do is try to free up capacity right now and that s what you see hospitals doing and that s what they re doing with these tents and these surge facilities they need to start discharging patients where they can not doing elective procedures so they re not bringing in patients these are hard economic decisions for the hospitals but this is absolutely what they have to be doing and we have time to do it we we do have three or four weeks if we re going to be on that trajectory that china was on to build that surge capacity right now china did just about everything wrong leading into their lockdown and they still were able to get control of their their epidemic there we do have an opportunity now but every day counts every day matters margaret brennan is the white house listening to you the president mentioned you by name this week scott gottlieb look i ve had i ve been fortunate to have the opportunity to talk to officials in the white house all through this some some of the calls that i was making to and the conversations i was having go back to january they ve been on top of this i mean they have been concerned about this i ve been talking to white house staff margaret brennan mm hm scott gottlieb and the staff has been concerned about this and so i m going to continue to try to provide whatever help i can margaret brennan all right doctor gottlieb thank you scott gottlieb thanks a lot margaret brennan good to have you with us once again and we re going to turn now to the director of the white house national economic council larry kudlow good to have you here larry kudlow national economic council director larry kudlow thank you margaret margaret brennan american lives changed dramatically there is an economic impact to all of this people are worried about paychecks and the like larry kudlow mm hm margaret brennan i want to ask you specifically about the bill that the house has passed that would provide paid leave and other assurances when do you expect the senate to vote and for the president to actually sign it into law larry kudlow well it would be a big help it may not be a perfect bill but it gets done essentially what we wanted to get done take care of individuals people on hourly wages families kids home if your spouse is home a lot of people may have to stay home in the weeks ahead we want them to get paid and margaret brennan is the senate already scheduling a vote and will it be on the president s desk within days larry kudlow this this well i think the senate is going to work on it tomorrow i i hate to predict that legislative calendar but i think there is an urgency to this something we ve pushed from the very beginning you know again it s about it s about helping families and middle income and blue collar type folks they should not be penalized financially and we don t want to force them to go outdoors when they should be indoors so i i think this would be a big plus and yes i think the senate will get it done pretty rapidly margaret brennan okay some big corporations already have paid leave policies larry kudlow yes margaret brennan but this bill doesn t apply to larry kudlow small medium businesses margaret brennan small medium larry kudlow this is really impacting margaret brennan if you have five hundred employees and above you re not impacted by this bill why how do you guarantee that the people who fall into these categories will still be able to take leave go home and put food on their table larry kudlow fall margaret brennan and afford to do what the government is telling them to do larry kudlow fall into which categories margaret the lower category margaret brennan well you have if you re fifty employees or less you can have a hardship exemption larry kudlow that s correct margaret brennan if you re five hundred or more employees this doesn t larry kudlow you qualify for if you re five hundred or less margaret brennan if you re in that middle range you re impacted larry kudlow you qualify margaret brennan if you re above that you re not required larry kudlow and that includes self that includes self employed people also it s very important well look the last word on that we don t know yet i mean if larger companies get into trouble we will be looking at the possibilities using the full powers of the federal government which are quite substantial during an emergency declaration like this we will be look to helping any individuals who might get left behind or might have a danger of getting left behind you know in this bill free testing i think is a very big thing and i also think the food stamp additions particularly if kids have to come home because the schools are closed down so we will we have lots of ways and means to make sure nobody falls through the cracks here margaret brennan the president speaking to grocers today i saw on the schedule if you go into a lot of grocery stores there are empty shelves right now what is the supply line like can you guarantee people that they will be able to stay home and feed themselves larry kudlow well i m going to say yes knowing there may be some exceptions to this i ve now i ve read about some situations where this is a difficulty but most of our supply lines are working pretty well in the domestic united states if i may make a point i mean there s a huge economic challenge here do not get me wrong a huge economic challenge on the other hand most of america is still working there was a good story in the journal yesterday about this factories are not shutting down across the country at least not yet margaret brennan yet larry kudlow the employment story which may become more tenuous in the weeks ahead i understand that nonetheless a lot of ceos i talked to they are doing everything they can i i ve just talked to somebody a ceo of a big car company not to lay off anybody so i margaret brennan do you have projections on possible layoffs what is the white house preparing for larry kudlow i m not going to put numbers out this morning i would just say margaret brennan you have one larry kudlow we re we re looking at everything right now margaret brennan mm hm larry kudlow as best we can you know so much of this because of the unusual nature of this virus so much of this is new it s very hard to model stuff margaret brennan yeah larry kudlow you don t have much experience with we re going to my view we go day by day fact by fact report by report phone call by phone call but i do want to make this point across the board in order to assist i call it fiscal assistance in order to assist individuals and families and small business we ve put on the board four hundred billion dollars already margaret brennan mm hm larry kudlow and that includes the paid family leave that you re talking about before margaret brennan what about larry kudlow it also includes small business assistance margaret brennan yeah larry kudlow very large significant sum it also includes deferred tax payments with no interest penalties margaret brennan what about the travel related industries larry kudlow well it all margaret brennan are you looking at a bailout larry kudlow but let me also but let margaret brennan for airlines like loan guarantees larry kudlow before i get to the bailout i also want to mention some other important areas here president is going to by executive order i reckon we will defer the interest on student loans margaret brennan right larry kudlow for the rest of the year also because of the mishmash between saudi arabia and russia we want to put our energy people out of business they never will we are purchasing margaret brennan purchasing for the larry kudlow seventy five million barrels from the strategic margaret brennan right larry kudlow petroleum reserve margaret brennan but you said i just want to clarify you did use the word bailout larry kudlow no i did not margaret brennan what is well what is it that you were preparing to do for the travel related industries is it loan guarantees can airlines plan on that larry kudlow it could be look we re talking to the airlines treasury secretary mnuchin is deeply involved we talk every day margaret brennan yeah larry kudlow we re going to go up to the hill this week we will have a number of new proposals with respect to the airlines margaret brennan right larry kudlow we ve got issues on cruise ships we ve got issues on the whole leisure story but i i just feel look this is a story that will be very challenging in the short run margaret brennan yes larry kudlow but margaret this is not a story of years this is a story of weeks and months margaret brennan okay larry kudlow we come in strong economies by all accounts margaret brennan yes larry kudlow and i think by the end of this year we will be back to a strong economy but we re taking these fiscal assistance measures just to make sure and please margaret brennan yes larry kudlow i don t want to leave out the president strongly supports the payroll tax holiday margaret brennan yeah which is not his bill larry kudlow which would be enormous benefit margaret brennan but we ll talk okay larry kudlow to the middle class and blue collar workers margaret brennan well we ll have to see larry kudlow it would be an enormous benefit margaret brennan well we ll look for you to put that to congress it s not in the current bill we have to leave it there larry kudlow thank you margaret brennan when we come back the ceo of bank of america brian moynihan will join us announcements margaret brennan and we re back with the head of america s second largest bank bank of america s ceo brian moynihan good to have you here brian moynihan bank of america ceo great to be here margaret margaret brennan you run one of the biggest banks in the country you met with the president this week this has been a swift change in americans lives are we on the brink of a financial crisis brian moynihan well i think let s step back and think about what we have here number one this is a health care crisis and a humanitarian crisis and we can t forget that we have to take care of people and handle that first and by the way that s the answer to the large larger question and i think i d think about three things this is a war we re in a war to contain this virus the interesting thing is everybody has the same common enemy across the whole world so the question of how we do that as employers as private sector public sector everybody is key and so we have to drive that the second thing going to your question of banking industry is big bank industry comes in with capital liquidity that is so different than the last crisis the question is we have to use it wisely and we have to manage the companies well in times of stress and this is a quick change from what was going on as a solidly growing economy and the third thing is as a company we have to take care of our own so our teammates and our customers and clients we have to continue to provide the services we do we have forty three hundred branches open every day margaret brennan mm hm brian moynihan the markets are trading every day the wires have trillions of dollars moving through the system every day are going on but at the same time as employer we have to take precautions to meet our part of the war which is to get our teammates socially distanced to go back to central operations to make sure we work so it s those three key points and you can t forget that this is a health care crisis and we care that the economic issues will go away quickly margaret brennan right and and it s that uncertainty of not knowing when and where that is is weighing on everyone so much you said your bank is going to treat this like a natural disaster brian moynihan right yeah margaret brennan and help consumers what specifically does that mean if someone can t make their mortgage payment or pay their credit card what are you doing for them brian moynihan they call the number on the card and they say i am affected by the disease and i can t make my payment we defer the payment we ve done it we did it for the employee government employees that were shut down we ve done it for every natural disaster but we re not alone as a company the whole industry does this this is what we do and then with small businesses and others when they have you know issues in terms of cash flow they come to us and we help work through it so the idea is you don t want people to be penalized much like the bill in congress is trying to take care if you think about you re in a war and you have to deal with the people who are going to fall out of that and and the question is the people in congress as larry was just talking about they are trying to deal with that more systematically health care or health leave benefits unemployment benefits we re trying to deal with the other side which is i can t make my payment call us and we ll make it right margaret brennan and then the consumers are the engine of this economy brian moynihan right margaret brennan people are scared brian moynihan right margaret brennan not just looking at the market when they re told to go home brian moynihan right margaret brennan when they can t get food at the grocery store when they don t know when their next paycheck is coming how is it that you can be confident the economy is going to come back when we don t know when this is going to end we don t know how many jobs are going to be lost brian moynihan well there s there s some interesting things to think about one is what s really going on as of today so we see the data of consumer spending and on things and goods and services and we watch it every day and the aggregate number year over year is still up ten percent plus margaret brennan now brian moynihan today margaret brennan but people are just now brian moynihan right margaret brennan social distancing brian moynihan and so so what you re going to say is what happens next margaret brennan yeah brian moynihan and obviously travel the cruise industry movies things like that are are you know changing dramatically restaurants you re hearing the reports of that so that so that s all in front of us but right now it hasn t had the impact people think and so that s the question but if you asked yourself what are we trying to do you heard doctor fauci talk about sort of flattening the curve margaret brennan right brian moynihan it s the inverse of that for us as bank the banking system we re trying to make sure the trough stays as high as it can that it doesn t go down as much that margaret brennan but other banks are are predicting a recession that s two quarters brian moynihan right margaret brennan of decline brian moynihan right and i think you know our our experts who are the leading research firm in the world you know it s basically a 1 2 for the u s now that will be a tale of four quarters that are different margaret brennan economic growth brian moynihan you ll have growth in the first quarter then it ll go down you know maybe flat but although they ve gone from 1 7 percent to 1 2 percent so they ve come down but they re saying it recovers given the health care crisis being solved but one and one of the things you re going to look at is what s happening in china we talk to our clients in china and we had teammates in china in hong kong and places like that this was an issue in january of social distancing and separation eighty percent of employees are back to work at our margaret brennan the factories are are we see propaganda photos you re saying it s real china is going back to work brian moynihan i m i m talking about clients of ours who employ have factories in china are back sixty seventy eighty percent which is good news because the supply chain of goods is there the question then is will the demand margaret brennan right brian moynihan in the united states and europe be there and that s coming down to solving the health care crisis margaret brennan and and that all matters because that s the second largest economy in the world it is huge to how our our global economy functions the federal reserve the the president said yesterday he wants more action to be taken brian moynihan right margaret brennan what do you expect to happen what needs to happen to stabilize the markets because they are brian moynihan so i think margaret brennan under such pressure brian moynihan they need to provide provide liquidity and and continuous liquidity and so in these situations that s what dries up people back up and and and the liquidity dries up so the treasury markets again they ve started they ve done major things there other government guarantee markets the money funds potentially commercial paper there s a lot of things that are on the table the central banks around the world have to both provide monetary help accommodation help rates they drop rates fifty basis points the package of things to do are all known the question is doing it at the appropriate time and and more importantly all the central banks around the world are to have the same impact meanwhile we got to solve the healthcare crisis margaret brennan very very quickly what larry kudlow was talking about was providing help potentially to the airlines does that need to happen does there need to be some version of a bailout brian moynihan i i think in a time of you know a time of war against this virus if industries are affected in a way that are strategic industries we ought to help them margaret brennan okay thank you very much brian moynihan yeah margaret brennan we ll be right back with a look at how the coronavirus is impacting the travel industry announcements margaret brennan one of many industries taking a hit from the coronavirus crisis is the travel industry so there is no better reporter to turn to than our own kris van cleave he is cbs news transportation correspondent good morning to you kris kris van cleave cbs news transportation correspondent krisvancleave good morning margaret brennan overnight we saw these incredible photos of lines people packed into airports in chicago there were some in texas these are the kind of crowds we re supposed to be avoiding what what is behind this why is this happening kris van cleave this was at the the customs area at at least two airports chicago and dallas and this i think came from the the rush of people coming back from europe you know the the new travel restrictions have gone into effect there the u k restrictions are going to go into effect monday night and some of this had to do we re hearing with a new form that a new health form that people have to fill out that was rushed into use and didn t necessarily get on the airplanes that you normally would fill out the form as you re margaret brennan right kris van cleave inbound that didn t happen plus you have the health screening which is basically a temperature check but that adds about a minute a person so between the form that no one knew about that they got handed at some point and this temperature check it caused substantial backups it raises questions about the staffing and what was customs and border protection prepared for the number of people that are going to be impacted when you put in a travel restriction to most of europe margaret brennan and when it comes to those travel restrictions the president from the podium at the white house yesterday said they were looking at domestic travel restrictions what are they looking at kris van cleave i think right now it s probably a case by case situation this has escalated very quickly on thursday the president was asked about domestic travel restrictions and he said hasn t been something we talked about but wouldn t rule it out sort of referencing hot spots like new rochelle and seattle by you know friday the the treasury secretary said he d fly to los angeles if he could and that it s safe to travel domestically saturday the president said he wouldn t travel domestically if he didn t have to and now they re talking about travel restrictions so would would it be something that probably gets phased in margaret brennan mm hm kris van cleave yes is it possible as this goes on and there are there are more outbreaks if that happens that you could see sort of a lockdown i think it s possible i don t think we re there yet i think they re still trying to figure out what is an appropriate response margaret brennan and this matters for the financial health of the travel industry which has a trickledown effect on whether people even keep their jobs i mean you your reporting this week had such incredible statements from the ceos of some of these firms british airways ceo said this is a crisis of global proportions like no one we have known this is after going through 9 11 kris van cleave every single airline executive i have talked to has said this appears to be worse than the impact that 9 11 had on their business you re seeing airlines with more cancellations than bookings for the next several weeks that s money going out the door and not coming in it s just not a sustainable be business model you ve delta talking about parking forty percent cutting forty percent of their capacity parking three hundred planes americans cut seventy five percent of its international flying they announced that overnight parking all of their wide body airplanes nearly all of them this is an unprecedented challenge for the airline industry and it it makes the business model likely unsustainable margaret brennan and you had bank of america s ceo said if they need help give it to them larry kudlow said they re talking about it what is it that the airlines are asking for is this like a bailout like we saw the auto industry or is this something different kris van cleave you know it has a lot of the same feel as we saw with the auto industry in 2008 where things just keep getting worse and i think what the conversation was on monday of last week and what it was by friday is evolving and and if domestic flight restrictions go into place that conversation is going to continue to change it s hard to see that there s not going to be some kind of a bailout if you want to see the number of airlines we have today in a year margaret brennan and that s just a difference of whether the government takes an ownership stake and then those companies repay it kris van cleave right margaret brennan or whether that s a loan guarantee or some kind of help with kris van cleave right margaret brennan you know kris van cleave and i think at this point that conversation is evolving and continuing to go on but the airlines are going to need help margaret brennan why are subways still open kris van cleave so cities view mass transit as critical as an essential service because it links people to jobs and services and if you were to cut it off you also tend to impact certain segments of your population lower income folks working class people who maybe don t have other options to get around so the belief is that that s important to keep that running we ve seen ridership numbers come down margaret brennan mm hm kris van cleave so in some ways fewer people riding makes it easier to spread out but they don t want to shut it down if they don t have to margaret brennan kris van cleave you will be busy as will all of us thank you very much for your time we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan the events in the last week have tested and touched every american and we have no idea when things will return to normal or even what that new normal will look like but as we found out here at cbs news challenging times do often bring us together begin vt margaret brennan life dramatically changed this week president donald trump i don t want people dying that s what i m all about representative nancy pelosi forget any physical contact greetings bow in an eastern eastern style margaret brennan as the rest of america began to learn what social distancing really means at least fifty seven thousand schools are closed affecting at least twenty five million students leaving working parents wondering how they ll manage it all and others asking if that daily commute is just too risky basketball soccer and hockey seasons were suspended tournaments marathons and baseball s opening day were also postponed or cancelled outright as crowds became something new to fear man it s kind of a weird circumstances right now margaret brennan disneyland and disney world shut down the lights went out on broadway and at carnegie hall the president has called for a national day of prayer but many churches are closed and wall street s unprecedented eleven year bull market run officially ended last week military exercises were also scaled back and protective measures taken to help those serving overseas those on the front lines at home the doctors nurses and first responders continued to show up and serve as did the journalists who need to keep the public informed that hit home for all of us at cbs this week our new york headquarters shut down after four of our colleagues tested positive for the virus leaving us all scrambling to get the news on by remote that meant it was all hands on deck in our network bureaus and at our stations around the country but especially here in our washington bureau which always punches above its weight but last week had to produce all cbs news broadcasts that happened with the strong assist of the scrappy face the nation team which has covered this mysterious virus for months journalists never should become the story but like many americans we re all finding ourselves in some extraordinary moments and those promise to continue end vt margaret brennan and i d like to say thank you to everyone at cbs for their work navigating the news during these tumultuous times we also wish our colleagues in new york a swift recovery for face the nation i m margaret brennan
