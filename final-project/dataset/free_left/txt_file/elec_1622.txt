 wichita as james thompson worked his way through a coffee shop the democratic candidate for congress said something that got people to look up from their laptops we ve got a lead right now really said marla flentje a republican who said she d voted for him in early balloting a trio of democrats walked over to meet thompson and tell him they d vote tuesday i hope you do because right now we re winning said thompson thompson was not supposed to win or even come close in this largely rural 4th district which picked donald trump for president by 27 points rep mike pompeo r vacated the seat to lead the cia and republicans expected to hold it easily but in the final days before tuesday s special election republicans reacted to weak polling and turnout data by rushing resources to southern kansas a gop super pac rolled out robo calls over the weekend from vice president pence and on monday from president trump in support of candidate ron estes ron estes needs your vote and needs it badly trump said on the call ron is going to be helping us big league on monday republicans also dispatched sen ted cruz tex for a fly in where he urged kansans to vote if you re fed up with the stagnation under the obama economy late monday the national house democratic campaign arm announced that it was calling 25 000 households to counter the gop influx readers of the liberal daily kos donated a total of 149 000 to thompson over the final weekend this the home town of koch industries is the last place the gop expected to have to undertake a rescue mission the kansas seat is one of the reddest of the five house seats vacated in the trump era four of them by republicans who joined the new administration if thompson ends up winning here the national democratic party will claim the victory as a portent of bad things to come for republicans in the 2018 midterms with trump in the white house democrats also have an opportunity in georgia s 6th district where jon ossoff is surging in the race to replace former congressman tom price r who is now health and human services secretary gop begins to fret about holding on to tom price s district in kansas thompson a civil rights lawyer who supported sen bernie sanders i vt in the 2016 presidential caucuses flew under the radar for weeks meanwhile estes the state treasurer got bogged down as his party staged an unsuccessful rebellion against deeply unpopular gov sam brownback r estes rarely mentions trump but he did reference fair trade at the cruz rally smoothing over an issue that divides kansans as the race has tightened republicans who are still favored to win tuesday have strained to make the election a referendum on liberalism brownback invisible on the trail didn t help matters by vetoing a bipartisan medicaid expansion bill last month his most favorable polling puts his job approval rating below 25percent even in the 4th district in november as republicans were scoring upsets around the country they lost three state house seats in the wichita area several more conservative republicans lost primaries to moderate candidates people here still like trump said thompson whose campaign signs identify him not as a democrat but as an army veteran it s not been a referendum on him it s a referendum on the failed republican leadership in the state people don t want these policies taken to the national level in wichita where turnout in early voting has been high brownback s name has the force of an epithet as she settled in for lunch at the anchor a downtown gastropub where thompson stopped to shake hands kayla marshall said she didn t vote in the 2016 election she would she said vote for thompson and to explain why she talked about teachers buying pencils with their own money because brownback had cut the education budget lynn jones who opened his door to thompson canvassers monday morning was quick to say he d voted for george w bush brownback he said was nothing like bush okay he was trying something new with his tax cuts but the experiment didn t work jones said when the laboratory explodes you probably ought to try a different formula thompson a first time candidate was generally ignored by both parties for most of the race when his campaign asked the state democratic party to fund a mailer it was turned down later investing just 3 000 in an interview last week democratic national committee chairman thomas perez said the national party would not be transferring any late money we can make progress in kansas perez said there are thousands of elections every year though can we invest in all of them that would require a major increase in funds thompson spoke before sanders at a february rally and has been endorsed by sanders s group our revolution according to recent fundraising reports estes has raised 459 000 to thompson s 292 000 outside groups which are pouring money into georgia ahead of the april 18 contest there have left kansas alone the democrats think so much of their candidate there that they ve spent zero dollars said corry bliss executive director of the republican allied congressional leadership fund we ll win the kansas election by double digits his group is now funding robo calls targeting local republicans who outnumber democrats but have been sluggish to turn out the national republican congressional committee has spent close to 100 000 multiplying estes s presence on the airwaves thompson s campaign reacted with delight to the robo calls viewing them as not just ineffective but as sign of his viability because he s getting so little attention no trackers from the other party were following him monday thompson talked freely with a voter concerned about abortion agreeing that society should do more to lower abortion rates he dismissed a last minute tv ad accusing him of favoring abortions for sex selection as representing his views to a ludicrous and false extreme his final tv spot featured him shooting an ar 15 as a narrator called him a fighter who grew up in poverty but the national rifle association was not on the air to contradict him what was on the air for estes was rote and telling of how republicans have struggled to find a pro trump rallying cry one of estes s first commercials featured him in waders joking that after eight years of obama america is weaker and the swamp is deeper than we thought as an alligator poked its head up for emphasis democrats haven t won here since the early 1990s then rep dan glickman d was swept out by a republican wave in 1994 glickman vastly outspent his opponent but the republicans made up for it with a grass roots surge of antiabortion activists in 2014 when bliss helped sen pat roberts r secure victory he got a similar late game boost from social conservatives those wins came when democrats controlled the white house on monday when more than 150 republican voters piled into the estes cruz rally some wore anti hillary clinton merchandise all cheered when cruz recalled how his lips curled into a smile when he saw a democratic colleague mourn clinton s defeat the cheering was quieter when cruz and estes described the stakes of the election they spoke generally about repealing the affordable care act though estes said he opposed the gop replacement bill that fizzled last month cruz talked up tax reform by staging a contrast unlike obamacare i m convinced we can get it done estes meanwhile packaged himself as an agent of common sense and disruption without mentioning the work he d done with brownback i m going to washington to change washington he said when i go to washington i want to get to a balanced budget the republican majority that estes would join does not have a balanced budget plan in interviews at the rally estes s voters said they were thrilled that neil m gorsuch had been confirmed to the supreme court but they had little else to say about congress asked what he thought of house speaker paul d ryan r wis john bernhardt who sported an early voting sticker on a red white and blue polo shirt answered with a grimace can i plead the fifth he said joyce wallace who got a plum position near the rally stage said she had no qualms about sending a trump ally to washington i m all for trump she said i think he s fulfilling his campaign promises not every republican at the event agreed cathy dowell who like wallace had caucused for cruz in 2016 worried that trump went back on a campaign pledge by attacking a syrian airfield i m a little worried about trump dowell said i know he s not a conservative and i think he s making a mistake in syria but the two republicans found something to agree on both would be happy if carl brewer the democrat who just finished two terms as mayor of
