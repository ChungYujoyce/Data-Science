advertisement supported by transcript sot ted cruz i m a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid fat and ugly vo donald trump wasn t there so ted cruz thought he d offer his best attempt at an impression sot cruz now that we ve gotten the donald trump portion out of the way vo most of the attacks on stage were aimed at another person who wasn t there hillary clinton chris christie tried to discredit her as commander in chief sot chris christie she put america s secrets at risk for her convenience hillary rodham clinton did that to our country she is not qualified to be president of the united states vo marco rubio faced sharp questions about his shifting position on immigration his rivals are likely to press the issue to discredit him with primary voters sot marco rubio when i m president we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it sot jeb bush you shouldn t cut and run you should stick with it and that s exactly what happened he cut and run and that s a tragedy vo but rubio tried to pick himself up with one of his sharpest attacks on a rival yet calling ted cruz a liar and giving a glimpse into what lies ahead in the race sot marco rubio this is the lie that ted s campaign is built on and rand touched upon it that he is the most conservative guy and everybody else is a rhino the truth is ted throughout this campaign you ve been willing to say or do anything in order to get votes by patrick healy and jonathan martin des moines the republican presidential candidates competed vigorously to fill the vacuum created by donald j trump s boycott of thursday night s debate with senator ted cruz of texas and senator marco rubio of florida trading ferocious attacks on immigration and taking fire from rivals seeking advantage in the iowa caucuses on monday mr cruz and mr rubio who are behind mr trump in the iowa polls and hoping for surprise finishes here were repeatedly confronted with pointed questions about their views and senate votes on providing citizenship or legal status to immigrants who are in the country illegally but it was mr cruz who was hit hardest on the issue as mr rubio teamed up with senator rand paul of kentucky to portray him as an opportunist everybody s for amnesty except for ted cruz mr paul said turning mr cruz s favorite shibboleth against him as he denounced the falseness that he said mr cruz perpetrated that s an authenticity problem mr rubio was even harsher as he tries to upset mr cruz here and finish in second place which could strengthen his position against mr trump in the feb 9 new hampshire primary this is the lie that ted s campaign is built on mr rubio said seizing on a brutal compilation of video clips that the fox news debate moderators had shown highlighting mr cruz s apparent shifts on immigration mr cruz struck back by getting nearly as personal with mr rubio i like marco he said unconvincingly he s very charming he s very smooth however mr cruz added when mr rubio came to the senate he backed off his hard line stance on immigration and supported an overhaul favored by the republican party s major donors because he thought it was politically advantageous if the debate began on a surreal note with the candidates poking fun at the absence of the field s leader mr trump it quickly turned conventional as the contenders tried to undercut one another in hopes of gaining favor with iowa voters but the added attention may not have been particularly helpful there was more time for mr cruz s image as a consistent conservative to come under relentless attack there was more time for mr rubio s past alliance with democrats on an immigration overhaul to come under scrutiny there was more time for former gov jeb bush of florida and gov john kasich of ohio to discuss policy in hopes of helping their chances in new hampshire but neither man had particularly electrifying moments gov chris christie of new jersey playing the washington outsider landed some deft attacks against hillary clinton earning applause for promising that he would never let her get within 10 miles of the white house mr paul who is so far behind in the polls that he did not qualify for the last prime time debate was aggressive and passionate as he made the case for his brand of libertarian politics explaining that he was opposed to abortion rights but would leave the issue to the states ben carson the retired neurosurgeon was almost as faded a presence as mr trump still the debate gave iowa voters a chance to see all seven men one last time before the caucuses with a good share of republicans still undecided or open to changing candidates the lack of scene stealing by mr trump who held his own rally across town could pay some dividends for the candidates here or in new hampshire where many of them are competing for second place after mr trump mr cruz who ascended in the republican race in part thanks to his effective debate performances found himself absorbing the fiercest attacks yet as he looked to regain lost ground in iowa while mr trump had often been a punching bag at past debates as moderates and rivals challenged his policy ideas mr cruz became the main target this time around facing skeptical questions from the moderators on immigration ethanol subsidies and his personal style his rivals were even more severe painting him as a holier than thou politician ted you worked for george w bush s campaign you helped design george w bush s immigration policies mr rubio said in a rhetorical torrent then when you got to the senate you did an interview with cbs news it wasn t even part of the video where you said on the issue of people that are here illegally we can reach a compromise yet mr rubio was also a frequent target over his past support for a comprehensive immigration overhaul mr bush whose allies have unleashed a multimillion dollar ad campaign attacking mr rubio over his support for the overhaul accused him of having cut and run because it wasn t popular among conservatives i guess mr rubio referring to a book on immigration that mr bush wrote and had just mentioned quickly returned fire that is the book where you changed your position on immigration he said noting that mr bush had moved from supporting a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to favoring only a path to legal status so did you mr bush responded so did you marco mr trump s absence was mentioned repeatedly with mr bush speaking out most forcefully against him mr trump s celebrity and pugnacity had turned previous debates into widely watched spectacles that frequently descended into shouting matches dueling insults and in mr trump s case frequent mockery of his rivals as listless flailing and even ugly megyn kelly the fox news talk show host whose participation on thursday night was mr trump s reason for skipping the event began the questioning by noting the elephant not in the room and lobbed a softball question to mr cruz about the missing mr trump it gave him a prime opportunity at the top of the debate when the most viewers were watching to speak directly to iowans with the caucuses nearly at hand he portrayed mr trump as an unserious insult artist not fit for high office i m a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid fat and ugly and ben you re a terrible surgeon mr cruz said recalling some of mr trump s gibes including his suggestion that ben carson a renowned neurosurgeon had been a mediocre physician now that we ve gotten the donald trump portion out of the way mr cruz continued before being interrupted by laughter and applause i want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of iowa the respect to show up yet mr bush mocked his republican rivals for trying to act tough against mr trump noting that he had been the first to wrangle with mr trump in last year s debates everyone else was in the witness protection program when i went after him mr bush said while poking fun at mr trump was a recurring theme of the night mrs clinton was a more serious target as the candidates tried to showcase themselves to iowans as her strongest foes mr rubio briskly dismissive of mr trump he s an entertaining guy pivoted to mrs clinton and warned that she would continue president obama s agenda as she has promised to do he noted that mrs clinton had even indicated this week that she would consider appointing mr obama to the supreme court hillary clinton cannot win this election mr rubio said mr christie who has not been shy about lashing his republican rivals at past debates also trained his fire on mrs clinton as he tried to project a positive message about republican leadership asked whether mr cruz and mr paul were qualified to be president in light of their support for curbs on the national security agency s surveillance practices mr christie quickly said he disagreed with their views and then moved on let me tell you what the country should really be worried about mr christie said before bringing up mrs clinton s email practices as secretary of state while the concerns and values of iowans were an ongoing motif at the iowa events center here with the debate coming four days before the caucuses several candidates who are far behind in the polls sought to look beyond the iowa vote mr bush brought up the needs of new hampshire voters mr kasich also hoping to appeal to viewers in new hampshire as much as in iowa argued that he would be the best steward of the nation s economy given his record of creating jobs and a budget surplus in his state and even trumpeted the new hampshire area newspaper endorsements he had won mr paul hoping for a surprise performance in iowa or new hampshire made some of the sharpest attacks against the republicans on the stage with him trying to appeal to both libertarian leaning republicans and the broader conservative primary electorate mr paul called a past suggestion from mr rubio that the country might have to consider shutting down mosques a huge mistake but also attacked mr rubio for his support of an immigration overhaul in 2013 he made a deal with chuck schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments mr paul said referring to a democratic senator from new york and noting that he had tried to file an amendment to the bill marco can t have it both ways you can t be in favor of defending us from radical islam if you re not supporting border security mr rubio said that mr paul s amendment had been wrongheaded and added when i am the president of the united states if we don t know who you are and why you re trying to come to the united states you re not going to get in after hovering in single digits for months in iowa mr rubio has moved into the teens in recent surveys and his assertiveness on stage thursday combined with the absence of mr trump and the assault on mr cruz may have offered an much needed lift to his campaign here conscious of the iowa evangelical voters still up for grabs mr rubio twice spoke emphatically about his christianity saying his faith would play a central role were he to be president and in another instance referring to jesus christ who came down to earth and died for our sins advertisement
