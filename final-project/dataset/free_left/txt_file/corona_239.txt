the government s dithering and lack of transparency will cost many thousands of lives mon 23 mar 2020 14 27gmt last modified on mon 23 mar 2020 19 52gmt those of us who have been tracking the novel coronavirus since december can easily identify its key milestones there was mid january when human to human transmission of coronavirus was confirmed then later that month hubei province hit 500 cases the unprecedented lockdown extended to almost 60 million people and the lancet published a study showing that a third of patients require admission to intensive care and 29 get so bad that they need ventilation by the end of february a sobering who china joint mission press conference illustrated the massive policy response in china and on 29 february the uk saw its first case of local transmission in the uk we have had nine weeks to listen learn and prepare we have had nine weeks to run outbreak simulations set up supply chains to ensure sufficient personal protective equipment ppe and ventilators and bring about the availability of rapid cheap tests we have had nine weeks to establish algorithms to support contact tracing and start mass awareness campaigns not only about hand washing but about the risks that the virus would pose to social and economic activity if not taken seriously by all countries such as senegal were doing this in january the uk s head start in managing the outbreak continued as our confirmed case count remained lower than our neighbours however on 12 march boris johnson announced that all minor testing and contact tracing would stop and passive self isolation would be introduced for those with symptoms all part of a herd immunity strategy supposedly endorsed by the best science after a backlash from scientists the government clarified that it was not explicitly pursuing herd immunity but would be taking measures at the right time guided by the evidence all according to a plan which it did not share with the public on 17 march imperial college released a study noting that it had revised the model the government had been using and stating that suppressing the virus was in fact the best way to avoid a vast number of people dying the earlier model did not include the icu data shared in the lancet on 24 january instead it was similar but much later information from italy that changed their recommendation so at the end of week the uk government did a 180 degree turn reversing what it had said only days previously it made the decision to take the same measures other countries had in order to delay the spread of virus closing schools except for the children of key workers closing pubs and other gathering places asking households to self isolate for 14 days and focusing on scaling up testing to 25 000 tests per day over the next month however capacity issues and lost time mean that testing will take time to ramp up ppe supply chains are strained and all while patient numbers continue to increase as we follow italy s path the twists and turns described above have created a climate where the public do not trust that the government is responding in their best interests many cannot say what the government s strategy is or are confused about how serious coronavirus is for their health communication during a crisis must be clear transparent open and responsive the confusion over herd immunity for example has made people reasonably think that the government wants everyone to get the virus to protect the economy that it is not taking more decisive action because this is not a serious threat or that the government does not know what it is doing none of these are the whole story but such perceptions are certainly not helpful in a crisis we had a choice early on in the uk s trajectory to go down the south korean path of mass testing isolating carriers of the virus 50 of whom are asymptomatic tracing all contacts to ensure they isolate as well and at the same time taking soft measures to delay the spread instead we watched and waited and whether it was academic navel gazing political infighting a sense of british exceptionalism or a deliberate choice to minimise economic disruption over saving lives we have ended up in a position where we are now closer to the italy scenario than anticipated and are faced with taking more and more drastic measures perhaps the delay was due to fears about a second wave of the virus next winter but why not then work on buying time for the nhs to prepare for health staff to get ppe to make testing available to boost beds and equipment to trial antiviral treatments or get us closer to the point that one of the vaccine candidates being investigated might actually work why not use the time to learn more about reinfection by the virus about immune response which seems to affect who needs icu care and about who recovers spontaneously to understand where this virus came from whether it is indeed seasonal and how it could mutate why give in at such an early stage unless the goal is to get through this outbreak quickly so that whoever is left can help get the economy back to normal it is still not clear who exactly is advising the government who sits on the scientific advisory group for emergencies and what factors the prime minister and his colleagues are taking into account in his decision making where does all this leave us now given that we lost the window of containment several weeks ago the only feasible path forward seems to be to put in stringent physical distancing measures to delay the spread of the virus but these alone will not be enough we also need to backtrack and start doing the mass testing tracing and isolating that are integral to breaking chains of transmission putting these measures in place does not mean that we will immediately solve nhs capacity challenges or that we will not see a massive rise in patients dying they will however help to slow down the spread we must also continue to push for the protection of the health workforce and frontline responders who are exposed to high viral loads and we must race to make up for the time lost during two months of passivity prof devi sridhar is chair of global public health
