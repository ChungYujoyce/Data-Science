hillary clinton s running mate tim kaine defended her from accusations of dishonesty on sunday after her inconsistent answers about emails her rival donald trump and new polls raised the question of trustworthiness in the minds of voters clinton s use of a private email server while secretary of state has continued to haunt her even after an fbi investigation cleared her of criminal wrongdoing in an interview recorded on friday her vice presidential pick was asked to account for the false or inconsistent statements she has made on the subject over the last year kaine did not directly address clinton s struggle to restore trust with voters arguing instead on nbc s meet the press that she did a great job telling her story in a speech at the democratic national convention last week which meant folks are getting reintroduced to that story in a positive way clinton has however also stumbled in the wake of the convention last week she told the fox news host chris wallace that the fbi director james comey said my answers about email practices were truthful and what i ve said is consistent with what i have told the american people comey said there was no evidence clinton lied to the fbi and declined to judge her various remarks to the public last month he excoriated her for her extremely careless email practices and highlighted facts that contradicted her claims though he found no evidence of intentional or criminal wrongdoing on friday clinton said she may have short circuited in her statements about comey and the emails on nbc kaine defended her saying her answer may have emerged from a misunderstanding i thought her answers in that setting were truthful kaine said adding that wallace might have been asking her a different question the bottom line is this kaine continued she made a mistake and she said over and over again i made a mistake and i ve learned from it and i m going to fix it and i apologize for it kaine also promised greater access to clinton who had gone more than 240 days without a press conference before an event on friday at which she took a handful of questions from pre selected journalists i know that this is something that she s learned from and we re going to be real transparent absolutely kaine said at a saturday night rally in new hampshire trump gleefully seized on clinton s short circuited remark i think the people of this country don t want somebody that s going to short circuit up here trump said pointing to his head not as your president not as your president he added she s a totally unhinged person she s unbalanced all you have to do is watch her see her read about her clinton s campaign has made trump s temperament a central issue highlighting erratic actions including a sudden trip to promote a golf course in scotland during the uk s brexit referendum and angry outbursts toward women minorities and most recently the family of a muslim american army captain killed in iraq this week barack obama who has endorsed clinton called trump unfit and woefully unprepared to be president trump tried to flip the argument on to clinton on saturday labelling her a dangerous liar the queen of corruption and hillary rotten clinton a pun on her maiden name rodham my whole life has been about winning i win he said she can t win she s not a winner she can t win the perception of untrustworthiness has shadowed clinton through three decades on the national stage even in 1996 while she was first lady the new yorker explored the question of why she inspired vitriol and distrust on sunday a new abc washington post poll found that nearly two in three voters believe clinton is too willing to bend the rules six in 10 believe she is not honest but clinton has managed to sway some americans at least relative to trump both candidates are historically disliked and a majority still have an unfavorable opinion of clinton but the proportion has shrunk to 52 in the latest poll with a move to 46 favorable a major gain since the democratic convention in contrast 61 of people polled had an unfavorable opinion of trump versus 36 who liked him about 60 of respondents said clinton had the qualifications and temperament to be president while almost 66 said trump lacked the temperament or a good understanding of international affairs the new poll also saw 49 of respondents find clinton

not invaded ukraine two years after it had said his daughter should find another company if sexually harassed and briefly claimed to have seen a nonexistent video of cash shipments to iran republicans have tried to tie clinton s foreign policy to that money 400m owed to pre revolutionary iran for a failed arms deal in the 1970s describing it as ransom for hostages who were freed in january around the time of delivery and sanctions relief for a nuclear arms deal clinton began tentative nuclear talks with iran but the money dispute predated her and was concluded by her successor as secretary of state john kerry who also oversaw the hostage release on sunday trump surrogates pursued the party line kaine a member of the senate foreign relations committee deflected such criticism saying we don t negotiate for hostages he added the settlement of a claim with iran the payment of a portion of that settlement hostages coming home thank god this was briefed to congress and the american public
