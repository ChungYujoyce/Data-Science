 joe biden makes a last ditch plea for support in dubuque on the day of the iowa caucuses in 2008 he did not fare well mark hirsch ap photo 2020 elections the former veep failed to crack 1 percent in the 2008 caucuses but that result didn t accurately capture the depth of his support by natasha korecki 05 01 2019 05 05 am edt as iowa caucus night neared in 2008 joe biden was outspent outstaffed and up against tough competition the historic candidacies of barack obama and hillary clinton and 2004 democratic vice presidential nominee john edwards but biden had consistently attracted solid crowds to his events in the run up an impressive number of state legislators had endorsed him his team felt they had held their own and entered the evening feeling cautiously optimistic advertisement then he got creamed biden ended up capturing less than one percent of state delegate equivalents 0 9 percent precisely he dropped out of the race later that evening statistically it was an ignominious early state defeat for the veteran senator and one that might not seem to bode well for his third try at the white house in 2020 except biden has led in nearly every iowa poll to date since last summer one reason for the dramatic turnabout is the stature gained from his two terms as barack obama s loyal vice president but as biden makes his first official visit to the state this week as a candidate his iowa supporters have another explanation for his seeming turn of fortune his 2008 caucus results were deeply misleading and failed to reflect his actual appeal on the ground sign up

a result of historic forces beyond his control and they point to caucus rules that they say distorted biden s true popularity at the time the narrative that he got one percent of the vote is not an accurate narrative said kevin mccarthy a former iowa house majority leader who served as biden s 2008 state chair supporters like mccarthy concede that given the timing and the field biden was up against he never stood a chance of winning obama vying to be the first african american president suddenly caught fire animating a younger electorate as he packed larger and larger venues clinton the former first lady and new york senator was running to be first woman president edwards john kerry s 2004 running mate attracted wide audiences with a message about economic disparity keep in mind that in 2008 you had john edwards running for the second time and he had nearly defeated john kerry you had barack obama and hillary clinton making these historic runs said ann selzer president of selzer and co who conducts the highly respected iowa poll so you had a field that was a little bit of a different ball of wax then all three had robust operations making tv buys and deploying staffers statewide to move supporters to caucuses biden s support meanwhile was static drawing mainly from white voters and in older catholic pockets of the state there were these mega three campaigns that blotted out the sun in terms of polling messaging and organization mccarthy said even so no one predicted the turnout tidal wave that hit on caucus night i had a projection of how many people would be at my caucus location and i thought it would be 120 in the end 400 people showed up i just thought forget it throw everything out the window said jim mowrer who headed veterans outreach in iowa for biden s 2008 campaign and helped in field organizing we were operating under the traditional playbook where we thought we were looking at the normal numbers things just changed the playbook was rewritten that scene played out again and again across the state where an unprecedented number of democrats flooded the caucuses largely propelled by obama s historic candidacy biden was respected people liked him he generated crowds and enthusiasm it just wasn t his time says randy black chair of the iowa wing ding democratic fundraising dinner people were so captivated by obama according to caucus rules if a candidate doesn t have 15 percent support of caucusgoers in an individual precinct that candidate is deemed non viable and the candidate s supporters then move to a different candidate who meets the viability threshold merle gaber of dubuque listens to a presentation by democratic presidential hopeful joe biden during a rally on the day of iowa s 2008 caucuses mark hirsch ap photo both mccarthy and mowrer said in their precincts biden had respectable levels of support but fell just short of meeting the 15 percent marker it was that phenomenon repeated across the state that ultimately led to his 0 9 percent delegate count they said we were one single human being short of being viable in my precinct says mccarthy who lives outside of des moines if you don t get 15 percent you get zero biden s position is decidedly different this year he s no longer a veteran small state senator but rather obama s loyal partner for two terms and all the metrics are flipped he just pulled off the best first day fundraising haul of any candidate in the crowded 2020 field and holds front runner status with leads in most national and state polls if you take all of his poll numbers from 2008 and combine them together that would not add up to the single number he has in our latest poll selzer said perhaps more important biden scores high in a key indicator of campaign sustainability selzer calls it the goldilocks question surveys of iowa democrats show that 70 percent believe biden holds a balanced view on the issues by far the highest score in the crowded democratic field the next closest candidate was elizabeth warren with 54 percent believing her stances on issues were just right he looks to be a good fit for likely caucus goers selzer said today biden is positioning himself as a moderate in a party that has moved too far to the left while working to portray himself as the only democrat who can beat president donald trump 2020 by michael grunwald sue dvorsky former chair of the iowa democratic party noted that in both biden s previous runs in 1988 and 2008 he was attempting to launch a national campaign as a senator from delaware today he s up against a slew of competitors who are similarly situated he was coming from this very small pond in which he was a very big fish dvorsky said now this man was the vice president of the united states for eight years he has an international set of experiences that he didn t have in either one of those races the fundamental difference today is that we are in a time when there is clearly a hunger to a return to some kind of normalcy even if biden s circumstances have changed trump is already signaling that he doesn t intend to let the former vice president forget about his 2008 caucus flop i think he ran three times and he never had more than one percent so we call him one percent joe trump said mockingly at a nevada rally in late 2018 and then remember what happened obama came along and took him off the trash heap and made him vice president but he never had more than one percent trump s tough talk in singling out biden only underscores the former vice president s messaging biden s the target because trump sees him as his biggest threat lots has changed since 1988 and since 2007 said david yepsen the legendary des moines register political reporter who covered both of those campaigns biden s now the grownup in the room at a time when democrats are craving some experience and maturity in the white house that s just going to set him apart missing out
