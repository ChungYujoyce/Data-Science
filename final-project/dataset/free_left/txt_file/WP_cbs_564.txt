watch cbsn live by rachel layne updated on may 29 2019 5 53 pm moneywatch as trade tensions between washington and beijing intensify china s state mediaon wednesday suggested it may play a new card restricting u s access to rare earths the chemical elements that are widely used in everything from mobile phones and other consumer electronics to wind turbines mri machines and military hardware china dominates global exports of the 17 elements that constitute rare earths accounting for almost 80 percent of america s imports last year according to the u s geological survey usgs and bank of america merrill lynch analysts other countries that supply rare earths to the u s include australia estonia france and japan here s a look at what rare earths are and why they could play an important role in the ongoing trade war between the u s and china the 17 elements defined as rare earths aren t as rare as their moniker suggests gold copper and platinum are more abundant and easier to mine for instance by contrast rare earths are ubiquitous in modern life and their use is likely to spread as technology advances cerium used in compounds for catalytic converters in automobiles is the most abundant and is more common in the earth s crust than copper or lead according to the usgs the glass industry is the largest consumer of rare earths which are used for polishing additives for color and other special optical properties one rare earth element lanthanum makes up as much as 50 percent of digital camera lenses including cell phone cameras rare earths don t get their name because of their scarcity rather they got that label in the 18th and 19th centuries because of their relative imperviousness to heat compared with other mined materials rare earths are found in such low concentrations around the world that they are harder to extract and refine and not always found in commercially mineable quantities as a result a handful of countries account for the bulk of extraction including china australia japan and malaysia china which has roughly 40 percent of the global reserves of rare earths accounted for almost 80 percent of u s imports of the elements last year according to bank of america merrill lynch one reason china is the global leader it s been pulling rare earths out of the ground for a long time the country spent a century perfecting the refining method for extracting and refining rare earths in large enough quantities to keep costs manageable chinese president xi jinping last week visited the country s biggest rare earths producer in an appearance that was broadcast on chinese national television the visit followed a u s crackdown on technology giant huawei by president donald trump s administration earlier this month and was interpreted by experts as a signal that the chinese government is weighing restrictions on rare earth exports china will try to meet global rare earths demand as long as they are used for legitimate purposes stated a commentary in the xinhua news agency a mouthpiece for beijing but later it added that if necessary china has plenty of cards to play hu xijin editor in chief of china s global times newspaper was blunter saying in a tweeton tuesday that the country is seriously considering restricting rare exports to the u s jj kinahan chief marketing strategist at td ameritrade said china s threat to use rare earths as a weapon against the u s is worrisome what it shows to me is that there is a little bit of a worsening relationship here he said they went pretty deep in the bag to throw out something that would hurt despite china s dominance in producing rare earths implementing a total ban on exports to the u s might not be in its favor for one cutting off supplies of a critical material used in products around the world could undermine beijing s efforts in recent years to portray itself as a responsible actor on the global stage and make it harder to bash the trump administration for its hardball stance on trade meanwhile a chinese ban risks inviting other countries to rev up rare earths production the last u s source for rare earths the mountain pass quarry in california closedin 2015 the u s could shift demand for some metals to places like malaysia or re start domestic processing although that could prove difficult because of regulations designed toprevent widespread environmental damage if china does clamp down they are likely to be selective in which elements to target because the country wants to be seen as playing by world trade organization rules said arthur kroeber head of research at gavekal economics and editor in chief of china economic quarterly on a call with clients this week china s goal is to paint the u s as a lawless actor that disrupts economic growth he said i really think that they have a problem in that none of the options are very good and all of them involve very significant costs to china kroeber said so if they re going to do any of them they have to do them extremely carefully and i think quite selectively still it wouldn t be the first time china tried to use its dominance in rare earths as part of a trade conflict china blocked some rare earth exports to japan after a maritime dispute in 2010 that led some countries to search for alternatives and a protest by japan with the wto which ruled in 2014 that the restrictions on rare earth exports were illegal it also led some companies to cut their use of rare earths and to find alternatives for things like the element dysprosium used in electric car magnets the bank of america analysts noted the associated press contributed to this report first published on may 29 2019 3 59 pm 2019 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the
