china s expanding global influence directly competes with america s military economic and technological might and the country is considered by many to be the u s top national security threat in an interview with cbs this morning wednesday former acting cia director and cbs news contributor michael morell offered another daunting prediction if the united states went to war with china in east asia we could possibly lose china has gained on us more rapidly than any other country has in history militarily morell said if we had to fight a war against them today in east asia we would struggle to win and could possibly even lose that war that s a big problem morell said given the threat china poses to the u s if you re gonna make a list of the national security threats and challenges facing the united states it s long but there s only one at the top and there s a big gap between that one and everything else and that s china he said that threat comes in part from a shift in the economic relationship between the nations they pose an economic challenge to us morell said we used to be economic compliments they were labor rich we were capital rich those two things fit together now we re competitors there s also a competition for geopolitical influence he said and we are now losing that one that s especially true in hong kong he added the chinese told hong kong in 1997 that we re one nation but two different systems you can keep your political system morell said and since 1997 those political freedoms have eroded year by year by year china didn t keep its promise and it s driving hong kong towards the authoritarianism we have in beijing he added that he thinks that process is inevitable china sees east asia as a place that they should dominate morell said they dominated it once historically they lost it they think it s their right they want it back morell also highlighted china s theft of intellectual property from the u s which he said costs billions and billions of dollars a year they re one of the few countries in the world that do this he added the united states of america has never used its intelligence capabilities to steal intellectual property for competitive advantage morell lauded president trump for being probably the first president who has publicly called out china as a major problem but while the president gets credit for that he said he hasn t been effective yet in changing the situation and he is not looking at the bigger strategic picture morell added he is focused on only a narrow slice of it morell acknowledged that it is a tough question there s nobody in the national security realm who s figured this out yet a lot of people are working on it but nobody s said here s the solution but he did identify two must haves for moving forward the u s taking the lead in the challenge against china and building a coalition of allies for support i think the biggest strategic mistake this administration has made has been pulling out of the trans pacific partnership because that s exactly what the trans pacific partnership was a group of nations saying to china if you want to play in the world in a big way you need to play by the rules not by your own rules another strategic mistake according to morell is fighting with china through tariffs i would rather fight these economic issues in the world trade organization rather than through tariffs morell said because tariffs at the end of the day undermine american consumers and i don t think that s a good thing so i d rather fight it out in the structures that we ve already built rather than in a very nasty public way watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
