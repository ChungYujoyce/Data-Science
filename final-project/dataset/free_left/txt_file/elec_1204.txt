 white house the vice president is picking at the damaged front runner and testing a progressive message by edward isaac dovere 09 10 2015 05 25 am edt getty joe biden s jumping right into hillary clinton s sandbox and new york democrats are eager to see him play biden s thursday swing through new york home of the clinton campaign headquarters and the state she once represented is perhaps the most aggressive stop of the coy pre campaign he s running advertisement he starts the day talking about women s issues with a rape kit backlog event where he ll appear with attorney general loretta lynch whose justice department is probing clinton s email server use then use an appearance with stephen colbert to showcase his unscripted style something many see as his strongest asset in a potential challenge to clinton between he ll hit her where it really hurts her standing with liberal democrats joined by new york gov andrew cuomo as eager a clinton supporter as there is among elected officials biden will headline an event to support a new 15 minimum wage for fast food workers a major cause among progressives the vice president s office insists these are all official events and that they d be doing them regardless of his exploration of a presidential run but fewer and fewer people see this as anything but the rumblings of a biden campaign much to the excitement of many of her old constituents he might even put some of them in contention if anyone can present a strong robust and lasting challenge to hillary clinton it s the vice president said rep hakeem jeffries a brooklyn democrat who said he s leaning toward endorsing the front runner but first wants to see whether biden will run and jeffries is not alone neal kwatra a new york based consultant with deep ties to labor and progressives throughout the city said biden s long history with labor could make a difference for voters in a city with the highest union membership in the state plus progressives are feeling flushed again about president barack obama and that would help biden if he s going to be making the case for a third obama term he s got a lot of stuff that can be appealing to progressives kwatra said many of the highest profile new york democrats have already endorsed clinton including cuomo sens chuck schumer and kirsten gillibrand state attorney general eric schneiderman and state comptroller tom dinapoli but in the roiling world of new york politics where nearly every race is determined in democratic primaries and where nearly every politician brims with a self importance that makes them believe their support matters as much as that of any major national figure the backing of traditional power brokers only counts for so much new york city mayor bill de blasio s still holding out putting his relationship with the clintons and other major democratic forces on the line in the hopes of using the progressive seal of approval he s asserted to turn himself into more of a national figure his spokesperson said he wasn t available for comment about biden and clinton and progressives gustavo rivera a state senator who represents the bronx and consider himself progressive said he wouldn t use that term to describe clinton though he has endorsed her do i agree with her on every position no rivera said but he added when you take her as a whole candidate i think she is an incredibly strong candidate that said rivera acknowledged that he s one of the people backing clinton who wants biden to get in he d force her to pay more attention to the issues they care about and drive her further to the left than sen bernie sanders i vt has so far clinton s campaign declined comment on biden coming to town or her standing with new york progressives 2016 by edward isaac dovere and there s no chance of a clinton run in she ll be in columbus ohio and milwaukee on thursday campaigning and raising money meanwhile biden will expand on the economic fairness message he started testing monday in pittsburgh standing in front of a union crowd and attacking trust fund babies and coming close to john edwards 2008 two americas line the tax code s not fair it s simply not fair biden said then there used to be one america dan morris a consultant for new york groups involved with the fight for 15 and other progressive causes said biden s record to date isn t reassuring he s only been for a 12 federal minimum wage the anti crime legislation he wrote in the 1990s has disproportionately hit african americans and there s little evidence that he d resonate with black latino and female voters who d benefit most from raising the minimum wage among other core progressive causes but morris said a biden campaign would be a good thing for democrats it would force clinton to grapple with many progressive issues that she hasn t before and it would lower the threshold for victory making sanders more of a factor by marc caputo a biden candidacy is both an opportunity and an obstacle for clinton morris said as for biden s trying to make himself the progressive in the 2016 race morris isn t convinced he s more of a question mark morris said than an exclamation point
