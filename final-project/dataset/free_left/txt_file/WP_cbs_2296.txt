for mandate and implantation of at home voting in november issues that matter to your health as health coverage remains a heated topic of debate in the 2020 election cycle cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall wicesays state regulators could see insurance rates rise when companies make their filings for 2021 in the coming months amid the coronavirus pandemic according to an analysis by the kaiser family foundation private insurers pay as much as 20 000 for comparable pneumonia hospitalizations and more than 80 000 for patients who require a ventilator during their stay with uncertainty around the coronvirus impact on next year s costs the kff said it could lead insurers to overprice plans particularly in the affordable care act marketplace meanwhile while hospitalization costs for medicare and medicaid patients would be lower on average because those programs typically pay lower rates than private insurance the kff analysis also found medicare spending could rise because older adults are at a higher risk of coronavirus related hospitalizations the new costs could potentially be offset by fewer non urgent procedures and hospital visits but an increase in medicare spending could still mean higher premiums and cost sharing in the future state medicaid programs will likely also experience increased costs from both covid 19 treatment as well
