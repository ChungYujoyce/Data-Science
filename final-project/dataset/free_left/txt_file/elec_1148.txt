advertisement supported by transcript na by amy chozick and patrick healy milwaukee hillary clinton scrambling to recover from her double digit defeat in the new hampshire primary repeatedly challenged the trillion dollar policy plans of bernie sanders at their presidential debate on thursday night and portrayed him as a big talker who needed to level with voters about the difficulty of accomplishing his agenda foreign affairs also took on unusual prominence as mrs clinton sought to underscore her experience and mr sanders excoriated her judgment on libya and iraq as well as her previous praise of former secretary of state henry a kissinger but mrs clinton was frequently on the offensive as well seizing an opportunity to talk about leaders she admired and turning it against mr sanders by bashing his past criticism of president obama a remark that mr sanders called a low blow with tensions between the two democrats becoming increasingly obvious the debate was full of new lines of attack from mrs clinton who faces pressure to puncture mr sanders s growing popularity before the next nominating contests in nevada and south carolina she is wagering that even voters excited by mr sanders s inspiring message will reconsider their support when they learn of his lack of experience in foreign policy and his vague explanations for how he will pay for his expansive government programs mrs clinton pounced from the start after mr sanders demurred in saying how much his proposals would increase the size of the federal government she stepped in and said that by economists estimates the government would grow 40 percent under mr sanders a generation gap is emerging over the importance of electing a woman to the white house we invite you to share your opinion the times may follow up with you and rather than bashing him as she did at their debate last thursday she appeared to try to get under his skin by implying that he had not been transparent about the cost of his programs such as his proposed expansion of government health care this is not about math this is about people s lives and we should level with the american people mrs clinton said she then repeated a jab at mr sanders s reputation as a truth teller that she would return to during the debate you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing and based on every analysis that i can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal the numbers don t add up i don t know what economists secretary clinton is talking to mr sanders responded insisting that families could come out with savings that is absolutely inaccurate mr sanders who has exuded confidence since his new hampshire win raising more than 6 million in the 24 hours after the polls closed there was more pointed and even belittling of mrs clinton at times he said bluntly that some of her attacks were wrongheaded and he was dismissive after mrs clinton talked about her plans to increase federal spending by about 100 billion a year after mrs clinton responded to a question by saying once i m in the white house he began his next answer by saying secretary clinton you re not in the white house yet drawing some murmurs and jeers the candidates had one of their sharpest exchanges of the race when the moderators of the debate asked them what is typically a softball question which leaders they admire mr sanders named franklin d roosevelt and winston churchill while mrs clinton named nelson mandela and then used the question to berate her opponent for his complaints about mr obama over the years the kind of criticism that we ve heard from senator sanders about our president i expect from republicans she said i do not expect from someone running for the democratic nomination the new york times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign mr sanders called the comment a low blow and said that while he disagreed with mr obama on occasion in the senate the president was a friend one of us ran against barack obama he fired back at mrs clinton i was not that candidate the pbs debate the sixth of the democratic race but only the second to include just mrs clinton and mr sanders came at a moment of rising concern among democrats about the strength of mrs clinton s candidacy and the electability of mr sanders if he becomes the democratic nominee mrs clinton fared poorly among key parts of the democratic electorate in the new hampshire primary losing a majority of the women who voted as well as young people who expressed mistrust of her on the campaign trail as for mr sanders some democrats believe he is too liberal and his proposed tax increases too toxic to win a general election mrs clinton s pointed critique of mr sanders was part of a new calculation by her campaign that the debate format in which mrs clinton excels was the best way to draw attention to mr sanders s record and his minimal expertise in foreign policy the role of commander in chief became another flash point on thursday when mr sanders argued that his judgment was better than mrs clinton s and more important than her experience he criticized mrs clinton s 2002 vote to authorize the war in iraq her push to oust col muammar el qaddafi in libya and her consulting of mr kissinger i m proud to say that henry kissinger is not my friend mr sanders said saying mr kissinger had enabled genocide in cambodia under pol pot mrs clinton turned the exchange back on mr sanders noting that he had sidestepped requests to identify his own foreign policy advisers well it ain t henry kissinger mr sanders snapped back mr sanders also criticized mrs clinton for telling cnn in 2014 that the children who entered the united states from central america should be sent back a statement that made some young latinos question her commitment to their communities transcript na i made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately mrs clinton said but she said the united states also had to send a message to parents not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers these are children mr sanders said i don t think we use them to send a message i think we welcome them into this country mrs clinton sensing her rival s relative inexperience on world affairs offered a somewhat belittling reply at one point in the exchange it s a big complicated world out there she said mr sanders also put mrs clinton on the defensive over donations to the super pac supporting her saying that its 25 million haul included 15 million with some connection to wall street mrs clinton countered that she was not involved with the super pac but noted that mr obama had also taken money from wall street she rejected the idea that if you take donations from wall street you can t be independent the people aren t dumb mr sanders replied why in god s name does wall street make huge campaign contributions i guess just for the fun of it they want to throw money around he added to applause mrs clinton responded by repeating her plans to impose new regulations on hedge funds and other firms yet mr sanders hit back again invoking theodore roosevelt to argue that big banks had become too predatory against average americans and needed to be broken up throughout the debate mr sanders who is seeking to appeal to racially diverse voters in nevada and south carolina demonstrated little capacity to broaden his political message in compelling new directions beyond overhauling the economy campaign finance and health care while he noted that his medicare for all program would save the average middle class family 5 000 a year he did not present his vision in any new way or frame the issue in personal terms for average voters his advisers said during the debate that his focus was on introducing himself to new voters around the country who may be intrigued by his candidacy after days of news coverage about his huge win in new hampshire at the same time several of mrs clinton s answers reflected an urgent political imperative to maintain and energize her deep support among minority voters in order to offset mr sanders s popularity with young people liberals and some working class white voters in her opening statement mrs clinton denounced discrimination against african americans in employment education housing and the criminal justice system but she was matched by mr sanders as he railed against a legal system in which young people have criminal records because of petty drug offenses while wall street executives escaped culpability for the great recession when asked whether he was potentially blocking a milestone for women by challenging mrs clinton mr sanders who would be the first jewish president if elected said i think a sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment as well he also asserted that race relations would be better under a sanders administration than they had been under mr obama the nation s first black president absolutely mr sanders said what we will do is say instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires we are going to create millions of jobs for low income kids so they re not hanging out on street corners advertisement
