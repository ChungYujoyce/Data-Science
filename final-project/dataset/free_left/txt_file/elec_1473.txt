advertisement supported by emma roller by emma roller political conventions used to mean something important specifically they used to mean here is where we will pick our party s nominee but today s political conventions are largely dog and pony shows to make the delegates feel special give the news media something to talk about and benefit the host city all while promoting the party s agenda party conventions perhaps not in terms of their importance but the sheer logistical headaches they impose are the political equivalent of the olympics and what with delegates alternates reporters party officials and other attendees cleveland is expecting roughly 50 000 people to show up for the republican national convention next week convention planners had less time than anticipated to get quicken loans arena ready thanks to the cleveland cavaliers run in the n b a finals in a normal election year a party s convention would attract a high profile slate of speakers including up and comers a young state senator named barack obama made his national debut at the 2004 democratic convention for example but this is not a normal election year and a stunning number of republican leaders have decided not to attend the convention when politico talked to more than 50 republican leaders recently only a few said they d be open to speaking at the convention even ohio s two most prominent republicans gov john kasich and senator rob portman have been hesitant to commit to an event where donald j trump will be offically selected as their party s nominee however at least three of mr trump s republican primary opponents will be speaking at the convention senator ted cruz of texas gov scott walker of wisconsin and former gov mike huckabee of arkansas in lieu of party luminaries mr trump proposed a winner s evening of sports stars the former indiana basketball coach bobby knight and boxing promoter don king are both expected to make appearances while the nascar owner brian france former chicago bears coach mike ditka and new england patriots quarterback tom brady all turned down mr trump s invitation apart from the question of star power there is the question of money conventions like the olympics can be a branding boost for the host cities which is why they lobby so hard to win bids despite talk that the polarizing campaign would make it difficult to fund raise for the convention this year david gilbert the president and chief executive of the nonpartisan cleveland 2016 host committee said his group has raised more than 90 percent of the 64 million it was given the task of getting far more than any other convention in history we ve always said this was not about red or blue it was about green he said but this year outside groups have encouraged companies to drop their sponsorship of the republican convention because of mr trump s offensive statements about minorities one of those groups was color of change pac which helped persuade coca cola to drop almost all of its funding for both conventions companies usually pledge the same amount of money to both conventions and withdrawing from one means withdrawing from both other big companies followed suit refusing to pledge money or resources to this year s convention apple hewlett packard coca cola h r block wells fargo u p s motorola jpmorgan chase ford and walgreens still mr gilbert said the effect of companies dropping their sponsorship of the convention has been relatively small meanwhile four tech and communications giants have maintained their support for the republican convention at t microsoft google and facebook in a statement microsoft said that this year s conventions may have some more dramatic moments than in some prior years making it all the more important for the company to help record accurate vote counts and share that information with the public using microsoft technology even companies that decided to stay in the convention tried to distance themselves from the presumptive republican nominee according to rashad robinson a spokesman for color of change pac he recalled talking to an at t representative who stressed the company s support for immigration reform in contrast to mr trump s plan to deport the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the united states if any one of their employees came to work and said the things that donald trump says in front of the media on the campaign trail they d be fired he said the last three standard bearers for the republican party aren t even going to the convention so why do these companies feel that they need to the answer in many cases is buying influence with both political parties but past convention planners say corporate sponsorship is all about supporting the democratic process to me they re supporting democracy and the democratic process said chip dipaula a baltimore businessman who helped organize the republican conventions in 1996 and 2000 it s an important celebration of american ideals that are over and above any particular nominee mr robinson disagreed those companies are on the wrong side of history he said history doesn t give credit to people who have empathy history gives credit to people who stand up and make decisions that are sometimes tough mr gilbert the cleveland convention president said this year presents certainly a more politically charged convention cycle than we ve had in a long time but added that he felt the city is well prepared one of the problems with this is it s just like running any big event he said you can prepare you can plan but until the event is over it s not over managing a convention can make even the most absurd logistical problems seem important maria cino who has been attending republican conventions since 1984 and was president and chief executive of the 2008 convention in st paul recalled a particular problem in 1996 the republicans met in san diego that year and the convention center s ceilings were just 25 feet high making a traditional balloon drop unfeasible instead engineers shot balloons into the air from cannons ms cino said it was a bit of a nightmare i m not sure that we would do that again she said aside from logistical difficulties there is the question of keeping convention attendees safe that poses big security problems in a normal election year let alone one with a nominee as polarizing as mr trump a white nationalist group which organized a protest in sacramento that turned bloody last month has said it will be on the scene in cleveland julian zelizer a professor of history at princeton said scenes from this year s republican convention could mirror the protests and riots seen outside the 1968 democratic convention in chicago that year the democratic nominee hubert humphrey tried to maintain some semblance of order mr trump in contrast isn t too big on sober discourse there s an element of trump that would just thrive if there was chaos going on outside the convention mr zelizer said it s part of his overall rambunctious style of politics the more controversy the more confrontation the more it works to his advantage the more people cover it mr dipaula said the foremost concern for any convention planner is pulling off the week smoothly and safely the best feeling was when the convention was over and everybody was safe mr dipaula said it was a huge feeling of relief does he think people s concerns about the safety at the republican convention have been overblown he paused i ll tell you when it s over he said advertisement
