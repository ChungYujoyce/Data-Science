other public spaces even getting to her patients is a risk she has to take two busses to get to her first patient of the day a disabled elderly man by 9 a m she said the the market frankford line commonly known as the el is no longer safe she used to spend time commuting on the train but another caregiver in her union was jumped on the train on wednesday williams said she has not received hazard pay for the conditions the only thing i do know is that they tell us if we feel like we re not safe then they re arranging for unemployment or we can use our pto paid time off time williams said williams has received some ppe hand sanitizer and gloves from one agency she said the agency and the union said they will be providing masks soon philadelphia has the most coronavirus cases in pennsylvania the state department of health told cbs news that home health workers are among those we are considering as we distribute ppe balancing their needs with the needs of our healthcare workers and frontline responders we are working to distribute ppe to our hospitals long term care facilities clinics home health agencies etc through identified areas of need and also through individual issues as they arise they said but when cbs news asked for clarification on how much ppe is being supplied to each sector the department said we are not providing that level of data at this time for now williams is paying for protection herself she said surgical type masks are around 2 each and that n95 masks are roughly 6 each ideally she would have three fresh masks a day one for each patient and one for commuting matthew yarnell president of union seiu healthcare pa said he talks to home care workers every day who are working without proper protection and putting their lives at risk to care for the most vulnerable people in this pandemic the trump administration s slow response to the ppe shortage is an insult to every one of them yarnell said home care workers should not be forced to reuse ppe or go without a federal response is required in a situation like this that s why it is so important that the president use the defense production act to repurpose manufacturing in the us to produce n95 masks gowns gloves and other ppe david causby president ceo of kindred at home the country s largest home health hospice and community care provider told cbs news that when the coronavirus outbreak began they were able to get maybe hundreds of gowns and n95 masks from a few states the company has roughly 80 offices in more than 40 states they serve roughly 120 000 patients who do not currently have coronavirus we have not received anything from fema or the federal government we continue to be in contact with them daily trying to explain the critical nature of the home care situation and the need for home care organizations to be moved up the ladder of supplies but we ve not had any success or not received anything to date the agency is now down to about 30 of their original supply inventory causby said and getting more ppe for their home health care workers has become more of a struggle we have worked with vendors to try to obtain supplies from china he said but we just found out this week that all of our orders that had been placed and then confirmed that the chinese government has seized those supplies i m not sure what they re going to do with those supplies but the orders we had coming in have now been canceled the cdc has recommended face masks be prioritized during activities where prolonged face to face or close contact with a potentially infectious patient is unavoidable williams has this prolonged contact with each of her patients but she can only afford one clean mask a day while living on her 11 an hour wage according to home health care non profit organization phi international thousands of home health care workers are in a similar situation in a phi report published in 2020 they found 15 of workers who are predominantly people of color live in poverty and 44 live in low income households more than 40 rely on public assistance a6 the direct care sector needs more ppe funding to strengthen compensation paid leave childcare for workers and support for existing training programs to help agencies staff up quickly learn covid19 and to launch targeted recruitment campaigns careduringcovid pic twitter com rxvls5ojkd i m afraid for myself we are out here we re going to people s homes and they re trusting us to be ok we deserve gowns and proper masks williams said we deserve proper gear just like the rest of the health care workers out there marina sapountzis 51 helps care for a 96 year old woman five days a week in queens new york who relies on a catheter she said she is lucky that the family of her patient provides ppe as most families do not pay for those supplies there are more than 51 800 cases of coronavirus cases in new york city lots of home health aides float from home to home place to place job to job daily and do not have one steady patient but pick up work where they are needed she told cbs news this puts them at a higher risk for viral and bacterial transmission and leaves them more vulnerable to a much higher rate of exposure compared to having just one patient to care for since new york governor andrew cuomo announced an executive order called matilda s law which requires vulnerable populations to stay home and limits who can visit them adequate home health care and protection has become more essential some patients they have heart problems a stroke breathing problems oxygen tanks sapountzis said they can range in age they could be in an accident even for home health aides like herself who only have one patient a day sapountzis said having ppe is important because of the various other sources of contact along with her two school age children and three adult children living at home sapountzis husband a cab driver has diabetes the new york department of health would not tell cbs news how they allocate ppe among health care sectors the department remains committed to getting ppe to home care agencies in need however we urge all healthcare entities to conserve supplies they said we are communicating that message regularly to healthcare providers jason kidushim executive vice president of operations foralliance homecare an agency with approximately 400 home health care workers currently caring for patients in new york told cbs news their agency has also been unable to get supplies from the state or federal governments and the price to get new supplies kidushim said has dramatically increased he said the cost of a box of gloves has increased about 500 and that three ply masks which used to cost roughly 20 cents each are now going for 4 or 5 they ve seen some n95 masks marketed for 12 each to cope with the pandemic alliance has instructed workers to take a change of clothes to patients homes and have provided them with disinfectant to wipe down surfaces as well as three ply masks there s not really enough supplies for us to last through the remainder of the crisis kidushim said we ve seen a huge uptick of potential clients that specifically either have tested positive or are recovering from coronavirus or have been turned away from the hospital system because their symptoms are not severe enough he added that small regional players like alliance will be needed to relieve a lot this pressure and constraint for the hospitals i think it s overlooked how many seniors are living in isolation and how many probably get routine visits from family members that can t do that right now he said at the end of the day we have a responsibility to protect our employees some of these home health aide workers are risking themselves just as much as anyone else in penobscot county maine where there are 16 confirmed cases of coronavirus home health care worker athena diligenti has not been provided masks or any other ppe by her agency those who are 65 or older make up more than 20 of the population according to the u s census bureau and diligenti cares for a woman in a retirement community in orono there is gloves at the retirement home where my client lives at but otherwise i ve just been taking my own precautions and being really aggressive about washing my hands she said i wash my hands about 20 times a day the cdc has recommended that nursing homes have face masks gowns gloves and eye protection available for those providing care they have also suggested implementing sick leave policies that are non punitive flexible and consistent with public health policies that allow ill health care professionals to stay home coronavirus is now the second leading cause of death in the u s and the third leading cause of death in assisted living facilities but diligenti 24 said her agency has never provided her with ppe or paid sick leave the only additional precautions that have been made are by the retirement community itself they limited social gatherings and visitors but there are still multiple health care professionals in and out of the patients rooms throughout the week after the coronavirus outbreak at life care center of kirkland in washington the cdc determined that once covid 19 has been introduced into a long term care facility it has the potential to result in high attack rates among residents staff members and visitors and that public health measures for health care personnel is critical but williams said her biggest concern right now is officials have not taken this situation to heart and have forgotten about the health care workers who take care of people outside of the hospital it s a lot to think about i don t just walk out this door like i m just going to work she said it s ugly it s really ugly and it shouldn t have to be this way editor s note since the publication of this story athena diligenti told cbs news that her home health care agency has provided her with about a dozen surgical masks first published on april 3 2020 7 11 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved be in the know get the latest breaking news delivered straight to your inbox copyright
