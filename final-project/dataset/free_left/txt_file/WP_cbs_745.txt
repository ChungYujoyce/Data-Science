on this face the nation broadcast moderated by margaret brennan clickhereto browse full transcripts of face the nation margaret brennan it s sunday september 29th i m margaret brennan in the nation s capital and this is face the nation the whistleblower case explodes in washington after president trump releases details of his call to the ukrainian president in which he asks for a favor ukrainian help with investigating former vice president joe biden and his son hunter for possible corruption the call happened soon after the president ordered a hold on an aid package to ukraine nancy pelosi it is not role of the president to shake down foreign leaders for his own political purpose withholding taxpayer money to do so margaret brennan that was enough for house speaker nancy pelosi after months of resisting pleas from democrats to open an impeachment inquiry she changed course the next bombshell came when a whistleblower complaint filed by a cia analyst assigned to the white house was handed over to congress it revealed blockbuster allegations about the president s efforts to urge the ukrainians to meddle in the upcoming election and cited attorney general william barr and the president s attorney rudy giuliani as the points of contact also stunning details of a possible administration cover up as the whistleblower revealed white house officials locked down the call record in a classified server due to concerns over its content but do these developments rise to the level of impeachable offenses most republicans say no president trump insists he s done nothing wrong but was caught on camera talking about the white house leak that led to the whistleblower complaint president donald trump who s the person that gave the whistleblower the information because that s close to a spy you know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart right the spies and treason right we used to handle it a little differently than we do now margaret brennan the president s personal attorney rudy giuliani will be with us as well as one of the president s biggest supporters senator lindsey graham two members of the house intelligence committee republican will hurd and democrat terri sewell will join us plus democratic senator chris murphy will be here along with our political panel just ahead on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation from capitol hill it has been a mind boggling week of developments in the whistleblower case here in washington each new revelation brings more questions we ll be talking today with key lawmakers from both sides of the aisle as well as the person the whistleblower called a central figure in the case president trump s personal attorney rudy giuliani there is a sharp political divide among americans on whether or not there should be an impeachment inquiry a cbs news national poll just out says that more than half fifty five percent of americans say there should be an impeachment inquiry into the president that includes eighty seven percent of democrats and twenty three percent of republicans independents are split forty two percent of americans say he deserves to be impeached over the ukraine controversy thirty six percent say the president does not and the rests say it s too soon those numbers also split along party lines for the most part there s more from our poll on our website at facethenation com on tonight s 60 minutes scott pelley sat down with congressional leaders including house speaker nancy pelosi he asked her what specifically had prompted her to open an impeachment inquiry into the president s actions regarding ukraine here s a preview begin vt scott pelley 60 minutes your republican colleagues say well the the call is the call but there s nothing here that rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors nancy pelosi 60 minutes well they re wrong and with it remains to be seen because it s not just what happens in the call it s part of the sequencing of events as well you withdraw a couple of hundred million dollars worth of of assistance to a country and then a couple of days later say by the way can you help me with my campaign in other words there s a sequencing there end vt margaret brennan you can see more of scott s interviews on 60 minutes tonight we turn now to the chairman of the senate judiciary committee lindsey graham senator good morning senator lindsey graham r south carolina lindseygrahamsc judiciary committee chairman good morning margaret brennan big week here but i want to begin where nancy pelosi just left off senator lindsey graham mm hm margaret brennan she lays out what she says is most problematic the sequencing senator lindsey graham right margaret brennan the president in this call record says senator lindsey graham right margaret brennan would you do us a favor he brings up debunked myth about the dnc server and then he brings up the biden family and the need for an investigation senator lindsey graham mm hm margaret brennan he repeatedly lays that out and also the aid package is mentioned senator lindsey graham right margaret brennan you have no problem with any of this senator lindsey graham i have zero problems with his phone call margaret brennan even with that sequencing senator lindsey graham i just told you i have zero problems with his phone call there is no quid pro quo here but i do have a problem with nancy pelosi if you believe that donald trump did something to hurt this country you owe it to vote not talk about impeaching the president the only way to open up an impeachment inquiry is to vote we need a john hancock moment from house democrats quit hiding behind nancy pelosi if you think the president did something wrong in this phone call then vote to open up an article of impeachment inquiry and a lot of house democrats won t because they are afraid margaret brennan well putting that political calculus aside i want to ask you about the content though senator lindsey graham yeah margaret brennan of this conversation senator lindsey graham can i tell you about this conversation margaret brennan do you think it was ethical for senator lindsey graham yes i it s okay margaret brennan the president to bring up joe biden senator lindsey graham yes absolutely i think somebody ought to look at whether or not joe biden had the prosecutor fired in an improper way i love joe biden i don t want to look at it i want an inspector general somebody like mueller did biden know that his son was receiving fifty thousand dollars a month from a gas company being investigated by the prosecutor margaret brennan isn t that just senator lindsey graham wait a minute margaret brennan his payment senator lindsey graham wait a minute margaret brennan for being on the board senator lindsey graham the margaret brennan do you have reason to believe senator lindsey graham the board the guys margaret brennan it was anything more than that senator lindsey graham on the board being investigated for corruption and the guy doing the investigation is asked to be fired by biden i don t know what happened it smells to high heaven i never said the mueller witch hunt the mueller investigation was a witch hunt i introduced legislation to protect mueller margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham this seems to me like a political setup it s all hearsay you can t get a parking ticket conviction based on hearsay the whistleblower didn t hear the phone call margaret brennan right sen graham who told the whistleblower margaret brennan which he says senator lindsey graham about the phone call and everything else margaret brennan he says senator lindsey graham donald trump is margaret brennan multiple white house officials were discussing it senator lindsey graham still an american every american deserves to confront their accuser so this is a sham as far as i am concerned i want to know who told the whistleblower about the phone call i want to know why they changed the rules about whistleblowers not the hearsay rule was changed just a short period of time before the complaint was filed the complaint sounds like a legal document who help him who helped this guy write it or this girl write it we re not going to try the president of the united states based on hearsay every american has a right to confront their accuser margaret brennan you wanted the president to release this partial call record senator lindsey graham i did margaret brennan but you re saying this is hearsay the complaint on a number of fronts senator lindsey graham who margaret brennan is matched by senator lindsey graham the margaret brennan the call record senator lindsey graham the transcript and the complaint are not matched now now wait a minute margaret brennan the reference to the dnc server senator lindsey graham please let me talk margaret brennan the will you do senator lindsey graham please please margaret brennan a favor i m laying out the facts here senator lindsey graham no no you re not margaret brennan the repeated senator lindsey graham no you re making an argument that margaret brennan reference to joe biden senator lindsey graham here s the point margaret brennan all those things senator lindsey graham joe biden margaret brennan are laid out here senator lindsey graham went to the margaret brennan the fact that the attorney general was brought up senator lindsey graham never mind you know you ve got an opinion and i got an opinion you ve got me on the show to tell me what what i think i think mueller did a good job for the country and there was nothing there i think this whole thing is a sham i can t believe we re talking about impeaching the president based on an accusation based on hearsay who is this whistleblower what bias do they have why did they pick this whistleblower to tell a hearsay story the transcript does not match the complaint what s going on here why did they change the rules about a whistleblower you can use hearsay when you could not just weeks before the complaint so i think this thing stinks and let me tell you about republicans you want to know about republicans republicans believe that you re guilty just by the accusation if you re margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham brett kavanaugh it doesn t matter they don t tell you when it happened and where it happened it just happened thirty years ago if you re donald trump you don t get to confront your accuser like every other american republicans believe this president is being persecuted they don t love donald trump and the way he does business they like what he does but they believe he is being persecuted they believe that everybody is out to get him and i believe as to this complaint it smells margaret brennan so the acting director of national intelligence who was put in that job by the trump administration senator lindsey graham yeah margaret brennan said he believed that the whistleblower was senator lindsey graham no he did not margaret brennan acting in good faith senator lindsey graham no he did not he said they couldn t question his motives margaret brennan right senator lindsey graham but he didn t know if it s true or not so adam schiff read the the the the transcript in a way that everybody would believe that trump is guilty the dni did not say he he could confirm this margaret brennan no senator lindsey graham he didn t know he didn t have any reason to believe the the whistleblower is doing anything wrong what i want to know who told the whistleblower about the transcript who told the whistleblower about a phone call between the president of the united states and a foreign leader margaret brennan yeah he senator lindsey graham this is the third time a phone call has been compromised margaret brennan right senator lindsey graham i ve read the transcript i m fine with it but i m not fine with this president being impeached based on hearsay every american should be able to confront their accuser including donald trump margaret brennan but the the whistleblower here says that multiple white house officials conveyed this to him senator lindsey graham who are they margaret brennan and the fact senator lindsey graham who are they margaret brennan pattern was laid out but just senator lindsey graham what what bias do they have margaret brennan to to move on to another point senator lindsey graham no wait a minute let s stop right there the whistleblower says i have no direct knowledge margaret brennan right senator lindsey graham multiple white house officials told me this margaret brennan yes senator lindsey graham they tell me about a phone call there s a disconnect who are these people and what are they up to you know this is mueller wasn t a witch hunt but this is salem witch trials have more due process than this margaret brennan why senator lindsey graham due process than this margaret brennan do senator lindsey graham how do you know she s a witch somebody told me she s a witch margaret brennan what do you think senator lindsey graham how do you know she s a witch margaret brennan do you think the president s senator lindsey graham i read articles thinking she might be a witch margaret brennan do you think the president s personal attorney rudy giuliani is advising him on this should he be out there publicly calling for the ukrainian government to investigate joe biden senator lindsey graham why don t you ask him he s going to be on corruption abounds in the ukraine margaret brennan if he s doing a good job do you think he s being advised advising the president on that senator lindsey graham here s what i think i think nobody s asking about joe biden calling for the guy to be prosecuted fired who s looking into a board that his son margaret brennan right senator lindsey graham sits on and did joe biden know that his son was receiving fifty thousand dollars when he asked for the prosecutor to be fired margaret brennan you know this prosecutor though because i know you cover ukraine and you watch russia very closely senator lindsey graham people say he s dirty margaret brennan you know that he yeah exactly senator lindsey graham yeah but you know what margaret brennan not just the united states the u k imf senator lindsey graham did joe biden know would you ask would you ask margaret brennan other international organizations senator lindsey graham would you ask somebody this did joe biden know that his son was sitting on a board being investigated for corruption and the guy doing the investigation joe biden said if you don t fire this guy margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham i ll cut a billion dollars of aid off now why am i asking that a lot of republicans don t believe the new yorker and the political fact checkers are really as adequate substitute i m all asking is due to joe biden s scenario what you did for trump find somebody not me outside of politics to look and see if it makes sense i love joe biden as a person margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham but we cannot give margaret brennan should that go senator lindsey graham democrats a pass and go after republicans margaret brennan well our paula reid is reporting that attorney general bill barr was quite upset to see his name linked in that transcript to this call for an investigation he s linked there senator lindsey graham well you need to talk here s the thing margaret brennan to rudy giuliani you have overs have you asked the attorney general if he was asked to investigate senator lindsey graham yeah i did i said have you ever talked to trump about anything in the ukraine for corruption no did the president ever ask you to call anybody in the ukraine did he ever mention going after joe biden no so this is a phone call between two presidents one just getting reelected just got elected congratulations we are very generous to the ukraine other countries like germany should do more margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham and oh by the way i have heard that this prosecutor that got fired maybe he was a good guy and they fired him because he was looking at joe biden s son could you look into that congratulations that to me is not a quid pro quo and the entire whistleblower complaint is based on hearsay and we re not going to impeach a president based on hearsay as long as i am around this is a sham margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham there s a political smell to this that s far different than mueller margaret brennan what did you tell the president when you were golfing with him yesterday are you advising him senator lindsey graham work with blumenthal and murphy on guns keep fighting back we have your back on this i am openly telling everybody in the country i have the president s back because i think this is a setup work with us on guns try to do something on prescription drugs margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham govern the country and make iran pay a price you had a measured response when they shot down the drone it didn t work mister president they re running wild the iranians put them back in a box try to be a good president defend yourself and that s what bill clinton did these numbers you saw margaret brennan right senator lindsey graham the only thing i can tell you americans are fair and if they believe president trump did something troubling they ll count they ll account for that but i don t think they re going to remove a man for office based on a hearsay accusation and bill clinton was able to do two things at once margaret brennan mm hm senator lindsey graham defend himself and govern the country and that s my advice to president trump margaret brennan senator graham thank you we re joined now by connecticut democratic senator chris murphy who traveled to ukraine earlier this month and met with president zelensky there good morning to you senator you just heard senator graham give a full throated defense of the president here would you like to respond senator chris murphy d connecticut chrismurphyct well republicans are circling the wagons because they know this isn t about hearsay evidence this is about a transcript in which the president of the united states seeks to trade away the credibility of the country seeks to use the immense power of the presidency in order to destroy a political rival the whistleblower complaint is absolutely credible but frankly you don t need it because you have a transcript of a conversation in which the president of the united states tried to convince a foreign leader to interfere in the 2020 election and you have rudy giuliani on tv every morning and every night openly admitting that as an agent of the president s campaign margaret brennan mm hm senator chris murphy he has been coordinating with the state department in order to try to perpetuate the president s political agenda this is not allowable in a democracy and frankly it frightens me that republicans are standing up and defending the president because if he gets away with this what s to stop him from essentially integrating the entirety of american foreign policy the state department itself into his political re election campaign the ukrainians don t have a lot of interest in interfering in our election margaret brennan mm hm senator chris murphy you can hear that in the way that zelensky talks but if president trump has asked or does ask the russians or the saudis to interfere in the 2020 election they will simply ask when and how margaret brennan the state department has said rudy giuliani does not represent the u s government there they ve tried to make that clear but when when you went to ukraine earlier this month and you met with president zelensky in the retelling of that president trump this week accused you of threatening the ukrainian president what exactly did you say senator chris murphy well first of all of course rudy giuliani is attempting to speak for the united states government right and you can understand how the ukrainians are confused when the personal representative of the president is coming to them and asking them to help destroy one of his political rivals and you can also understand how they might be concerned that if they don t do the bidding of the president of the united states there might be consequences that come to them when i went to ukraine three weeks ago i told the president that he should stay away from interfering in the 2020 presidential election and if he wants to talk to the united states government he should talk to the state department because i had heard these concerns that the ukrainians didn t understand what the consequences would be if they said no to the president s request to investigate the bidens and they worried rightly that there might be a consequence to their security and that just stands to reason remember whether or not there s an explicit quid pro quo margaret brennan yeah senator chris murphy there is an implicit threat in every demand that the president of united states makes if you don t do what the president of the united states wants you know there are going to be consequences margaret brennan did you did you ask if there was anything to all of these insinuations around hunter biden did you ever bring that up with the ukrainian officials senator chris murphy well well no that didn t come up because we already know that there is zero evidence for the claims that the president is making that in fact the prosecutor at the time was not investigating this company and that there is zero evidence to suggest margaret brennan well the investigation was open but it was not being prosecuted or pursued senator chris murphy well and remember and remember the vice president was doing what every other one of our allies was doing this was a corrupt and incompetent prosecutor margaret brennan mm hm senator chris murphy vice president biden the e u the imf everyone was calling for his removal and by the way at the time there wasn t a single republican in the united states congress who was raising an issue with what the vice president was doing it only comes up now that they are trying to defund to defend the corrupt actions of this president margaret brennan why do you think you sit on senate foreign relations so you have some oversight of the state department secretary pompeo has been subpoenaed by house committees number of diplomats are coming forward for depositions this week why up to this point has the state department refused to hand over some of the documents do you have any insight into that senator chris murphy well listen we re learning by the day how deeply integrated the state department was into trump s corrupt actions essentially what trump is trying to do margaret brennan you think secretary pompeo was directly involved in this senator chris murphy what what we know is that that ambassador volker was involved that rudy giuliani says he was doing this at the direction of the state department i don t know whether the secretary himself was involved but what you cannot allow is for the president to use the massive power of his office the credibility of the united states in order to try to get foreign countries to interfere in an american election that s what he was doing here today and that s why you ve seen this massive turn of public opinion that s why americans know that you have to open an impeachment inquiry margaret brennan is it possible to do what lindsey graham said here for the president to actually get things done legislatively are democrats really going to be willing to work with him senator chris murphy so i i m willing to walk and chew gum at the same time i d love to get a deal done on background checks that s a matter of saving lives so if the president s willing to work with us on guns i m ready to do it if we don t get a background checks deal margaret brennan mm hm senator chris murphy the only reason that it doesn t get done is because the president is distracted not because his margaret brennan okay senator chris murphy potential partners in congress won t work with him margaret brennan senator murphy thank you very much we ll be back in one minute don t go away announcements margaret brennan we go now to texas republican congressman will hurd he joins us this morning from burbank california congressman thanks for getting up early to talk to us you heard senator graham say all of this is hearsay we know the acting director of national intelligence has said he has no reason to doubt the motives of the whistleblower where do you fall on this representative will hurd r texas hurdonthehill well first and foremost i think we should be protecting the whistleblower having laws in place to ensure that folks throughout the government are able to get to the right committees information where they think may be wrongdoing is important there there are troubling issues within the whistleblower s report but they are allegations and i think that s why we should explore these allegations through hearings where we had a hearing last week we re going to be having some depositions this week as well in order to get to the bottom of this and and i will say this you know i i was never in a terrorist organization but i collected a lot of intelligence on terrorist organizations when i was an undercover officer in the cia margaret brennan mm hm representative will hurd and so being able to get information second hand is not necessarily a bad thing but i can t i can t speak to the veracity of this whistleblower s margaret brennan right representative will hurd information but that s why we bring people and we and try to collect collect facts understand what was said and be methodical about this we shouldn t rush it but we should we should explore many of those issues highlighted by the whistleblower margaret brennan so do you support the impeachment inquiry representative will hurd well an impeachment inquiry i i i think this is wordplay being used by by speaker pelosi in order to placate some of the extreme wings of her party the last three times in history that there was an impeachment inquiry of a president it was a vote on the house floor and it was done in a bipartisan way there are many of my friends on the other side of the aisle that have been trying to impeach this impeach this president since january of 2017 but these are investigations we should bring witnesses forward i want to hear from the folks in the state department i want to hear from margaret brennan mm hm representative will hurd mayor giuliani i want to hear from hunter biden i think he should he should show up and and testify as well too so there s a lot of questions to to be had and anybody who thinks that we have enough information to make a statement on impeachment that s that s incredibly premature margaret brennan the president was captured on camera this week saying that whoever told the whistleblower any of this is a spy and that he should be dealt with in the old way many perceive that to be a threat how did you hear it and and what are your concerns representative will hurd well again whistleblowers are important i am concerned about the identity of this current whistleblower we should hear from the whistleblower and and talk to this individual about motives margaret brennan will you representative will hurd who are they talking to i i hope i know the whistleblower has told both the house and the senate committees that he or she is interested and willing to testify that will be important i hope we can protect this individual s name i find it highly unlikely in this incredibly partisan environment it s unfortunate i believe that that chairman schiff is handling this like this is a tribal council on the survivor and we re voting somebody off the island this is this is serious business we should be proceeding on the house side margaret brennan yeah representative will hurd the way the senate is and do this stuff in a thoughtful manner and transparency is important after we ve done our work let the american people know what s happening but trying to do this in the public eye is having impact on our foreign policy the fact that i m sure many leaders of other countries are concerned margaret brennan mm hm representative will hurd about speaking to the u s president because they re afraid their words are going to get out into the u s press so these are this this type of thing is having an impact on our foreign policy especially at a time when you have the threats like iran margaret brennan right representative will hurd especially at a time when you re dealing with the economic shenanigans of china this is where we should be our allies should feel comfortable having conversations with us margaret brennan to be clear it was the white house who released that call transcript representative will hurd that that s correct that s correct margaret brennan yeah all right congressman hurd we have to leave it there thank you so much for your insights and we will be watching the developments over the coming weeks we ll be back in a moment announcements margaret brennan coming up next we ll talk to a democrat on the house intelligence committee alabama congresswoman terri sewell and then we ll hear from the president s personal attorney rudy giuliani stay with us announcements margaret brennan some of our stations are leaving us now but we will be right back with a lot more face the nation there was a lot of news this week and we ll have analysis ahead on our impeachment panel so don t go away announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we turn now to a democrat on the house intelligence committee alabama congresswoman terri sewell congresswoman welcome representative terri sewell d alabama repterrisewell thanks so much margaret margaret brennan now the accusation is that democrats were chomping at the bit to impeach but you say you were actually very reluctant to move ahead with this representative terri sewell well you know look it s not because i didn t think that there were really unpresidential behavior by this president from moment one but because i was worried that it would get us sidetracked from other more important items for the american people but i do believe that we ve crossed a a rubicon here i do believe that this whistleblower allegation is so serious it gets to the very heart of our nation s democracy the integrity of our elections and if any district understands that it s my district alabama s seventh congressional district which was the civil rights district where people died fought bled for the right to vote and the integrity of our elections are at question when the president of the united states ask a foreign leader for a favor and then withholds millions of dollars of foreign aid in order to solicit interference in in our election i don t think it gets more important than that margaret brennan a a as you ve heard republicans dispute this idea that there was a quid pro quo and dismiss this representative terri sewell you don t need margaret brennan whistleblower as just relaying hearsay representative terri sewell you don t need a quid pro quo the reality is that the complaint speaks for itself and it corroborates the partial margaret brennan mm hm representative terri sewell readout that we received earlier in the week so i think that you know none of us come to congress to try to impeach the president i know the people i elected me to go to congress to lower prescription drug prices for them to be sure that we have a an equal level playing field when it comes to education but i think that we find ourselves at a very sombering moment in american s history and we can either choose to live by the oath that we took which is to uphold this constitution and get to the bottom of what s going on we need to understand that what we ve what the speaker has done is initiated an inquiry margaret brennan mm hm representative terri sewell an inquiry and obviously the road map is the complaint it ob it raises lots of concerns as to the extent of of this this president s portrayal and we need to get to the bottom of that we margaret brennan how representative terri sewell do so in a deliberate manner margaret brennan deliberate manner how quickly is this actually going to move from inquiry to articles of impeachment representative terri sewell well i can tell you that we in the intel committee are working diligently through this rosh hashanah break and we don t know exactly when it will come but we do know that we re working in a deliberate thoughtful manner we ll follow the facts where they lead us and the american people deserve to understand and know to what extent did the president you know interfere in our elections margaret brennan mm hm representative terri sewell and to what extent has it been a cover up i think all of those things are unfortunately we re we re at this moment in american history but we need to live up to our oath if the president is not going to live up to his margaret brennan as a democrat you said this worried you that you wouldn t be able to get real work done for your constituents in in the polling that cbs has done forty two percent of people polled think congress will still work on legislation fifty eight percent of americans say they re going to be just too distracted representative terri sewell but we ve already shown that we can do both margaret brennan how can you work with the president when there is an effort underway to impeach him how is it po possible to do both things representative terri sewell what first of all we can do things in a methodical diligent way the intel committee will will conduct the investigation and i m on the house ways and means committee we are working diligently to address a surprise billing to address the prescription drug problem that we have in america i m also on the working group of democrats that s looking at usmca margaret brennan right representative terri sewell so we have a lot of things going on simultaneously we are multitaskers as legislators and we can do both margaret brennan congresswoman thank you very much representative terri sewell thank you margaret brennan and we will be tracking how the committee investigation continues we will be right back with the president s personal attorney rudy giuliani he is standing by for us in new york so don t go away announcements margaret brennan we re back now with president trump s personal attorney rudy giuliani who is called a central figure in the whistleblower complaint he joins us from new york this morning mister mayor thank you for joining us rudy giuliani attorney to president trump rudygiuliani thank you margaret margaret brennan why wouldn t the president reach out first to law enforcement to his own agencies if his concern was truly about corruption why bring this up in a phone call with the leader of ukraine rudy giuliani well listen i mean this goes back actually to november of 2018 i i wasn t asking for this someone came to me a very well respected ins investigator american citizen and told me that in in in ukraine there were a number of allegations of interference in the 2016 election that appear to be real and truthful unlike the russian collusion hoax and that it was really ironic that hillary clinton the democratic national committee our embassy there was collecting dirt going back to the early part of 2016 on the trump campaign on people who operated in the trump campaign on the president and that there were witnesses quite a few of them that would support this and they ve been trying to get it to the fbi for a year to a year and a half and they have been frustrated in in doing so so having gotten that as his defense lawyer i had to pursue it they would not margaret brennan sorry chris wray rudy giuliani talk to the fbi because they margaret brennan the fbi director appointed by president trump you re saying refused to look at this rudy giuliani i didn t say he refused to look at it i said they were afraid margaret brennan you just said the fbi wouldn t look at it rudy giuliani i said they were afraid to go to the fbi because they had been turned down so often and one of the central figures in it is a fbi agent who appears to be involved in the gathering of dirt work with a particular company owned by george soros that was collecting this information that company is one of the companies where biden s bribery of poroshenko he got that case dismissed people were ignoring that that biden played a role in getting these collusion allegations covered up by having the case against antac dismissed so it was all one piece the reason i investigated it is margaret brennan yeah rudy giuliani as his defense lawyer it s my job to show if there is an alternative explanation that proves him innocent margaret brennan well rudy giuliani i got it to the point let me finish i got it to the point of affidavits i put them all online margaret brennan mm hm rudy giuliani here s one of them margaret brennan a a sorry rudy giuliani that margaret brennan can we finish on on the first point rudy giuliani here here here here s one of them margaret brennan you brought up because this is very complicated mister mayor rudy giuliani well i know i know nobody wants to margaret brennan i want i want to respond to what you just laid out rudy giuliani i know i know no i know nobody wants to cover margaret brennan no i want to actually i i want to bring up to you no we did rudy giuliani the a margaret brennan actually cbs news and and our partners bbc in ukraine went to the prosecutor general to ask him specifically rudy giuliani which one margaret brennan about rudy giuliani which one margaret brennan about the biden questions you re raising the current one let s play the clip please begin vt yuriy lutsenko bbc and i told mister giuliani okay if you start your investigation in the united states we can officially help you according to international law we will give you legal international assistance jonah fisher bbc have you got any evidence that joe biden acted in any way which supported hunter biden s company burisma yuriy lutsenko it is not my jurisdiction jonah fisher but have you got any yuriy lutsenko it is not my jurisdiction i can t do nothing jonah fisher but yuriy lutsenko which is not connected with ukrainian law jonah fisher so under ukrainian law you ve got nothing yuriy lutsenko nothing end vt margaret brennan so that was sergei lutsenko sic who is one of the advisers to the current president we also spoke rudy giuliani no no no no no margaret brennan off camera to the rudy giuliani margaret margaret margaret brennan prosecutor general who says rudy giuliani this is very embarrassing margaret brennan there is no evidence there rudy giuliani margaret this is exceedingly embarrassing mister lutsenko has been fired by the current president mister lutsenko is exactly the prosecutor that joe biden put in in order to tank the case and it is suspected margaret brennan you met with him repeatedly rudy giuliani both

blinded because this is a democrat you re not doing your job properly the prosecutor general you should have spoken to is the one who was fired who has said in this affidavit that he was fired

about margaret brennan mister mister mayor i want to ask you about rudy giuliani other areas in which margaret brennan something that has developed in rudy giuliani he dropped cases margaret brennan

brennan right rudy giuliani who around the president who is crooked i said i am willing to do it let me check the guy out first i called him back two or three days later we arranged a meeting margaret brennan mm hm rudy giuliani he knew about the meeting at the end of the meeting i called mister volker and ambassador sondland and i debriefed them i told them margaret brennan okay rudy giuliani what i had learned and then on august 11th i had a complete debriefing margaret brennan all right rudy giuliani at the time they didn t mention the secretary of state they don t have to they re both margaret brennan right rudy giuliani ambassadors and assistant secretaries i think margaret brennan yeah we rudy giuliani however when i spoke when i spoke to margaret brennan we have to rudy giuliani the secretary last week margaret brennan yes rudy giuliani i said are you aware of this and he said yes i know about this margaret brennan okay rudy giuliani quote margaret brennan thank you for clarifying that mister mayor we will be back in a moment with our panel announcements margaret brennan it s now time for some analysis from our panel adam entous is a staff writer at the new yorker paula reid is a white house correspondent here at cbs michael morell is a cbs news senior national security contributor and a former acting director of the cia he also served as advisor to hillary clinton s campaign in 2016 and rachael bade covers congress for the washington post paula a lot to unpack let s start with the president s attorney where we just left off there what stood out to you paula reid cbs news white house correspondent paulareidcbs he didn t answer the core question which is if you thought there was any evidence of wrongdoing why did you go to ukraine why didn t you go to u s law enforcement the attorney general has been clear the president has never asked him to look into anything related to the bidens in ukraine rudy giuliani has presented this affidavit there are other officials who give a differing account but at at the core of this if you think there is a problem why wouldn t you go to the fbi why wouldn t you go to the justice department or are you just trying to sow questions and seeds of doubt in the absence of any true evidence margaret brennan and in that partial call transcript the attorney general is mentioned a few times by the president but what you are reporting is that there was no actual contact that happened paula reid exactly and i ve learned from a person familiar that he was angry he was surprised that he would be lumped in with rudy giuliani rudy giuliani is the president s personal attorney william barr is the nation s top law enforcement official and it raises the question about whether the president thinks those two are one and the same now there is some some reason for him to think that william barr has been his staunchest defender the way he handled the mueller report very favorable to the president but now it s up to william barr going forward to try to allay any of those concerns margaret brennan mike you know russia you know ukraine you know what happened at the time when you hear this sort of retelling of history and what happened during the biden obama years michael morell cbs news senior national security contributor michaeljmorell former acting cia director yes margaret brennan what are you hearing what stands out to you what do we need to know michael morell what stands out to me is that there is a complete absence of clarity here right so there is this image that the vice president acted on his own no he was the point man for administration policy interagency agreement agreement across countries that we needed to pressure ukraine to get tough on corruption margaret brennan he wasn t freelancing michael morell he was not freelancing the second is that there s a deep irony here right is that the investigation of burisma was on hold and one of the things we were concerned about was that there wasn t enough investigations going on about corruption burisma was on hold when biden was pressuring so the margaret brennan this is the gas company that hunter biden ended up on the board michael morell exactly so the irony here is that the vice president in pressing the prosecutor general to resign to be fired right was actually creating an opportunity for burisma investigation to reopen right so it s the direct opposite of what everybody thinks margaret brennan it s confusing to the public though as well here and i know you adam have been digging into hunter biden and the work he did do for this gas company adam entous the new yorker adamentous right right margaret brennan is there any there there adam entous well i think there s the two issues one should hunter have taken this position when his father was you know vice president playing a key role in shaping policy towards ukraine should some of biden s advisors or white house officials or state department officials have said to joe biden or said to hunter biden you know what you really shouldn t be on this board that never happened so that s i think that s a legitimate question on the issue of whether joe biden used his office in order to have shokin this prosecutor fired you know i spent a lot of time looking at this much of what i see is the opposite the oligarch who s who who recruited hunter to be on this board when shokin was the prosecutor he was in ukraine he was he felt safe according to former board members he didn t feel like he had any he was in legal legal jeopardy at all it was once shokin was fired and lutsenko who s the person who you interviewed here took over as the prosecutor that s when the oligarchs zlochevsky decided to leave the country he went to dubai at that point because that s when he was concerned that he might actually be prosecuted margaret brennan mm hm adam entous so really when when so shokin leaves that s when the oligarch feels like he s actually in jeopardy margaret brennan rachael you heard senator graham on this program fully defend the president here this is someone who knows the details of this region these policies are other republicans standing by the president on this fight rachael bade washington post rachaelmbade yeah i mean largely the party is sticking with the president right now we are seeing a little cracks begin to emerge i will say privately we hear a lot of griping from lawmakers on the hill who are wondering why the president put out this transcript to begin the list and and think that there is something that really is damaging we have seen a couple of republicans start to crack mitt romney for example came out and said that this was disturbing sort of un unacceptable we saw republicans in a hearing last week mike turner from dayton ohio say that this sort of action asking a foreign leader to investigate a political adversary that would benefit you is point like not okay but there s a difference between some republicans and i can probably count them on one or two hands who are willing to say that this sort of activity is not acceptable and actually saying that this is an impeachable offense we saw a really interesting sort of flip flop over the weekend with a republican from nevada mark amodei he had been talking to reporters on friday saying let s see where this goes he was asked about the impeachment inquiry and it seemed like he was supporting it saying you know this is an investigation there are concerning allegations here let s see where it goes well within twenty four hours he totally walked back on that and said i was never supporting the impeachment investigation and again this is just showing that this is a party that sticks with the president who is very popular with their base margaret brennan mike the whistleblower as we ve been reporting came from the intelligence community and yet you have republicans saying everything la laid out in that complaint was just hearsay from the work you saw that was then made public does that look like it s based on just hearsay michael morell so the whistleblower seems to me to be highly credible whistleblower made a number of allegations we know that the first allegation that the phone call was made and the ask was made about investigating the vice president was one hundred percent correct the whistleblower lays out not just the fact that they received this from one source but multiple sources the whistleblower complaint is detailed it s compelling we still need to look into the other allegations but i think the whistleblower is highly credible margaret brennan in other words this looks like an analysis product that an agency would produce michael morell so so when i read it i said this is a high quality piece of cia analysis the person who wrote this is well trained they are highly skilled i was kind of proud of the product right in looking at it it seemed to me like this was a piece of cia analysis margaret brennan paula are white house officials actually nervous or are they embracing impeachment as the fight they want to have paula reid look the president is not likely to be removed from office that s just basic math and so far this administration has constantly been under this kind of controversy and scandal but the real concern is the now this impeachment inquiry and possible articles of impeachment makes it almost impossible margaret brennan mm hm paula reid to to expect any kind of success on the legislative front they were making some progress getting the president s proposal together for gun control legislation they were hoping for maybe something on prescription drugs the usmca now their biggest concern is they may not have much to show when they go on the campaign trail in 2020 particularly a trade deal the president so far has not been able to get any of his trade deals actually approved the usmca was his big hope margaret brennan right paula reid and with this unlikely margaret brennan adam why aren t we seeing joe biden out there sitting down actively defending his son and giving detailed explanations for all of this there s a lot of dirt being kicked up into the air adam entous i mean there s a reason why they are focusing on hunter this is a this is a really delicate issue for joe biden particularly delicate in the period that we re talking about because this is right when beau is very sick and getting you know it s his last year of life which is really when hunter takes this makes this deal to work with burisma this ukrainian company and historically you know aides to biden just never wanted to address this issue with him it was too sensitive things that involved his family were just considered to be off limits largely to his staff and i think to a to a fault you know he you know was reluctant to really say anything to his son you know about the appropriateness of some of his business choices and the way they dealt with it was like a don t ask don t tell policy where hunter wouldn t tell his father about his activities and joe biden wouldn t ask and so they just had this area that they didn t discuss and that kind of allowed this thing to sort of stew margaret brennan mm hm adam entous and obviously if this had been addressed early on in 2014 when this became public that he was on this board you know we wouldn t be maybe discussing it now margaret brennan rachael is opening the inquiry ultimately something that could backfire for democrats because it keeps this story out there rachael bade that was the number one concern speaker nancy pelosi had about impeachment when she opened the new congress this year i mean she has been the single greatest reason why democrats who overwhelming have favored for impeachment for a while have not charged forward but this pelosi has said to her colleagues she said it publicly this is something different this is there were concerns that for example robert mueller s report about ten instances of potential obstruction of justice that that wasn t resonating with the public there were suggestions that even though federal prosecutors named trump as the number one individual involved in allegations of well actually paying off women who alleged affairs margaret brennan mm hm rachael bade with the president in 2016 that wasn t resonating with the public and the public wasn t supporting impeachment but what we are seeing in some of these cbs numbers just today margaret brennan yeah rachael bade that that s changing fifty five percent supporting an impeachment inquiry more people supporting the impeachment of the president than actually do not pelosi it seems was right that this was something different and that margaret brennan mm hm rachael bade this is going to move public sentiment potentially continuing in their direction margaret brennan major story we will continue following we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan that s it for us
