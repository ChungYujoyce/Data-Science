 democratic presidential candidate elizabeth warren says of iowa iowa is a chance to do the kind of face to face campaigning that i think all the democrats oughta be doing charlie neibergall ap photo 2020 elections they established a beachhead very early and they built on it and that matters said one veteran of the state s first in the nation caucuses by alex thompson 06 03 2019 05 01 am edt newton iowa elizabeth warren s presidential campaign is obsessed with stickers at a half dozen events in rural eastern iowa over memorial day weekend paid organizers and volunteers swarmed every attendee affixing brightly colored circles to them as proof their contact information had been secured the sticker patrol circled the room before warren spoke and afterward in the selfie line just in case anyone happened to slip through advertisement the campaign s hyper vigilance about capturing data on every potential supporter isn t unique to iowa but the sheer number of people dedicated to the task certainly is warren has made an early wager on the state unrivaled by other democratic hopefuls aiming to strike early in the nomination contest by out organizing the competition she already has more than 50 staffers in iowa and more are coming a significant number of hires will be announced on june 15 according to jason noble her iowa communications director the national campaign said its iowa payroll would total at least 60 after the additions plenty of other democrats are investing heavily and ramping up their presence in iowa including cory booker beto o rourke and kamala harris but no candidate has hired nearly as many staffers or made the hawkeye state as central to their hopes for the nomination from the very start the race for 2020 starts now stay in the know follow our

explaining her focus on the state this is our chance to build a grassroots movement and that happens one person at a time this account of warren s iowa battle plan is based on interviews with more than a dozen campaign advisers organizers and volunteers as well as voters who came out to see the candidate in person warren and her campaign aren t predicting victory here but they are gunning for the kind of performance that would catapult her to front runner status for the nomination a win over joe biden and other rivals could also dispel doubts about her electability among some democrats still traumatized by 2016 as some of her staffers have noted the best way to erase concerns about whether she can win is to win but the up front investment by warren who so far has lagged behind biden bernie sanders harris o rourke and pete buttigieg in fundraising isn t without risk committing to so many salaries from the outset could leave the campaign without much cash for tv and digital advertising in the critical weeks before voting begins that danger is even greater given that warren has sworn off high dollar fundraisers warren s camp says she ll be fine pointing out that she transferred 10 4 million from her senate reelection account to give her a healthy financial cushion some people will raise money from you know whatever source and then dump it all into tv but elizabeth warren has made a conscious effort to hire a lot of staff here in every corner of the state campaign aide john russell told voters at a rural issues roundtable in fact the campaign is replicating its iowa model in new hampshire nevada and south carolina aides say they ll have more than 50 staffers in new hampshire by mid june and more than 30 on the ground in both nevada and south carolina by then as well other campaigns of course are also hiring staff and collecting voter data what s distinct about warren s iowa effort is how early she built out an infrastructure here embedding people in communities throughout the state who are organizing all manner of activities to draw voters into the fold if the rural issues roundtable didn t strike one s fancy the campaign hosted a 5k run nearby that same morning warren aides and volunteers have also organized slam poetry sessions movie nights and a book club first up this fight is our fight penned by warren in 2017 warren has appeared at more campaign events in iowa 34 than any other state the campaign has held an additional 200 plus events without her there and dozens more are scheduled they established a beachhead very early and they built on it and that matters matt paul the head of hillary clinton s iowa caucus operation in 2016 said of the warren campaign observing how different campaigns have run their events he added warren is doing it in the most organized fashion they are capturing all that data and it s very smart the campaign thinks its head start will pay dividends come caucus time by getting out of the gate so early we have added exponential days to our calendar and that was a very deliberate decision said senior adviser emily parcell a veteran of iowa politics the organizers are here for almost a year and so they have time to become part of the community be a real human being don t be a voter contact robot she tells organizers some events are earnest and activism oriented such as a weekly persist party and trash clean ups on the saturday afternoon of memorial day weekend in a fluorescent lit sideroom at the drake community library in grinnell iowa just over a dozen people gathered for the rural issues roundtable as they chomped on chocolate chip and m m cookies for over an hour three warren organizers went around the room soliciting thoughts and adding to two white poster sized sheets of papers taped to the wall one labeled the issues and the other the plans when one person left early a warren organizer ran out to make sure the person filled out a fight card the campaign s voter contact form 2020 elections by elena schneider it doesn t seem like any of the other campaigns have as much of a presence or as many boots on the ground in iowa said vivienne kerley de la cruz a 20 year old grinnell college student who attended she said she s undecided on which candidate she ll back but is leaning towards warren she has also seen o rourke at a town hall and attended camp kamala the grass roots organizing program for harris campaign or as morgan sperry a 2018 nyu grad who worked on warren s senate reelection campaign before moving to iowa earlier this year put it if you can do all these events people are like this is lit the face to face events and embedded organizer approach isn t novel howard dean s 2004 campaign drew buzz for in person campaign get togethers set up via meetup com barack obama s 2008 iowa operation for which parcell served as political director leaned into obama s community organizing evangelism and struck an early blow against hillary clinton by winning the caucus the warren campaign is hoping that their hiring early and often organizing approach will be similarly rewarded warren is polling third in most iowa surveys behind biden and sanders and just ahead of harris and buttigieg biden s lead here looks less commanding than elsewhere most polls have him in the 20 s here compared to his much larger advantage in national polls his late entry puts him well behind warren organizationally in a caucus contest that has rewarded robust organization in the past some caucus goers have taken notice of warren s heavy presence in iowa when it comes to their presence their organizing and their reaching out to people said jennifer pryke 64 a retired special ed teacher who attended a warren event but remains undecided it s very impressive missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020 politico llc
