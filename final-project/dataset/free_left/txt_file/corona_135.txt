advertisement supported by detailed guidelines for reopening drafted by the centers for disease control and prevention were blocked from publication after trump administration officials labeled them overly prescriptive by abby goodnough and maggie haberman washington as president trump rushes to reopen the economy a battle has erupted between the white house and the centers for disease control and prevention over the agency s detailed guidelines to help schools restaurants churches and other establishments safely reopen a copy of the c d c guidance obtained by the new york times includes sections for child care programs schools and day camps churches and other communities of faith employers with vulnerable workers restaurants and bars and mass transit administrators the recommendations include using disposable dishes and utensils at restaurants closing every other row of seats in buses and subways while restricting transit routes among areas experiencing different levels of coronavirus infection and separating children at school and camps into groups that should not mix throughout the day but white house and other administration officials rejected the recommendations over concerns that they were overly prescriptive infringed on religious rights and risked further damaging an economy that mr trump was banking on to recover quickly one senior official at the department of health and human services with deep ties to religious conservatives objected to any controls on church services governments have a duty to instruct the public on how to stay safe during this crisis and can absolutely do so without dictating to people how they should worship god said roger severino the director of the department of health and human services office for civil rights who once oversaw the devos center for religion and civil society at the heritage foundation a spokesman for the c d c said the guidance was still under discussion with the white house and a revised version could be published soon over the last week c d c has been working on additional recommendations and guidance for reopening communities returning to public events and i expect even today that we re going to receive a presentation on that vice president mike pence said on thursday on a radio show broadcast in pittsburgh he added that what c d c would be doing as it often did is publishing health care guidance at cdc gov in the very near future the c d c s director dr robert r redfield and other leaders of the agency have had almost no public platform during the pandemic with dr deborah l birx an infectious diseases expert coordinating the white house s coronavirus response and dr anthony s fauci another member of the coronavirus task force who is the longtime director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases handling most of the public speaking on the federal public health response usually at briefings dominated by mr trump after the c d c recommended the public wear masks mr trump said he probably would not do so even as he announced the guidelines the rejection of the c d c s guidelines for reopening is the latest confusing signal as the trump administration struggles to balance the president s desire to quickly reopen the country against the advice of public health experts who have counseled reopening methodically through a series of steps tied to reduced rates of infection and expanded efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus this week the white house signaled it would wind down its coronavirus task force only to reverse course amid a public outcry last week mr pence refused to wear a surgical mask at the mayo clinic then apologized the mixed signals extend to reopening guidelines on april 16 mr trump s coronavirus task force released broad guidance for states to reopen in three phases based on case levels and hospital capacity but some members of the task force and other aides saw the more detailed c d c guidance as a document that could slow down the reopening effort according to several people with knowledge of the deliberations inside the west wing to date 24 states mostly in the south great plains and interior west have begun allowing certain businesses to reopen sometimes only in certain counties many more have businesses that are set to reopen or stay at home orders that could lift in the next week or two in a senior staff meeting last week at the white house mark meadows the chief of staff expressed concern that the guidelines were too uniform and rigid for places with minimal numbers of cases according to a person familiar with the discussion particularly contentious were the c d c s recommendations for churches and other houses of worship mr severino vocally opposed them protections against religious discrimination aren t suspended during an emergency he said in a statement on thursday this means the federal government cannot single out religious conduct as somehow being more dangerous or worthy of scrutiny than comparable secular behavior the recommendations for churches include encouraging all congregants to wear cloth face coverings when inside the building offering video streaming or drive in options for services and considering suspending use of a choir or musical ensemble during services it also urges churches to consider temporarily limiting the sharing of frequently touched objects like hymnals prayer books and passed collection baskets a senior trump administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely about internal discussions said that dr birx also expressed skepticism about the c d c guidelines in task force meetings the official said that dr birx said she was mistrustful of the data the agency had provided although the official did not specify what exactly the doctor was concerned about updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities the guidance which the c d c submitted to dr birx in draft form on april 23 and to the white house s office of management and budget last week was to help states local governments and businesses adopt specific precautions to help keep the coronavirus from spreading once they reopened but several federal agencies that reviewed the draft including the labor department and the office for civil rights at the department of health and human services protested saying it would be harmful to businesses and the economy and too burdensome for houses of worship a federal official who supports the guidance said that dr birx was in favor of publishing them and that joe grogan the director of the white house s domestic policy council even tried to broker a compromise but that others in the white house pushed back especially on the worship section dr birx was not available for comment in one version of the draft guidance the section titled interim guidance for communities of faith was left blank with a note in capital letters referring to multiple federal agencies that have to come to agreement but another version included the guidance for faith communities with the caveat that it is not intended to infringe on first amendment rights as provided in the u s constitution the federal government may not prescribe standards for interactions of faith communities in houses of worship the second version states c d c offers these suggestions that faith communities may consider and accept or reject abby goodnough reported from washington and maggie
