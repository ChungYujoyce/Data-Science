to topple hillary clinton bernie sanders must win every remaining democratic primary polls suggest he may not win any mona chalabi guardian us data editor wed 4 may 2016 14 45bst last modified on wed 26 feb 2020 18 01gmt despite bernie sanders surprise victory in indiana the democratic race is fundamentally unchanged hillary clinton looks near certain to be the nominee to reverse his fortunes sanders has to prove the polls wrong a lot wrong to pick up the 973 pledged delegates he needs to cross the finish line sanders will need to win every remaining democratic primary polling however suggests he might not win any the vermont senator needs to capture about two thirds of the remaining pledged delegates no numbers are available for the primaries that will be held in puerto rico the virgin islands oregon and kentucky partly because pollsters know the voters there won t change the political calculus much they re not wasting their time in places with few delegates available but where opinion polls are available they show sanders trailing clinton in new jersey and crucially california just as for republicans california will be decisive in the democratic race since it offers 546 delegates sanders will need to win the majority to have a chance of securing the nomination but he has an approximately nine percentage point gap to close on clinton and in new jersey he will have to erase clinton s 16 percentage point lead then overtake her by at least 16 percentage points and all that in a month the state votes on 7 june sanders finished tuesday night with 52 5 of the vote and 43 delegates however democratic primaries are not winner takes all and so clinton s vote share in indiana translated into 37 delegates in terms of net differences the only ones that matter in primary races sanders only won six extra delegates and that simply isn t enough given that clinton is ahead by 321 pledged delegates and by 481 superdelegates despite this it seems unlikely that sanders will drop out of the democratic race until he has no choice and there seems to be party consensus that this is a good thing a poll released this week by nbc news and survey monkey found that 57 of democratic and democratic leaning voters want sanders to stay in the race until the convention
