in 2013 with the future of their cause and the country on their minds joining them was ben carson the renowned neurosurgeon who d electrified republicans several weeks earlier with a sharp attack on president obama s policies at the national prayer breakfast now a half dozen of carson s admirers all prominent african american conservatives wanted him to go further over dinner in a palatial room at the willard intercontinental just two blocks from the white house they courted carson with views that had long set them apart from much of black america niger innis spokesman for the congress of racial equality said he thought obama would make it easier for a country to accept a black conservative as president antiabortion activist alveda king told carson that he was a role model for my son not like obama whom she deemed so liberal that his inspirational pull went no further than his race and pizza magnate herman cain who d briefly been a republican presidential front runner in 2012 before being derailed by disputed sexual harassment allegations was eager to confront liberals in the next election cycle kick their butts he exhorted the group as they dined in the willard s private holmes room it was cain who d invited carson to the gathering and the others suspected an unstated reason it felt as if we were witnessing a passing of the torch innis says but only if carson was willing to trade his identity as a medical pioneer the first doctor in the world to separate twins conjoined at the back of the head for something far more polarizing a black gop presidential candidate the decision to remake himself would be the culmination of a long political journey for carson but it also would reveal his sense of destiny and supreme self confidence he knew a run for the white house was likely to exact a steep price on his carefully cultivated public image his against the odds rise from poverty to accomplished pediatric neurosurgeon had made him an african american hero in speeches books and a movie about his life based on his autobiography gifted hands he was inspirational aspirational and apolitical though he d always been conservative he publicly bragged about being a registered independent and he d already deflected another attempt to persuade him to step into the political arena after his prayer breakfast appearance the wall street journal published an editorial proclaiming ben carson for president in response carson told reporters he did not wish to wade into the cesspool of modern politics then he did it anyway he d flirted with running for office before about 11 years ago carson made an appointment with michael steele a black republican who was serving as lieutenant governor of maryland steele remembered the surprising discussion carson was thinking about entering into politics steele told him to be cautious all the fancy r sum s and wonderful things you ve done won t matter when someone wants to come after you steele said he told him i ended that discussion and i remember it well by saying why would you want to sully such a wonderful reputation as a neurosurgeon with politics carson just laughed he then sought the counsel of donlin long who was the head of the neurosurgery department at johns hopkins according to long a group of republicans had approached carson about a run for the u s senate long suggested a deeper question what do you want to do with your life there was no way he could do both long explains at his age at that point in his career he had to decide whether he was going to be a politician or a physician carson now 64 chose medicine the realm that had made him famous in 1987 after he d cut the brain blood vessel that connected conjoined infants patrick and benjamin binder a young carson stood in front of microphones and a gaggle of reporters at his first major news conference to describe the surgery the public fascination with the yale educated square jawed soft spoken black surgeon led to book deals biographical plays and public speeches in which he would promise young people that through faith in god and diligent study that they too could lift themselves out of poverty the story of the surgery that made ben carson famous carson felt the message had a special resonance for african americans early in his medical career he grew tired of seeing able bodied people who were not working he said in a december interview with the washington post they had grown dependent on welfare he concluded and he quietly found himself swayed by president ronald reagan s argument that government had become the problem not the solution he didn t talk much then about his political evolution from a flaming liberal to a staunch conservative he was still trying to reconcile his belief that republicans generally did not care about african americans and carson was quickly becoming a prominent figure in black america drawing the praise of liberal civil rights activists such as the rev jesse jackson and the rev al sharpton both said they reached out to carson but could never get a read on him he was always courteous but always elusive we just exchanged words of respect but it never really went beyond that jackson recalled in the spring of 1994 carson found himself in a room at the supreme court for a weekend of networking events with the horatio alger association an exclusive society of high fliers who started their lives in dire poverty attending was justice clarence thomas whose conservative ideals made him such a pariah among african americans that carson was somewhat skeptical of him in supreme discomfort the divided soul of clarence thomas a biography written by two washington post reporters carson said he challenged thomas immediately when they met he asked why thomas was against busing when it was largely seen as a key instrument to help desegregate schools he told me he didn t want these kids thinking they have to go somewhere else to be successful carson recalled in the book he concluded that thomas s argument made a lot of sense after his induction into the horatio alger society carson befriended other members such as terry giles a prominent white lawyer who grew up pumping water in the ozarks and bob brown an african american who had raised hogs in rural north carolina and became an adviser to president richard m nixon together they would laugh at each other s i was so poor jokes behind the humor was a subtle affirmation of the american dream and a reminder that the up from the bootstraps narrative was not exclusive to carson his friends at horatio alger shared similar traits they grew up poor many of them raised by a strong single parent or a grandparent who did not accept excuses they were service oriented and they usually voted republican i came to realize that many of my political beliefs were based on nothing other than propaganda said carson who was a registered republican for a time before switching his party affiliation to independent in 2001 murray carson the eldest of his three children said his father would come home and devour programming on fox news particularly the o reilly factor and hannity and colmes i don t know why people were so surprised he was so conservative or would run for office said murray carson a 32 year old web programmer at our home he loved talking about this stuff as he neared retirement carson could not stop talking about the state of the country in 2011 he co authored a book with his wife candy called america the beautiful that detailed his increasing conservatism carson advocated tough punishments for terrorists proposed a flat tax expressed his admiration for the tea party and voiced disdain for political correctness he had grown frustrated at organizers who asked him not to utter the words jesus christ during his speeches most of all he worried about the legacy of barack obama the president who had eclipsed him as an inspirational figure among african americans carson hated the explosion of the national debt and questioned whether those who supported obama saw anything beyond the fact that he was the first black president carson began to wonder whether his voice could help to loosen the liberal grip on black america s politics he had spent decades building up a reservoir of goodwill he had given hundreds of college scholarships through the carson scholars fund and planted reading rooms in dozens of low income schools throughout the country i always wanted to do what was needed to strengthen the country carson said but i was preoccupied with medicine at the prayer breakfast in 2013 he took his outrage public criticizing obama s policies while standing at a lectern a few feet from the president carson talked about the country being in danger of falling like the roman empire from moral decay and fiscal irresponsibility and he lambasted obama s signature health care overhaul as the president s smile wilted into a grimace a viral video and a conservative folk hero were born armstrong williams the conservative commentator who serves as carson s business manager was thrilled we re going to rachet it up he remembered thinking and they did the newer bolder carson was on television comparing homosexuality to bestiality causing such an uproar that he was forced to apologize then he called the president s health care law the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery many who admired him were stunned say it ain t so sharpton said were his first thoughts when he heard carson s slavery comparison we ve had black republicans before so it s not that he s on the right that is particularly surprising sharpton said it s that he s so far right that winter a conservative activist named mike murray knocked on the door of carson s new retirement home in florida carson answered the door in shorts and a t shirt he invited him to the living room and murray sat near candy carson s organ over three hours murray told carson he wanted him to be the face of an organization that would push for the repeal of obamacare i m concerned about being too political murray remembers carson replying but murray was persuasive people are hungry to hear from you he said and you could do this the right way together they ventured throughout the country urging legislators and voters to sign a petition everywhere they went murray recalled people told carson that he was the right one to deliver the hard truths about the state of the country carson basked in their admiration he said he began to believe that the country needed someone who has been able to utilize the strength of lots of other people as well as their own intellect to solve problems that no one ever solved before maybe that would be a more useful skill set than time in washington d c it has to be someone carson thought as he recalled it in an interview earlier last year then he chuckled maybe it just happens to be me then came a sign from the divine according to murray the two men had agreed that carson would call the 100 000th person to sign the health care petition the woman did not want her full name made public murray said but he identified her in a mailer as a woman named emily from virginia when carson reached her murray said she told the neurosurgeon that her dying son was once one of carson s patients he helped to save him now she wanted him to run for president to save the country i couldn t believe it murray said everyone will think she was a plant in a february 2014 email to supporters carson wrote that he might have received a wink from above that november carson grabbed a voter registration form in florida in the party field he checked republican carson had written a whole book about making tough choices in take the risk he laid out four key questions what s the best thing that can happen if i do this what s the worst thing that can happen if i do this what s the best thing that can happen if i don t do it what s the worst thing that can happen if i don t do it now he asked himself those questions about a presidential campaign the best thing that would happen if he ran people would respond positively to my message he said and we could get back on the right track to restore the concept of fiscal responsibility the worst thing i would lose something that he hates to do and you d get someone who had very bad ideas in there he said he considered the best case scenario if he didn t run the election of another candidate who would do a good job but that seemed far less likely than the worst case scenario another failed president before he made any decisions there was one person williams wanted carson to see in january 2015 williams drove him to the steps of the supreme court are you kidding me carson told williams starting to laugh awaiting carson in his chambers was justice thomas he warned me carson recalled if you re black and conservative anything is fair game in terms of trying to destroy you giles echoed thomas s warning during a visit to the carson home everyone loves you giles said he told carson if you run at least half the country is not going to like you anymore are you ready for it the warnings would quickly prove true carson would be derided for suggesting that millions of armed jews would have survived the holocaust he d be laughed at for pronouncing the name of the militant group hamas as if it were a mediterranean chickpea dip some of the details in the carson autobiography about his temper would be questioned by reporters and disparaged by gop rival donald trump as impossible to believe crap and his campaign would first soar and then stumble with top advisers resigning in a new year s eve campaign shake up but as giles and his wife sat with ben and candy carson on the porch of their florida home carson was resolute i need to do what is best for my family and my country carson told giles if somebody dislikes me for that that s okay with me he seemed ready giles said so i was in the doctor turned candidate had spoken the country needed a new direction and so did he
