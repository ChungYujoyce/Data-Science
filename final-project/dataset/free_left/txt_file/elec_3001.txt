more than 300 pledged delegates which was down to 263 before tuesday s contest in wisconsin according to an associated press tally sanders invested significant time in wisconsin not leaving the badger state in the final four days leading up to the primary and making an unadvertised campaign stop at a milwaukee diner tuesday morning if people come out to vote in large numbers i think we re going to do very very well sanders told reporters as he entered blue s egg with barbara lawton a former wisconsin lieutenant governor sanders aggressively sought to highlight his more insular views on trade an issue that he s pressed in other midwestern industrial states as well as clinton s ties to wall street wisconsin was viewed as difficult terrain for clinton in 2008 the state s democratic electorate was 87 percent white voters whom sanders has consistently won in nominating contests this year its industrial landscape large bloc of independent voters and substantial working class also were seen as fertile ground for sanders s message of rethinking u s trade policy in 2008 clinton lost the state by 17 points to then sen barack obama this time she campaigned lightly here focusing strategically on cities in congressional districts that played to her strengths including milwaukee where she is popular with a large african american electorate she highlighted that she unlike sanders has been a democrat her whole adult life she emphasized her commitment to supporting democratic candidates at the state and local levels a salient issue for a state party that has been waging fierce ideological

over the coming two weeks as well while he will make some campaign stops in other states with upcoming nominating contests aides say he plans to return to new york city most nights reflecting the hard to overstate consequences of the primary his decision to campaign tuesday in wyoming was born of a desire to add to his momentum heading into new york by notching a win in the state s caucuses saturday though only 14 delegates are in play at this time in 2008 obama s pledged delegate lead over clinton fluctuated between 120 and 140 delegates about half of the margin by which clinton now leads sanders and that doesn t include superdelegates the elected officials and other party leaders who are not bound by their state s results and who so far have broken heavily in clinton s favor sanders aims to catch clinton in pledged delegates those won in primary elections once california votes june 7 doing so would require lopsided wins in most of the remaining contests including some in states that have demographics similar to places where he has struggled if sanders catches clinton or gets close both candidates would enter the party s convention in july without enough pledged delegates to claim the nomination that would force the party s superdelegates who are automatically made convention delegates to choose the nominee a scenario sanders s campaign manager reiterated during an interview tuesday on cnn the sanders campaign has started making the case to superdelegates that they should side with him because he is more electable than clinton against republican front
