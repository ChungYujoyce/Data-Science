former vice president dick cheney may hate donald trump but he s fine with him leading the country former political reporter dick cheney s presidential pick is a man he once suggested was a 9 11 truther cheney reportedly told cnn on friday he intends to support the gop nominee in 2016 just as he has every prior cycle this is surprising shortly after the first presidential debate cheney told fox news bret baier that the real estate mogul s assertions regarding the september 11 attacks including that george w bush willingly let them happen were way off base he clearly doesn t understand or has not spent any time learning about the facts of that period cheney said it s um misleading for him to campaign on that basis he added it s a little curious that cheney has decided to board the trump train it s also a break from the rest of bush world as representatives for george h w bush and george w bush say neither former president will back the mogul s presidential bid but in fairness trump may not be too thrilled with cheney s endorsement either in 2011 trump made a youtube video for his from the desk of donald trump series a series i cannot recommend highly enough in which the presumptive nominee trashed the former vp and his then newly released memoir he s very very angry and nasty the mogul said i didn t like cheney when he was a vice president i don t like him now and i don t like people that rat out everybody like he s doing in the book i m sure it ll be a best seller but isn t it a shame here s a guy that did a rotten job as vice president nobody liked him tremendous divisiveness and he s gonna be making a lot of money on the book i won t be reading it and in 2008 trump said he was disappointed nancy pelosi didn t push to impeach bush over the iraq war it just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach bush and get him out of office which personally i think would have been a wonderful thing he said discussing nancy pelosi with wolf blitzer on the situation room in the same interview trump asserted that bush deliberately lied to persuade americans to support the iraq war a view that cheney et al unsurprisingly find deeply problematic he got us into the war with lies he continued and i mean look at the trouble bill clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant and they tried to impeach him which was nonsense and yet bush got us into this horrible war with lies by lying by saying they had weapons of mass destruction by saying all sorts of things that turned out not to be true speaking of national security cheney told radio host hugh hewitt in december that trump s proposed ban on muslim immigration goes against everything we stand for and believe in religious freedom s been a very important part of our history and where we came from he added but if cheney has anything to do with it then trump s america is where we re going
