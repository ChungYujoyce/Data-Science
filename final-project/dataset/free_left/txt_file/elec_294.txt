advertisement supported by by jonathan martin milford n h bill clinton uncorked an extended attack on senator bernie sanders on sunday harshly criticizing mr sanders and his supporters for what he described as inaccurate and sexist attacks on hillary clinton when you re making a revolution you can t be too careful with the facts mr clinton said deriding mr sanders s oft mentioned call for a political revolution the former president addressing a few hundred supporters at a junior high school here portrayed his wife s opponent for the democratic nomination as hypocritical hermetically sealed and dishonest he even likened an incident last year in which sanders staffers obtained access to clinton campaign voter data to stealing a car with the keys in the ignition mr clinton discussed the race for nearly 50 minutes and his comments took on a harder edge the longer he spoke what began as a testimonial to mrs clinton s leadership and a statesmanlike lecture on her approach to issues evolved into an angrier recitation of grievances against mr sanders and his fervent supporters anybody that doesn t agree with me is a tool of the establishment mr clinton said mocking what he described as the central critique of mrs clinton by mr sanders 14 photos view slide show mr clinton s comments represented an escalation in the language that he and mrs clinton s campaign have used to attack mr sanders who has maintained a sizable advantage in the polls here mr clinton made headlines in 2008 for fiercely defending his wife and leveling tough attacks on senator barack obama but he has been largely restrained so far in this campaign his heated remarks here reflected the frustration the clintons felt two days before the primary in a state that has rewarded them in the past but that appears ready to hand mr sanders a decisive victory mr clinton seemed especially irritated that new hampshire after lifting his 1992 bid for the democratic nomination and handing her a comeback win in 2008 would now abandon his wife criticizing mr sanders s hastily presented health care plan which mr clinton claimed the vermont senator had already disavowed the former president asked is it good for america i don t think so is it good for new hampshire i don t think so he continued the new hampshire i knew would not have voted for me if i had done that but mr clinton s most pointed remarks may have been when he took aim at sanders supporters who he said use misogynistic language in attacking mrs clinton he told the story of a female progressive blogger who defended mrs clinton online through a pseudonym because he said the vitriol from mr sanders s backers was so unrelenting she and other people who have gone online to defend hillary to explain why they supported her have been subject to vicious trolling and attacks that are literally too profane often not to mention sexist to repeat mr clinton growing more demonstrative added that the liberal journalist joan walsh had faced what he called unbelievable personal attacks for writing positively about mrs clinton in a demonstration of how engrossed he is in this campaign mr clinton recited the names of the regional newspapers that are backing his wife s campaign and in a rarity mentioned mr sanders by name bernie took what they said was good about him and put it in his own endorsements said mr clinton fuming that mr sanders used complimentary language from a nashua telegraph endorsement of mrs clinton in his own campaign appeals then reflecting the fury among clinton campaign advisers over what they see as the kinds of behavior mr sanders gets away with mr clinton noted that the senator s campaign had used the image of an american legion officer in new hampshire without his permission a week in february 1992 revived bill clinton s presidential campaign and made the state hallowed ground for the clintons if you point it out it just shows how tied you are to the establishment he said in a response tad devine a senior adviser to mr sanders called it disappointing that president clinton has decided to launch these attacks and said mr sanders would continue to focus on his message against the rigged economy campaign finance corruption and income inequality obviously the race has changed in new hampshire and elsewhere in recent days mr devine said the appearance by mr clinton absent the entourage and crowds that usually surround the former president was striking and somewhat poignant and it felt far apart from the frenzied final campaigning happening around the state on sunday the junior high school s small gym was not full and only a handful of reporters showed up at a time when campaign events are being flooded with dozens of national and international journalists but with mrs clinton in flint mich and other clinton staffers absorbed in the primary mr clinton seemed almost on his own he was introduced by a local mayor and larry lucchino the former chief executive of the boston red sox recalling his own formative experience in this state mr clinton sounded wistful in reminiscing about his duels with paul tsongas the massachusetts senator who beat him here when i campaigned against paul tsongas we actually had substantive debates he said with perhaps a selective memory given the intense attacks at the time over allegations of mr clinton s sexual misconduct and his avoidance of the draft now he complained mrs clinton is suffering through attacks from a would be purist who he said is in reality a veteran politician hardly unfamiliar with the ways of politics citing mr sanders s attendance at a lobbyist filled democratic party fund raiser mr clinton expressed astonishment i practically fell out of my chair when i saw it he said turning to a vivid metaphor mr clinton suggested that sanders staff members obtaining clinton campaign voter data amounted to grand theft mr sanders apologized for the incident but the former president dismissed that he said that in private they sent an email out noting that the democratic party had left the keys in the car and all i did was drive off that line won laughs which seemed to be what mr clinton was going for i want you to laugh he told the crowd but he did not seem to be in the mood for levity advertisement
