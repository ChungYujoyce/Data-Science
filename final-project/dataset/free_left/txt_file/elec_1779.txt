 the politico caucus one day after the paris attacks democrats viewed him as unprepared to talk in depth about foreign policy by katie glueck 11 15 2015 06 50 am est politico illustration getty bernie sanders had the weakest night of the three democrats onstage at saturday night s debate that s according to a survey of the politico caucus a bipartisan group of influential strategists operatives and activists in iowa new hampshire south carolina and nevada who weighed in immediately following the second democratic primary debate advertisement nearly half of democrats surveyed said the vermont senator lost the debate and only 10 percent of democrats said he won those insiders who said sanders had the worst night argued that he appeared out of his depth on foreign policy a day after terrorist attacks rocked france he spent just a few seconds addressing the matter in his opening statement before pivoting to his familiar pitch about the economy in stark contrast to rival hillary clinton a former secretary of state who devoted her entire statement to the paris attacks he made a mistake right off the bat in switching from paris to the economy and had an uneven performance a new hampshire democrat said he was clearly not comfortable discussing detail on foreign policy matters agreed another new hampshire democrat others said the self described democratic socialist made no effort to appeal to the broader democratic party and reinforced perceptions saturday night that he is unelectable focused entirely on his base which demands the pure said an unaligned iowa democrat worst answer asked directly how he would work with a gop congress he argued that the political revolution would sweep aside all in its path the early primaries and caucuses are getting closer and closer and he is failing to come across as viable and presidential to pick up the new supporters he needs said a nevada democrat who instead thought martin o malley won time is running out agreed a new hampshire democrat sanders showed he is just too out of step with middle america to be president seventy seven percent of democratic insiders surveyed called clinton the winner saying that of the three candidates on the stage she showed the most presidential stature it was a very good night for o malley but secretary clinton still proved that she is the most prepared to be potus said an unaligned south carolina democrat added a new hampshire democrat not even close hillary clinton once again demonstrated her mastery of all issues both foreign and domestic she was truly presidential sen sanders and gov o malley are both fine men but their issue knowledge stops at the water s edge o malley who took direct aim at clinton over her ties to wall street and her record on gun control lags badly in the polls but insiders said he had a slightly better night than sanders did with 13 percent naming him the winner and 41 percent saying he had the worst night o malley showed he deserved to be in that stage and should be taken seriously a new hampshire democrat said agreed a new hampshire republican how could bernie say climate change was a bigger threat than terrorism given last night how could hillary invoke 9 11 as a reason for accepting contributions from wall street o malley seemed to be the only one that didn t have a tin ear among republicans nearly half said clinton won and were close to evenly divided on which candidate lost but sanders pulled the most votes on that question he s the new metric for far left and it s awesome gloated a south carolina republican however some republicans flagged clinton missteps that they expect their candidates to seize on including when she cited her senate work on behalf of new yorkers following the september 11 terrorist attacks as a reason she has so many wall street donors hrc will be reminded of several blunders from this debate said an iowa republican not the least of which is throwing 9 11 up as a block to the criticism that she takes quite a bit of campaign money from wall street these are the members of the politico caucus not all of whom participated this week iowa tim albrecht brad anderson rob barron
