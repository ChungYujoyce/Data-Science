advertisement supported by the conversation but does she have trump s number and what is going on with him anyway by gail collins and bret stephens ms collins and mr stephens are opinion columnists they converse every other week bret stephens hi gail did you read our friend frank bruni s column this past weekend it s one of the most thought provoking articles i ve read in a while about the likely shape of the 2020 race and it contains this fascinating nugget 19 republicans in congress have already announced that they won t seek another term in their current office and most of them are just retiring from politics altogether instead of seeking a higher office frank calls them bellwethers and suggests that republicans are limping toward a disastrous election day do you draw the same conclusion gail collins definitely agree it was a fascinating column it certainly cheered me up but i want to hear a little more about your take i know you d do anything to see trump defeated well almost anything we will have to return to your refusal to consider voting for elizabeth warren but are you rooting for a democratic congress in 2020 too you live in jerry nadler s district right will you be voting for him to keep running the house judiciary committee bret ideally i want a democrat in the white house and republican control of the senate or the senate and house together if the next democratic president leans too far left divided government is one of the blessings of the american system let nadler try to impeach in the house and wiser heads in the senate save us from president pence gail remember the olden days when senators were just into making deals i used to complain about their lack of passion boy do i miss lack of passion as things stand now if we have a democratic president and house a republican majority in the senate would just devote itself to perpetual obstruction plus remember the way the senate rules work even minority leader mitch mcconnell would still have plenty of power to hold everything up for ransom bret i think frank s column definitely points to further republican losses in congress but i m not at all sure whether that will translate to a democratic victory for the presidency i ve lost hope that pete buttigieg can win the nomination and i m pretty sure that kamala harris and bernie sanders can t so that leaves the democratic race coming down to a race between warren and joe biden that is between a blade most americans may find too sharp and one they fear is too dull gail you may notice that biden warren and sanders are the three candidates the voters are familiar with it s so hard to come out of relative obscurity and get the kind of attention and confidence you d need to win a presidential nomination barack obama did it but he was an extraordinary campaigner and of course there was the excitement of having the first black president donald trump did it but he was a reality tv star i don t know if even in the age of round the clock social media anybody from the real world could pull off that kind of leap to fame bret it s a shame because i think the democratic field has some first rate talents who could beat trump but that the party has just discounted at least so far michael bennet steve bullock amy klobuchar what is it about them that just doesn t excite the base gail think back on the obama comparison people used to faint at his rallies they were so excited the names you mentioned are all fine people with good ideas but i wouldn t call any of them electric bret true though you have to love michael bennet s latest campaign pledge if you elect me president i promise you won t have to think about me for two weeks at a time lord give me a president like that gail speaking of um electric let s move on to shocking which do you think will hurt trump more the fact that he played golf while americans were being threatened by a terrible hurricane or the fact that he doctored the weather map to make it look as if he was actually right about the storm going to alabama bret remember when he used to slam president obama for playing too much golf go on gail both of those worry me more than his much larger recent bad decisions because they go beyond bad judgment to a kind of egomaniacal delusion where s the most obscure dictatorship in the world i ll bet even there the head man wouldn t go on tv to show the country a map that looked like it had been doctored by an overreaching third grade geography student is it too much to wish for a president who s at least capable of competent forgery bret you know if you squint hard the trump presidency could be a darkly comic tv show imagine house of cards but with steve martin or rowan atkinson in the role of president underwood alternatively perhaps the more accurate comparison might be to the sequel to the stephen king horror flick it chapter two i ve been thinking about this a lot lately in terms of our approach to the rest of the world protesters in hong kong are waving american flags singing the star spangled banner and imploring trump to stand up on their behalf but the administration has basically been mute we were about to pull the plug on afghanistan until some last minute disagreements snagged our withdraw and surrender deal but trump appears to be perfectly indifferent to what the return of the taliban would mean to the afghan people particularly afghan women and then there s the news that the administration is mulling a plan to slash the number of refugees we take in each year i m the son of a refugee my patriotism is deeply tied to my gratitude for a country that took in my impoverished mother and grandmother when they had no other country and no other place to go the thought that the administration wants to deny the chance they gave my mom to thousands of similarly stateless people today makes me feel physically ill gail bret that was so beautifully said that i am going to give you a break and not ask you if this means you ll vote for elizabeth warren if she s the nominee bret at this point she s almost tempting me on the theory that an empty wallet beats an upset stomach gail let s end as cheerfully as we began hey it s football season and although i had no interest whatsoever in football until trump was elected president i m now finding it a relief to talk about something other than politics so how about those patriots bret i sometimes have the feeling that if we conversed more about football than about politics we might also disagree more the patriots are loathsome ninety five percent of america hates them with excellent reason and bernie sanders probably roots for them which means they must be communists also tom brady s an overrated quarterback the most he s good for is
