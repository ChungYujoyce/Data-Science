watch cbsn live by caitlin o kane may 14 2020 4 23 pm cbs news a team of researchers studied the transmission of the coronavirus between cats and found that felines are capable of infecting each other with the virus there have not been any known cases of a cat spreading covid 19 to a person but the scientists say it s possible felines could be a silent intermediate host for the virus and they believe more research is needed this is of particular importance given the potential for sars cov 2 transmission between family members in households with cats while living under shelter in place orders they write in a letter published in thenew england journal of medicine on wednesday the research team lead by yoshihiro kawaoka professor of pathobiological sciences at the university of wisconsin school of veterinary medicine inoculated three cats with the virus and then introduced three other uninfected cats to the group in five days the three previously uninfected cats had caught the virus they note that none of the cats ever showed any signs of illness the researchers say recent reports of covid 19 transmission from humans to pet cats and between big cats at the bronx zoo coupled with their recent data shows there is a public health need to recognize and further investigate the potential chain of human cat human transmission previous studies have shown that cats and ferrets are susceptible to the virus but dogs less so both kawaoka and peter halfmann a research professor at university of wisconsin madison who helped lead the study advise people with covid 19 symptoms to avoid contact with cats they also say cat owners should keep their pets indoors to limit the interaction their cats have with other animals and people it s something for people to keep in mind halfmann said if they are quarantined in their house and are worried about passing covid 19 to children and spouses they should also worry about giving it to their animals while the cats in the study did not show any symptoms a tiger at the bronx zootested positive for the viruslast month after developing a dry cough and decrease in appetite zoo officialsbelieve the tiger was likely infected by a human caretaker three other tigers and three african lions also developed symptoms and all were expected to recover the zoo said according to the cdc there is still much to learn about this virus but we know it is primarily spreading from person to person and it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations the cdc has issuedguidelines for pet owners regarding covid 9 while the cdc says there is there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes covid 19 there have been instances where other viruses spread that way in 2016 an h7n2 influenza outbreak in cats at a new york city animal shelter infected a veterinarian a case that highlighted the public health implications of cat to human transmission to workers in animal shelters according to the authors of the new study the researchers say that given the need to stop the coronavirus pandemic studying the role cats may play in the transmission of the disease to humans is needed dr ann hohenhaus an internal medicine and small animal veterinarian at new york city s animal medical center spoke to cbs news about what the study means for pet owners is there a hard and fast study that says cats can absolutely not spread this to humans no said hohenhaus who was not part of the study but we also have no evidence of the converse which is that cats are spreading it to people this study doesn t change that hohenhaus said there are millions of people worldwide infected with covid 19 but only a smattering of reports of cats she also explained how cats could potentially catch the virus from humans but might not be able to transmit it back to them how a virus works is that the virus gets to your body and then your cells have to have a receptor that the virus plugs into and then that receptor drags the virus into the cells hohenhaus said so it s kind of like an outlet and a plug on a cord if you ve got a three prong cord and a two prong outlet then the virus won t get in so cats clearly have a receptor that matches the virus hohenhaus also said cats might not replicate the virus in their cells as well as humans do she explained that when people have a high viral load in their bodies they appear to get sicker with covid 19 than people with lower viral levels so since cats don t seem to get very sick maybe they don t have a very high virus level and therefore they don t make enough virus in their cells that when they sneeze it back out their nose there s not enough virus to make people sick it s not unheard of for an animal to transmit a virus to humans hohenhaus said however she wants to remind pet owners that this new article highlights what veterinarians think and that is more research is necessary it does not change our recommendation that if you are sick social distance your pets quarantine yourself away from everyone in the family that includes the pets she continued and if you ve got covid 19 and your pet is acting sick please call your veterinarian and talk about what s going on so a safe plan for everyone can be made for your pet first published on may 14 2020 4 23 pm 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights
