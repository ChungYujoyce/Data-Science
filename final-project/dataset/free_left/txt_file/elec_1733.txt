jeb s tried to be what the voters want him to be but it hasn t been enough and on friday it all seemed to be drawing to a close greenville south carolina to reach the theater where jeb bush was speaking here on friday afternoon you d need first to walk through a doorway above which a six foot tall cross stood hammered into the wall bush is polling on average at 10 3 percent in the state behind donald trump ted cruz and marco rubio on friday the biggest story about his campaign was one that declared it was running on fumes hemorrhaging confidence from his supporters and donors just when he needs it most as a last resort 24 hours before the republican primary he dragged his 90 year old mother barbara out on the campaign trail with him for three separate town hall events what he needed was more like a 30 foot cross and maybe a few rabbit s feet and four leaf clovers he stood at the center of the stage no lectern and awkwardly dangled his stiff arms at his sides as he spoke thanks to his paleo diet he is a shell of his former self sleek and modern in a slim cut blazer and pants on this particular day he wore no glasses behind him a row of his remaining boosters sat congenially among them barbara columba his wife and lindsey graham the senator from south carolina who was himself running for the republican nomination until december much has been said about bush s demeanor throughout this campaign he seems to vacillate between detachment and frustration with the process at times he just seems sad giving the sort of contemplative spaced out looks that make for the perfect absurdist vines it s not the kind of viral content a campaign hopes for exactly but then this is not the sort of campaign that the candidate had hoped for either i feel like i m in some sort of play bush said to the audience in bush s mind the media has dictated the supposedly democratic process in 2016 and treated it like a tabloid story feeding the american public s appetite for more drama read trump too wonky and polite to serve as a lead bush has become a bit character in this season of america and frankly this is not the sort of arc he was promised at the initial casting we re all part of a narrative he said mockingly borrowing the language of tv political pundits i always thought narratives were part of a play you know where you just kind of play out your part the narrative is that there s an establishment lane and then there s the outsider lane and i m in the establishment lane because i am the son of george h w bush and the brother of george w bush i got that i m proud of it it doesn t bother me a bit later as he posed for a photo he complained to a supporter about how hard it is to break through because of the media the media as it was stood huddled around him within earshot he made awkward eye contact and swiftly told the supporter that the media s job of vetting presidential candidates is actually important work and personally he welcomes the scrutiny a man jostled to get his baby girl s photo taken with the next president of the united states getting into an argument with a photographer who stood in his way in the process it was jarring to hear someone describe bush that way as the next president because unlike other candidates he doesn t even pretend like he thinks it ll happen during a speech in january cruz said when heidi s first lady french fries are coming back to the cafeteria it was a joke ostensibly but you get the feeling sometimes that before they ve even won a considerable number of delegates candidates are making plans to redo the molding and install a hot tub in the oval office in contrast during his speech on friday bush said at one point i think the first thing that our president should do not the first thing that i will do as president but the first thing that our president should do the closest bush got to indulging in fantasy was halfheartedly asking the crowd do you want veto corleone his alleged nickname as governor to go to washington d c and maybe that s why he hasn t gained momentum to borrow another phrase from the pundits bush a genteel wasp spent a great deal of time on friday condemning what he perceives to be trump s rudeness but what trump s supporters believe is his matter of factness donald trump man insulting women hispanics the disabled pows like john mccain he said donald trump has never showed any interest in anybody else other than himself he s so nice that he couldn t even bring himself to complete his insults against cruz and rubio the latter being his central rival in the establishment lane he started out being tough the two candidates that are gifted speakers marco rubio and ted cruz have shown nothing in their pasts that would suggest they can make a tough decision then in his next breath he complimented them and walked it back completely they re very good at their own ambitions for sure and they re talented beyond belief it s possible they could do the job i m not suggesting otherwise they re far better than hillary clinton or bernie sanders don t get me wrong
