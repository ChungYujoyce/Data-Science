written by eric boehlert published 10 11 16 10 31 am edt share comment the big dig has begun at a time when most presidential campaigns are trying to widen their reach to the largest possible audience during the final weeks of the campaign donald trumpseems to be consciously contracting and burrowing down rattled by the release ofaudio tapesthat revealed the predatory language he uses about women and how he plots his assaults on them trump s been withdrawing into the fringe media this retreat is even deeper into the confines of non reality than trump s previouswithdrawal into the fox news bubble that was when beginning latesummer trump began appearing almost exclusively on fox news and then within fox news appearingalmost exclusivelyon the show of his most ardent supporter sean hannity and the friendly confines of fox friends trump s current withdrawal is like having hannity then hand trump the keys to asmall bunker beneath the fox news bubble and trying to run a white house campaign from there for trump the fox news bubble is a reassuring place where his campaign is always soaring and nobody cares about his tax returns but the bunker atmosphere is perhaps even more pronounced it s where hillary s a bitch who needsto be imprisonedfor imaginary crimes against the state starting with benghazi and where talk from middle aged men about grabbing pussy and trying to fuck married women can be dismissed as boys being boys it represents thedarkest regionsof the conservative media it s basically the breitbart news dungeon breitbart of course being a haven for people who think fox news is too polite and restrained populated by a cranky collection of mediaoutcasts trolls andbottom feeders trump has embraced them all inviting them into his sanctum as his campaignimplodes his crew is now trashingwhat s left of the republican party while trump and his cadre have their eyes fixed on the prize obsessing over allegations of sexual assault and harassment by former president bill clinton the am talk radio bunker is the kind of place where let trump be trump reigns as a guiding philosophy and at the debate prowling the stagewith a permanent scowl on his face trump waved that flag and marked the occasion with relentless attacks against hillary clinton s husband trump and his cadre of advisers evendreamt up a schemewhere bill clinton would be forced to shake hands with his accusers why millions of tuned in voters likely asked was the republican nominee in 2016 fixating on allegations about bill clinton from decades ago especially whenhe s not even running for office politically the strategy makes no sense for a general election candidate trying to lure independent voters during the home stretch of a campaign veteran republicans have long recoiled from dredging up accusations that have been leveled against bill clinton considering it as a losing strategy that turns off voters cnn reported this week and ayougovfrom august confirmed that well known fact 62 percent of respondents said that it would be inappropriate for donald trump to bring up bill clinton s past personal behavior as a way to attack hillary clinton the focus now from trump and his media surrogates like rudygiuliani who actually spent time in the post debate spin roomsundaynighttalking excitedlyabout bill clinton s semen is that hillary s husband acted horribly just as birtherism for years whipped up white hot elements of the conservative base while simultaneously doing damage to the republican party s image broken record attacks on hillary over allegations about her husband s behavior from two decades ago remain a political loser for republicans so the obvious question is why why does there remain a small but obviously powerful pocket within the republican party or at least within the trump campaign and within the fringe confines of the conservative media that sees this topic as the most important issue facing america right wing journalists and operatives have been laying the groundwork for an attack on bill clinton s sexual history for months wrotemichelle goldberg atslatelate last year in truth the plotting has been going on for years withsundaynight s debate being the culmination of a manic campaign to try to humiliate the first female presidential nominee in the u s by shaming her with allegations about her husband and that s what trump s pre debate stunt was all about the press conference where reporters weren t allowed to ask any questions to the clinton accusers the candidate flew in for the event with trump flanked at a long narrow table by the clinton accusers it looked like a twisted version of the last supper wrotemargaret sullivan at thewashington post at breitbart readers were told trump crushed clinton in the debate despite the fact that he lost the debate according to polls of viewers meanwhile trump surrogate newt gingrich cheered the idea that clinton was totally rattled by the trump campaign stunt and that appears to be the entire goal of this last ditch campaign effort to stoke the fascination of the bunker dwellers and their remaining hardcore supporters i t will satisfy the breitbart wing of the conservative movement who only ever wanted to see someone really stick it to hillary clinton the way they would if given the chance wrote noah rothman at the conservative magazine commentary but there is no evidence that trump will benefit from this in the polls a new nbc wsj poll showed trumptrailing by 11 points politically the topic represents a guaranteed dead end for the republican party ask newt gingrich about the1998midterms but from trump s fringe media bunker it remains an oddly irresistible target as his campaign burrows even further underground video audio 05 26 20 10 46 pm edt
