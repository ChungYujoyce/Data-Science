advertisement supported by the president s comments could derail a bipartisan deal to extend three f b i tools for national security investigations they expire sunday by charlie savage and nicholas fandos washington three f b i tools for investigating terrorism and espionage will expire at least temporarily on sunday after president trump suggested on thursday that he might veto a bipartisan surveillance bill to extend them and the senate left town without voting on it the intervention by the president known for his unpredictability on surveillance policy potentially disrupted an agreement to resolve a broad debate over national security and privacy related to the foreign intelligence surveillance act or fisa many republican senators want me to veto the fisa bill until we find out what led to and happened with the illegal attempted coup of the duly elected president of the united states and others mr trump wrote on twitter mr trump s comments came a day after the house had passed a bipartisan bill to extend the expiring tools while also adding safeguards to national security wiretapping under fisa several of the president s most vocal allies backed the legislation and senator mitch mcconnell republican of kentucky and the majority leader enthusiastically urged swift passage of the house s bill but on thursday the republicans whom mr trump had referred to in his tweet raised objections that prevented the senate from passing the bill on an expedited basis an attempt to extend the expiring authorities for 45 days to buy more time also fell apart by the day s end senators left town for the weekend and republican leaders had plans to pass the house s agreement early next week when they have more time with hopes that mr trump would ultimately relent and sign it into law the president did not explain whether he was suggesting that he might not sign the bill negotiated this week by speaker nancy pelosi and representative kevin mccarthy of california the house republican leader or a short term extension that republican senators were contemplating but the intervention showed that mr trump remains an unpredictable and volatile decision maker on surveillance legal policy republicans in the house thought they had assurances from the white house that mr trump would sign their bill before they voted because the bill will not be passed by sunday the f b i will at least temporarily lose three powers that lawmakers created after the sept 11 attacks they include the authority to get a court order for business records that are relevant to a terrorism or espionage investigation the powers lapsed briefly once before in 2015 because of a similar stall in the senate the impact of a short term gap may be small any existing court orders for business records and special types of wiretaps for example will still be valid during the lull and the f b i can most likely use other authorities like grand jury subpoenas from its criminal investigative toolbox as a workaround still the lapse could cause some operational headaches and the spectacle of governing dysfunction arising from congress in the national security arena and a measure for which there is very likely majority support was striking mr trump and his supporters are invested in promulgating a conspiracy theory that the f b i s counterintelligence investigation into russia s efforts to manipulate the 2016 presidential election was actually a politically motivated attempt to sabotage his presidency not a legitimate attempt to understand a foreign power s interference in american democracy an investigation by the justice department s independent inspector general michael e horowitz concluded that the russia investigation including efforts to understand the nature of numerous links between russia and the trump campaign had a lawful basis and found no evidence that its opening was politically motivated mr horowitz did however uncover serious errors and omissions in one aspect of the inquiry investigators applications for permission from the fisa court to wiretap carter page a former trump campaign foreign policy adviser with many links to russian officials none of the expiring tools were involved in the page applications but the legislation to extend them has become a vehicle for congress to respond to the inspector general s findings the house bill for example would push the fisa court to appoint an outsider to critique the government s arguments when a wiretap application raised serious issues about first amendment activity which could include political campaigns even before mr trump s twitter remark it was uncertain whether the house s rewrite could pass the senate in time to prevent the expiring f b i tools from temporarily lapsing under senate rules senators can express their displeasure by slowing legislation moving through the chamber for days though not stopping it in this case senator mike lee republican of utah threatened to use procedural tools to hinder its passage if mr mcconnell brought the bill for consideration on thursday mr lee does not believe the house s language sufficiently protects americans civil liberties from government spying and he said on thursday afternoon that rights are at stake and that all he was really demanding was a full debate this is unjust this is unrealistic this is unsustainable mr lee said civil libertarians on the right and the left made similar objections in the house but several of mr trump s staunchest conservative allies including representatives jim jordan of ohio and devin nunes of california who have led the attack on the f b i over the page spying case lent their approval to the bill so did attorney general william p barr when mr mcconnell took to the senate floor earlier thursday to endorse the bill he indicated that he knew that mr lee and other civil libertarian minded lawmakers would objected that the bill did not go far enough but made clear he did not intend to let them win it is not a question of if this passes but when mr mcconnell said i hope that my colleagues who may not choose to vote for this legislation will not deny this body the opportunity to renew these authorities today to prevent any lapse in 2018 when another part of the complex legal architecture governing national security surveillance a law known as section 702 of the fisa amendments act which permits warrantless wiretapping of foreigners abroad was about to expire the white house and mr trump s republican allies in congress pushed to renew it with minimal new privacy protections turning back a push by civil libertarians to impose more significant limits but on the cusp of the crucial vote mr trump abruptly denounced the legislation after seeing a commentator on fox news speak critically of it and urge him to change course telling him that his own woes began with surveillance mr trump s unexpected intervention at the time threatened to derail the legislation his own administration had pushed for the house speaker then paul d ryan called mr trump to explain that section 702 involved a different kind of surveillance and eventually got him to walk back his statement the bill passed and mr trump signed it advertisement
