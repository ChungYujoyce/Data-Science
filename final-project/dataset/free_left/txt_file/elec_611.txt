state of the state address and a joint appearance with legislative leaders to unveil an agreement on casino regulation the governor has also been using his executive powers sparingly creating just two commissions and task forces over the past year compared with the roughly two dozen he convened in his first term when he has issued executive orders it has most often been to lower the state flag in honor of someone s death being criticized for spending more time on the campaign trail than at home is an occupational hazard for sitting governors running for president but mr christie s absence has been particularly felt in new jersey democrats and republicans in trenton described mr christie as having abandoned the commanding political role he played earlier in his tenure when by force of personality and public argument he cajoled democratic lawmakers into enacting sweeping reforms responding to predictions that a heavy snowstorm would hit new jersey this weekend mr christie at first resisted taking a break from the campaign trail but on friday with the storm bearing down he relented he announced that he would return to his state to make sure the people of my state feel safe and secure his wife mary pat was to stay in new hampshire but i will be back because i am able to do both things mr christie wrote on twitter the fact is you are never not the governor in interviews mr

election seasons at a campaign stop in iowa last weekend mr christie who travels with a complement of new jersey state troopers for security clad in suits and riding in black s u v s with the state s license plates said he was still doing the important work required of a governor he said he planned to read a 62 page memo about the flood of bills passed in the new legislative session and would hold a conference call with two top aides to discuss it kevin roberts a spokesman for the christie administration said the governor s modest legislative agenda for 2016 was a product of democrats relentless opposition to him mr roberts said mr christie would be asserting his executive powers forcefully in the coming months starting with a review of charter school regulations that the governor announced in his state of the state speech you can run a government but you re only going to be able to achieve reforms when you have a willing partner on the other side of the table mr roberts said we don t have good faith partners across the aisle on every single issue these days anymore if mr christie has sought to project the image of a governor firmly in control his actions in trenton detail the pared down aspirations of his administration as he seeks national office and winds down his time as governor because of term limits he cannot seek a third term in 2017 he has delegated virtually all of his office s public activities to lt gov kim guadagno who has played an increasingly prominent role even when mr christie is in new jersey ms guadagno has met frequently with foreign dignitaries business leaders and civic groups she also attended the funerals of two police officers in december when mr christie was in the state when the governor s office releases schedules these days it typically identifies ms guadagno as the acting governor and directs queries about mr christie s schedule to his campaign staff mr christie has also moved slowly to fill key offices in his administration seven cabinet positions including those of the attorney general and the state treasurer are filled on only an acting basis four of the seven have not had a permanent officer for half a year or more mr roberts faulted the democrats who control the state senate for failing to confirm several of mr christie s nominees to fill those positions permanently in his state of the state address this month mr christie called on the legislature which democrats control to enact only one policy the immediate and total abolition of the state s estate tax vincent prieto the speaker of the state assembly said the idea was dead on arrival mr christie has also eased up on using his executive powers to advance policy the two dozen state task forces commissions and agency divisions he formed in his first term covered policy areas such as homelessness higher education pension fraud and gun violence in the last year the governor has created only two such bodies a state unit on cybersecurity and a commission to review new jersey s process for issuing gun permits mr christie announced the gun permit commission on june 29 the day before he entered the presidential race the move was widely viewed as part of his aggressive courtship of national conservative activists senior state lawmakers said the governor remained accessible by telephone on matters of great importance and had occasionally engaged legislators on urgent concerns this month for example he intervened to help resolve a standoff between speaker prieto and the senate president stephen m sweeney a gloucester county democrat over casino regulation mr prieto a democrat from hudson county said it was difficult to manage the state without consistent participation by the governor as long as mr christie holds veto power mr prieto said democrats cannot develop meaningful legislation on thorny issues without him serving as a negotiating partner a chief example mr prieto said was a looming crunch in state transportation funding that democrats hoped to address in part by increasing the state s gasoline tax i can speak to him in any given week a few times mr prieto said of the governor or it can go a few weeks or a month that i have not had a conversation on the most difficult legislative issues mr prieto said personal interaction was essential i m a people person he said i m not a phone guy in mr christie s absence legislative leaders said two of his top aides had been deputized to act as his proxies regina egea the chief of staff and thomas p scrivo the chief counsel ms guadagno s role as acting governor appears strictly limited she has signed only nine pieces of legislation all of them uncontroversial since the start of mr christie s presidential campaign according to the administration s website those measures included one regulating veterinary clinics and others related to the beekeeping industry jon m bramnick the republican leader in the state assembly said mr christie remained in frequent contact while campaigning returning phone calls and text messages within seconds unless he s in the middle of a speech new jersey democrats mr bramnick said had become less and less cooperative with mr christie and more eager to undercut him during the presidential race running for president is really really hard and somebody s got to do it he said we ve got a governor from new jersey who s willing to do that and i think that is something we should respect advertisement
