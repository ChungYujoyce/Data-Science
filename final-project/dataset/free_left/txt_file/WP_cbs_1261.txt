covid 19 outbreak there are now more than 250 000confirmed coronavirus cases reported across the globe so far over 10 000 people have died from the coronavirus worldwide health officials believe the virus was initially transmitted from animals to humans but thathuman to human transmissionof the flu like illness is now occurring here s what you need to know coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that can cause illnesses as minor as a cold or as serious as middle east respiratory syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars according to the world health organization the viruses can be transmitted from animals to humans the virus that causes sars for example was originally transmitted to humans from a cat like animal called a civet but in some instances as with this outbreak they can also be transmitted from one infected person to another according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention the new virus can cause symptoms including fever cough and shortness of breath some patients only show mild symptoms and recover but others have developed life threatening complications like pneumonia the cdc says symptoms of the 2019 ncov virus can appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after initial exposure most cases are mild but the illness can become severe if a person s immune system cannot repair damage to the lungs caused by the virus according to cbs news medical contributor dr tara narula similar to the flu it s believed the coronavirus can be spread through droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes in one case a hospital patient in china is said to have infected 14 medical workers it also appears to be possible for the virus to be transmitted by infected individuals who are not showing any symptoms at all social distancing according tocbs news chief medical correspondent dr jon lapook is trying to keep yourself away from other people especially large crowds at schools work or events washington governor jay inslee previously told face the nation that his state where the majority of fatal u s coronavirus cases have occurred is considering measures including mandatory social distancing those who are more vulnerable to the virus such as people with weakened immune systems should avoid places like theaters where there are large numbers of people oxford sour world in dataproject explains its flattening the curve graph this way while the total number who get infected might not change the containment measures intend to avoid an outbreak trajectory in which a large number of people get sick at the same time is it really worth while to do all of thissocial distancingandhand washing the answer is yes cbs news chief medical correspondent dr jon lapook says normally right now without any measures the epidemic might go up sharply and go down that peak number of cases could overload the system and that s what people are worried about his comment referred to the first line of the curve graph the worst case scenario line in which the number of cases spikes dramatically there may not be enough doctors the doctors might get sick other clinicians health professionals might get sick you might not have enough ventilators other medical equipment it s a stress on the system he explained if you could do all of these measures and flatten out that curve so instead of a peak up and down it s sort of slowly going out that s a reference to the second line on the curve graph the scenario we hope to see instead of a huge spike on the graph like a steep mountain this line looks more like a gently sloping hill it s still going up and the epidemic may last longer but it s not putting such a stress on the system at that moment lapook said if the peak number stays lower hospitals will be more likely to have enough beds medical staff and specialized equipment like ventilators for patients who need them the race to better understand the virus requires a huge increase in data from patient testing the trump administration isstill playing catch upwith those efforts and as the virus derails election year activities the white house is also facing mounting pressure over whatcritics from both major partiessay has been a poorly coordinated response the u s food and drug administration has so far granted emergency approval to start selling a high speed coronavirus test the test designed to run on a computerized diagnostic system developed by roche will be available immediately and can be run on machines already in place at more than 100 laboratories across the u s according to roche which is based in switzerland one version of the device can test more than 4 000 patients a day while a second can perform nearly 1 500 tests the company announced typically test is administered using a sterile soft plastic stick as health care workers swab the inside of a patient s nose or back of the throat the goal is to collect material that s recently been in the lungs where the virus is believed to replicate that stick then gets sealed up and shipped in a cold container to the testing lab the cdc is strongly emphasizing an all of community approach focused on slowing the transmission of covid 19 and reducing illness and death while minimizing social and economic impacts the cdc advises the general public should practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce the risk of getting sick including airlines and travelers are still sorting out the new travel ban that president trump announced this week that bars most foreign visitors coming to the u s from continental europe for 30 days the ban will affect 7 300 flights and more than 2 million airline seats scheduled from 26 european nations to the u s according to travel data firm cirium the ban starts midnight on friday as for travel elsewhere the cdc advises that crowded travel settings like airports may increase your risk of exposure to covid 19 if there are other travelers with covid 19 for more
