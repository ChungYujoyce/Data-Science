by dahlia lithwick lawsuits demanding that stay at home orders be repealed have been filed this week in maryland minnesota and nevada in michigan a family dollar store security guard was shot after telling a customerto wear a face mask which is mandated throughout the state for all retail stores in oklahoma mcdonald s employees were shot at for asking customers to leave the dining area which was closed due to coronavirus restrictions small but media gobbling gatherings of armed protesters continue to gather demanding that state stay home orders be rescinded using lethal weaponry to demonstrate a power their numbers cannot convey members of the state supreme court in wisconsin hearing arguments in a case challenging the governor s safer at home rules invoked the language of tyranny and the japanese internment to describe the current public health efforts to contain a pandemic president donald trump has tweeted support for the armed militants these are very good people but they are angry they want their lives back again safely and demanded the liberation of the states defiant public intellectuals embrace the general democratic principle that being a grandma killer is a small price to pay for resuming dentist visits and family trips to the zoo the words freedom and liberty have been invoked breathlessly in recent weeks to bolster the case for reopening protesters of state public safety measures readily locate in the bill of rights the varied and assorted freedom to not be masked the freedom to have your toenails soaked and buffed the freedom to open carry weapons into the state capitol the freedom to take your children to the polar bear cage the freedom to worship even if it imperils public safety and above all the freedom to shoot the people who attempt to stop you from exercising such unenumerated but essential rights beyond a profound misunderstanding of the relationship between broad state police powers and federal constitutional rights in the midst of a deadly pandemic this definition of freedom is perplexing chiefly because it seems to assume not simply that other people should die for your individual liberties but also that you have an affirmative right to harm threaten and even kill anyone who stands in the way of your exercising of the freedoms you demand we tend to forget that even our most prized freedoms have limits with regard to speech assembly or weaponry those constraints are not generally something one shoots one s way out of even in a pandemic and simply insisting that your own rights are paramount because you super duper want them doesn t usually make it so to be sure a good number of these protesters and pundits represent fringe groups financed by other fringe groups and amplified by a press that adores conflict the data continues to show that the vast majority of americans are not out on the hustings fighting for the right to infect others for the sake of a mcnugget also it is not irrational in the least to fear a tyrannical government capitalizing on a pandemic it s happening around the world but even for those millions of people genuinely suffering hardship and anxiety it s simply not the case that all freedoms are the same and it s certainly not the case that the federal constitution protects everything you feel like doing whenever you feel like doing it in a superb essay by ibram x kendi in the atlantic this week we re reminded that there is a long standing difference between core notions of what he calls freedom to and freedom from the freedom to harm he points out has its lineage in the slaveholder s constitutional notion of freedom slaveholders disavowed a state that secured any form of communal freedom the freedom of the communityfromslavery from disenfranchisement from exploitation from poverty from all the demeaning and silencing and killing kendi continues by pointing out that these two notions of freedom have long rubbed along uneasily side by side but that those demanding that states open up so they may shop or visit zoos are peeling back the tension between the two from the beginning of the american project the powerful individual has been battling for his constitutional freedom to harm and the vulnerable community has been battling for its constitutional freedom from harm both freedoms were inscribed into the u s constitution into the american psyche the history of the united states the history of americans is the history of reconciling the unreconcilable individual freedom and community freedom there is no way to reconcile the enduring psyche of the slaveholder with the enduring psyche of the enslaved the very idea that it doesn t matter what happens to the larger community so long as the individual has unfettered freedom to do as he pleases is not just a vestige of the slaveholder ethos as charlie warzel points out this week this has been the core animating theory behind the american gun rights movement reduce the debate to an absolutist fight about freedom that eventually narcotizes an entire population into believing that the cost of true liberty is tens of thousands of avoidable gun deaths each year any effort to regulate anything within the vast space between assault weapons for everyone on demand and reasonable gun safety is cast as a dire step toward tyranny as warzel puts it this leads to another version of freedom to in this case the freedom to either do mass harm or the freedom to insist that nothing be done about it this idea of freedom is also an excuse to serve one s self before others and a shield to hide from responsibility in the gun rights fight that freedom manifests in firearms falling into unstable hands during a pandemic that freedom manifests in rejections of masks despite evidence to suggest they protect both the wearers and the people around them it manifests in arejection of public healthby those who don t believe their actions affect others in this narrow worldview freedom has a price in the form of an acceptable number of human lives lost it s a price that will be calculated and then set by a select few the rest of us merely pay it we now find ourselves on the precipice of a moment in which americans must decide whether the price they are willing to pay for the freedom of armed protesters those determined to block hospitals and pundits who want to visit the zoo is their own health and safety polls show that the majority of americans are still deeply devoted to the proposition that their government can protect them from a deadly virus and that they trust their governors and scientists and data far more than they trust the mission accomplished industrial complex that would have them valuing free floating ideas about liberty over the health and indeed lives of essential workers the elderly and their own well being despite the president s recent insistence that this is what all of us as warriors must do as jamil smith points out this cultish view of liberty as demanding mass death in exchange for liberty as in freedom to is an assembly line astroturf version of liberty pushed by those who are already very free their true goal plutocracy is the diametrical opposite of freedom smith writes it is a life lived to spite other lives and often take advantage of them in the coming weeks we will see some relatively small portion of americans with great big megaphones and well financed backers start to openly attack the selfsame health care workers who were celebrated as heroes just a few weeks ago we will see attacks on people wearing masks and attacks on people lawfully asking others to wear masks some leaders will buckle under the pressure to rescind orders with claims that in choosing between liberty and death they went with liberty others like michigan gov gretchen whitmer will respond by insisting that the brandishing of guns inside the state capitol is not in fact liberty and that if it is liberty and justice it is hardly liberty and justice for all but rather for a small minority of people who seek to define freedom as something they will seize and threaten and even kill for a good rule of thumb for covid based discussions about opening up is that if someone is demanding it while threatening to hurt or kill you you are probably not as free as they are and that their project does nothing to increase freedom in america and everything to hoard a twisted idea of freedom for themselves when you hear someone demanding inchoate generalized freedom ask whether he cares at all that millions of workers who clean the zoos and buff the nails and intubate the grandmas are not free these people are cannon fodder for your liberty the long standing tension between individual liberty and the collective good is complicated and as kendi is quick to point out the balance often tilts trade offs are made federal and state governments shift clumsily along together and the balance tilts again nobody denies that individual liberty is essential in a democracy but in addition to parsing whether we as a collective do better in providing the freedom from while also offering some freedom to it s worth asking whether those making zero sum claims about liberty are willing to sacrifice anything for freedom or are just happily sacrificing you readers like you make our work possible help us continue to provide
