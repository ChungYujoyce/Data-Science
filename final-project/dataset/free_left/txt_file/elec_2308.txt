donald trump trailing narrowly in presidential polls has issued a warning to worried republican voters the election will be rigged against him and he could lose as a result trump pointed to several court cases nationwide in which restrictive laws requiring voters to show identification have been thrown out he said those decisions open the door to fraud in november if the election is rigged i would not be surprised he told the washington post in an interview tuesday afternoon the voter id situation has turned out to be a very unfair development we may have people vote 10 times those comments followed a claim trump made monday to an audience in ohio that the election is going to be rigged that same day in an interview with fox news channel s sean hannity he beseeched republicans to start watching closely or the election will be taken away from us through fraud like much of what trump says the rigged riff defies the recent norms of politics and it taps into fears that long predate his campaign one is a growing and unsubstantiated worry that elections are being stolen the other is a broader unease that regular americans are being cheated by wall street by washington and by a duplicitous media those worries have found voice in both parties this year with trump and sen bernie sanders vt both rallying their supporters during the republican and democratic primaries with the assessment that the system is rigged now trump is reviving the theme to highlight the possibility of voter fraud in november trump refuses to support ryan mccain in upcoming republican primaries since the 2000 election which ended in a legal battle that stopped recounts of ballots in florida paranoia about the nation s election system has mushroomed according to a pew research center survey just 48percent of americans were confident that the votes across the country were accurately counted in the 2004 election after 2012 an election with a wider popular vote margin that percentage fell to 31percent among republicans it was 21percent the idea that the person who won the presidency did so illegitimately is not new said jesse walker the author of the united states of paranoia a history of conspiracy theories what s new is the possibility of a possible loser in the presidential contest making an issue out of it i can t think of another example in the last century jokes about democrats counting votes from dead people or bused in fraudsters are part of the republican lingua franca during his unsuccessful presidential bid sen ted cruz tex often encouraged his audiences to bring friends and family to the polls with a joke about democratic election theft i want you to vote 10 times he would say don t worry we re not democrats in his interview with the post trump offered that his chief concern about fraud was that states without strict identification requirements would see rampant repeat voters if you don t have voter id you can just keep voting and voting and voting he said on fox news trump s only evidence for fraud consisted of precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the republican in the 2012 election in reality voter fraud is rare a 2014 study by justin levitt a professor at loyola law school found just 31 possible instances of fraud over 14 years of elections with a total of 1billion votes cast the low republican vote in some urban centers squares with the low support black voters gave gop nominee mitt romney s campaign in 2012 still the battle against voter fraud has made gains with republican lawmakers and conservative journalists since the 2013 decision in shelby county v holder undid some requirements of the voting rights act restrictive new voter id and registration laws have passed through republican run states obama trump is unfit to serve as president those laws have been challenged successfully in court with north carolina north dakota and wisconsin losing cases in the days before trump made his rigged comments north carolina gov pat mccrory accused judges of undermining the integrity of our elections in an interview tuesday with cbs12 in florida trump seemed to condemn the rulings against the states some bad court cases have come down he said some of his more freewheeling supporters went even further with the radio host alex jones warning listeners that the obama administration might cancel the election and off again on again adviser roger stone telling breitbart news that trump needed to be ready for a violent post election contest i think he s gotta put them on notice that their inauguration will be rhetorical stone said i mean civil disobedience not violence but it will be a bloodbath the government will be shut down if they attempt to steal this and swear hillary in to ari berman a reporter for the nation and the author of the voting rights history give us the ballot trump s worry about rigging sounded like an adaptation of something already mainstream among republicans there s been a two decade campaign on the right to drum up fears of voter fraud stealing elections berman said they re trying to say that these voting rights victories will lead to more fraud they want to spin these court victories not as something that s good for democracy but something that will hurt democracy that s what trump is buying into at the same time many supporters of sanders s presidential run have argued that the democratic nomination was effectively stolen from him another sentiment trump has tried to exploit long before the democratic national convention in philadelphia sanders supporters asked whether a purge of new york voters california s slow ballot count or the closure of polling places in arizona s largest county had suppressed their votes the bernie sanders folks don t believe all the ballots were counted chuck pennachio an academic and a sanders delegate from pennsylvania said at a news conference last week they don t believe that the process was clean if you look at the exit polls they don t match up with the results in 11 of the 12 closest states every theory about how the primaries were stolen has been debunked the famous new york purge for example disproportionately affected nonwhite voters who had been breaking for clinton the same was true of the long lines in arizona s maricopa county which resulted from a decision by the county s republican run elections team but in trying to explain how some early exit poll results diverged from vote totals debunkers found themselves struggling to convince their listeners joe lenski the lead pollster for exit poll provider edison research explained to the skeptical left wing site counterpunch that sanders voters and young voters had been more likely to fill out the surveys that did not stop the spread of theories that millions of sanders votes might have been switched or suppressed last week when more than 200 sanders supporters invaded a media tent at the dnc some left behind charts attempting to prove that vote counters skewed the election clinton s 2 9million vote margin in the primaries may have set the upper bounds for speculation that an american election had been stolen sanders supporters also latched onto internal emails between staff members at the democratic national committee in which they speculated about a clinton nomination even before the primaries were over trump who previously accused republicans of rigging primaries through the delegate selection process found solace in the email scandal like sanders whose voters he wants to convert he had found the idea of a rigged process syncing perfectly with his outsider brand on fox news trump tried to tell sanders s supporters that they already had seen an election wrested away by the political elite it was rigged a little bit against me and we won he said it was rigged a little bit against bernie sanders we know it was rigged hannity said we ve seen the emails philip rucker contributed to
