in the america that bernie sanders wants to create tuition would be free for every student at every public college which of course is another way of saying that the government would pay for it to do that the democratic presidential candidate would spend 750billion over 10 years and raise the money with a new tax on wall street trades and with the government paying for college colleges would run by government rules sanders s rules for one thing sanders thinks student centers are a waste of government money he would make sure they did not get any more of it if he becomes president sanders would spend an enormous amount of money 3 27trillion at the very very least he is not just a big spending liberal his agenda is not just about money it s also about control the biggest pieces of sanders s domestic agenda making college health care and child care more affordable seek to capture these industries and convert them to run chiefly on federal money sanders thinks this would consolidate areas now shaped by a confusing mix of federal rules state laws and the private market and make these systems cheaper and more efficient the risk is that this authority would expand the federal bu reaucracy which has sometimes struggled to make itself run cheaply and efficiently sanders said voters would welcome the change even if it means americans must turn to the federal government to oversee new sectors of their lives he bristles at the idea that this might be considered an intrusion you re not turning to the government you re assuming that the government is some kind of foreign entity sanders said in an interview the government in a democratic society is the people bernie sanders a senator from vermont who describes himself as a democratic socialist will never get everything he wants in washington the fix sanders s 26 million cash haul is a major problem for clinton and that still would be true if he became president sanders republicans in congress would fight him fiercely democrats might not be much help in fact sanders s most recent senate bills legislation that would make college free and provide universal health care attracted zero democrats as co sponsors but now the same ideas that have made sanders a lonely leftist in the senate have made him a star on the campaign trail and he is setting himself up as a champion of liberal ideals while making rival hillary rodham clinton appear cautious by comparison this assessment of sanders s vision is based on an examination of his current and past legislation his campaign speeches and interviews with him his chief policy aide and experts after years of debate about how much government to cut sanders has succeeded at least with a piece of the electorate by promising that he would make it grow substantially i want you all not to think small i want you to think big sanders said during a speech in south carolina in august this is the wealthiest country in the history of the world the simplest parts of sanders s platform are the parts that are simply very expensive new money but pumped through old pipes he would allot for example an extra 1 2trillion for social security beneficiaries paid for by higher taxes on people earning more than 250 000 he also would create a new social security benefit paying for americans of any age to take 12 weeks off to care for a new baby or deal with a serious illness the funding for that would be new taxes on wage earners and businesses raising 319billion clinton also has called for a family leave benefit but her staff declined to say how she would pay for it in sanders s more ambitious plans however the mechanism is different to provide a benefit the government doesn t write checks it takes an existing industry with many paying customers and reshapes it so there is one major customer the government and analysts say the bureaucracy would then be tasked with making sure the government s money is spent according to the government s wishes now it looks like the federal government is funding schools directly and if it is funding the schools directly then it seems much more clear that the federal government should be writing all the regulations neal mccluskey of the libertarian cato institute said about sanders s college plan his plan for free tuition would not apply to private colleges they would still charge students and their students could still apply for traditional federal scholarships public schools too could opt out of the free tuition model to avoid the government s rules in theory good luck with recruiting free mccluskey said is very hard to defeat with something that s not free in his speeches sanders focuses on the potential benefits of this big idea low income students could find college doors opened to them all students could graduate without debt the downside left unstated would be that all colleges might start to look alike and that a huge industry would spend its time waiting on bureaucrats and trying to game their rules take for instance the one against spending money on non academic buildings it s probably not that simple that one line absolutely somebody s going to have to write a rule about what an academic purpose is said gerald friedman a professor at the university of massachusetts who has studied sanders s ideas and mostly agrees with them after the rule is written friedman said will come the special cases nitpicks and loopholes what if there s a chemistry lab in the football stadium s basement what if the student center is 50percent classrooms forty percent then you re going to have to litigate the rules because colleges aren t going to like it he said the federal education bu reaucracy already is not a speedy machine recently the education department needed 18months and 7 000 words in the federal register to define the college term credit hour this part of sanders s agenda would be paid for if congress agreed to his plan to add a small tax to every wall street trade that would be an increase worth 54billion to 300billion per year according to sanders s staff more broadly sanders has proposed more than 3 4trillion in new taxes most of them targeting the rich or large companies but right now it seems that even this enormous tax increase would not pay for sanders s full vision that s because sanders has not provided details about two of his most ambitious ideas revamping the health care and child care systems he hasn t said exactly what he would do to improve these areas or how he would pay for the changes the point is we haven t finished the proposal yet sanders said when asked about the details of his health care plan a recent report in the wall street journal quoted an estimate that a plan sanders has supported in the past would cost 15trillion over 10 years sanders said that missed the point even assuming that it were 15trillion over 10 years americans would no longer be paying private health insurance at the same time so they d be saving money that way he said sanders said he wants to model his plan on medicare the popular federal health insurance program for seniors he has proposed similar very detailed plans to expand medicare into a national health care program in the past but in this election he has made a point of saying that those old plans are not his official campaign proposal he s still working on the official one left undecided exactly how would it hold down costs with so many new enrollees how would it deal with unhappy customers in a system in which congress would be both the funder and the national complaint department nobody likes whoever pays whoever controls the money people hate said john mcdonough a professor at harvard university s school of public health describing the new role the government would take on if the government is the source of all health care financing the government then becomes the source of all dissatisfaction on child care reform sanders hasn t decided what it would cost or how it would be regulated but he is certain that the government would become the major funder for the industry that means child care for every american who wants it and rules to make sure the money is well spent the goal is to make it universal said warren gunnels sanders s policy director just like you make health care universal just like you make public colleges and universities tuition free
