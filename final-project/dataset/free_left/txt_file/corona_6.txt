the food and drug administration has already warned hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing covid 19 in its public warning necessitated in part by president trump s hyping of a dangerous drug the fda explained hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can cause abnormal heart rhythms such as qt interval prolongation and a dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia these risks may increase when these medicines are combined with other medicines known to prolong the qt interval including the antibiotic azithromycin which is also being used in some covid 19 patients without fda approval for this condition it went on to say patients who also have other health issues such as heart and kidney disease are likely to be at increased risk of these heart problems when receiving these medicines doctors who want to prescribe the drug should check for a suitable clinical trial and consider enrolling the patient there is little room for doubt this is not a cure for the novel coronavirus and can have serious even deadly consequences nevertheless trump claims the white house physician prescribed it for him although the physician s letter meant to back up trump s dubious claim stated merely that he had discussed the topic with trump and concluded the benefits what benefits outweigh the risks trump s press secretary claims he is taking the drug which proves nothing since she has already demonstrated a propensity to say anything her boss requires the debate over whether the president is actually doing something so reckless as to put his own life at risk or merely lying about doing so thereby risking other people s lives who will follow his example is instructive in four respects full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic first virtually nothing trump says about himself his actions the world and his advisers can be taken at face value in one sense this is an improvement for the mainstream media which no longer gives him the presumption of truthfulness extended to other presidents and of course if he would lie about taking a potentially dangerous treatment he will lie about anything e g falsely stating america tests more than all the other countries combined if republicans actually believed trump on this one they d be up in arms that he might be putting his life in danger second trump corrupts everyone around him he has either induced a doctor to violate his professional responsibilities ignore fda warnings or at the very least to write a letter sounding like he did virtually no one in the administration e g white house physician justice department lawyers has the nerve to say this goes too far their assumption that they are impervious to public legal and professional sanctions suggests that state medical boards and state bar associations need to rethink their policing function and public obligations third the notion that trump would never put the country at risk say by ignoring a pandemic or by recklessly risking war with iran or by weakening an ally in a war against russia has been permanently discredited he too often tries to own the libs by demeaning experts denying science and lying to make himself look smarter than others if it means some of his own supporters die well that is of no apparent concern to trump he has yet to fly flags at half mast or even declare a day of prayer or mourning for the nearly 90 000 americans we have lost likely a reflection of his total absence of empathy and his insistence on projecting normalcy so as to preserve his chance for reelection finally any other person taking to the airwaves or social media to induce the public to engage in dangerous activity should be booted off the platform remarkably even fox news commentators such as neil cavuto deplored the president s conduct a relative engaging in this behavior would be advised to seek counseling and yet an entire political party fervently backs trump and wants him to remain in power propagating goodness knows what for four more years trump is not the only menace to public health and safety every republican who tolerates supports and advocates his reelection is equally to blame for the harm that ensues read more erik wemple this will kill you fox s neil cavuto at center of trump s hydroxychloroquine madness greg sargent trump s rage at a fox
