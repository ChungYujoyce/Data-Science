in the second presidential debate donald trump once again relied on many dubious and false claims that have been repeatedly been debunked his democratic rival hillary clinton on occasion made a factual misstep but it didn t even compare to trump s long list of exaggerations here s a roundup of 25 interesting and suspect claims as is our practice we do not award pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debates trump mixes up a story about a long ago criminal case clinton did not laugh at a rape victim in 1975 clinton then hillary rodham was a 27 year old law professor running a legal aid clinic in the university of arkansas in fayetteville after a 41 year old factory worker was accused of raping a 12 year old girl he asked the judge to replace his male court appointed attorney with a female one the judge went through the list of a half dozen women practicing law in the county and picked clinton in her autobiography living history clinton wrote i told prosecutor mahlon gibson i really don t feel comfortable taking on such a client but mahlon gently reminded me that i couldn t very well refuse the judge s request gibson has confirmed that account in interviews with newsday and cnn saying clinton told him i don t want to represent this guy i just can t stand this i don t want to get involved can you get me off ultimately the prosecution s case fell apart for a number of reasons including investigators mishandling evidence of bloody underwear so in a plea agreement the charges were reduced from first degree rape to unlawful fondling of a minor under the age of 14 not until 2008 did the victim kathy shelton realize that clinton had been the lawyer on the other side she has since attacked clinton for putting me through hell and she appeared at a news event with trump before the debate the rape case reemerged when the washington free beacon in 2014 discovered unpublished audio recordings from the mid 1980s of clinton being interviewed by arkansas reporter roy reed for an article that was never published in the recorded interview clinton is heard laughing or giggling four times when discussing the case with unusual candor the reporter is also heard laughing and sometimes clinton is responding to him here are the four instances paula jones a former arkansas state employee alleged that in 1991 clinton while governor propositioned her and exposed himself she later filed a sexual harassment suit the case was dismissed by a federal judge who ruled that even if her allegations were true such boorish and offensive behavior would not be severe enough to constitute sexual harassment under the law that ruling was under appeal when clinton in 1998 settled the suit for 850 000 with no apology or admission of guilt all but 200 000 was directed to pay legal fees premiums are expected to increase overall in 2017 but trump is cherry picking from the highest proposed increases in the insurance marketplace state by state weighted average increases range from just 1 3 percent in rhode island to as high as 71 percent in oklahoma butthe most common plans in the marketplace will see an average increase of 9 percent according to the kaiser family foundation sjuly analysis these plans have been used as the benchmark to calculate government subsidies the vast majority of marketplace enrollees about eight in 10 receive government premium subsidies they areprotected from a premium increase and may even see a decrease if they stay with a low cost plan according to the kaiser family foundation anecdotal examples of premium hikes or averages across insurers can provide a skewed picture of the increases marketplace enrollees will actually face to support the debunked notion that clinton s campaign originated birther rumors during the 2008 presidential campaign trump once again referenced longtime clinton ally sidney blumenthal andclinton campaign manager patti solis doyle but he s grasping at straws and once again refused to apologize for his own role in promoting the birther fable james asher former d c bureau chief of mcclatchy has said that blumenthal strongly urged him to investigate the exact place of president obama s birth which he suggested was in kenya mcclatchy assigned a reporter to go to kenya and the reporter found the allegation was false asher said we reached out to asher several times but did not receive a response blumenthal declining to elaborate further said in a statement to the fact checker this is false period donald trump cannot distract from the fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie and bears the responsibility for it solis doyle saidin a recent cnn interview that in december 2007 a volunteer coordinator in iowa forwarded an email perpetuating the birther conspiracy clinton made the decision immediately to let that person go solis doyle said in the interview as in the instance with the iowa volunteer coordinator the campaign denounced isolated instances of clinton s staffers questioning whether obama was muslim we found that there s no evidence that she or her campaign were pressing it very hard though some of her supporters did perpetuate the claims in the bitter 2008 primary campaign against obama trump has used this line of attack throughout the campaign sometimes saying hillary clinton was an enabler of her husband s affairs saying she would go after these women and destroy their lives one of the interviews that clinton s critics have pointed to is a jan 27 1998 interview on the today show saying it showed clinton was discrediting allegations by then white house intern monica lewinsky this interview took place a week after her husband was accused of having an affair with lewinsky and clinton blamed republican foes for making false attacks against her husband specifically critics have pointed to this quote by clinton i mean look at the very people who are involved in this they have popped up in other settings clinton told matt lauer this is the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president this interview by many accounts was certainly pivotal to saving bill clinton s presidency as his wife forcefully backed him but by hillary clinton s account at the time her husband had not yet admitted the lewinsky affair to her that did not happen until aug 15 1998 according to her memoir moreover at the time of the interview lewinsky also denied there had been a relationship her lawyer had submitted an affidavit on jan 12 from her saying she never had a sexual relationship with the president lewinsky did not begin to testify before the independent prosecutor about the full extent of the relationship until july 27 six months after the today show interview lewinsky testified for 15 days after which the president finally confessed to his wife see our in depth fact checks on this here and here while trump has ramped up the attacks on the clintons and the sex allegations against bill clinton the record shows that trump dismissed or minimized these very allegations for many years trump dismissed the women involved as losers and not attractive trump even suggested that americans would have been more forgiving if clinton had slept with more beautiful women here are some examples see more here in 1998 trump attacked paula jones who had sued clinton alleging sexual harassment paula jones is a loser but the fact is that she may be responsible for bringing down a president indirectly in 1999 trump faulted bill clinton for the way he handled the lewinsky scandal and complained about his choice in women he handled the monica situation disgracefully it s sad because he would go down as a great president if he had not had this scandal people would have been more forgiving if he d had an affair with a really beautiful woman of sophistication kennedy and marilyn monroe were on a different level now clinton can t get into golf clubs in westchester a former president begging to get in a golf club it s unthinkable during a 2001 interview trump again expressed sympathy for bill clinton arguing that the former president s biggest mistake was answering questions about his sex life trump said he likes clinton and finds it all too easy to understand why the then president found it hard to answer the question did you f monica what he should have done is fought for years not to answer it trump said in the interview i mean isn t it amazing and terrible that a guy a president is put in that position he could have gone down as truly great and instead you know he ll be viewed somewhat differently which is really a shame trump always makes it sound like this is u s taxpayer money and he always uses a too high estimate because of international sanctions over its nuclear program iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe with sanctions lifted in theory those funds would be unlocked but the treasury department has estimated that once iran fulfills other obligations it would have about 55 billion left much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in china for its part the central bank of iran said the number was actually 32 billion not 55 billion there is no evidence this was the case in the 2015 terrorist attack that killed 14 people there have been unconfirmed second or third hand reports a friend of a friend of a neighbor that a neighbor claimed to have noticed suspicious activity but did not report anything for fear of doing racial profiling the religion of this supposed neighbor is unknown but presumably a fear of racial profiling would suggest the neighbor was not muslim trump is technically correct on the timeline but clinton s staff had requested the emails to be deleted months before the subpoena according to the fbi s august 2016 report moreover there s no evidence clinton deleted the emails in anticipation of the subpoena and fbi director james b comey has said his agency s investigation found no evidence that any work related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them politifact compiled a helpful timeline of events relating to clinton s release of her emails based on the fbi report from their timeline on july 23 2014 the state department agreed to produce records pertaining to the 2012 attacks in libya for the house select committee on benghazi s investigation in december 2014 clinton aide cheryl mills told an employee of the company that managed her server to delete emails on her server unrelated to government work that were older than 60 days on march 4 2015 the benghazi committee issued a subpoena requiring clinton to turn over her emails relating to libya three weeks later between march 25 and march 31 the employee had an oh s moment and realized he did not delete the emails that mills requested in december 2014 he told the fbi the employee then deleted the emails and used a program called bleachbit to delete the files this is just totally false we have found no evidence of his early opposition trump expressed lukewarm support the first time he was asked about it on sept 11 2002 and was not clearly against it until he was quoted in the august 2004 esquire cover story titled donald trump how i d run the country better but by the middle of 2004 many americans had turned against the war making trump s position not particularly unique in light of trump s repeated false claim esquire has added an editor s note to its august 2004 story saying the iraq war began in march 2003 more than a year before this story ran thus nullifying trump s timeline we have awarded this claim four pinocchios compiled a timeline of all of trump s comments prior to the invasion in march 2003 and even a video documenting how this is a bogus claim trumpis simply wrong when he says the united states is the highest taxed nation in the world the pew research center using 2014 data found that the tax bill for americans under various scenarios is below average for developed countries in 2014 according to comparative tables of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product the broadest measure of the economy was 26 percent for the united states out of 34 countries that put the united states in the bottom third and well below the oecd average of 34 4 percent clinton overstated the impact of the 2011 new start strategic arms reduction treaty agreement which she helped negotiate as secretary of state new start placed tighter limits on deployed strategic weapons but russia was actually already meeting the treaty s limits for the most part when the treaty s implementation began indeed russia has increased deployed nuclear weapons from 1 537 in february 2011 to 1 796 in september of this year also the treaty does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons russia s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline from 40 000 since 1986 during obama s presidency russia s nuclear warhead total has hovered around 4 500 since 2012 trump cites an internal revenue service audit as his justification for not releasing his federal income tax returns but the audit does not prohibit from releasing the returns richard nixon who started the tradition of presidents and presidential candidates releasing their returns did so in the middle of an audit moreover trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009 which are no longer under audit according to his attorney presidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency hillary clinton has released three decades worth of tax returns trump is simply wrong the toppling of libyan dictator moammar gaddafi at the hands of libyan rebels aided by u s and nato air power has led to highly unstable governance as the country s tribes have vied for influence and power there are rival governments based in the capital of tripoli and the eastern city of tobruk and neither has fully recognized the unity government established by united nations mediators the national oil corporation noc claims to be operating independently without taking orders from either of the country s rival governments though a rival noc appears to have been set up in the east isis has attempted to step into the power vacuum but not a single expert or news article that we consulted said that isis has grabbed a single oil field instead militants appear to be trying to disrupt the flow of oil mainly by scaring workers away claudia gazzini a tripoli based senior analyst at the international crisis group told the fact checker it was not true that the islamic state has control of any libyan oil while it is true that isis has attacked oil fields in the sirte basin area and destroyed key equipment there they have not sought to keep control of the oil fields gazzini said at the moment they appear to have adopted a hit and run strategy there is no evidence that they are pumping out the crude oil and certainly no evidence that they are trading it at the moment they just appear interested in starving the libyan state of oil revenues trump made a ludicrous claim that u s ambassador chris stevens made 600 requests for help before he perished in the september 2012 attack on a u s diplomatic facility in benghazi this is a misunderstanding of a figure widely used by republicans on the house select committee on benghazi but even they never claimed that these came from stevens the fact checker delved deeply into this 600 figure it is a subjective accounting of requests and concerns not actual requests for help there is no dispute that security was inadequate in benghazi and that the state department failed to respond to all requests for security but the shorthand description of 600 requests has left a misleading impression so much so that many reporters and lawmakers appearto believe that all of these requests were ignored at least some of the requests were actually fulfilled and the counting of concerns may be subject to dispute homicides were up 10 8 percent nationwide in 2015 the biggest percentage jump in a single year since 1971 according to fbi data but violent crimes overall have been declining for about two decades and are far below rates seen one or two decades ago homicides have continued to spike in major cities this year though the rates remain far below their peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s law enforcement officials including the fbi have voiced concerns about the uptick in crime in 2015 criminal justice experts warn against comparing crime trends from short periods of time such as year over year an annual trend can show a trajectory of where the trend might be headed but still not give a full picture many criminal justice experts say crime trends are determined over at least five years preferably 10 or 20 years of data trump takes clinton s statement out of context during a march 2016 town hall clinton was asked by a voter make the case to poor whites who live in tennessee mississippi alabama who vote republican why they should vote for you based upon economic policies versus voting for a republican clinton gave a lengthy response which included the line we re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business it was part of her longer answer about how transitioning away from coal powered plants has already affected mining communities and her plan to help coal mine workers adjust after losing factory jobs as explained in her november 2015 policy proposal for revitalizing coal communities here s her full answer the portion that trump cited is in bold this is easy to disprove let s look at the tweet sent at 5 30 a m regarding former miss universe alicia machado did crooked hillary help disgusting check out sex tape and past alicia m become a u s citizen so she could use her in the debate trump claims that machado is no angel no sex tape has surfaced since trump sent out the late night tweet but he clearly tweeted that people should check out sex tape it s unclear what trump s source is on this one and his campaign did not respond to our inquiry in 2015 24 percent of black people lived below poverty levels according to the census black people had the highest rate of poverty among all racial groups 21 percent of hispanics 11 percent of asians and 11 6 percent of whites moreover the majority of black people do not live in the inner city as the naacp tweeted during the debate fact the majority of black people in america don t live in the inner city research shows that as of 2010 the majority of blacks asians and latinos in metropolitan areas lived in the suburbs coal is not clean when burned in power plants it emits sulfur dioxides nitrous oxides and mercury unless coal fired power plants have scrubbers to remove those from the air thanks to regulation by the environmental protection agency that trump said was so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business coal also emits carbon dioxide which the supreme court in 2007 said was a pollutant under the clean air act that carbon dioxide can only be removed from emissions at great cost and the technique is not currently in use except in areas where it can be used for enhanced oil recovery finally the act of mining coal is not clean it either involves open pit mines or underground mines that often pollute waters and coal fired power plants also produce coal ash waste that is often kept in ponds that are prone to leaking probably the major reason for the decline in coal use is the discovery of a way to tap into shale gas which has brought down the price of natural gas many utilities are switching to natural gas actually the united states is still a net importer of crude oil and refined petroleum products it imported 5 3 million barrels a day in july according to the energy information administration that is however down sharply from the 13 million barrels a day of imports reached in 2006 clinton went onto say we are not dependent upon the middle east that s correct but it s been the case for years canada is the biggest source for american oil imports more than the entire persian gulf combined this is wrong the obama administration has admitted 12 500 refugees over the past fiscal year which slightly exceeded a goal of 10 000 even so this is about one third accepted by canada with a much smaller population trump in the past has claimed that clinton wants to admit 620 000 refugees in her first term clinton has supported accepting up to 65 000 refugees from syria in one year this is 55 000 more than the obama administration s plan to accept 10 000 syrian refugees this fiscal year the 620 000 figure that trump often uses is based in the unverified assumption that clinton would continue at that pace for every year of her first term on top of the obama administration s proposal for 100 000 total refugees for fiscal year 2017 multiply 155 000 four times and you reach 620 000 after trump made his comment about hundreds of thousands moderator martha raddatz deftly noted that clinton had asked for an increase from 10 000 to 65 000 clinton s talking point is out of date the census bureau reported in september that median income was up 5 2 percent from 2014 to 2015 to 56 516 this is the first annual increase in median household income since 2007 the year before the great recession the united states has a trade deficit of about 500 billion in goods and services trump appears to be referring the deficit in goods which was nearly 800 billion in 2015 according to the census bureau this is not the full story the federal government weighed several factors when considering bids for redevelopment of the old post office building 50 percent were qualitative including past performance of the developer site plan and design concept and 50 percent were quantitative developer s financial capability and capacity and the developer s financial offer two factors weighed heavily in trump s favor the financial backing of major real estate investor colony capital and the design by prominent architect arthur cotton moore trump had submitted the bid with colony capital as the financial backer and the trump organization as the lead developer the washington post s jonathan o connell wrote colony is a major global investor in real estate which bolstered trump s efforts to secure the deal at the time colony had already invested 45 billion in more than 14 000 corporate and real estate assets ranking it among the top real estate investment firms worldwide but after the trump organization won the bid colony capital backed out of the deal saying that the project s timeline became too long for the firm the trumps instead contributed 40 million to 42 million in equity and borrowed 170 million from deutsche bank the selection of moore bolstered the organization s experience restoring or managing historic buildings in new york o connell wrote moore stepped down from the project less than a year after trump won the bid he told the new york times i left because i couldn t support what they were doing to the building they were covering up or tearing out everything that was historic about
