advertisement supported by the attorney general said that an investigation into the russia inquiry was focusing on others not the former president transcript today i am pleased to announce that thanks to the relentless efforts and ingenuity of f b i technicians the f b i finally succeeded in unlocking alshamrani s phones the phones contained information previously unknown to us that definitively establishes alshamrani s significant ties to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula not only before the attack but before he even arrived in the united states over the past few decades there have been increasing attempts to use the criminal justice system as a political weapon the legal tactic has been to gin up allegations of criminality by one s political opponents based on the flimsiest of legal theories this is not a good development this is not good for our political life and it s not good for the criminal justice system and as long as i m attorney general the criminal justice system will not be used for partisan political ends and this is especially true for the upcoming elections in november as to president obama and vice president biden whatever their level of involvement based on the information i have today i don t expect mr durham s work will lead to a criminal investigation of either man by katie benner and adam goldman washington attorney general william p barr dismissed president trump s attempts to rebrand the russia investigation as a criminal plot engineered by former president barack obama saying on monday that he expected no charges against either mr obama or former vice president joseph r biden jr as a result of an investigation into how their administration handled russian election interference as long as i m attorney general the criminal justice system will not be used for partisan political ends mr barr said during a news conference announcing that the gunman in last year s shooting at florida military base had links to al qaeda mr barr said that john h durham the federal prosecutor investigating how law enforcement and intelligence officials confronted russia s operations to meddle in the 2016 election was examining some aspects of the case for potential crimes but that he was focused on other people not mr obama or mr biden i don t expect mr durham s work will lead to a criminal investigation of either man mr barr said our concern over potential criminality is focused on others mr barr did not say who mr durham might be focusing on but the justice department inspector general has previously referred findings about an f b i lawyer s conduct during the russia investigation for potential prosecution mr barr s comments served as an unmistakable rebuttal to escalating efforts by mr trump and his allies to reframe the russia investigation as a plot to sabotage his presidency by mr obama mr biden and officials in their administration mr trump has targeted mr obama in a way that no modern sitting president has accusing his most recent predecessor of unspecified crimes under a vague but politically charged catchphrase obamagate asked later at the white house about mr barr s comments mr trump stood firm in attacking the previous administration obama knew everything that was happening mr trump told reporters again saying ambiguously that it was a takedown of a president but while mr barr was unwilling to fuel speculation that the justice department would target mr obama and mr biden he himself has done perhaps more than any other trump administration official to undermine the overall credibility of the russia investigation the attorney general s handling of the russia inquiry has come under fire since he first emphasized its findings last year in a way that was more favorable to mr trump than investigators had found he has also intervened in cases involving former trump advisers including moving this month to withdraw the case against michael t flynn who twice pleaded guilty to lying to the f b i mr barr has explained his undoing of the flynn case and other moves like intervening to recommend a more lenient sentence for the president s longtime friend roger j stone jr as correcting overreach by other law enforcement officials mr stone was convicted of seven felonies in a bid to impede a congressional inquiry that threatened the president the highly unusual justice department move to withdraw the charge against mr flynn spurred accusations that mr barr was further politicizing law enforcement and prompted a federal judge emmet g sullivan to appoint an outsider the former federal judge john gleeson to oppose the department in the case judge gleeson said in a motion filed on monday that he would submit a brief by june 10 addressing issues in the case including whether judge sullivan has the authority to deny the justice department s motion any additional investigating he may need to do and whether judge sullivan should order mr flynn to show why he should not be held in criminal contempt for perjury that timetable means that the flynn matter could drag on into the fall campaign season mr barr has also moved to replace timothy shea as head of the u s attorney s office in washington mr shea a longtime adviser to mr barr was the only prosecutor to sign the motion to dismiss the flynn case after career prosecutors withdrew from it on monday the white house announced that mr trump planned to nominate justin e herdman the u s attorney for northern ohio to replace mr shea who will become the acting head of the drug enforcement administration mr herdman a former intelligence officer in the navy reserve is known as a relatively apolitical prosecutor who has made a name for himself by pursuing domestic terrorism cases mr barr emphasized on monday as he has previously that he believed that law enforcement and intelligence officials unfairly targeted mr trump as they sought in 2016 to understand links between his campaign and russia we saw two different standards of justice emerge one that applies to president trump and his associates and the other that applied to everybody else mr barr said we can t allow this ever to happen again mr barr called the russia investigation and the investigation of mr trump a grave injustice that was unprecedented in american history he also spoke of a trend in recent decades of increasing attempts to use the criminal justice system as a political weapon this is not a good development he said this is not good for our political life and it s not good for the criminal justice system even so mr barr would not criminally implicate mr obama or mr biden and he said that improper actions by the previous administration may not turn out to be criminal offenses not every abuse of power no matter how outrageous is necessarily a federal crime the attorney general said he said that voters should be able to choose between mr trump and mr biden the presumptive democratic presidential nominee based on a robust debate of policy issues rather than efforts to drum up criminal investigations of either candidate mr barr s public statements on the russia investigation have outraged democrats and former national security officials from both parties he has said that the inquiry was not properly predicated though an inspector general report found that it was and that the trump campaign was spied on perhaps illegally joshua a geltzer the executive director of the institute for constitutional advocacy and protection at georgetown law school and a former obama administration national security official said he was unconvinced that mr barr would not use the justice department for partisan ends from an ordinary attorney general i d find these reassurances comforting but frankly attorney general barr doesn t seem to use language responsibly mr geltzer said i m glad barr said what he said but that doesn t erase the egregious politicization of federal law enforcement he s overseen other trump administration officials and allies have also sought in recent days to undermine the origins of the russia investigation richard grenell the acting director of national intelligence declassified a document last week that listed the names of some obama administration officials who made requests during the presidential transition to see fuller versions of classified intelligence reports the release of the document by republican senators prompted accusations that mr trump s supporters were wielding the information for his political benefit advertisement
