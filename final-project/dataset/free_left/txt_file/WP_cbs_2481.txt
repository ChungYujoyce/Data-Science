asignificant mark on the way conventions are conductedin the future according tocbs news campaign reporter adam brewsterandcbs news political unit associate producer ellee watson the change comes as thecoronavirus pandemicupended the political world ending traditional campaign rallies causing primaries to be conducted entirely by mail and even putting the fate of the national convention into question we pride ourselves for having the largest convention in the country said texas democratic party deputy executive director cliff walker it s the biggest gathering of democrats outside of the dnc democratic national convention but now that we re having to make some adjustments i think it really does give us some opportunities as the coronavirus spread nationally in march party leaders realized they might not be able to hold their customary convention with thousands of texans packed into a san antonio convention center in early june and they started looking at ways to reinvent the event for 2020 and beyond the party announced the decision to transform its in person convention into a virtual one in march but is sharing details of how it will execute the plan for the first time we firmly believe that this is the future of what conventions can look like said texas democratic party convention director hannah roe beck the party plans to hold its virtual convention during the first week of june using two channels one for official party business like voting on delegates and one with speakers performances and panels the party is still in talks with the production company and the speakers about the locations for the broadcast events but the idea is to build a tv studio and control room to deliver the feed according to convention organizers the main stage channel with speakers and panels will be broadcast on social media platforms such as facebook the party business will be conducted on a video chat platform like zoom that will feature a grid of video boxes and allow participants to interact and ask questions for voting on delegates and other party business the state party has built out a system using google forms to insert preferences voting will be divided up across multiple days instead of the traditional one to two days of voting so that users with varying technological equipment and expertise have the time to participate party officials said there

michigan s legislature also adopted a bipartisan oversight committee to examine the state s response to the coronavirus pandemic governor s mansion help wanted according to audio obtained bycbs news several governors stressed the need for state funding during a call on friday about testing with vice president mike pence and members of the white house coronavirus task force minnesota governor tim walz said he s had to spend 36 million on a combination of testing which is money he had to front using the state s general funds if there s no help for the state then we re left to go bankrupt that s the money we re using to do the testing walz said on the call senate majority leader mitch mcconnell previously floated allowing states to go bankrupt while congress hits the pause button on any further funding to the states new york governor andrew cuomo has slammed mcconnell s comments in his press briefings and during the call said that a clear show of support from trump would help the governors speak in the voice of solidarity and to do our jobs cuomo added because if we have to start to push back against this it s not going to be an easy situation for any of us in response pence referenced trump s prior comments about having an openness to another bill an openness to state support the call for state aid comes as governors across the aisle are concerned aboutany future cuts they might have to make reportscbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarroandcbs news digital political reporter grace segers during the call the governors also gave updates on their testing capabilities sharing some of the ways they ve worked with public and private laboratories cuomo said the delineation of responsibility on testing between the federal and state governments is clearer with the federal government handling issues with the national supply chains and the states handling their labs so the national manufacturers the reagents the test kits the international supply chain whatever those issues are the federal government could facilitate that up to the national manufacturers then our labs in our states could actually get the supplies from the national manufacturers so our labs produce whatever they can produce he said it s not the states on their own and it s not the federal government running the show it s an absolute partnership dr anthony fauci added key constituencies latino vote are the daily presidential news briefings on coronavirus and the near constant coverage of president trump s words and actions in response to the pandemic giving him a campaign advantage a new survey out today suggests it might be with a critical bloc of support for democrats according tocbs news political correspondent ed o keefe just 49 of latino registered voters would vote for former vice president joe biden while another 10 said they were undecided but leaning towards backing him according to the poll by latino decisions seventeen percent of respondents said they back mr trump with another 6 undecided but leaning in his direction eighteen percent said they are undecided the poll was conducted on behalf of henry mu oz the former finance chairman of the democratic national committee and a longtime party moneyman who is close to biden and his senior advisers there is softer than anticipated support for biden among latinos because democrats are creating a vacuum that reflects a lack of information in the latino community about how the trump administration is responding to the crisis mu oz said this isn t an ask people for their vote moment it s a moment when we should be speaking to americans about what they re going through and reaching out to them and letting them know that we have their back because the other party does not and this president does not he said he is killing us and not testing us and we re losing jobs and he s taking care of insiders what might help biden picking a latina running mate the poll finds

uniform statewide policies in response to the coronavirus grove is asking newsom to allow some parts of the state to end lockdowns ahead of more afflicted areas grove said the rate of spread across communities has been different adding many counties have in fact only had a handful of cases according to an analysis from the los angeles times kern county which encompasses bakersfield has 699 confirmed cases of coronavirus in contrast neighboring los angeles county has reported over 17 000 confirmed positive cases grove said it does not make sense to indefinitely bind different areas as part of the same statewide lockdown and urged newsom to grant city and county governments more flexibility and discretion when it comes to ending shelter in place mandates meanwhile the california republican party is asking newsom to prohibit campaign operatives and volunteers from collecting mail in ballots from voters at their homes the practice referred to as ballot harvesting is legal and allows any person to collect a mail in ballot from voters and turn it in to a polling place or the registrar s office prior to 2016 the law restricted this practice to just relatives of or those living in same household as the voter the california republican party says it has not heard back from newsom after sending him a letter nine days ago to prohibit this practice because it presents the same risk as in person voting the letter argues that the practice of ballot harvesting which may involve a stranger visiting a voter s home and returning that voter s ballot to the election offices would be a threat to the safety of others in a statement tocbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidar republican national committee chairwoman ronna mcdaniel said newsom needs to make clear that ballot harvesting stands in direct conflict with the stay at home order he issued and in a tweet this morning mcdaniel renewed the calls to prohibit the practice of ballot harvesting ahead of california s
