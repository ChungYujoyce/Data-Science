the third in a vox series making the best case for each of the top democratic contenders vox writers are making the best case for the leading democratic candidates this article is the third in the series read them all here vox does not endorse individual candidates for a democrat to beat president donald trump in 2020 and to have a shot at retaking the senate they ll have to win in places hillary clinton lost democrats who ve done it before want former vice president joe biden to be the nominee rep conor lamb 35 won a special election in the suburbs of pittsburgh 18 months after trump carried the district by 20 points his campaign made time for only one national surrogate biden he reminds me of my son beau biden said at a rally at the carpenter s training center in collier pennsylvania a week before the march 2018 election referring to his son who died of brain cancer in 2015 biden s endorsement was not the only reason for lamb s victory but the campaign did think the visit from the former vice president offered lamb a chance to build credibility with union workers lamb is now endorsing biden to be the democratic nominee and he s in good company biden has far more endorsements from elected officials than any other candidate the fivethirtyeight endorsement tracker which keeps track of high profile endorsements and weights them by influence has biden scoring 237 points nearly triple the second place candidate sen elizabeth warren who scores an 81 sen bernie sanders trails warren at 55 sen amy klobuchar is next with 50 other candidates have picked up pockets of support in important states in michigan five state lawmakers are backing warren and the young democrats have come out for sanders but biden has way outpaced his competitors in numbers and he s earned endorsements from democrats who ve won tough races in places that will be tough again in 2020 in pennsylvania four sitting democratic members of congress have come out for biden in arizona where democrats have a slim chance of picking up a republican held senate seat biden has been endorsed by former gov janet napolitano a rare democrat to have won statewide in recent history sen doug jones the first democrat to win a senate seat in alabama in decades has endorsed him too jones up for reelection in 2020 won a special election in 2017 against a man accused of sexually assaulting two teenagers and other predatory behavior even so the campaign knew it would be a feat for a democrat to win in alabama they only wanted surrogates with cross party appeal like former nba star charles barkley and biden we were not anxious to bring in a lot of national partisan officeholders said democratic strategist joe trippi who worked on the jones campaign biden s never had the persona of a hard charging partisan he was somebody we wanted to campaign he is among the least polarizing figures in the party the democrats in swing states who have endorsed biden did so of course because they support his policy positions but in a year when democrats are laser focused on beating trump their endorsements also represent a vote of confidence in biden s ability to win in their states and to help down ballot democrats win too biden seems to have an edge in battleground states but the top democratic candidates all tend to outperform trump in head to head polling the case for biden is about his potential to do one more thing take back the republican controlled senate how the hell are any of them going to get anything through congress with mitch mcconnell sitting in the senate trippi said biden s coalition offers the democrats their best shot at winning up and down the ballot he s led the pack nationally among democrats including core base voters like african americans he s consistently polled further ahead of trump in key midwestern states despite relentless attacks from trump and the democrats who know what it takes to defeat republicans in hostile territory want him to take on not just trump but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell too two important storylines about the democratic party emerged from the 2018 election the first is the rise of the far left best symbolized by rep alexandria ocasio cortez s upset victory against longtime democrat joe crowley in new york ocasio cortez instantly became a leading voice in the new progressive wing of the party the second storyline to emerge has gotten far less attention but explains how democrats actually won while ocasio cortez represents an important new force in the party her win over a fellow democrat didn t change the party makeup of the house that bragging right goes to a crop of moderate democrats who ran careful pragmatic campaigns they won on tangible policy ideas like preserving the affordable care act s provision on preexisting conditions they weren t calling for a revolution so much as a return to stability an analysis by alan i abramowitz at the center for politics at the university of virginia found that candidates in the 2018 midterms who supported medicare for all performed worse than those who did not it s true that the progressive left helped inspire enthusiasm including a surge of new voters and young voters latinx voters made up a larger vote share in 2018 than in previous elections but as yair ghitza of the democratic data firm catalist estimates about 89 percent of the party s improved vote margin is attributable to swing voting not higher turnout by committed democrats a big piece of democratic victory was due to 2016 trump voters turning around and voting for democrats in 2018 ghitza also found that even though many of the democratic wins were in suburban districts rural areas largely moved in a democratic direction often by even larger margins than the suburbs to carry these districts and win the electoral college the democratic nominee must appeal to a broad swath of voters including trump voters biden stumped in these districts in 2018 and candidates welcomed his help a sign that he s the strongest choice to do it in 2020 any democrat who could beat trump would only have a shot at a transformative presidency if he or she also took the senate right now it looks bleak for democrats mcconnell controls the senate by three votes plus the vice president s tie breaker and in 2020 there is no republican running in a state that clinton carried by 5 points or more so while democrats defend seats in 12 states where they re up for reelection a few of them tough races they ll also have to flip seats in at least three competitive races to take back control of congress most democrats believe their best bets for flips are in colorado arizona georgia and maine biden has earned about a dozen endorsements across these states including from napolitano the only democrat to be elected governor in the state since 1982 vulnerable democrats defending seats include sen gary peters in michigan a state where biden has consistently polled above trump by a higher margin than any other candidate he s earned some half a dozen endorsements from sitting lawmakers there too similarly he s picked up strong support in alabama even if you look at an example like the state of alabama where there s a clear dichotomy between urban exurban and rural he s uniquely positioned not to move just urban voters said democratic birmingham mayor randall woodfin who has endorsed biden when you think about all parts of the state he s actually able to excite and motivate those same alabamians who may be white or rural hanging on to the house is not a given either democrats surged in 2018 delivering a wave election even bigger than the tea party s in 2010 but this time around trump will be back at the top of the ticket and could make it harder for democrats who won on his turf biden s campaign is headquartered in pennsylvania a state that barack obama won in 2008 and 2012 but clinton lost in 2016 and that democrats will need to win back in 2020 to realistically defeat trump he s racked up endorsements from six sitting and former pennsylvania lawmakers i think some in the media and the sort of commentary around this race have been a little bit focused on the size and novelty of policy proposals lamb said in a recent interview before heading to iowa to stump for biden i think joe biden is advancing ideas that can actually be passed into law and actually help the lives of people who i care about a fear among liberal skeptics of biden is that his pragmatism represents a retreat from the party s leftward momentum that s true in one sense he doesn t pass progressive purity tests on issues like medicare for all on paper his plans are less ambitious but he d still be the most progressive democratic nominee in history if he won his plans line up closer with the center of gravity in the party but in recent years the center has moved much further left than even during the barack obama years for example biden isn t willing to replace the affordable care act with a new single payer system like warren or sanders s medicare for all but he does want to improve on it with a major new addition an expansive public option he d also cap premiums at 8 5 percent of a patient s income these might seem small relative to the scope of medicare for all but medicare for all has pretty much no chance of becoming law and it s likely to spark a damaging intraparty fight among congressional democrats that harms the chances of passing any health care bill lamb pointed out that there probably aren t enough votes in the democratic controlled house to pass it never mind a republican controlled senate or even a narrowly democratic controlled senate post 2020 and the key senate democrats who will drive health care policy if democrats retake the gavel have already said medicare for all is a nonstarter ultimately the question of which health care policy passes congress comes down to how many votes democrats have in congress if biden is best for down ballot democrats as many democrats who ve won in those states believe then he s likelier to get health care reform passed than his competitors with more ambitious plans but narrower political appeal it takes a lot of integrity not to necessarily back the flashiest thing in the moment but the thing that i can actually do for you and your life lamb said woodfin agreed echoing lamb s point that most americans don t favor medicare for all even among democrats the enthusiasm has declined at a certain point being a leader wanting to be a leader the president the leader of the free world pragmatism is required woodfin said it s not just this whole world of what i want to do as it relates to his policies they are pragmatic they are workable biden has also outlined a suite of policies that taken on their own terms would be the most ambitious governing agenda of any modern democrat still there is one significant policy criticism that biden can t overcome easily his stance on the iraq war he voted in the senate foreign relations committee to support the intervention he s recently portrayed the vote as a decision he quickly regretted but as alex ward and tara golshan reported for vox the story of biden and iraq is long complicated and arguably checkered during a recent debate biden reiterated that he regrets the vote and that he has proven he s trustworthy on the issue it was a mistake and i acknowledged that but the man who argued against the war barack obama picked me to be vice president while liberals recall how the iraq war shaped the 2008 primary and general election a deadly folly that loomed in voters minds polling amid trump s iran confrontation showed 32 percent of potential democratic primary voters trusted biden most on foreign policy sanders came in second trailing him by 12 points matters of war and foreign policy are certainly big enough questions for any individual voter to consider in deciding whom to pick for president for biden he s overwhelmingly the favorite among democrats on these matters in an ideal world the democrats would likely want a nominee younger than biden who is 77 it s also true that for a party coming off the historic election of the first african american president and that came within a razor s edge of electing the first female president there s something symbolically disappointing about retreating to another white man this is made worse by the fact that when he was pressed to address his problematic personal treatment of women near the launch of his campaign biden was perfunctory and dismissive representation matters and with biden we re not getting a real advance but we don t live in an ideal world and there isn t a younger and slightly more self reflective version of biden out there for democrats to vote for there s way too much that s both tangibly and symbolically at stake with trump s presence in the white house for democrats to ignore the overwhelming evidence that the politicians with something on the line in tough races think biden is the best chance to beat him ultimately the 2020 primary issue democrats care about most is who can stand up to trump and beat him biden is in a unique position he s faced almost a year of attacks by trump and it hasn t hurt him in the fall the american public learned that trump had enlisted his personal attorney rudy giuliani to gin up dirt on biden s son hunter biden by leaning on the government of ukraine while these revelations ultimately ended in the president s impeachment they also led to months and months of trump attacking joe biden in october trump really lit into him with personal insults he was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss barack obama s ass trump s daughter in law lara trump and his former press secretary sarah huckabee sanders went on to make fun of biden s slight stutter amid all this biden s fundraising skyrocketed and he paid no penalty in the polls biden remains up over trump in head to head polling in michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania as noted earlier most democratic candidates beat trump in head to head polling but biden consistently holds the highest margin in swing states why are you so obsessed with me mr president pic twitter com bbaawevqo6 biden s campaign made an ad about trump s attacks which biden tweeted with a joke why are you so obsessed with me sometimes a joke is funny because it gets at the truth biden isn t the flashiest candidate or the most ambitious in his proposals but he s the candidate who is in the best position to beat trump and take back the senate he s stayed strong in the polls nationally and up against trump in key states despite months of attacks he s got strong support from different types of democrats and most of all the democrats who know what it takes to win in trump country believe he s the best candidate for the job read the rest of the case for series the case for
