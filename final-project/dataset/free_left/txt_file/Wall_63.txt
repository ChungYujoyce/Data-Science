by public health guidance officials said by katie glueck joseph r biden jr s presidential campaign which has faced criticism from some democrats worried about his team s general election readiness is planning a substantial expansion of its operation and eyeing an ambitious battleground map even as the question of when mr biden will resume in person campaigning remains unclear in an hourlong briefing with reporters on friday senior campaign officials pledged to have over 600 organizing staff responsible for battleground states in place by next month as they pursue an expanded map with arizona at the top of the list of new opportunities they also said that they had doubled the size of the digital team and it is growing and that they planned to implement a new livestreaming platform as they navigate the challenges of campaigning virtually during the coronavirus crisis the campaign which is seeking to cast the election as a referendum on president trump expects traditional on the ground organizing to take place sometime this year said mr biden s campaign manager jennifer o malley dillon but when that begins or when mr biden leaves his wilmington del home to campaign will be determined by public health recommendations she said the most important thing for us and for the campaign is public safety and the safety of the vice president the people around him the staff the press corps the secret service ms o malley dillon said noting the current stay at home order in delaware we will travel physically to places when the time is right driven by the experts and the guidelines that come and not a day before but she stressed i truly believe voters our volunteers our activists our supporters get as much on hearing from the v p and connecting with him in a virtual setting now as they would if he was out in person so i really feel like we re doing the business of campaigning in an aggressive way yet news of the campaign expansion comes as some democrats have expressed anxiety about mr biden s visibility and the campaign s agility headed into a general election in which mr trump has an enormous cash advantage and the bully pulpit of the presidency the biden campaign which is now fund raising with the democratic national committee has 103 million in cash on hand according to a slide show that accompanied the campaign presentation the trump campaign announced this week that in conjunction with republican fund raising committees it had 255 million on hand some democrats have also been dismayed by the poor quality of mr biden s online appearances citing the glitches that have marred some of his livestreams and have urged him to significantly upgrade his digital operation and to find ways to drive a forward looking agenda ms o malley dillon and mike donilon the biden campaign chief strategist argued that for all of the hand wringing about tactics mr biden continues to lead in many polls because he cuts strong positive contrasts with mr trump on matters from empathy to governing style the president also faces a historically challenging environment amid disapproval of his handling of a pandemic that is killing tens of thousands of americans and leaving millions unemployed the trump campaign themselves would admit they could not win a referendum on his presidency in this country today mr donilon said asked for comment a trump campaign spokesman tim murtaugh replied every election is a choice voters will be able to choose between president trump s record of success and joe biden s dismal record as a washington d c swamp monster ms o malley dillon said that in coming weeks the campaign will intensify its efforts in critical swing states with plans to have leadership in place by next month as part of an effort to build out the relatively skeletal staff that powered mr biden through the primary she promised a number of significant announcements in coming days on how the team is growing and emphasized a commitment to hiring diverse senior leadership ms o malley dillon also sketched out the biden campaign s view of the battleground map echoing the candidate who privately told supporters at a virtual meeting of his finance committee on thursday that he expected a major expansion of the playing field according to two participants she indicated that the campaign sees arizona texas and georgia as being in play she is particularly bullish she said on arizona a traditionally red state an accompanying slide described the biden strategy in arizona as a mix of persuading romney clinton voters and others who have moved toward the democratic party recently as well as increasing turnout among latino voters and voters under 30 she also said that the campaign intended to roll out a new website a night earlier mr biden again addressed the biggest controversy his campaign has faced in the general election to date saying that he did not remember tara reade the woman who has accused him of sexual assault and adding that americans probably shouldn t vote for me if they believe the accusation which he has strenuously denied i think they should vote their heart he said on msnbc asked about his message to voters who had been inclined to support him but believed the reade allegation i wouldn t vote for me if i believed tara reade ms reade a former senate aide has said that mr biden assaulted her in 1993 in the interview thursday night mr biden said that women s claims of assault should be taken seriously but should also be vetted as he sharpened his questioning of ms reade s accusation look at tara reade s story he said it changes considerably but i don t want to question her motive i don t want to question anything other than to say the truth matters on friday kate bedingfield a deputy campaign manager was asked whether the biden camp believed that mr trump or his campaign were linked to ms reade s allegation no she replied saying the campaign was not questioning her motive also thursday night mr biden indicated that he would not pardon mr trump if elected absolutely yes i commit he said when asked if he would commit to not pardoning the president and to the idea that no one is above the law

officials who asked for the identity of an unnamed american mentioned in intelligence reports about contacts with russians an american who turned out to be mr flynn according to documents released
