marc bruxelle eyeem gett garden state equality had its lowest month of fundraising in four years and it couldn t have come at a worse time new jersey s largest lgbtq organization has found itself at the center of the covid 19 pandemic in the united states after new york new jersey has the second most coronavirus cases of any u s state with more than 75 000 cases the majority of reported infections are concentrated in the northern half of new jersey garden state equality is located in the coastal town of asbury park just over an hour s drive outside new york city the global epicenter of the crisis christian fuscarino executive director of the organization said the onslaught of covid 19 has only increased the demand for resources from the lgbtq community he said community members have reached out for everything from protective gear and health care needs to financial aid while fuscarino noted that new jersey gov phil murphy indefinitely freezed evictions and foreclosures for those who are out of work or have been furloughed many of its clients live month to month and the governor s order still doesn t put food on the table for an organization that is essentially the only statewide lgbtq organization we re here for the community to be a voice and to advocate for our people on a normal day fuscarino told vice when the lives of our community are turned upside down we need to be there for them even more but continuing to meet that overwhelming need will be a challenge for garden state equality as donations have dwindled over the past few weeks fuscarino said donors who typically give generously to the organization have a lot more going on in their lives right now after murphy issued a stay at home order on march 24 the org was forced to cancel two of its largest events of the year one of those was a gala for its corporate partners the fundraiser typically brings in 30 percent of the group s operating budget for the year without those donations fuscarino estimated that 80 percent of all garden state equality s expenses in the last 30 days were paid out of its reserve funding which is set aside in case of extreme emergencies it s unclear how long that can continue especially if the covid 19 crisis lasts into the summer imagine standing under a spigot with a bucket that says monthly fundraising he said and then someone came and turned that spigot off and it stopped immediately lgbtq groups across the country say they are being forced to do more with less to offer support to a community that advocacy organizations have claimed is uniquely vulnerable to covid 19 as vice previously reported human rights campaign president alphonso david noted in a march memo that lgbtq people are less likely to have access to paid leave or health coverage and disproportionately work in industries that have been shut down by coronavirus which both puts them in greater economic jeopardy and increases their exposure to the virus but providing the assistance the community needs is a struggle when many groups are just trying to keep the lights on lgbtq groups across the country said covid 19 has severely hampered their ability to bring in funding and revenue and many have been forced to cancel events and fundraisers in the wake of the crisis just weeks into the covid 19 pandemic lgbtq organizations said they are already feeling the strain human rights campaign cancelled three fundraisers in los angeles nashville and houston and a representative told vice the l a event alone could result in a loss of possibly up to 1 million glaad was forced to cancel its annual media awards which chief communications officer rich ferraro estimated would be a 2 million implication to its bottom line family equality was forced to pull the plug on a may fundraiser that typically brings in about 1 million every year and may have to pause another event in the fall vice reached out to nearly 20 lgbtq groups for this story and almost all reported that they d had to shutter or postpone upcoming events because of the pandemic costing them critical fundraising opportunities these included from lambda literary which holds a yearly awards ceremony recognizing excellence in lgbtq literature equality texas which rescheduled four events each bringing in as much as 25 000 and the transgender equality network in fayetteville ark which couldn t hold its annual trans day of visibility gathering due to social distancing concerns vee lamneck executive director of equality virginia told vice that the impact of losing out on these events is probably incalculable although some of the individuals who had purchased tickets to its annual commonwealth dinner in march allowed the organization to keep their donations equality virginia holds a popular silent auction and raffle ticket fundraiser at the gala it brings in a quarter of our operating expenses lamneck said of the event estimating that the group would take at least a 50 000 hit it s not a small portion by any means while some organizations may be able to withstand those temporary downturns others are being forced to tighten their belts black and pink a prison justice organization based in omaha neb had to delay the launch of a youth space for formerly incarcerated lgbtq people and individuals living hiv adrian shanker executive director of the bradbury sullivan lgbt community center in allentown pa said two staff members had been furloughed this means the already small organization has only 11 employees left even as their offices are flooded with requests for help with unemployment and lgbtq specific information related to covid 19 we were understaffed to begin with and now we re even more understaffed shanker told vice we re not the kind of organization that can just turn to a rainy day fund and get through this unscathed relief organizations like indiana youth group in indianapolis and new alternatives to homeless lgbt youth in new york city haven t made any cuts to staff but they worried that a prolonged recovery period could have severe long term impacts on the programs they offer although indiana youth group ceo chris paulsen estimated that covid 19 could result in as much as 300 000 in lost grants and funding she said the organization has continued to provide food clothing showers and laundry facilities to clients however paulsen said the group could only ride out 60 days of fundraising doldrums before it would be looking at cutting services new alternatives for homeless lgbt youth executive director kate barnart noted that five fundraisers for the organization have already been cancelled or postponed and four others could follow suit the organization has continued to meet the needs of marginally housed young people by offering daily hot meals in addition to its weekly sunday night dinners and switching all its meals to carry out orders but those additional services have actually increased its operating costs we get no government funding at all barnart told vice we re a very grassroots organization and we ve always relied on community based fundraisers we already run on a shoestring so it s really hard for us to cut much organizations across the country said they are scrambling to figure out how to make up for lost funding and a few have had some success in doing so when victory fund was forced to postpone a pair of campaign brunches that would have brought together thousands of potential donors it put together a conversation on facebook live between its president and ceo annise parker and two lgbtq lawmakers endorsed by the political advocacy group pennsylvania state rep brian sims and u s senator tammy baldwin according to parker victory fund raised maybe 5 000 in donations after 6 000 viewers tuned in although outfront minnesota has had to pull its weekly drag brunches which bring in 100 000 annually for the organization development director michelle hesterberg said the organization moved its annual youth summit to a virtual event which included online workshops and hangouts for lgbtq youth because the vast majority of its partners did not cancel their sponsorship hesterberg added that the event did not lose any revenue and raised more than 50 000 for the organization chris hartman executive director of fairness kentucky told vice that his organization had also been fortunate when the statewide lgbtq group had to shutter its annual fundraiser he said 90 percent of its donors allowed their contributions and sponsorships to stand and some even bought additional tickets but even as lgbtq groups are facing challenges during an unprecedented time they remain undeterred the bayard rustin center for social justice has been hosting daily livestreams with notable figures like gavin grimm to give its members a space for community while many are stuck at home imani rupert gordon executive director of national center for lesbian rights said her organization plans to continue to hold a reimagined version of its annual gala to make sure that its supporters have somewhere where they can feel safe and be themselves and retain a sense of normalcy during uncertain times when things are closed and we re feeling lost and not every place is answering it s really important for the places that can answer to answer rupert gordon told vice we know that s something we provide for folks these groups said however that they have no choice but to continue the fight for lgbtq equality because their opponents aren t stopping even as covid 19 has shut down most of the country idaho gov brad little enacted two first of their kind laws targeting members of the trans community one blocks transgender people from correcting the gender marker on their birth certificates while the other prevents transgender girls from playing on school sports teams in alignment with their gender identity at both the k 12 and collegiate level although many state legislatures have disbanded during the covid 19 outbreak to keep lawmakers from contracting the virus lgbtq advocates know more proposals like them are headed down the pipeline when the crisis is over more than 200 anti lgbtq bills were considered by state legislatures this year and not all have been killed discrimination isn t stopping matthew ramsey chief development officer for family equality told vice our work is necessary and it can t go away we need to find a way to do it 2020 vice media llc
