democratic party and the bonds he built as barack obama s vice president which vaulted him to the top of the primary pack this year without rushing into the race early he still faces a treacherous path to the nomination including questions about his past positions and his appeal to the base of a changing party which other candidates are sure to stoke but biden s team sees an opportunity to generate something he hasn t yet had this year with a strong entrance forward momentum created by showing biden has what it takes to compete in a historically large primary field before going toe to toe with president donald trump as biden s team works to lock down national labor support it is also chasing union backing in early states like iowa where his aides have already interviewed staff i talked to his staff quite a bit said betty brim hunter who was the state political director to iowa s afl cio for 13 years asked whether she will be with biden 100 percent and i told his staff whatever i can do to help them i just retired they have my commitment former nevada democratic party chairman sam lieberman said biden has already won his endorsement and he expects labor could be easily persuaded to support joe biden if he was in the mix i have always supported him in the past and i would definitely support him now lieberman said i m just concerned that it needs to happen fast because we in nevada are getting inundated by all the candidates the long awaited campaign is finally in the works biden is expected to release a video announcement thursday morning to be followed by a rally in pittsburgh on monday a source close to the former vice president s team confirmed biden s formal announcement is to be followed by related launch events including a fundraiser in philadelphia an announcement on early state presidential staffing would soon follow and the campaign would then roll into a series of early state visits they re going to launch strategically all over the country an operative with knowledge of biden s strategy said they ll have people in place in iowa new hampshire nevada south carolina and roll out endorsements from elected officials all over the country so when they come out they can have this show of force in recent weeks biden s team or biden himself have reached out to donors around the country asking for commitments for a launch this week in philadelphia a group of donors was asking supporters to write checks even before the fundraiser slated to be held later this week once biden is officially in the race 2020 elections by stephanie murray former pennsylvania gov ed rendell who is helping organize the fundraiser said it s 99 999 percent likely to occur thursday with biden in attendance stephen cozen an attorney and longtime biden ally said the fundraising effort aims to demonstrate to others that he s got this very broad band of support at the lowest level not necessarily even at the highest level where i m sure i know for a fact there are people with a lot of money sitting out there waiting for joe to get in that s not what we re concentrating on we re concentrating on building the bottom biden s call for donors comes as he s expected to be outpaced on small donor fundraising by others in the field including sen bernie sanders who so far has the most consistent highest polling aside from biden small dollar donations have been a point of emphasis for most candidates who have sought to portray themselves as outsiders not entangled with special interests it s not an emergency but it s a need he s got a list but it s not a bernie list said a biden campaign surrogate we need to push checks up as early as possible holly otterbein and alex thompson contributed to this report missing out on the latest scoops sign up
