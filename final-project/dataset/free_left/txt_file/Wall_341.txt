advertisement supported by a majority of justices seemed skeptical of an effort by three house committees but they seemed more sympathetic to the argument of the manhattan district attorney transcript what s really happening here could not be clearer the presidency is being harassed and undermined with improper process that was issued in our view for illegitimate reasons the copying of the subpoenas speaks to that the framers saw this coming and they structured the constitution to protect the president from this encroachment the house has put legislation where its mouth is we have specifically provided bills there would be a limit if congress is interfering with the president s ability to carry out his article ii functions no such claim has been made here nor obviously can it be made i think it s fairly common knowledge that mr trump before he was president was thinking about running for president for a very long period of time why is it that congress can t believe that looking at longstanding relationships and how those relationships changed or didn t change is important to knowing what undue influence might be occurring at no place do you make a case as to why these particular subpoenas place a particular burden on the president such that he will be prevented from carrying out his constitutional responsibilities we believe a prosecutor should be required to show one an objective basis for the investigation and two a reasonable probability the request would yield relevant information the prosecutor would have to show that the information can t be obtained from another source or would be very it would be very difficult to obtain it from another source by adam liptak washington the supreme court heard more than three hours of arguments on tuesday on the powers of the presidency and whether they protect president trump from the prosecutors and house committees seeking to obtain troves of information about his business affairs the court considered two sets of cases and there was a strong possibility of a split decision a majority of the justices appeared skeptical of mr trump s argument in response to a subpoena from the manhattan district attorney that he was absolutely immune from criminal investigation while he remained in office but the court seemed more receptive to mr trump s argument that the three house committees had asked for too much information for reasons unrelated to their legislative responsibilities should the court order release of the president s tax returns and other financial information in response to the house subpoenas the records would almost certainly be made public and voters could consider them in deciding whether to re elect him in november the records may provide insight into mr trump s business practices foreign entanglements and hush money payments but if the manhattan prosecutors prevail the records would not immediately be made public under the secrecy rules that apply to grand juries because of the coronavirus the court heard the arguments by telephone an experiment that started last week the justices asked their questions one at a time in order of seniority which gave the arguments a stilted halting quality and made them harder to assess than the free for alls that are commonplace when arguments are held in the courtroom the court s ruling expected by july could require disclosure of information the president has gone to extraordinary lengths to protect or the justices could rule that mr trump s financial affairs are not legitimate subjects of inquiry but some of the justices questions raised a third possibility that the court could return the cases to lower courts for reconsideration under stricter standards that would have the incidental effect of deferring a final decision beyond the 2020 presidential election michael c dorf a law professor at cornell said the two sets of cases could have different outcomes the congressional cases appeared to split the justices on ideological lines with the possible exception of justice breyer who seemed genuinely concerned about excesses against future presidents professor dorf said referring to justice stephen g breyer there appeared to be more cross ideological agreement in the new york grand jury case justice breyer said that he was concerned about the presidency rather than a particular president recalling senator joseph r mccarthy s investigations of supposed communist infiltration of the government in the 1950s what i hold today will also apply to a future senator mccarthy asking a future franklin roosevelt or harry truman justice breyer said there was no doubt that the questions before the court were momentous and consequential for mr trump for the justices for the separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government and for the relationship between local officials and the president the subpoenas here are unprecedented in every sense said patrick strawbridge the lawyer representing mr trump in the cases on inquiries from congress trump v mazars usa no 19 715 the case the court heard first several justices disputed that saying the watergate investigation of president richard m nixon and the whitewater investigation of president bill clinton provided apt analogies both presidents lost unanimous supreme court cases in which they sought to withhold information history and practice matter quite a bit in separation of powers cases justice brett m kavanaugh said the justices returned repeatedly to those precedents united states v nixon in 1974 and clinton v jones in 1997 in the nixon case the supreme court unanimously ruled that he had to comply with a trial subpoena seeking tapes of his conversations in the oval office rejecting claims of executive privilege in the clinton case the court unanimously allowed a sexual harassment suit against the president to proceed discounting concerns that it would distract him from his official responsibilities several justices said those two cases posed problems for mr trump s position in the second case trump v vance no 19 635 resulting from the manhattan district attorney s request for business records in a criminal inquiry if nixon was required to turn over information about his official conduct in a criminal case they said why should mr trump be able to shield records of his private conduct as far as the impact of the president is concerned i think there s no case more dramatic than the nixon tapes devastating impact on the president justice ruth bader ginsburg said he resigned from office but yet that was ok so i really don t get it and if mr clinton was required to provide a deposition in the sexual harassment case several justices said why should mr trump be able to avoid the lesser burden of allowing third parties to provide information to prosecutors how do we avoid the conclusion there justice neil m gorsuch asked referring to the clinton case that the president wasn t subject to some special immunity but here is there said justice gorsuch who was appointed by president trump they sought the deposition of the president while he was serving here they re seeking records from third parties the first case concerning subpoenas from the house committees did not feature such obvious precedents and the justices questions concerning them mostly reflected their usual inclinations the more liberal members of the court for the most part were skeptical of mr trump s arguments and the more conservative ones said they were worried about opening the door to partisan harassment of the president chief justice john g roberts jr suggested that the case was in one sense routine it sounds like at the end of the day he said this is just another case in which the courts are balancing the competing interests justice breyer a member of the court s liberal wing also seemed inclined to strike a balance in the cases concerning the house subpoenas expressing dismay at their breadth and the burdens they imposed they apply to 15 trump affiliated entities he said of the subpoenas they ask for all documents related to opening of accounts due diligence closing requests for information by other parties et cetera now that s a lot of information and some of it s pretty vague justice sonia sotomayor said congressional inquiries into foreign influence over american elections were doubtless proper but she and justice kavanaugh indicated that a hypothetical subpoena for the president s medical records would be out of bounds justice elena kagan said there was a reason for the dearth of precedents relevant to the house subpoenas congress and the president had in the past worked out their differences through informal accommodations what it seems to me you re asking us to do she told mr strawbridge is to put a kind of 10 ton weight on the scales between the president and congress and essentially to make it impossible for congress to perform oversight and to carry out its functions where the president is concerned mr strawbridge responded that these subpoenas fail every hallmark of a legitimate legislative investigation jeffrey b wall a lawyer for the justice department who argued in support of mr trump in the case on the house subpoenas made a more limited but still sweeping argument you can t proceed against the president as against an ordinary litigant he said the potential to harass and undermine the president and the presidency is plain douglas n letter the general counsel of the house of representatives said the president s arguments were surprising in their boldness history really matters here he said and it shows that the arguments being made here by president trump astonishingly ask you to ignore a massive amount of history the arguments gave the public a rare chance to hear justice clarence thomas who ordinarily asks no questions from the bench and has criticized his colleagues for cutting off lawyers and each other in arguments held in the courtroom but he seems to have found the court s telephone arguments more congenial and he has been a full participant in them the sheer number and breadth of the congressional subpoenas he said on tuesday was problematic at some point he said this thing gets out of control later in the argument he elaborated there s a straw that breaks the camel s back he told mr letter and it seems as though you re saying that we should look at these in isolation as opposed to in the aggregate why wouldn t we look at all of them and look at the full effect and whether at some point it debilitates the president the second argument began immediately after the first it concerned a subpoena to mr trump s accounting firm from the office of the manhattan district attorney cyrus r vance jr a democrat seeking eight years of business and personal tax records in connection with an investigation of the role that mr trump and the trump organization played in hush money payments made in the run up to the 2016 election both mr trump and his company reimbursed the president s former lawyer and fixer michael d cohen for payments made to the pornographic film actress stormy daniels who claimed that she had an affair with mr trump mr cohen was also involved in payments to karen mcdougal a playboy model who had also claimed she had a relationship with mr trump the president has denied the relationships jay sekulow a lawyer for mr trump said his client was entitled to temporary presidential immunity from the subpoena while he remains in office that sweeping argument did not appear to gain much traction carey r dunne the general counsel of the manhattan district attorney s office said the case boiled down to a simple principle when a president acts as a private individual he or she has responsibilities like every other citizen including compliance with legal process mr dunne said in particular this court has long held that american presidents are not above having to provide evidence in response to a law enforcement inquiry some justices said they were looking for a middle ground a possible solution is to say no absolute rule justice breyer said but just send it to the ordinary system for weighing the needs versus the burdens and the different sides have to say what they are and then have that reviewable in federal court now all that would take time he said the time itself would discourage prosecutors from doing this which might be good and time itself would encourage house congress president to work things out in a nonjudicial way transcript from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily today in two historic cases on tuesday the supreme court debated the nature of presidential power and who is entitled to donald trump s personal records my colleague adam liptak listened in it s wednesday may 13 hello michael adam in a t shirt good lord what has the pandemic wrought if i went to court i d be wearing a suit of course of course but like the justices themselves you re wearing god knows what i have the distinct suspicion that there were no robes on the justices today adam set the scene for us on tuesday at the supreme court i m not even sure it was at the supreme court but set the scene the court has been hearing arguments by telephone conference call which is a new experiment this is only the second week of it this was the fifth time they did it so at 10 o clock in the morning i dialed in the honorable the chief justice and the associate justices of the supreme court of the united states i listened to the marshal of the court announce oyez oyez oyez oyez oyez oyez and then she usually has a script admonishing people to draw near supreme court of the united states are admonished to give their attention for the court is now sitting god save the united states and this honorable court gavel but she omitted that from the script because there s nothing to draw near to we were just listening in on a telephone conference call now at the same time this was quite a radical departure for the court because there was live audio right which everyone in the country could listen to in real time right usually we have to wait days to get that audio yeah typically it comes out the friday after the arguments which happen on monday tuesday wednesday so if we were still living in the pre pandemic world they would have not released audio till friday and that allowed us to listen into two cases both involving subpoenas to president trump one from congressional committees the other from prosecutors in manhattan both seeking his tax returns and all kinds of records concerning his business affairs and that clash gave the public an opportunity in real time to see the justices in action ok tell us about the first of these two cases what s the background the first case we will argue today is case 19 715 donald trump v mazars u s a the first case concerns three different sets of subpoenas from house committees the house of representatives of course controlled by democrats seeking a variety of business records about president trump his children his dealings with his bank his accountants his tax returns you know large troves of information that the president is fighting hard to protect and what was the original rationale from these congressional committees in seeking these very sensitive documents they say they have oversight responsibilities and they say that gathering this information will allow them to propose legislation on things like conflicts of interest mr strawbridge mr chief justice and may it please the court so how do the oral arguments unfold well the first thing that happens and this is also a recent innovation the lawyers are given a couple of minutes of uninterrupted time to lay out their case the subpoenas at issue here are unprecedented in every sense before these cases no court had ever upheld the use of congress s subpoena power to demand the personal records of a sitting president so president trump s lawyer in the house subpoenas case patrick strawbridge starts by saying that these are unprecedented subpoenas and the court should block them the rule that the court applies here will affect not only this president but the presidency itself the court should deny the committees the blank check they seek and reverse the decisions below his argument is that there s no link between congressional responsibilities and what is being sought here the president s personal papers are not related to anything having to do with the workings of government and to empower the committees to simply declare him a useful case study is to open the door to all sorts of oppressive requests you could have that sure congress has some power to investigate in order to enact wise legislation but that this was partisan harassment that they don t need president trump s tax records to make tax law they wouldn t need his medical records to decide how to reform the affordable care act and that this is a kind of dragnet fishing expedition the threat in this case of subpoenaing decades worth of papers not only of the president but of the president s family members of his children of his grandchildren as the house has done in this case poses an obvious problem with respect to harassment and infringement upon the ability of the executive to discharge his duties so the argument here from trump s lawyer is that the idea that these documents are needed for legislative affairs and legislative production is basically a fancy cover for just wanting embarrassing documents about the president that s the argument yeah and what is the response from the justices well the justices respond one by one in this new way of questioning the justices ask a couple questions each in order of seniority justice ginsberg counsel in so many of these prior cases there was a cooperation for example tax returns every president voluntarily turned over his tax returns the liberal justices are mostly skeptical of the president s argument and they point out that for most of our history when there have been these kinds of clashes the congress and the president have worked things out have found a way to accommodate one another the president would turn over some but not all information and justice elena kagan says that what the president is asking for here what it seems to me you re asking us to do is to throw a 10 ton weight on the scales between the president and congress and avoid that kind of accommodation and some of the subpoenas that congress through history as far back as 1792 have asked for personal papers of the president while being president justice sonia sotomayor points out that there have been congressional subpoenas throughout our history going back as far as thomas jefferson this she says is different this is easier we re asking for his personal tax returns before he became president she s saying that the current case doesn t even ask for the documents of the official duties of a sitting president this is old news this is what the president as a private citizen did so that s the liberal justices who seem to be skeptical of the president s arguments what are the conservative justices getting at in their questioning thank you counsellor justice thomas following up on the chief justice s question what if it was clear from those statements that you reviewed that their intention was actually to remove the president from office the conservatives say that there have to be some limits we can t live in a world where every committee of congress can on a whim require the custodians of a president s records his business records his medical records to turn them over for no good reason and there have to be limits there has to be a connection between legislative responsibilities and why the information is sought so justice kavanaugh for instance said but i think everyone has explored with you that just about everything can be characterized in terms of a subpoena as pertinent to a legislative purpose that just about all information can somehow be said to be relevant to some piece of legislation and the question then boils down to how can we both protect the house s interests in obtaining information it needs to legislate but also protect the presidency how can the court balance those interests and so the conservative side of the court was sensitive and not only the conservative side of the court because justice breyer also had some qualms in this area about whether these very broad some say dragnet subpoenas go too far in what could be said to be harassment of the president and what about the lawyer for congress for the people seeking these records what is his argument for the legitimacy of these subpoenas mr letter yes mr chief justice and may it please the court so doug letter the lawyer for the house the house s general counsel says that they ve laid out in great detail why they need these records they say they re investigating for instance president trump s foreign entanglements that might shed light on election interference there s an obvious need to focus on the president s financial records to determine if the president is subject to foreign leverage they say that the president s business records and tax records could inform what kind of conflicts of interest legislation the house might want to propose do we need better laws about conflicts of interests do we need better laws about for example a president dealing in contracts with government agencies and they say that they have general oversight responsibilities over the executive including the president so at this point there seem to be two debates going on one argues that historical patterns show that these requests have happened all the time and presidents have handed over these documents the other is that congress needs to really show that there s a legislative purpose to have these documents and i wonder if either of those questions is resolved and what they tell us about the nature of the president s power versus congress s so i don t think we had anything like a resolution of the question and i think there are multiple outcomes that are possible in the house subpoenas case but it does illustrate just how important these questions are because it s quite rare for the supreme court to weigh in on the responsibilities duties of the other two branches so this is a big separation of powers case where on the one hand you have congress saying we need this information to do our job to make laws and move society forward and on the other hand you have the president who says i m the head of a branch of the federal government and i can t be made to cooperate in handing over all kinds of sensitive material from my private business affairs for what looks to me to be like a partisan witch hunt and from what you could gather during these oral arguments how eager or uneager are these justices to resolve that major question between those two branches of our government you know some are more eager than others but the court as a whole didn t seem to coalesce around any particular theory and may be looking for some kind of exit ramp a likely scenario could be for the court to send it back down to the lower courts to say we re not sure who s right but we think you lower courts were too sympathetic to congress why don t you have another cut at this using a stricter standard about whether congress really needs these records kicking it down to a lower court would be pretty anticlimactic for a major constitutional clash between congress and the executive yes speaking only as a journalist that s not my preferred outcome but whatever happens on the house subpoenas there s a second case also argued on tuesday and there the coalitions look quite different we ll be right back we ll hear argument next in case 19 635 donald trump vs cyrus vance so adam tell us about this second case that was heard by the justices via conference call on tuesday well they concern the same kinds of documents but the subpoena comes from a different source it comes from the manhattan d a cyrus vance jr which is conducting a criminal inquiry and it s looking into the hush money payments that president trump through his lawyer and fixer michael cohen paid to two women who said they had affairs with him affairs he denies it s a more straightforward case and why is it more straightforward than a congressional subpoena there s not a lot of precedent on congressional subpoenas and particularly congressional subpoenas to the president but there are leading precedents on criminal inquiries and civil lawsuits seeking information from the president i feel like you have mentioned those precedent cases in the past and that they include correct me if i m wrong president clinton and president nixon that s right and so in two cases the supreme court and both of them unanimously ruled against presidents seeking to withhold information and in many ways those cases were more intrusive than what was at issue here president nixon was required to turn over oval office tapes about his official conduct president clinton was made to sit for a deposition in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by paula jones here the records sought are in the hands of third parties and don t seem to impose anything like the same kind of burden as those other two cases and a third party in the trump case would be an accounting firm for example that s right yeah so how did the oral arguments unfold in this case mr sekulow thank you mr chief justice and may it please the court the president s lawyer jay sekulow makes a very broad argument this court has long recognized that the president is not to be treated as an ordinary citizen he has responsibilities he is himself a branch of government he is the only individual that is a branch of government in our federal system he says that the president enjoys temporary immunity from even being investigated our position is that the constitution itself both in structure and text supports the position that the president would be temporarily immune from this activity from a state proceeding while he is the president of the united states and justice thomas the court s most conservative member seems unconvinced yes i m interested in whether or not you can point us to some express language you think at the founding or during the ratification process that provides for this immunity asking sekulow where that immunity appears in the constitution and what is sekulow s answer well there s a couple sekulow cites some materials from the founding era there was a colloquy between vice president adams and senator ellsworth where they talked about process against the president and they took the position that any process against the president would be constitutionally problematic but the concern but they don t seem to get him very far down the road justice ginsburg so the more liberal justices really have no patience for sekulow s arguments we have said in the grand jury context that the public has a right to every man s evidence is it your position that the grand jury right to every man s evidence is exclusive of the president justice ginsburg it s not that it excludes the president the president is not to be treated as an ordinary citizen and this is a temporary immunity this is for while the president s in office and we think that ok so that argument does not seem to be succeeding so what other defenses is sekulow are making here well the fallback argument is that you should apply a really strict standard to subpoenas directed at the president s records and that you should only be able to do this if the information can t be obtained any other way if it s critical to your decision about whether you re going to charge the president or someone else with a crime so that backup argument is almost certainly the ground on which the supreme court will decide the case not the absolute immunity argument the decision would allow any d a to harass distract and interfere with a sitting president it subjects the president to local prejudice that can influence prosecutorial decisions at the i listened to this hearing and i recall sekulow basically saying if we re not careful every local prosecutor in the country might start coming at the president of an opposite party and that would be a nightmare you can t just look at the one subpoena it is the potential for 2 300 d a s or just 1 percent of them 23 d a s issuing process against the president but the concern right but we do have some evidence that it hasn t happened yet the president has been in office for three years and this is the one grand jury subpoena of this kind that i know of and that local prosecutor in nebraska would need to have some kind of jurisdiction over the president but the trump organization was not headquartered in nebraska it was headquartered in manhattan so you re saying almost by definition there will be very few local prosecutors with grounds to bring a case that involves a subpoena of the president right but sekulow says that the president s time is really valuable and we shouldn t lightly impinge on it to require the president to have to respond to each and every state district attorney that no he would hire you and he d hire a lawyer to list what the burdens are that wouldn t take a lot of time and then he wouldn t be burdened because you d go in and say what the burdens are and if you re right you win that case they are saying the other side there are no burdens here well send it back and let them figure out what they are i think that doing that establishes the problem with an analysis of a case by case analysis for instance in this very case in this subpoena found on page 118a and 19 of the petition appendix is a list of documents that are extensive you would have to meet with the president of the united states i mean could you imagine just for a moment justice breyer that i and you said let s assume the president wanted to hire me then i m going to call the president of the united states today and say i know you re handling a pandemic right now for the united states but i need to spend a couple of two to three hours with you going over a subpoena of documents that are wanted by here the new york county district attorney i know you re busy so he s now making a very practical argument not so much a constitutional one that if the president is required to answer subpoenas from a prosecutor in manhattan that that could take up a lot of his time yeah so it s both a practical and constitutional argument the president as the head of the executive branch should deserve some protection so that his time is not wasted on nonsense but the bill clinton case in which he was made to sit for a deposition certainly suggests that some impingement on the president s time is allowed where the justice system can t work otherwise justice gorsuch makes pretty much this exact point how is this more burdensome though than what took place in clinton vs jones i guess i m not sure i understand well i mean there s a big distinction between a defendant in a civil case and a principal in a criminal case here by the state district let me stop you there yes there they sought the deposition of the president while he was serving here they re seeking records from third parties so i m hearing a lot of skepticism from all the justices to these arguments it doesn t seem like the lawyer for cy vance in manhattan had a ton of work to do but what was his argument he said yes we recognize the president has important duties important duties the other principle is that under our constitution when a president acts as a private individual he or she has responsibilities like every other citizen including compliance with legal process but it s also true that no person is above the law and you balance these things out and a focused subpoena directed to not the president himself but to his accountants in a legitimate criminal inquiry is appropriate and that message seemed to resonate with many of the justices thank you mr chief justice thank you counsel the case is submitted gavel it sounds like the court is leaning towards a ruling in this case where cy vance the manhattan district attorney will likely get the records he s seeking from the president i think a split decision michael is fairly likely so that trump loses the manhattan d a case wins or at least gets a timeout in the house subpoenas case and that has implications because interestingly if the manhattan d a wins it s a grand jury subpoena it goes to a grand jury grand juries are secret so it could be that although trump has to turn over the records they ll be shielded from public view even so and in that case you just outlined adam the president s tax records would remain secret yes at least in the short term yeah adam on a slightly more practical note it occurs to me that the justices are going to be ruling in both of these cases at the end of their term typically it s june july which happens to be the height of the presidential campaign and the presidential campaign involves the person at the center of these two cases president trump if they side against the president that would mean public release of pretty embarrassing documents if they side for him it means those documents are largely going to be shielded i have to imagine the justices understand the context in which they re going to be making these rulings oh i think they re well aware of it and they might have some reason to want to duck the issue in order not to be playing a role in the presidential election i also think the court will be sensitive to charges that it s acting in a partisan way so it might like to have a split decision in which trump wins one and loses one and there are ways in which you could do that and send a message about the independence of the court and hand trump a loss in the grand jury case but does not deliver to the american public information that some voters would like to have in deciding whether to vote for or against president trump a really potentially very interesting outcome yeah it s one of many one of many we ll see in june or july how right these predictions proved to be well we really do enjoy holding you accountable for these predictions so we will do that well you know what i hope to be right well adam thank you very much thank you michael we ll be right back here s what else you need to know today so i d just like to hear your honest opinion do we have the coronavirus contained senator thank you for the question right now it depends on what you mean by containment if you think that we have it completely under control we don t if you look during a senate hearing on tuesday two of the federal government s top health officials painted a grim picture of the months ahead warning that the u s has not contained the pandemic and that reopening the country too quickly could lead to a new wave of infections if we do not respond in an adequate way when the fall comes given that it is without a doubt that the infections will be in the community then we run the risk of having a resurgence the two men dr anthony fauci and robert redfield of the c d c offered a far bleaker diagnosis than president trump who has called for a swift reopening and has predicted a quick victory over the virus so i think we ought to have a little bit of humility in our belief that we know what s best for the economy and as much as i respect you dr fauci i don t think you re the end all i don t think you re the one person that gets to make a decision during the hearing republican senator rand paul of kentucky pressed fauci on why the country should trust his judgment i have never made myself out to be the end all and only voice in this i m a scientist a physician and a public health official i give advice according to the best scientific evidence i don t give advice about economic things i don t get advice about anything other than public health that s it for the daily i m michael barbaro see you tomorrow advertisement
