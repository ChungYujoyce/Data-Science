democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders has a new tv ad out this week and it shows in vividly brilliant terms exactly why he is overwhelming hillary clinton s traditional establishment style campaign his campaign is about us it s not about him he doesn t highlight his experience or plans to get things done he channels all of our desire to make our country better and make it work for everyone his us is all of us normal americans against them the broken system and partisan political establishment sanders is not the only one with this kind of formula of success republican front runner donald trump is doing much the same thing the difference is that trump s us doesn t include everyone his us is mostly just straight white christians his them isn t just the political establishment it s the people who are different from his us his them includes immigrants muslims and anyone else he can find to blame our country s problems on his us doesn t include enough voters to win a national election but he sure can win a republican primary because it s a party of mostly straight white christians hillary clinton was once the unbeatable candidate but her inevitability has dissolved because of her campaign s inability to connect with voters and include all of us on a personal level she actually started the campaign off on the right foot her everyday americans announcement video and early campaign theme struck the right tone it was essentially it s about you and me america let s work together to make our country better hillary clinton s campaign went south went she started making it about her and her experience clinton s new slogans reflect a shift away from everyday americans slogans such as fighting for us or her hashtag imwithher don t include her with us why not fighting together or she s with us she shouldn t be removed from us it should be we re in this together it s not just slogans that separate her from us it s her language she regularly speaks in the first person singular i while her opponent almost always says we why the shift i suspect that the campaign received great feedback after her stellar performances in the first debate and the benghazi hearing and they saw that her experience and unmatched depth of knowledge are their best assets indeed they are her best asset but making the campaign about her preparedness to be president puts the focus in the wrong place when a campaign is about the candidate then that shines the light on them that light reveals what we like about them but it also reminds us about everything we dislike about them sanders isn t making his campaign about him and that s why voters aren t focused on the fact that he s a 1960s era radical socialist who now wants to be commander in chief after being a conscientious objector during the vietnam war clinton has also employed the old partisan language of the broken political establishment by recently ranting on about how our country does better under democrats than under republicans and she s a good democrat and bernie s not she s also embraced high profile endorsements from elected officials and the political establishment in washington that only serves to remind us that she is not us she s them she s part of bernie s them so by making her campaign about her and her experience the campaign inadvertently reminds america what they don t like about her then by embracing the rhetoric and people of the broken political establishment clinton paints herself clear on the side of sanders them that s why her campaign is repelling voters especially politically disenchanted young voters and driving them into the open arms of sanders it s not too late for clinton and her campaign to right the ship return to their campaign for everyday americans and bring voters together in support of her but she had better do it fast those voters sanders is reaching with his message about us aren t going to stop turning out to vote for him any time soon copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
