some republicans for attending the protest and flagrantly encouraging behavior that he said endangered the lives of heroes on the front lines in a statement goodwin said the frustrations over the economic hardship millions of north carolinians are feeling right now are entirely valid but to return to our normal way of life we must let science facts and data guide our next steps protesting safely under these circumstances is one thing but today s demonstration quickly devolved into a dangerous situation in which social distancing guidelines were entirely ignored he added u s representative dan bishop and state representative jerry carter s attendance at this event is a shameful display of ignorance and selfishness goodwin also called on the state republican party to disavow the outrageous behavior of the aforementioned republican lawmakers cbs news reached out to the north carolina republican party but didn t receive a response before the publishing of this piece

director david bergstein said in a statement wisconsin milwaukee s health commissioner says there areat least seven cases of the coronavirus tied to in person votingduring the april 7 election as of monday cbs news campaign reporter adam brewstersays those seven cases are the first linked to the in person voting held two weeks ago in wisconsin despite a stay at home order and attempts to delay or cancel in person voting the number could increase as more cities report data and as milwaukee gathers more information please note that we only have 30 of the data back from new cases as of 4 7 and on milwaukee health commissioner jeanette kowalik said in a statement to cbs news on tuesday we hope to have these fields complete by friday and will provide a more complete report then kowalik said the city is also looking at any new cases that began after april 7 since the incubation period is 14 days meaning the time frame when symptoms typically appear more than 18 000 people voted in person in milwaukee at five different polling sites during the april 7 election milwaukee typically operates 180 polling locations but like many cities around wisconsin had to consolidate locations due to a drastic shortage of poll workers kowalik said monday during a press briefing that she expects to know more soon whether those cases were concentrated at a single location or among a group of people who knew each other there needs to be a little bit more analysis so we can connect the dots that s why case investigation and contact tracing is so important kowalik said before kowalik s briefing on monday wisconsin health secretary designee andrea palm said state officials had not seen indications of an impact from the election but she noted the lag time it can take for symptoms or information about the virus to show up separately wisconsin s republican leaders in the legislature are asking the state s supreme court to block wisconsin s extended safer at home order issued last week democratic governor tony evers directed department of health services secretary designee andrea palm last thursday to extend the order from april 24 to may 26 it lifted some restrictions on daily life but shut down schools for the rest of the current school year and kept many businesses closed the legislative leaders slammed the ability for palm to act with such broad authority purporting to act under color of state law an unelected unconfirmed cabinet secretary has laid claim to a suite of czar like powers unlimited in scope and indefinite in duration over the people of wisconsin the filing said the lawsuit expressed concerns that palm could continue to extend the order without legislative oversight it also argues that the state could face dire consequences since restrictions apply not only to cities dealing with a high level of cases but also rural counties with few or no known cases by the time the secretary sees fit to lift her decree be it in five weeks or eight months many wisconsinites will have lost their jobs and many companies will have gone under to say nothing of the order s countless other downstream societal effects the complaint says our state will be in shambles the lawsuit comes one day after evers outlined his plan to start to reopen wisconsin the proposal would open the state in three phases based on several metrics including a 14 day downward trajectory of flu and covid 19 like cases being reported and a 14 day downward trajectory of positive cases compared to total tests it requires hitting benchmarks for things like increased testing more contact tracing greater access to ppe and enough healthcare capacity campaign cash biden had his best month of fundraising to date in march as the race for the democratic presidential nomination
