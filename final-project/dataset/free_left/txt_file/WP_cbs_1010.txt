watch cbsn live february 19 2020 6 03 am cbs news in this episode of intelligence matters host michael morell speaks with ben buchanan assistant teaching professor at georgetown university s school of foreign service and senior fellow at the university s center for security studies morell and buchanan discuss the intersection of technology and statecraft focusing on the potential effect artificial intelligence driven technologies may have on the geopolitical dynamics among nations buchanan reviews some of the central questions surrounding ai including how autocratic governments and democratic governments may leverage it and how offensive cyber operations may come to rely on it buchanan also shares elements of his forthcoming book the hacker and the state intelligence matters ben buchanan correspondent michael morell producer olivia gazis jamie benson michael morell ben thanks for joining us on intelligence matters it s great to have you ben buchanan my pleasure thank you michael morell i want to start ben by asking what got you interested in this intersection between technology and national security ben buchanan when i was younger i thought the coolest thing in the world was technology and that was all i was interested in and then 9 11 happened the bush administration happened michael morell how did that interest in technology play out ben buchanan like every kid i wanted to make video games i wanted to do the dorky stuff and then 9 11 happened bush administration happened war in iraq and i thought this technology stuff is fun but it doesn t really matter so i went hard into international affairs studied arabic forgot about technology and remarkably the two fields really came together where international affairs started to be a domain in which technology really mattered not in the sense of video games and the like but in the sense of cybersecurity in sense of artificial intelligence and it s very fortunate to see these two things that have been animating my interests for a long time come together in particularly complex and interesting ways michael morell so post 9 11 you deep dive into international relations and national security and then you see the importance of technology how did you get smart on all these technologies that are so important ben buchanan i was a ph d student when i made this decision to focus again on technology and the great thing about ph d students is they have a lot of time in the cybersecurity context i think i read every single word of every single report put out by private sector companies and one of the things that s remarkable about cybersecurity is there was just this wealth of information that the private sector was producing on russian and chinese and north korean hackers and reading these technical reports was my education during the ph d in how to think about these fields and this intersection and eventually in the latter part of the ph d i started getting very interested in artificial intelligence and thinking about how can artificial intelligence change not just the cyber game between nations but more generally the geopolitical game between nations michael morell so ben there s always been this intersection between technology and national security if you think about the beginnings of warfare gunpowder and turning a church bell over and making it a cannon and the manhattan project the launch of sputnik the u 2 spy plane there s always been this intersection is there something fundamentally different now about that intersection compared to history or is it just a matter of degree do you think ben buchanan it s probably a matter of degree and it s probably also a matter of pace i think what s remarkable to me as much as reading on the last 20 years of cyber operations who s thought about ai is that the developments are happening very quickly and the developments are also happening in the private sector and i think particularly when you talk about artificial intelligence the key difference between that and the technologies you mentioned like the manhattan project is how much of the truly cutting edge research is happening not in government labs but it s happening in private sector companies michael morell so as you know i wanted to have you on to talk about ai and its impact on national security but i wanted to mention that you have a new book coming out in the next couple weeks it s called the hacker and the state cyber attacks and the new normal of geopolitics can you take just a minute and tell us what the book s about ben buchanan my goal in writing this was to synthesize my thoughts of studying cyber operations for the last ten years how and why nations hack each other and to put it in sort of one stop shopping to understand how it is that nations project power what cyber operations are good for and what hacking can t do so it s very narrative each chapter is a different story of how nations project power in cyberspace from cases we probably know a little bit about like stuxnet to cases that we probably don t know much about at all or certainly don t know many of the technical details about unless you really go deep in this field already like the blackouts in ukraine or like encryption back doors between big nations michael morell is there a main theme that comes out of it ben buchanan the theme i think is that too often in international relations scholarship and also to some degree in policy we look at cyber operations like they re nuclear operations and we look at them like they re these tools for signaling between nations the kind of signaling that animated the cold war and i don t think that s right i think cyber operations are much more the domain of shaping and nations rather than bluffing at the poker table they re stealing aces and stacking the deck and they re using these shaping operations well below the threshold of conflict to change the state of play and i think it s quite interesting in the scholarship and maybe to some degree the policy hasn t quite caught up with that michael morell so ben ai artificial intelligence maybe the place to start is by asking you what is it because i think a lot of people don t understand what it is so in layman s terms how would you describe ai ben buchanan the first thing we need to do when we think about ai is differentiate ai from its cousin machine learning and you ll hear both these terms used interchangeably and they re not quite interchangeable machine learning is the current paradigm for ai we ve had other ones in the past but machine learning shows the most promise and that is quite simply using machines to learn from data and this inverts our previous paradigm of computer programming where we give computers very clear instructions in machine learning we tell the machine using an algorithm how to learn and we give it data from which to learn and we give it computing power that enables this learning to happen so the three parts of an ai system these days are the algorithm the data and the computing power and we ve seen remarkable advances in each of those three parts over the last ten years or so and frankly that s why we re here that s why we re talking about ai because in this machine learning paradigm the data the algorithm and the computing power have gotten much better and have let us do things that maybe ten or even five years ago we didn t think were possible michael morell so a basic calculator would that be considered ai or a kind of crude form of ai ben buchanan there s an old joke that once something starts working we stop calling it ai and start calling it software so there probably was a time when we thought a calculator would be really intelligent but it certainly doesn t work with machine learning it doesn t work with this modern paradigm of giving computers the data and telling them how to learn from that data a calculator or any kind of basic math computer program is the traditional linear model of computing michael morell so give us a non national security example of ai ben buchanan probably the most famous example is what a company called deepmind did in 2016 when they beat the world champion at go and what s remarkable about go is how complex it is michael morell this is the chinese ben buchanan the ancient asian board game how complex it is relative to other board games so there are more possible combinations on the go board than there are atoms in the universe in fact there are more possible combinations of the go board than total atoms if every atom in our universe had a universe of atoms within it and you add all those up still more possible combinations on the go board michael morell that s amazing actually to think about ben buchanan it s just a remarkable number and what this means is that you can t calculate in go you have to intuit the right answer because there s so many possibilities you can t calculate through and i think for a long time we thought this was something that only humans could do only humans could have the sense of feeling the right answer intuiting the right answer and what deepmind showed in 2016 is that machines can do it too or at least machines can mimic it and that was a remarkable success for pushing forward in what ai can do and i think really put this on the map for a lot of people not least the asian countries like china that have played go for 4 000 years michael morell so i suppose ben like all technologies ai has pluses and minuses from a national security perspective so maybe we can kind of break it into those two and maybe start with the downsides how can it be used against us ben buchanan i think one of the things that concerns me the most in the context of a nation like china is how ai can enable authoritarianism and this is the question i ve asked my students on their final exam every single semester because i think it s so fascinating which is will ai benefit democracy more than autocracy and there s a case to be made that ai will solve or help to solve some of the central problems of authoritarian regimes namely centralizing power and if you look at ai as a tool of surveillance ai as a tool of facial recognition ai as a tool of essentially enabling an ever more aggressive and ever more intrusive police state then i think that works against the interests of democracies and we need to think quite seriously about how do we combat this and take this technology and use it for democratic purposes michael morell you ve also written and talked a lot about ai and cyber together ben buchanan that s right michael morell the link between can you talk about that ben buchanan yeah so we re starting a project at georgetown at the center for security and emerging technology focused on this intersection and there s a lot of hype and that s the first thing we need to say i think there s a lot of hype in silicon valley around ai and cyber on defense but there s also some promise there and one of the questions we re exploring still in the early stages is what could ai do for cyber offense and i think a vision people often paint is that you ll get to some world in which you ve got ai in defense and ai in offense playing this out in cyber operations again there s some hype to that but there probably are pieces of that that are true and we re trying to sort the signal from the noise on that michael morell and what are we finding so far ben buchanan it s early days but i think if nothing else putting aside the machine learning piece and looking a little more generally at automation it s fair to say that some of the most powerful cyber attacks in history have been the ones that have some automated component that have the capacity to spread themselves or push decision making to the code stuxnet s a well known example here another one less well known but quite interesting is the 2016 blackout in ukraine this is the second blackout that happened in ukraine in the span of a year the 2015 blackout was incredibly manual 2016 blackout had much more automation in the code and one of the questions that we re asking is what does that mean how do we interpret this increasing level of automation pushing closer to a fire and forget kind of cyber attack where the code could find the configuration of the industrial control system and attack it without too much guidance that might be a sign of things to come michael morell and what is the difference between a manual cyber attack look like versus an ai enabled cyber attack what s fundamentally different ben buchanan if you look at the 2015 versus 2016 blackout in 2015 you had the hackers themselves executing each step so they d give a command the malicious code would execute they d give another command the 2016 blackout was pushing much more towards they would launch the malicious code against the target and it would make some decisions on its own about how the target is configured and how to carry out an attack against that target it s worth saying the 2016 blackout code was not terribly effective it failed in this capability in some key ways doing less damage than it might otherwise have done but i think it might be a sign of things to come which you re pushing more decision making power to the malicious code allowing you to go faster and with fewer loops to human operators michael morell so we see the russians doing this do we see any other nation states trying to link these two together ai and cyber ben buchanan i think it s probably fair to say that russia has a high risk tolerance and is content to be aggressive and we see the most of russian activity i don t think we ve seen a lot of public discussion of american activity in this area it wouldn t surprise me if folks in intelligence agencies are thinking about what this could do not only on the attack side in the case of the united states but also on the data analysis side same with intelligence programs bring back an enormous amount of information processing that information is a key part of the business of folks at nsa and the like and you can imagine ai will help but this is not something that s widely discussed michael morell and you ve also written a little bit and i saw you gave a testimony on the link between ai and terrorism counterterrorism ben buchanan that s right michael morell can you talk about that ben buchanan i think where this comes up the most is in two areas the first is internet moderation and i think the view that some people have who are a little more technically utopian than i am that ai will solve the challenges of internet moderation on platforms like facebook and the like and i m pretty skeptical i think the technology is not near the point where it needs to be to judge things like context and the like the same terrorist video in one context could be a recruiting tool another context could be a legitimate news report one should go down the other one should stay up on a platform like facebook so i was pushing back in that testimony a little bit on the notion that technology s going to solve our counterterrorism problems on the internet certainly i think the second piece of this is how recommendation algorithms and the like on platforms like you tube and facebook are essentially governed by ai it determines what you see on the internet and that s certainly as you know far better than i do a breeding ground for terrorism and a recruiting tool michael morell one of the things i hear over and over and over again and i m wondering a if you do and b what you think of it is the potential risks of a link between ai and biotechnology ben buchanan i think it s a little too soon to say i don t worry about that as much in the terrorism context in wmds i don t think the capability is there there s interesting work to be done with ai and bio and ai and science probably the most promising work is something we saw from deepmind again the same company that did alphago something they called alphafold and this made progress on one of the hardest problems in biotech called the protein folding problem which we don t need to parse the details of but it s a problem that essentially relates to how proteins can combine and entangle themselves making progress on this problem is key for drug discovery and the like and i think alphafold showed there s some significant progress for ai in the biotech context away from national security but just in pure science to advance beyond what humans have been able to do deepmind has made a lot of investments in the science area and biotech is one of the areas in which they re making progress michael morell so any other big areas of ai s impact on national security that you think about that we haven t talked about ben buchanan probably the biggest one that people talk about is ai and autonomous weapons and the degree to which artificial intelligence should be used in kinetic weapon systems that kill the degree to which those systems should have the authority to decide on their own to fire what the role of the humans should be there are deep questions here that i think the national security state is only beginning to figure out and you can imagine that democracies and autocracies would come to different answers on these questions michael morell and are people thinking about this not only here but also in places like china and russia are those conversations happening ben buchanan no doubt and russia has a very long history in particular of trying to push more automation to their systems even before the modern machine learning paradigm if you look at some of what russia s done with their nuclear systems there s i think strong hints at automation there china s a little harder to read but you can imagine that this is something that would be of interest to the chinese leadership particularly if you don t have the strong officer corps the u s has if you don t trust your people in the same way the u s military might autonomy in control again serves the authoritarian purpose michael morell and at this early stage in the discussion which way do you tend to lean ben buchanan i think the best analogy i know of is from paul charette who writes about this and he says there s a distinction in how we think about this thing on december 6 1941 and december 8th and part of me feels like the real question with autonomous weapons is not what do we think about it in the abstract but when people are actually dying are there principles here for which we re willing to send american warriors to die in other words we will not use autonomy because we believe in these principles that is the much more profound question you don t often see that much tougher question asked essentially in a conflict that involves autonomous weapons that are better which is again speculative would we be willing to not use the weapons and to have people die instead one of the things i like about ai is how it raises very deep ethical questions as well as hard power national security questions michael morell so let s switch gears a little bit ben if we can and who has the lead today united states china somebody else in the use of ai for national security purposes ben buchanan i think it probably depends on which part of ai you re thinking about if you look at image recognition for example facial recognition it seems pretty clear the chinese are ahead in that area as i said before there s some domestic reasons why they would pursue that if you re looking about integrating ai into other systems the u s has made some pretty big investments in the last couple years standing up the joint ai center at the pentagon for example spinning out project maven we haven t always seen the results of that you can imagine they re locked away in places but that s an area where the u s i think has invested more than things like facial recognition for national security so it depends on the piece of the ai puzzle that you re talking about michael morell and what about russia are they doing anything in this area that concerns you ben buchanan there s a famous quote from vladimir putin where he said about ai whoever controls this technology will rule the world so there s probably some directive from the top but i don t think that we ve seen that play out at the level of investment that the united states and china have for reasons probably that the united states and china just have more resources than a nation like russia but certainly the russian interest in autonomy as i said goes back quite a while michael morell and what skillsets do you as a nation state need to maximize the benefit you can get out of tying these two together ben buchanan there s two pieces to this the first is the capacity to develop ai algorithms and software themselves and the people who can do this in some sense are like nfl quarterbacks there s just not enough of them and the demand is really high and those people are primarily concentrated in the private sector right now the second piece of this that s particularly important in national security is integrating these algorithms and these advances into your national security systems and that s something i think that s overlooked because it s not flashy but it s really important ai is not just magic pixie dust that you sprinkle on something and automatically makes the technology that you re using already better integration and design test and evaluation those are all key parts of integrating ai into national security and i think that s going to be where the rubber hits the road for using this technology well michael morell and you would think that the government needs a certain skillset that it might not have today in order to do that ben buchanan that s right and marrying geopolitical sensibilities with technical skill putting the team together to do this these are all hard organizational problems that are not really about the technology they re about scaling integration of the technology into a much broader defense apparatus than many other applications of ai have to integrate with michael morell so ben what s the appropriate role of the government here and the private sector and then most importantly how do you think about what the appropriate link is between the government and the private sector ben buchanan the camps are far apart we ve talked about deepmind a couple time today in the terms of sale for deepmind to google was the provision that they would do no defense work and as a pretty broad generalization many ai researchers have cosmopolitan views in which they feel like they re here to work on hard science problems problems that if solved will benefit everyone and not so much this hard power competition between nations there s no better example of this than the dustup between google and the pentagon over google s work on project maven the pentagon s ai project so the two sides are pretty far apart there s certainly a frustration i think with some in the tech companies about activities of the intelligence community in the past activities of the military in the past and i don t see a lot of reason for near term optimism about bridging that gap probably it makes sense that for the country it d be best if the two sides could reconcile a bit and understand where each is coming from and why but right now the gap seems to be pretty far michael morell it seems to me anyway like there s mistrust on both sides ben buchanan for sure michael morell if you re in the tech community you worry about what the government s going to do with your technology and if you re in the government you re looking at these tech companies saying we don t want to work with you because of our concerns about what you re going to do but we are working with the chinese on helping them perfect their surveillance state so the government folks are sitting there scratching their heads saying hey what s going on here ben buchanan that s right and i think that captures the gap well it s worth saying not all tech companies feel this way amazon has been cleared and they ll do more government work but certainly many of the ai engineers that i interact with especially folks at google and the like have this view that we need to keep ourselves separate from national defense work michael morell are there any lessons ben to be learned from the relationship between the government and the private sector now on these technologies and the early years of the cold war when the government and the private sector came together to really make some significant advances that enhanced national security ben buchanan i think the biggest difference and probably the biggest lesson is that in those early years of the cold war the government was a very good customer and in many cases the only customer companies like google and the like tech companies in general have many other customers that are easier to work with that have fewer contracting restrictions that are in many cases just a much bigger market so i don t think that for a tech company as opposed to a defense contractor there s necessarily economic incentive to contort themselves to work with government to say nothing of the trouble it creates with some of their employees so on the government side i think there s a realization that the game s actually quite different than the old days of the cold war in that the u s is not the only or the best customer michael morell so ben we ve talked a lot about ai is it the most important technology being developed today as it relates to national security or is there something else that s more important are there other things that are just as important how do you think about that ben buchanan often i get asked to give a talk on ai and blockchain and 5 g and quantum all in one and i think we make a mistake in washington d c a lot of putting these things in this emerging technology bucket of that bucket i think ai stands alone in its importance i think compared to the other things i just mentioned ai s far more significant for national security than quantum computing which is a long way away blockchain which is not nearly as useful as people seem to think and i think in this sense of the emerging technology bucket so counting stuff like cyber operations as emerged and already here ai stands alone as the most significant michael morell and why is that ben buchanan i think it s a the nearest term so we see enormous fundamental progress where it s things like alphago or alphafold or other key advances so we know there s something here in a way we re not quite sure with quantum computing and the like and i think it s so broad in its application ai can touch many different parts of the national security establishment from intelligence analysis to cyber operations to autonomous weapons that i think there s a lot to study here and that s why it s so rewarding to work on this michael morell is it also of great significance because it potentially impacts all those other areas we talked about ben buchanan exactly michael morell you said something interesting about blockchain just now which is that maybe it s not everything it s made out to be ben buchanan i m a skeptic michael morell can you explain to people what is it and then why are you a skeptic ben buchanan one way of thinking about blockchain is just what they d call technically a distributed ledger so it s a high fidelity way of recording information that s pretty transparent and there s a lot of hype around this there s a lot of hype around bitcoin but relative to what ai can do it seems to me the blockchain applications are far more narrow than other technologies far more questionable on whether or not they actually work and far less likely to be integrated you ll hear people talk about how blockchain will solve voting and the like or will increase transparency in voting i think it s probably that the less technology we have in voting the better i m a fan on that front of paper ballots and going old school i m just skeptical of a lot of what people say about how blockchain will change society michael morell and then i m really interested in asking you how your students think about all this how they come at it do they come at it the way google employees might come at it or do they come at it the way somebody sitting at the pentagon might come at it or is it a mix ben buchanan the great thing about teaching in the security stage program at georgetown is it truly is a mix so i have students who are for their day jobs at cia at nsa and they have i think some perspectives from that place and then i have students who are coming out of the tech sector and thinking about national security and not unintel and saying none of this matters they wouldn t be taking my class if they didn t want to touch national security but i love the debates i get to have every tuesday with students where we set up these discussions and people will have different views what s really rewarding is that i think at least the students i see have a sense that this technology s going to matter and have a sense that it s very hard to make good policy or make good strategy without first understanding the technology and that s something we push even in a fairly nontechnical program you have to understand the technology to get the right answer on strategy michael morell so is there in these classroom discussions with two different points of view do they ultimately come together in a new point of view or what happens ben buchanan a good classroom discussion ends with each being able to state the other side s argument so well that the other side will say yeah i wish i had put it that way there s not always a change of views people have their perspective but what i seek is some capacity for fairness in discussion where people say yeah that captures my views well and i understand the other side s views as well and i do think ultimately when you re looking at thorny problems like ai and national security we ve got to get to some consensus on what the facts are what our opinions are how they differ and i wouldn t say every class is perfect but the nice thing about academia is you have the time and the space to foster that kind of conversation michael morell all right so let s if it s okay ben finish up here by playing a bit of a mind game i want to ask you to imagine yourself as a historian maybe 50 years from now or 100 years from now looking back at this time on this issue what do you think the themes would be 100 years from now looking back ben buchanan the biggest question is how democracies are going to adapt to this i think we know what the authoritarian playbook is going to be it s a question of how well they can integrate the technology and what the technology can do but the biggest question that remains unresolved is what will the united states do what will democracies do can we get ai talent to come to our shores not just for education but for work can we get ai talent to work in national security in a way that s consistent with their principles can we get a federal government that s often slow and bureaucratic to embrace this technology can we think about what this technology can and can t do in the context of long range strategic decisions from buying the b 21 bomber to thinking about how we structure and analyze seamless intelligence we re going to make a number of decisions as a country over the next five to ten years in a wide range of national security fora in which this technology is going to be hyped and we need to sort that hype out from what s real and we need to get that right and that goes beyond just national security fora again immigration is one of the key ai things that we could do to improve our competitiveness bring talent here michael morell how short of talent are we ben buchanan everyone s short of talent and i think the biggest difference is that other nations including our allies like canada and britain and france have explicitly made pursuing ai talent a strategy the united states has some very strong advantages in that we educate a lot of the people and many of them want to say and indeed many of them do stay but this is an area where i think we should continue to prioritize getting talent to the country michael morell so are you at the end of the day optimistic that we re going to be able to answer all of those questions or are you more pessimistic ben buchanan i m optimistic that we have the chance and that s not a fait accompli i m pessimistic because i think time and again we ve not always made these choices correctly before i did my ph d in britain they re very fond of winston churchill s quote americans can always be trusted to do the right thing after they ve tried everything else let s hope that works out here too michael morell so ben thank you very much for joining us great discussion about ai i also want to remind people again that ben has a book coming out in a couple weeks called the hacker and the state cyber attacks and the new normal of geopolitics ben thanks very much ben buchanan my pleasure end of transcript first published on february 19 2020 6 03 am 2020 cbs
