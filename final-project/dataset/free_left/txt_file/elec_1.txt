 the politico caucus a majority of republicans praised trump s selection of mike pence as his running mate by steven shepard 07 16 2016 07 48 am edt insiders praised trump s vp pick while insisting clinton should opt for kaine as her running mate getty now that donald trump has officially tapped indiana gov mike pence to join his ticket hillary clinton should select tim kaine to be her running mate that s according to the politico caucus a panel of battleground state activists operatives and strategists pluralities in both parties picked kaine the virginia senator whom many dubbed the safe choice among a list of seven supposed clinton short listers as the best choice for the presumptive democratic nominee advertisement given the choices of kaine and six other reported contenders 38 percent of democratic insiders and 42 percent of gop insiders said kaine would make the best running mate for clinton who reportedly spent friday at her home in washington considering her options and meeting with a number of hopefuls including housing and urban development secretary jul an castro and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren but few democrats thought castro or warren 12 percent respectively would be the best choice for clinton gop insiders meanwhile mostly praised trump s selection of pence a 54 percent majority of republicans said pence was a good choice that would help the trump campaign while 7 percent said he was a poor choice that would harm the campaign thirty nine percent said the choice of pence won t have any impact on trump s campaign at all among democrats who looked forward to clinton s pick those who selected kaine cited his experience as a governor senator and chair of the democratic national committee one new hampshire democrat who like all respondents completed the survey anonymously said kaine reinforces clinton s theme of competence running against an unprepared reckless opponent hillary comes to this from a position of strength added a florida democrat she doesn t need someone to expand her coalition this election doesn t need more spice the donald is more than enough so she should stick with steady proven leadership which is a big part of her brand added a pennsylvania democrat i still think that clinton should stay safe and go with kaine he matches up with pence in terms of r sum but has been able to steer a moderate course without getting into the cultural jams of pence and the pence kaine exchange on medicaid expansion and obamacare will be priceless like trump she needs someone low key added an iowa democrat in her case however it s because she just isn t very exciting or a good campaigner and wouldn t want a vp choice to steal the spotlight kaine fills that bill that he s fluent in spanish will help with hispanics the same message was echoed by gop insiders hillary needs a safe pick said a colorado republican she needs someone that independents and disgruntled republicans can support kaine is a safe pick for clinton and stacks up against pence essentially negating what each might bring to the ticket added a wisconsin republican support for other candidates was limited like castro and warren 12 percent of democratic insiders said clinton should pick agriculture secretary tom vilsack a former governor of swing state iowa hillary should focus on a young capable person of color said a florida democrat respect for all people is important and diversity matters insiders who chose warren said the first term senator could help clinton with voters who sided with vermont sen bernie sanders in the democratic primaries hillary needs to shore up her image as willing to attack the establishment and elizabeth warren brings energy to the campaign at a time when hillary really needs it said a north carolina democrat the fact that hillary is now even with trump in the cbs news new york times poll is actually a good wake up call for democrats who will need to fight with all they have to defeat trump elizabeth warren is a fighter she s a fighter that ordinary people can relate to most of the support for vilsack came from his home state tom vilsack is a steady leader who has deep experience and a real sense of loyalty to hillary one iowa democrat said he has an american story of tragedy and triumph he s also one of the most genuine and caring people in politics today an iowa republican said vilsack would be a good analog for pence wonky white midwestern governor meets the same the republican said tom vilsack has been a loyal soldier for hillary clinton since ending his own presidential bid nearly 10 years ago iowa is the closest of the toss ups right now and choosing a beloved native son would be a significant blow to trump s efforts here colorado gov john hickenlooper who reportedly met with clinton friday at her home wasn t on the list of seven potential running mates offered as options for caucus insiders the survey was conducted prior to news of hickenlooper s meeting being reported but of the 7 percent of democratic insiders who chose other none mentioned hickenlooper republicans meanwhile said trump s choice of pence would help the thrice married new york billionaire bring aboard social conservatives one colorado republican called pence an excellent choice that helps address many of the concerns and perceived weaknesses of the presumptive nominee pence brings a solid track record collaborative ties to gop leaders in congress and a disciplined cautious demeanor to the ticket the republican said his strong ties with social conservatives and major conservative donors will help reassure both concerned members of the republican establishment as well as a skittish evangelical base that isn t yet convinced that trump will be an advocate for the issues important to social conservatives and others on the right pence is as restrained conventional and palatable as his haircut added an ohio republican who called the indiana governor a good counterweight to trump s undisciplined unpredictable and odd political coiffure an ohio republican called pence a slight positive who would give some comfort to social conservatives and he added that pence faced a tight reelection campaign back in indiana which he officially abandoned just minutes after trump s announcement and republicans could be better positioned with a different candidate truthfully this gets pence out of a losing situation so the republican governors association is the biggest beneficiary the insider said among those who predicted pence wouldn t make an impact was the usual cadre of republicans who said little could change the culture of the trump campaign this is the donald trump freak show one ohio republican said neither pence nor anyone else would have mattered pence is no harm no foul added a florida republican he won t mean a lot because there s only one chief clown in the trump circus and that s trump while few gop insiders said trump erred in choosing pence one who did was hoping for more sizzle from the former casino owner and reality television star boring declared one florida republican i wanted newt these are the members of the politico caucus
