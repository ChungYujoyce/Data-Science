advertisement supported by the president s interest in the case of austin tice a journalist who went missing in syria in 2012 prompted the c i a to renew its focus on finding him by adam goldman and julian e barnes washington last year administration officials briefed president trump on a hostage whose case he has taken an interest in austin tice a former marine missing in syria the c i a pledged to ramp up efforts to learn where he is being held and why syria refuses to negotiate his release the c i a s renewed focus on mr tice who was working as a journalist when he was captured in 2012 reflects a broader push by the trump administration to focus more intently on americans being held hostage abroad the administration has helped free americans held in egypt iran turkey and afghanistan and is trying to win mr tice s freedom as well as working to find mark r frerichs a former navy diver kidnapped last month in afghanistan the white house wants him freed before american troops leave the country in a peace deal with the taliban an urgent deadline for the pentagon and intelligence agencies to locate mr frerichs returning american hostages is mr trump s top priority secretary of state mike pompeo said this week in a statement marking the 13th anniversary of the disappearance inside iran of robert a levinson a former f b i agent and c i a contractor for the american military the c i a and other intelligence agencies focusing more on hostages is a way to show an often mercurial commander in chief that the government is responding to the priorities he has set the appointment of the former top envoy for hostage negotiations robert c o brien as national security adviser has also elevated the issue and the national counterterrorism center is leading a review of hostage recovery efforts mr trump s interest in seeing american hostages brought home is a reflection of his us versus them worldview that often puts foreign policy issues in stark terms a senior administration official said adding that the president takes it personally when adversaries illegally detain americans mr trump invited to the state of the union the parents of kayla mueller who was taken captive in august 2013 before being killed by the islamic state in early 2015 the military mission last year to kill the group s leader abu bakr al baghdadi was named after ms mueller s birthday america s warriors never forgot kayla and neither will we mr trump said during the address last month before the speech ms mueller s parents were given a tour of the white house and met briefly with mr trump and vice president mike pence they also spoke with both mr o brien and kashyap patel then a senior counterterrorism official who was handling hostage issues the killings of ms mueller and of the journalist james foley in 2014 another american in syria helped prompt president barack obama to make wholesale changes in how the government dealt with hostages and their families the obama administration established a hostage recovery fusion cell and created a special presidential envoy for hostage affairs the post mr o brien held the trump administration s look at hostage operations is part of a five year review of the obama directive while he was the hostage czar mr o brien pushed hard to figure out a way to free mr tice he cited the case to ms mueller s parents when they visited the white house as one of several the administration was trying to resolve based on a mosaic of intelligence officials believe mr tice now 38 remains alive and is being held by the syrian government according to former and current officials questions remain about why the syrian government has neither admitted to holding him in the nearly eight years since he was abducted nor negotiated his release and why it has released other americans who were captured after him the trump administration has pushed unsuccessfully to win mr tice s release early in his 15 month tenure as c i a director mike pompeo tried to set up back channel talks with ali mamlouk syria s powerful intelligence chief who is close with president bashar al assad the effort fizzled but also prompted concerns among some administration officials that the c i a s outreach might have left the mistaken impression with the syrians that mr tice was a spy in august 2018 the c i a dispatched another top senior agency official with expertise in the middle east to meet with mr mamlouk in damascus former american officials said during the meeting the c i a official brought up mr tice the former officials said what came of the meeting is not clear the administration has also tried without success to engage both the united arab emirates and the vatican to assist with the tice case the emiratis who played a key role in 2019 in freeing danny burch an american oil worker who had been held hostage in yemen reopened its embassy in damascus in 2018 as the hostage czar mr o brien embraced the idea of traveling to damascus to negotiate with the syrian government mr pompeo now the secretary of state nixed the proposal for security reasons though some administration officials were skeptical that mr o brien s life would have been in danger other administration officials viewed such a trip as a mistake because a visit by a high ranking american official could bolster the assad government while probably doing little to prompt it to release mr tice mr tice s family has sought to keep public attention on his case to pressure the government to continue working for his release debra tice mr tice s mother has held news conferences and granted interviews in which she praised mr trump s focus on the case of her son and other hostages she recently told the fox news host tucker carlson that the syrian government had invited an american official to talk about her son s case but accused neocons at the state department of intervening to stop the trip it was unclear whether she was referring to mr pompeo ms tice declined through a spokesman to comment critics have accused the trump administration of missing opportunities to win mr tice s release it has made concessions to the assad government without demanding mr tice s release or anything else in return including when administration officials announced in 2017 that they would no longer pursue mr assad s ouster and again last year when mr trump abruptly pulled back american forces fighting the islamic state essentially giving up much of the land in syria that the military had seized from the group back to mr assad s government mr frerichs s case is similarly caught up in delicate geopolitical negotiations as the military begins to withdraw its personnel from afghanistan as part of a deal with the taliban the white house has stepped up its pressure on the defense department to get home hostages still held there according to a senior official mr frerichs the former navy diver who was working as a contractor in afghanistan was captured in february and officials believe he is being held by the haqqani militant network in afghanistan some officials expressed concern that if mr frerichs is not found quickly he could be smuggled into pakistan making a rescue by american commandos more difficult because of the political sensitivities and potentially treacherous terrain advertisement
