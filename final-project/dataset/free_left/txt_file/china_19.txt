mount a senior fellow and director of the defense posture project at the federation of american scientists said beijing is reasserting itself and looking to shape the agenda for the upcoming summits divisions between beijing and pyongyang were a major asset to trump s pressure campaign he said adding that a reinforcement of their ties would weaken trump s hand in negotiations and diminish further the effectiveness of u s military threats ni lexiong a military expert at the shanghai university of political science and law said kim was using conflict between china and the united states to obtain benefits from both sides in international media coverage kim is often portrayed as an irrational madman more of a punchline than a person let alone a leader trump has referred to him as little rocket man in tweets kim s diplomatic debut will make it harder to dismiss him outright experts said we re seeing a carefully crafted north korean strategy on diplomacy unfold on the world stage starting with beijing jean h lee a north korea expert and fellow at the wilson center in washington said in an email shutting china out and ramping up the rhetoric with the united states gave kim the space and justification he needed to expedite the building of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles she wrote now with a program he feels confident is a proven threat he feels emboldened to force the region s leaders to treat him as an equal not as the young son of a dictator who inherited power china s official statement on kim s visit annotated china s xi may take issue with equal there have been few signs that xi is fond of kim only two years into his reign kim had his uncle who was north korea s main liaison with china executed for building his own power base then in 2016 as xi was hosting a group of 20 summit on his home turf kim presided over the launch of three medium range ballistic missiles stealing the spotlight the south korean military called the move an act of armed protest against xi when xi sent a top official to pyongyang last year kim did not even see him successive american administrations have called on china to use its economic leverage over north korea to exert control butanalysts say that china s main priority has always been stability and that it does not want to do anything that could cause the collapse of the kim regime which could bring millions of hungry refu gees and it fears u s troops to its door amid increasing talk of military options from the trump administration china seemed more willing to act it has been more carefully enforcing sanctions conducting intrusive inspections of cargo and cutting off key north korean exports including seafood and workers those efforts helped bring kim back to the table amid the tightened sanctions rapprochement with china has become a practical need of great urgency for north korea said cheong seong chang an expert on north korea s leadership at the sejong institute near seoul in the short term experts see the meeting as a sign that the trump summit is likely to go ahead kim can now enter those talks with more confidence the visit is a breakthrough of the diplomatic isolation imposed on north korea said cai jian executive director of the center for korean studies at shanghai s fudan university he said that kim having shaken hands with xi heads into the negotiating room with more useful bargaining chips or a more advantageous position to negotiate with the west fifield reported from tokyo luna lin amber ziye wang and yang liu in beijing min joo kim in seoul and brian murphy in
