rubio was never going to be the savior by michael grunwald march 16 2016 michael grunwald is a senior staff writer forpolitico magazine michael grunwald is a senior staff writer forpolitico magazine in february 2013 senator marco rubio let me sit in on the politics course he taught part time at florida international university he knew i was writing a cover story about him for time magazine but he still gave his students a master class in self promotion in my presence explaining the machinations he had used to persuade his colleagues to elect him speaker of the florida house of representatives you raise money for them you befriend them you make sure your kids are friends with their kids and then you cut the best deal you can he also candidly described how partisan redistricting had driven him and his caucus toward ideological extremes if you know the only way to lose your seat is to get out conservatived in a primary you ll never let anyone get to your right i m not telling you this is how it should be he said with a grin but it s how it is this isn t a good government class it s a politics class advertisement the story i wrote portrayed rubio as a political animal an ambitious calculating charismatic conservative who was positioning himself as the barack obama of the tea party titled immigrant son it explored how a politician who had never accomplished much in the way of good government his autobiography recounts virtually no substantive achievements beyond a hometown tree planting project had become the most influential voice in the national debate over immigration reform elevating his stature at a moment when the republican party was panicked about attracting latino voters i explored the borderland rubio was trying to navigate as a child of immigrants who was also a child of the conservative movement the thin line he was trying to walk between the republican establishment and the base between compassion and the rule of law between family and politics unfortunately the only thing anyone remembers about that story is the cover line my editors chose the republican savior as i ve been reminded by a few billion mocking tweets since he dropped out tuesday night rubio didn t turn out to be the republican savior i get it in my own defense as i ve been trying to point out ever since rubio posted his clever response to the cover three years ago i never called him that but it s useful for journalists to look back with a self critical eye and i don t want to be overly defensive about my contributions to the rubio hype machine i did think he was the most likely gop nominee back in 2013 and i continued to think so until a few weeks ago although i fortunately never said so in print so what did i miss at the risk of failing the self critical test my time profile on rubio s immigration quandary still holds up it made it clear that rubio was already hedging on the reformist stance that had thrust him into the spotlight demonstrating not only the intense personal pressure he felt from his family he played me a voice mail from his mother begging him not to mess with the immigrants but also the intense political pressure he felt from his tea party base in our conversations he was already throwing cold water on the prospects for reform defending conservative critics of reform and repeatedly insisting he wasn t soft on illegal immigration i wrote that the backlash has yet to materialize but i also suggested that rubio could easily abandon reform when it did materialize which is exactly what he did i m more conflicted about whether i overestimated rubio s political talent it s possible that i exaggerated that talent because i was early to notice it back in june 2009 when rubio was running 30 points behind then republican governor charlie crist in his long shot race for senate i followed him on the campaign trail in florida and wrote a story about how he electrified the crowds with eloquent arguments for tea party principles it was clear the gop base loved him as much as it hated mushy moderate crist when choosing between a republican and a republican i wrote republicans usually pick the republican that s why i thought rubio made so much sense for the gop in 2016 he was the quintessential modern republican he stood for almost everything mitt romney stood for massive tax cuts muscular foreign policy social conservatism but while romney a former massachusetts moderate spoke republican as a second language rubio was fluent the one issue where he strayed from orthodoxy was immigration but the republican national committee s autopsy after romney s defeat had urged the party to moderate its views on immigration to attract more hispanics to the party and what better messenger than a telegenic young cuban american with a beautiful family and an inspiring personal story the son of a bartender and a maid with an amazing rap about the american dream well it didn t work out because donald trump happened i don t think i m the only writer who didn t foresee the trump phenomenon but i definitely didn t foresee it i still believe that in the kind of primary that most of us expected rubio would have been a formidable candidate a tea partier who would have been acceptable to the establishment as a house trained alternative to ted cruz even in the crazy town primary that actually happened rubio drubbed jeb bush scott walker rick perry chris christie and other would be republican saviors sure immigration would have been a problem for him in the primary no matter what but not an insurmountable problem romney was the father of obamacare and he still became the nominee and rubio s immigration flirtation could have helped him in the general even tuesday polls showed he could have beaten hillary clinton ultimately though republican voters didn t want a conservative version of obama another fresh faced minority first term senator who gave a great speech they wanted an anti obama a bombastic billionaire who wasn t a politician wasn t no drama wasn t interested in public policy wasn t going to improve republican outreach to minorities and definitely wasn t a law professor or a community organizer they didn t want a new rock star with broad appeal they wanted a rock thrower who reflected their anger in retrospect republicans have reaped what they sowed in the obama era they ve been much more consistently anti obama than consistently conservative and while their relentless obstructionism has been a policy failure obama has gotten his way on health care energy policy wall street reform tax hikes on the wealthy and much more it has been a political bonanza helping to put both houses of congress and a slew of statehouses back in republican hands the gop has been lousy at governing but quite adept at marketing itself and fighting obama it makes sense that they ve turned to a marketing genius who was best known in the political world for questioning obama s citizenship of course rubio embraced the strategy that came back to bite him he s part of a new generation of lean and hungry conservatives who grew up in the antigovernment reagan era and entered politics after the scorched earth gingrich revolution i wrote in 2013 bipartisan compromise is not usually his thing his campaign mantra was that obama was deliberately destroying what was unique about america barack obama he liked to say knows exactly what he s doing that line sounded better when rubio said it in a stump speech than it sounded when rubio repeated it four times on a debate stage especially since christie had just derided him as a mindless repeater of talking points the robo marco debacle was truly shocking especially for those of us who thought highly of rubio s political skills it really was as cringeworthy as everyone said it was and i never saw it coming in fairness nothing in the modern history of republican politics should have led anyone to believe that mindlessly repeating talking points would be a dangerous strategy it s the predominant strategy but it imploded along with rubio at the worst possible time opinion by rich lowry 2016 by eli stokols and shane goldmacher what works by sara solovitch remember rubio s debate malfunction happened right before the new hampshire primary and it might have dropped him from second to fifth if he had finished second he might have emerged as the dominant alternative to trump and cruz knocking out bush and john kasich before south carolina and then well who knows it s not crazy to think that he could have united the party politicians always look hapless after they lose and their campaigns are inevitably portrayed as hopelessly misguided exercises in dysfunction but 16 of the 17 republican candidates had to lose and rubio almost didn t his strategy of mouthing platitudes about the future while letting his rivals challenge trump like a kid hiding in the back of a gym class dodgeball game would have seemed brilliant if it worked ok ok it didn t work republican non elites didn t want a personable conservative who could have made clinton look like yesterday s news they apparently want a xenophobic salesman who says he can make everything great again polls suggest that trump would fare much worse than rubio in a head to head matchup with clinton but his voters don t believe polls any more than they believe beltway establishment types people often assume i m a rubio fan because of the time cover but i ve never shared his right wing domestic policies or neoconservative foreign policies i ve written about how his party has lost touch with reality in the obama era and i think he reflects his party s drift i remember shortly after the profile ran he invited me to talk to his class about my everglades book as we walked back to the parking lot he made it pretty clear that he was ignorant about climate change and intended to stay that way he did ask me to put him in touch with some experts on energy efficiency which felt a bit awkward but maybe i should have done it that said i still think he s a major political talent with genuinely humble roots and an incredibly compelling story and if trump loses to clinton in a landslide with overwhelming margins among hispanics it s not implausible to think that rubio s name will resurface in 2020 this year he wasn t a savior the larger question is whether republicans even want to be saved california by jeremy b white updated 05 08 20 09 44 pm edt by sam sutton and carly sitrin by bill mahoney and josh gerstein
