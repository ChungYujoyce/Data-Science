advertisement supported by transcript na by jonathan martin and patrick healy simi valley calif determined to prove their mettle several republican presidential candidates showed new aggressiveness in lacing into donald j trump on wednesday night seeking to elevate themselves as leaders of substance and shake up a race that mr trump has dominated all summer while moderators at the cnn debate tried repeatedly to pit one republican after another against mr trump the candidates fought to break out of that dynamic with carly fiorina emerging as an especially tenacious combatant who provided some of the few moments where mr trump looked uncomfortable the debate covered a broad range of subjects immigration the nuclear deal with iran same sex marriage federal financing for planned parenthood and was more inclusive than the first debate last month allowing each of the 11 candidates to engage through a nearly three hour forum that tested their endurance still some of the most memorable interactions centered on loaded confrontations with mr trump mrs fiorina called him an entertainer and senator rand paul of kentucky labeled him sophomoric in the opening minutes of the debate at the ronald reagan presidential library here mr trump drew a stinging assault on his leadership abilities and character from gov scott walker of wisconsin one of several candidates who have declined in the polls as mr trump has soared we don t need an apprentice in the white house we have one right now mr walker said invoking the name of mr trump s former reality show when mr trump sharply criticized his record in wisconsin mr walker hit back just because he says it doesn t make it true the facts are the facts 11 photos view slide show another struggling candidate former gov jeb bush of florida who has been mr trump s chief target was initially slow to take him on but then ripped into him for suggesting that mr bush would be a puppet of his major donors he accused mr trump of using his enormous wealth to act like a special interest by lobbying for casino gambling in florida when mr bush was governor there totally false said mr trump who rolled his eyes and feigned looks of shock as his opponents piled on you wanted it and you didn t get it because i was opposed mr bush shot back more energy tonight i like that mr trump quipped drawing a look of fury from mr bush whose low key manner he has lampooned all summer several candidates tried to connect with voters on a personal level gov chris christie of new jersey spoke at length about his fears that his wife had been killed in the sept 11 attacks and that he might become a single parent senator marco rubio of florida spoke about the importance of speaking spanish in his family and used national security questions about russia and syria to pledge that he had the experience to keep americans safe and ben carson a retired neurosurgeon and a social conservative said he loathed politics as much as many of the voters who have helped him and mr trump emerge as the leading candidates in polls when i entered this race all the political pundits said it s impossible you can t do it because you re not connected with the money mr carson said we now have over 500 000 donations and the money is coming in but the pundits forgot about one thing and that is the people and they are really in charge prompts from the moderators and new combativeness from the other candidates ensured that donald j trump once again led in airtime the attacks from mr bush and mrs fiorina were expected given how harshly mr trump has jabbed at them in recent weeks but perhaps more notable was that mr walker too in an acknowledgment that he has to make up lost ground repeatedly took on mr trump at times mr trump responded to attacks with gusto belittling mr paul s appearance i never attacked him on his looks and believe me there is plenty of subject matter right there bashing mr walker for his collapse in the polls in iowa you went down the tubes and treating mr bush as well as his brother george w bush dismissively your brother s administration gave us barack obama because it was such a disaster mr trump snapped at one point you know what as it relates to my brother there s one thing i know for sure he kept us safe mr bush said drawing strong applause on a night when he often delivered sharp lines with an uneasy obligatory tone knowing he had to attack but seeming not to relish it mr trump appeared cowed at only one moment when a moderator noted that he had recently denigrated mrs fiorina s appearance saying look at that face would anybody vote for that he later claimed he had been referring to her persona mrs fiorina was asked what she thought of mr trump s persona i think women all over this country heard very clearly what mr trump said she said pointedly her riposte drew the loudest applause of the debate and mr trump waited until it died down to reply i think she s got a beautiful face and she s a beautiful woman mr trump said as mrs fiorina looked on stonily over and over the discussion returned to mr trump who stood center stage his shoulders slouched forward hands on lectern and lips pursed he gladly took on his rivals but was unable to bait the moderators into a spat and seemed not to enjoy the evening as much as he had at the first debate as the night went on he became quieter and in an interview with cnn immediately after the debate complained that it had gone on too long and said it had to have been the longest ever held the debate highlighted significant policy differences among the candidates with gov john kasich of ohio and senator ted cruz of texas tangling over the iran accord and whether congressional republicans should stop funding the government as part of an effort to end public financing for planned parenthood in a glimpse at the tension between the hard right and more centrist wings of the republican party mr kasich mocked the idea that the deal between iran and multiple world powers could be summarily discarded saying americans operate better in a world when our allies work with us and he warned republicans not to shut down the government mr cruz gave no quarter citing videos that show planned parenthood officials discussing fees for tissue from aborted fetuses as evidence of a criminal enterprise and denouncing republicans for pre emptively surrendering to barack obama mr walker asserting himself after a sharp fall in the polls repeatedly interjected when he was not called on attacking mr trump and later criticizing the washington political establishment mr christie who was left out of the conversation for much of the night eventually intervened in the argument between mr trump and mrs fiorina chiding them for focusing on their own careers rather than on americans who are struggling you re both successful people congratulations mr christie said raising his voice at mrs fiorina and warning her not to interrupt him stop this childish back and forth the conversation turned even more pointed and personal when a cnn moderator noted that mr trump had suggested that mr bush s views on immigration were shaped by his marriage to a mexican born woman donald j trump officially accepted the republican party s nomination on july 22 hillary clinton was officially nominated on july 26 at the democratic convention mr bush seized the moment turning to mr trump just inches to his right and imploring him to apologize to his wife columba who was in the audience no because i said nothing wrong mr trump said prompting mr bush to flash the tight grimace he displayed repeatedly throughout the night when mr trump spoke as the debate neared its conclusion the questions turned lighter and the candidates punchier they were asked what woman they might put on the 10 bill rosa parks was a favorite and mr bush picked a non american margaret thatcher and when asked what their secret service code names would be mr bush turning to mr trump said he would choose eveready it s very high energy donald mr bush said to laughs even mr trump had to concede it was a good line holding out his hand for mr bush to slap which he did with notable energy the sparring reflected a calculation among several candidates that the forum offered their best opportunity yet to convince a sizable national audience that they were more credible alternatives to mr trump yet shared his passion and determination to change washington a record setting 24 million people watched the first debate on aug 6 and standout performances from four candidates mr trump mr carson mrs fiorina and mr kasich helped them make gains in opinion polls and draw greater news media attention in the six weeks that followed support for mr trump has proved particularly durable in spite of his divisive remarks 39 percent of republicans see him as their best chance of winning the 2016 election according to a new york times cbs news poll released this week wednesday s forum held before a few hundred well heeled republicans at the hilltop shrine to one of the party s most revered presidents had been expected to have less of a gladiatorial feel than last month s debate which took place in a cavernous cleveland arena where audience cheers and catcalls seemed to energize mr trump and throw off others like mr carson in a campaign that has been overwhelmed by a reality show celebrity it is perhaps fitting that these televised showdowns are becoming so consequential in no small part because of last month s debate one candidate rick perry has exited the presidential race and others have advanced or faded in the polls advertisement
