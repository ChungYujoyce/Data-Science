with breanne deppisch the big idea now that it has become crystal clear donald trump will not quit that he has unshackled himself and plans to limp across the finish line some republicans who called on him to drop out over the weekend are reversing themselves the senior senator from nebraska tweeted this on saturday the comments made by mr trump were disgusting and totally unacceptable under any circumstance 1 2 it would be wise for him to step aside and allow mike pence to serve as our party s nominee 2 2 but yesterday during a radio interview she announced that she will vote for trump after all he decided he would not step aside i respect his decision deb fischer told the lincoln radio affiliate klin i support the republican ticket and it s a trump pence ticket to me it s not a tough choice darryl glenn the republican nominee against sen michael bennet in colorado said saturday that trump must step aside america cannot have a man who speaks this way about women be the face of our country to the free world he said in a statement but facing backlash from trump supporters glenn who already has no realistic path to victory backtracked he says watching the debate sunday night changed his mind donald trump did what he absolutely had to do glenn said on fox news i think he reset this campaign it has truly been a surreal cycle to watch many republican elected officials are personally outraged and ashamed by something their party s nominee says or does so they distance themselves but as soon as they face a whiff of blowback from some in the party they cave and fall back in line then they offer up excuses and rationalizations twisting themselves into pretzels to justify voting for a guy who somewill tell you privately is a danger to the republic it s happened over and over again now and it validates what trump himself said during the primaries many politicians are indeed cravenand interested mainlyin maintaining power for themselves principles be damned andnbc wall street journal pollingsuggests that some rank and file republicans who defected after the emergence of the 2005 video are coming back into the fold too some 83 of republicans said in post debate polling that they would vote for mr trump in a head to head matchup against mrs clinton up from 60 in weekend surveys monica langley writes in the journal so what would it take for these republicans to actually dump trump dogged by accusations of corruption as he ran for governor of louisiana in 1983 edwin edwards told reporters the only way i can lose this election is if i m caught in bed with either a dead girl or a live boy the democrat won earlier this year trump boasted in iowa i could stand in the middle of fifth avenue and shoot somebody and i wouldn t lose voters we were reminded of both these quotes during blake farenthold s appearance on msnbc last night asked by host chris hayes whether he would still support trump even if the republican nominee said on tape that he liked raping women the congressman from texas suggested he might eventually adding he d consider it again it depends you don t know the entire context of all of this he said that would be bad and i would have to consider i d consider it but again we re talking about what donald trump said 10 years ago as opposed to what hillary clinton has done in the past two or three years aaron blake has more the congressman apologized in a trio of late night tweets i apologize for my failure to immediately condemn anyone who would say something as outrageous as they like raping women 1 3 during an interview on msnbc with chris hayes tonight i was thrown off by the anchor s use of a hypothetical question 2 3 i do not and have not ever condoned rape or violence against women that is not the kind of man i believe donald trump to be 3 3 farenthold s stumble raises the question of how high trump s floor of support might be it is doubtlessly higher than conventional wisdom in the mainstream media would suggest acomprehensive usa today surveyfinds that 26 percent of republican governors senators and house members are now refusing to endorse trump in real numbers that is 88 out of 331 put another way three quarters of elected gop leaders are supporting the donald in new hampshire for example sen kelly ayotte is the only statewide republican to withdraw her support for trump the concord monitor notes that the republican gubernatorial nominee and both gop congressional candidates condemned trump s comments but continue to support him in next door maine gov paul lepage r actually said yesterday that authoritarian power may be needed in the united states sometimes i wonder that our constitution is not only broken but we need trump to show some authoritarian power in our country and bring back the rule of law his longtime supporter said during a radio interview we ve had eight years of a president he s an autocrat he just does it on his own he ignores congress and every single day we re slipping into anarchy portland press herald other republicans who clearly do not like trump personally are nonetheless continuing to support him for political reasons people close to ted cruz said after the convention in cleveland that the texas senator would not endorse trump because he saw his former rival as an authoritarian in the mold of benito mussolini now cruz is sticking with someone who he sees as a strongman and who has also suggested that his father was somehow involved in the assassination of john f kennedy and who has criticized his wife s physical appearance marco rubio after staying under the radar for a few days announced yesterday that he is standing by trump despite the video and his insistence earlier this year that the reality tv star cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons i wish we had better choices for president the florida senator whom trump not so affectionately dubbed little marco said in a statement but i do not want hillary clinton to be our next president and therefore my position has not changed miami herald history will not be kind to these trump collaborators in the gop establishment conservative thought leader ross douthat arguesin an important column for today s new york times in bending the knee to trump last spring they thought that they were buying party unity and a continued share of power and paying for it with just a little of their decency a mite of their patriotism a soup on of their honor they may find out soon enough that all this bargain bought them was an even harsher reckoning and that all they will inherit is the wind history in its day to day is not a morality play but sometimes there is a clear chastisement a moment when the judgments of providence seem stark and so it may be for the men who led the

had to tangle with russian intelligence agencies who seem to be doing everything they can on behalf of our opponent podesta told reporters aboard clinton s plane he said it would be reasonable to assume that the trump campaign knew his email was going to be released by wikileaks pointing to comments made earlier this year between longtime trump ally roger stone and wikileaks founder julian assange around the same time stone pointed his finger at me and said that i could expect some treatment that would expose me podesta said referring to comments on twitter in august by stone who said

keeps getting worse four women who competed in the 1997 miss teenusa beauty pageant said trump walked into the dressing room while contestants some as young as 15 were changing from buzzfeed i remember putting on my dress really quick because i was like oh my god there s a man in here said mariah billado the former miss vermont teen usa trump she recalled said something like don t worry ladies i ve seen it all before three other contestants also remembered trump entering the dressing room while girls were changing saying the girls tried to cover their bodies with one calling it shocking and creepy former miss arizona tasha dixon corroborated the reports he just came strolling right in there was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything the 2001 winner told cbs los angeles some girls were topless others girls were naked our first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half naked changing into our bikinis to have the owner come waltzing in when we re naked or half naked in a very physically vulnerable position and then to have the pressure of the people that worked for him telling us to go fawn all over him go walk up to him talk to him get his attention fred barbash these women are coming forwardafter it emerged thattrump bragged about strolling through dressing rooms while contestants were changing during a 2005 interview with howard stern i ll tell you the funniest is that i ll go backstage before a show and everyone s getting dressed trump said i m allowed to go in because i m the owner of the pageant and therefore i m inspecting it is everyone okay you know they re standing there with no clothes is everybody okay and you see these incredible looking women and so i sort of get away with things like that a former trump tower executive who spent two decades working for trump called him asupreme sexist who thinks men are better than women he told me and he believed this that women had to work harder and be smarter and were willing to work harder than men barbara res told the daily beast s olivia nuzzi in an interview she also said the real estate developer blamed his early 90s business failureson being a so called women magnet blaming poor work done by executives while he was off hooking up with women two and three at a time res explained that as trump s fame grew his ability to withstand criticism or even honesty shrank he got too famous he started believing his own expletive she said he got way too famous and you know people were telling him he was great and he was buying that he started thinking that he walked on water he really did related a sound engineer responsible for attaching trump s microphone on the apprentice said that donald repeatedly referred to him as a expletive monkey and described his experience working with him the most abusive humiliating experience of his career from buzzfeed the engineer said the first time he was assigned to put a mic on trump the real estate mogul refused to shake his hand instead turning to one of his many assistants and saying whoa whoa whoa who s this effing monkey he said throughout all of their interactions trump refused to address him directly instead aiming all of his comments about the engineer to his assistants i m not gonna let this effing monkey touch me unless he washes his hands trump reportedly said making one of his assistants escort the engineer to the bathroom and watch him wash his hands before walking him back and reporting to trump he treated me like i wasn t a human being the engineer said i ve mic d everyone from ben affleck to ren e zellweger and never ever in my career have i run into something like that eric trump chalked up his father s predatory remarks to an example of two alpha dogs caught mid conversation it was two alpha guys in a thing and by the way it is totally unacceptable the younger trump said in a radio interview he acknowledged that and he apologized for it it s two guys by themselves in private at some event going back and forth my father is a man that has a heart of gold cnn the worst surrogate award may go to ben carson who suggested the problem with

boyle spank your children more on his own essential loneliness politics is an effort to make human connection but trump seems incapable of that new york times david brookswrites his emotional makeup means he can hit only a few notes fury and aggression in some ways his debate performances look like primate dominance displays filled with chest beating and looming growls but at least primates have

courageously refused to endorse trump when it was politically risky is coming out with a book next may to raise his national profile his publisher st martins says it is about our coming of age crisis and how to rebuild a culture of self reliance the book is titled the vanishing american adult and reflects on sasse s time as the president of midland university for five years before he got elected in 2014 our kids aren t growing up because we re no longer showing them how sasse writes adding that he was surprised and troubled by his students passivity their seeming inability to take initiative and solve problems without adult help lincoln journal star sasse casts his approach to politics education theology and life in sweeping historical terms a typical 30 minute speech covers 6 000 years indulges in a smattering of mckinseyan jabberwocky and cites c s lewis thomas friedman and alexis de tocqueville tim murphy writes in a flatteringprofileformother jones but the basic thrust is that the institutions that have steadied america s progress over the last 200 years are no longer up to the task sasse likes to talk about the cratering effect that sites like expedia had on traditional travel agencies a cautionary tale of the power of disintermediation to usurp established systems adapt or die as a longtime scholar of the protestant reformation and a self described crisis turnaround guy sasse has spent his life studying what happens when major organizations become unmoored from their mission the republican party may be his biggest project yet the daily hillary clinton spokesman brian fallon said in a may 2015 email that a doj official had informed him about clinton s status in a civil case over her private email server a leakon which trump immediately pounced this week but not too fast says the post s matt zapotosky the exchange might not be as bad as trump s campaign is making it out to be the date of the status hearing was listed on the court s public docket and though someone seemed to alert fallon to a filing in the docket it would also presumably be public record clinton announced she will propose expanding a tax credit for parents with young children a move her campaign is billing as a middle class tax cut and which appears to ensure that the democratic presidential nominee will not propose any across the board reductions in income tax rates before november 8 from jim tankersley clinton s announcement which appears to be one of the final additions to her policy platform will put hard numbers on her earlier promise to expand the child tax credit it would double the maximum value of that credit from 1 000 per child to 2 000 per child up to age 4 it would allow millions more low income families to claim that credit her campaign said by tweaking an income threshold and allowing the refundable credit to be claimed for the first 3 000 that a worker earns for working families clinton said this new tax credit will make their lives a little bit easier the announcement comes as clinton seeks to help working families with young children defray rising living costs including making pre k education universally available and offering tax credits
