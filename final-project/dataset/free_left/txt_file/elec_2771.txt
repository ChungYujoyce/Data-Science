advertisement by ashley parker april 13 2015 marco rubio announced his candidacy for the 2016 republican presidential nomination on monday here is a look at what he will need to do to win related article mr rubio will try to position himself as a next generation conservative who can unite the republican party impressing moderates while satisfying social conservatives and galvanizing the tea party fiscal hawks who helped elect him to the senate in 2010 his fluent spanish certainly will not hurt him with hispanics admirers see mr rubio as a charismatic speaker with an optimistic message someone who could be a fresh ambassador for the party exciting not just younger voters but those looking for a politician for the 21st century but if that sounds like another politician who was elected president not long ago the rubio team is quick to reject any comparisons to president obama who remains wildly unpopular among republican primary voters mr rubio hopes to compete in all four of the early nominating contests and will need to finish first in at least one or come close in a number of them to be considered viable he campaigned for senator joni ernst in iowa during the 2014 midterm elections and has a strong ground operation in new hampshire where the state s predilection for town hall events should highlight his strengths as a speaker his operatives include several people from south carolina giving him useful connections in that state he spent his formative years in nevada a heavily hispanic state and has relatives there but it remains unclear which early nominating contest offers mr rubio the best chance and he could still face jeb bush the former governor in a winner take all primary in florida the state that has elected them both mr rubio 43 hopes to persuade republicans to entrust the party s future to a new generation of leaders with him as its standard bearer expect an optimistic theme that connects his biography the story of a son of cuban immigrants who made it to the upper echelon of american politics to specific economic policies these include allowing investors to cover college students tuition in exchange for a percentage of their future earnings as he suggests in his book american dreams running neither as hotly conservative as senator ted cruz of texas nor as coolly establishment as mr bush mr rubio could be the right contender to unite the unruly factions of his party an often inspiring speaker he starts with high favorability ratings in polls and performs well on the stump he would look for a breakout performance in the debates perhaps on foreign policy a strong suit mr rubio is navigating a fine line as a man for all factions and he could instead find himself with no obvious base he was a part of the senate s gang of eight that helped push through a broad bipartisan immigration bill in 2013 but he later distanced himself from his own legislation saying he realized that an overhaul could come through only a step by step process that starts with border security mr bush also a spanish speaking republican from florida undercuts mr rubio s natural base forcing him to compete harder for money and support in his home state he might have to rely on factors outside his control faltering efforts by mr bush or gov scott walker of wisconsin for instance to get the second look that would allow him to surge advertisement
