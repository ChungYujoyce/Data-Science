mississippi has taken a cue from trump and is attempting to reopen while this week the state reached its highest numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths by oliver laughland in biloxi mississippi sun 10 may 2020 11 00bst the boulevard that snakes along the biloxi coastline marks a crossroads in the city s bid to reopen to the north towering hotels and casinos lights dim doors shut a sign of a once booming tourist industry that evaporated overnight last month to the south turquoise sea and white sand hundreds of sunbathers enjoying recently reopened beaches in this medium sized city known for its hedonistic nightlife and its seafood most reopening is being done by halves earlier this week the republican governor tate reeves allowed restaurants to host dining at half capacity retail stores to reopen with restrictions and up to 20 people to gather in groups outside but one thing that has shown no sign of relaxing is the state s number of covid 19 cases three days before the governor s latest guidance mississippi announced its highest number of daily cases and deaths on friday the tally stood at 396 deaths far from the worst in america but certain to rise other states in the south including georgia texas and florida have also moved to open despite growing numbers of cases like many conservative governors reeves has taken cues from donald trump who has encouraged states to open in the face of white house taskforce guidance which states that phased reopening should not commence until a 14 day decrease in the number of coronavirus cases has been seen earlier this week leaked guidance from the federal centers for disease control and prevention cdc indicated that the move to open up could lead by 1 june to a daily death toll across america of 3 000 an increase of 70 on the current rate in biloxi as the sun beat down and gulls squawked some at the beach seemed to care little about the potentially fatal health outcomes associated with reopening too soon although many practised social distancing others queued unmasked and non distanced at the life s a beach jet ski rental hut i just don t think we know enough about the virus said shannon carrou an out of work casino worker we can t stay at home forever mark bresset who works in transportation and had travelled 160 miles from central mississippi argued without evidence that the death toll had been inflated people are going to die he said period i m sorry that s not being cold or unaffected by it that s just the way things happen for people in certain areas to always call on these official death toll numbers and generate fear just makes people more compliant to do what they re told to do rather than be an individual and make a decision for themselves a few blocks into the sloped streets that surround the beach front more nuanced views were easier to come by lee price 45 who moved to the city two years ago to take up stable work as a cook grimaced as he described the moment a month ago when reeves announced a stay at home order belatedly in the eyes of many that led to him losing his job tens of thousands in biloxi where 25 of the economy depends on tourism suffered the same fate it

cases in the area had already fallen he cited no city specific data but the county has reported no new deaths in the past week the sun is shining summer is here he said you know i ve got things that need to be done in order to maintain our sanity and just our way of life the cure should not be worse than the problem gilich added echoing a catchphrase trump has used this week the president

feel the same lea campbell a frontline healthcare worker and community organizer with the poor people s campaign described the decision to reopen as an ideological reflection of putting the economy before public health it s irresponsible and it s unproductive she said campbell is a physical therapist at a hospital working exclusively with covid 19 patients some of whom are recovering from critical illness she acknowledged the caseload had gone down in recent days but argued that the lull should reinforce the need to keep the city closed down people are making a willful decision to put other people at risk and i have seen the consequences of doing that campbell said as a gentle breeze wafted over her garden if they had seen what i have i think their behaviour would be different
