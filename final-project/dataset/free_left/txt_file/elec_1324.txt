sen marco rubio r fla is officially in for the 2016 presidential race telling the associated press that he feels he is uniquely qualified to run and serve breaking marco rubio says he is running for president feels uniquely qualified to talk about future and rubio is nothing if not unique in today s gop he s young 43 years old in an increasingly old party he s hispanic in a party that is hemorrhaging latinovotes he s a very good communicator in a party that struggled to find one in 2012 and he has ties to both the tea party and the party establishment in a party that is very much split between the two and as we ve argued before hehas more upside than just about anybody in the 2016 race republican or democrat marco rubio the upside candidate of 2016 he s also putting a lot more on the line than just about anybody else for a few reasons 1 he s giving up his senate seat sen rand paul r ky is also running for president and like rubio is up for reelection in 2016 but because paul comes from a red state and the filing deadline for his seat isn t till late january 2016 he could potentially revert to staying in the senate if his presidential campaign doesn t catch fire rubio doesn t have that luxury he comes from florida a big swing state in which you need to be focused on that race from day one democrats already have a solid contender in rep patrick murphy and other republicans are alreadylooking at running for rubio s seat the filing deadline in florida isn t till may 2016 so rubio could conceivably attempt what paul is doing he hasn t quite ruled it out though hecame close but national republicans can t really afford to let democrats get that much of a head start in a very important state while rubio figures out whether he can win the gop presidential nomination all the othergop hopefuls either aren t up in 2016 wisconsin gov scott walker and sens ted cruz r tex and lindsey graham r s c for instance or are out of office altogether rubio as the youngest gop hopeful in the field is the only one giving up a bird in hand for the possibility of two in the bush 2 that vp thing isn t looking so likelyanymore well it doesn t matter if he doesn t win the nomination you might say because he s got a really good shot at becoming the vice presidential pick this makes complete sense with republicans likely to nominate another white man and likely to face the potential first female president getting some diversity on their ticket will be key and nobody fits the bill better than rubio some are even joking about rubio running for vp new cartoon floridians are pumped for marcorubio s miami announcement sayfie flapol jebbush pic twitter com sz3hxdkj40 but the idea that rubio could run for president with being vp as a backup plan took a significant hit the day jeb bush started running for president that s because the fellow floridianis perhaps the likeliest if not likely period nominee and the constitution basically precludes him from picking rubio as his running mate itsays that no state can cast its electoral votes for a ticket that includes to people from their own state and given florida s 29 electoral votes are well kind of important it s really hard to see bush picking rubio unless one of them conveniently established residency outside the sunshine state in short at this point bush seems like the most likely nominee and rubio the most likely vice presidential pick but bush won t pick rubio 3 he has a lot more time rubio s youth also means he has more time to wage a political comeback yes but there are no guarantees in a state like florida and winning office is much more difficult than holding an office you already inhabit what s more the republican bench in florida is teeming with ambitious young pols by virtue of the gop dominance of the state the gop controls all statewide offices and about two thirds of the state legislature no republicans haven t exactly fielded the greatest candidates in recent years connie mack much but there are lots of new faces these days that means that if this whole 2016 thing doesn t pan out rubio can t count on returning to statewide office in florida any time soon rubio would certainly be a frontrunner but he would probably have to fight for it time works both ways yes rubio would have yearsto mount a comeback but it also means he has time to wait for another presidential campaign one in which he wouldn t have to give up his seat in the senate to run and yet he has chosen to strike while the iron is semi warm and risk his political future on running for president what s clear is that he doesn t enter into it lightly update longtime florida political reporter adam smithtells our own fix boss about the reasoning for rubio s move a lot like jeb bush rubio is an impatient guy it was always hard to see him as a lifer in the senate nor has he shown much enthusiasm for the slow nuts and bolts work of actually legislating he s more about announcing big policy ideas than actually crafting bills and corralling votes to implement them personal finances i think probably also played a role four kids in private school and living in both west miami and d c is not easy financially
