watch cbsn live june 23 2019 6 50 pm ap toy story 4 brought the box office to life with a 118 million opening weekend after a three week slump of underperforming sequels but the pixar film s below expectations debut didn t quell continuing concerns about a rocky summer movie season the toy story 4 opening according to studio estimates sunday ranks as the fourth highest animated film opening ever not accounting for inflation above it are 2018 s incredibles 2 182 million 2016 s finding dory 135 million and 2007 s shrek the third 121 million it s the year s third largest debut trailing only a pair of other disney releases avengers endgame and captain marvel but heading into the weekend a 140 150 million opening had seemed assured for toy story 4 which played in 4 575 north american theaters adjusted for inflation the film came in shy of the 110 3 million or about 129 million in today s dollars toy story 3 made nine years ago the opening for toy story 4 followed a string of disappointing sequels including dark phoenix godzilla king of the monsters and men in black international but toy story 4 had something those films didn t great reviews it rates 98 fresh on rotten tomatoes audiences gave it an a cinemascore the sequel which introduces the child made plaything forky voiced by tony hale to the voice cast including tom hanks and tim allen also grossed 120 million internationally including a modest 13 4 million in china the world s second largest film market it was trounced there by the rerelease of hayao miyazaki s 2001 animated classic spirited away from studio ghibli the japan animation studio that has often served as an inspiration to pixar cathleen taff distribution chief for disney said the company was thrilled with the opening and praised pixar s high standards the pixar team has always been disciplined about making sure they have a compelling story to tell and that is especially true when it comes to sequels if you look at their past said taff their process of sort of going through the rigor of making sure that this is a story people want told the end result speaks for itself the overall marketplace didn t give toy story 4 much momentum last week s top film sony pictures poorly reviewed men in black international slid 64 percent slipping to fourth place with 10 8 million the no 2 film orion pictures horror remake child s play cheekily positioned as the weekend s r rated toy movie also opened below expectations with 14 1 million a remake of the 1988 original the film stars aubrey plaza with mark hamill voicing the

2017 did little to promote the film in advance of its release in 2018 besson was accused of a rape by the actress sand van roy a lawyer for besson denied the accusation and french authorities dropped the investigation in february citing a lack of evidence eight other women also accused besson of sexual misconduct in a french publication in a summer season that s running 6 5 off the pace of last year according to comscore many had positioned toy story 4 as a surefire savior due in part to the enviable track record of disney and pixar disney s aladdin remake this weekend passed 800 million worldwide instead the weekend was down 27 2 from the same frame last year overwhelming the industry s market leader disney was thought immune to any sequel downturn but most other studios would love to have a film underperform to 118 million with an expectation of long term playability outside sony s upcoming spider man far from home toy story 4 has no family friendly competition until disney s own lion king remake opens july 19 the numbers being bandied about out there pre weekend were certainly much higher than the number that it came in with said paul dergarabedian senior media analyst for comscore but if we bring it down to earth and put some perspective on this it was still a franchise high debut it was a global opening of 238 million but with underwhelming returns for even critically acclaimed comedies like booksmart and seemingly surefire bets like the secret life of pets 2 little has gone according to plan in hollywood s primetime season the summer has been a real head scratcher said dergarabedian in limited release neon s wild rose about a scottish single mother jessie buckley who dreams of being a country music star opened with a per theater average of 14 046
