advertisement supported by education secretary betsy devos released final regulations for schools dealing with sexual misconduct giving them the force of law for the first time and bolstering due process rights by erica l green washington education secretary betsy devos on wednesday issued final regulations on sexual misconduct in education delivering colleges and schools firm new rules on how they must deal with one of the biggest issues that have roiled their campuses for decades the rules fulfill one of the trump administration s major policy goals for title ix the 48 year old federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in programs that receive federal funding bolstering due process protections for accused students while relieving schools of some legal liabilities but ms devos extended the reach of the law in other ways establishing dating violence as a sexual misconduct category that must be addressed and mandating supportive measures for alleged victims of assault title ix had become a flash point in recent years after sexual assault cases rocked high profile universities like stanford and duke and serial sex abuse by staff at the university of southern california michigan state and ohio state demonstrated how schools had failed to properly investigate complaints but enforcement of the law has also grown contentious especially since the obama administration issued guidance documents in 2011 and 2014 that advised schools to ramp up investigations of misconduct and warned that their failure to do so could bring serious consequences critics said schools felt pressured to side with accusers without extending sufficient rights to the accused and dozens of students have won court cases against their colleges for violating their rights under the obama era rules when ms devos announced in 2017 that she was rescinding the obama era guidance she said she would give schools from kindergarten to college regulations with the force of law that balanced those rights her final rules which she called a historic break from the kangaroo courts of the past take effect aug 14 today we release a final rule that recognizes we can continue to combat sexual misconduct without abandoning our core values of fairness presumption of innocence and due process ms devos said on a call with reporters victims rights groups promised they would challenge the new rules in court we refuse to go back to the days when rape and harassment in schools were ignored and swept under the rug said fatima goss graves the president of the national women s law center the new regulations adopt the supreme court s definition of sexual harassment as unwelcome conduct that is so severe pervasive and objectively offensive and they require colleges to hold live hearings during which accusers and accused can be cross examined to challenge their credibility the rules also limit the complaints that schools are obligated to investigate to only those filed through a formal process and brought to the attention of officials with the authority to take corrective action not other authority figures like residential advisers schools will also be responsible for investigating only episodes said to have occurred within their programs and activities not for instance apartments not affiliated with a university and they will have the flexibility to choose which evidentiary standard to use to find students responsible for misconduct preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing evidence to find a school legally culpable for mishandling accusations it would have to be proved deliberately indifferent in carrying out mandates to provide support to victims and investigate complaints fairly the 2 000 page document emphasizes equitable treatment and the presumption of innocence the rules are the most concrete and wide reaching policy measure of ms devos s tenure and were pushed by president trump groups that have long fought the obama era rules claimed victory on wednesday the department s new regulations require schools to provide students with a fundamentally fair process before imposing these life altering consequences said samantha harris a senior fellow at the foundation for individual rights in education a higher education group the obama administration s dear colleague letter of 2011 and supplementary policy clarification in 2014 defined sexual harassment broadly and held schools liable for episodes they knew about or reasonably should have known about they asked schools to adopt a preponderance of evidence standard in adjudicating cases and discouraged cross examination and mediation between accusers and accused victims rights groups said that approach shepherded in a new era of accountability at colleges putting schools on notice that title ix did not only address equal access to sports teams the obama administration found a pattern of cover ups and rampant mishandling of title ix proceedings in both higher education and elementary and secondary schools and it initiated high profile investigations at schools that carried the threat of losing federal funding arne duncan and john b king jr president barack obama s secretaries of education said in a joint statement that the rules were part of an egregiously troubling pattern to continue to rollback civil rights for students especially those most underserved we believe as noted in the 2011 obama administration guidance that institutions should hold those who violate title ix accountable for their actions and protect victims rights the former secretaries said to do otherwise is simply unacceptable ms devos s initial proposals released in november 2018 elicited more than 120 000 public comments and prompted hundreds of meetings between education department officials and advocacy groups the final rules were changed to address at least some concerns the department amended provisions that would have allowed schools to ignore virtually all accusations of misconduct that occurred off campus and officials changed proceedings that critics argued would have re traumatized victims for instance the department did extend responsibility beyond campus saying that schools would be obliged to investigate accusations of misconduct that occur in a building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a postsecondary institution like a fraternity or sorority jurisdiction also extends to locations events or circumstances over which the school exercised substantial control over students and activities like field trips or academic conferences however the rules exclude actions that happen to students studying abroad it also softens initial proposals for cross examination it prohibits students from questioning each other in personal confrontations leaving that to advisers and lawyers a hearing officer must first decide if the questions are relevant and questions about a person s sexual history are generally not lawyers for accused students pressed for cross examination which they believed a crucial tool for rooting out the truth and frivolous complaints justin dillon a lawyer at kaiserdillon which has represented more than 100 accused students at more than 100 schools said the rules were a huge victory for basic fairness and long overdue it was a process that resembles almost nothing that the administration has done it was honest it was thorough he said if the trump administration had put half the thought into the coronavirus as they did into the title ix regulations we d all be going back to work now the final regulations also make exceptions for primary secondary and other specialized schools amid concerns that the draft regulations would have subjected small children to the same treatment as young adults those schools are not required to hold a hearing or cross examinations though parties must be able to submit written questions and students in primary and secondary schools can report their claims to any staff member unlike colleges where reports must be made to a high ranking official the department maintained that the supreme court s strict definition of harassment was so severe and pervasive that it effectively denies a person access to a school s education program or activity but the final rule added that conduct could be harassment if a reasonable person would say it was the department also clarified that sexual assault dating violence domestic violence and stalking are also sexual harassment and those accusations would not have to meet a severe and pervasive standard the rules still mandate that schools dismiss complaints that do not meet the sexual harassment definition even if the accusations are proved true the rules bolster the role and visibility of the title ix coordinator the main point person for facilitating the complaint process and allow schools to appoint several staff members to the position those staff members are now required to provide supportive measures to accusers even if they choose not to go through with a formal complaint the department added an extensive section to combat retaliation against people who bring forward complaints of sexual misconduct meredith smith the assistant provost for title ix and clery compliance at tulane university said she worried how her students would respond to the rules including those accused of misconduct they re going to see this incredibly legalistic way of responding to the harms that they ve experienced including being accused of horrible things and instead of thinking of us as people who can help we re now here to litigate she said i thought i was working in civil rights and ensuring access to education but instead i m going to be running a courtroom the rules require that accused students be given written assurance that they are presumed innocent schools would not be able to impose any disciplinary actions on students accused of misconduct until the end of the case though they retain the ability to remove students from campus if they are found to pose a risk cases involving students can be resolved through mediation but those involving both staff and students cannot the rules could be reversed in congress should democrats win back the senate and keep the house in november democrats will not stand silently as the trump administration attacks the civil rights of students and will fight to ensure that every college campus is free from the fear and threat of discrimination harassment or violence speaker nancy pelosi of california said in a statement republicans praised the rules as fair under the previous administration a single official at the u s department of education was issuing edicts without the proper public input said senator lamar alexander of tennessee the chairman of the senate education committee college and public school leaders urged ms devos to hold off on issuing the regulations during the coronavirus pandemic and with most of their schools closed they have called on her to at least postpone their effective date the department of education is not living in the real world said ted mitchell the president of the american council on education which represents college presidents and administrators choosing this moment to impose the most complex and challenging regulations the agency has ever issued reflects appallingly poor judgment ms devos defended her decision saying schools have known the rules were coming and have ample time to prepare the reality is civil rights really can t wait she said advertisement
