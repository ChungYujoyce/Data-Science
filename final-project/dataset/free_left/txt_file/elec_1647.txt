donald trump is adamant that he raised more than 5 million for military veterans this campaign season and that it is all going to veterans charities after reports raised questions about whether that s true trump scheduled a press conference tuesday to give more details about the donations whereabouts at his press conference trump explained the lack of clarity surfaced in a recent washington postreport by stating he wanted to keep it private i don t think it s anybody s business if i wanna send money to the vets before ultimately unveiling the list of recipients here are the veterans groups that have received money from the trump campaign totaling 5 6 million pic twitter com 7awczfakp0 according to reporting from theassociated press many of these donations were dated the same day as the washington post s article trump associated the timing with the vetting process reviewing statistics reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was deserving of the money he said tuesday but what his reaction to scrutiny of his alleged veterans donations really reveals about trump is how he handles criticism from the press viewing fact checking from reporters as personal attacks rather than a nettlesome but necessary role in democracy last week the presumptive republican nominee responded to the post s report which found his january charity event which he claimed raised more than 6 million in donations for veterans charities had come up short much of the money i have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups it s not the first time reports have raised questions about the donations in march trump spokesperson hope hicks shot down media inquiries in an interview with cnn that similarly wondered about these alleged donations if the media spent half as much time highlighting the work of these groups and how our veterans have been so mistreated rather than trying to disparage mr trump s generosity for a totally unsolicited gesture for which he had no obligation we would all be better for it hicks told cnn at the event which trump held as counterprograming to the republican presidential debate he boycotted in january the candidate said he broke 6 million in donations 1 million of which he donated himself but as of march hicks said they were still collecting donations now trump s campaign manager corey lewandowski says some of the event s biggest donors have backed down on their promises the fundraiser actually brought in 4 5 million or 75 percent of what was initially said the washington post s david fahrenthold reported he later remarked on twitter that even the adjusted numbers are still a hefty and admirable sum for a worthy cause lewandowski also said he did not know whether a 1 million pledge from trump himself was counted as part of the 4 5 million total he said trump has given that amount but he declined to identify any recipients at the time of the report the campaign said the amount was not 4 5 million trump tweeted it is somewhere between 5 million and 6 millions and it was unclear where trump s own pledge of 1 million ended up but regardless of the numbers something has become increasingly clear trump feels this isn t about the money he s making it about him doing a good deed the press should be ashamed at themselves and on behalf of the vets the press should be ashamed of themselves trump said tuesday even calling a reporter at his press conference a sleaze the reports were a personal attack trump said instead of being like thank you very much mr trump or trump did a good job everyone said who got it who got it who got it trump said and you make me look very bad i have never received such bad publicity for doing a good job the washington post report was yet another dishonest ploy from the mainstream media trying to spin his good deed into scandal he tweeted when the report surfaced amazingly with all of the money i have raised for the vets i have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media in many ways trump s idea to host a fundraising event honoring veterans began as a reaction to the disgusting media in january trump decided to boycott the last gop presidential debate before the iowa caucuses because of fox news host and debate moderator megyn kelly it was an early chapter in their months long feud she represented the biased media he felt she had personally targeted him in the first debate and intended to tank fox news s ratings by hosting a charitable even in iowa at the same time as the debate trump and kelly have of course now officially made up trump s fundraiser was organized on a whim and featured the things that represent trump the most middle america an unyielding love for america and trump supporters for trump the washington post s report was an attempt to turn a good deed sour but fahrenthold maintains that wasn t the intention launching a 16 tweet response to trump s comment he has some questions 1 this is a good time for a recap of what we know about realdonaldtrump s jan 28 fundraiser in iowa https t co el01y8zgyf 2 first and foremost it did raise at least 3 1m for veterans we know there was 3 1m b c vets groups got it https t co el01y8zgyf 3 but there are still questions about the total raised and what realdonaldtrump gave from his own pocket https t co el01y8zgyf 4 for instance realdonaldtrump said he d raised 6m last week his campaign mgr told me it was less abt 4 5m https t co el01y8zgyf 5 so how did 6m turn into 4 5m realdonaldtrump blamed unnamed donors who backed out https t co qpdxnbento https t co el01y8zgyf 6 since then campaign has said it s not 4 5m realdonaldtrump now says it s between 5m and 6m https t co el01y8zgyf 7 realdonaldtrump has not identified which donors backed out he mentioned 9 donors onstage including himself https t co el01y8zgyf 8 i ve found evidence from vets groups from donors or from trump staff that at least 7 of the 9 paid up https t co el01y8zgyf 9 together those 7 gave 3 75m realdonaldtrump s website said online donors gave 670k which adds up to 4 45m https t co el01y8zgyf 10 the other question to whom did realdonaldtrump give the 1m he pledged https t co el01y8zgyf 11 realdonaldtrump says his has been given but not to whom i ve been trying to find the vets groups who got it https t co el01y8zgyf 12 which again if you received any of this 1m of trump s personal money dm me https t co el01y8zgyf 13 bottom line realdonaldtrump fundraiser was a huge boost for the vets grps who got donations as a result https t co el01y8zgyf 14 but there are still questions about how much he raised and how realdonaldtrump met his personal 1m pledge https t co el01y8zgyf 15 realdonaldtrump wants to use his skills as a leader of big organizations to fix the va https t co el01y8zgyf 16 so please keep reading https t co qpdxnbento https t co el01y8zgyf january s fundraising event raised a lot of money for veterans it was also undeniably a political platform it resembled a trump rally as much as it did a charitable event i reported in january the event was true to trump s candidacy with platitudes about veterans viral internet meme stars and invitees coronating trump with an award one of the veterans in attendance described the event as so much america trump invited three military veterans to speak and near the end of the event they presented him with a ring honoring him for thanking the nation s military and respecting those lost in war fahrenthold captured it best in a single evening in des moines trump showed fox news the host of that night s trump less debate that he was powerful enough to spurn the fox network at the same time he showed a national audience that he could conjure a multimillion dollar benefit out of nothing using connections showmanship and his own wealth since then trump has used the event to exemplify all the good he has done for the military and its veterans in the weeks after he used his campaign events to give large checks to various charities rallying confidence that he can get good things done with a snap of his fingers he raised millions the point is clear trump under no obligation did a good thing while under no obligation to do so i have raised between 5 6 million dollars including 1million dollars from me for our veterans nice get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
