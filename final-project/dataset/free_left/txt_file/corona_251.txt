stepping up to meet the continuing challenges of coronavirus in unprecedented ways our federal government continues to let us down at the white house we know the president took too long to act dismissed the seriousness of the pandemic in the earliest days spread misleading information about test availability and drug treatments at press briefings and used those briefings to blame everyone from former president obama to the media for his own leadership failures he has publicly contradicted and diminished his own medical experts belittled governors for demanding more assistance smirked at the hardship of political rivals and personally and viciously attacked journalists in depth political coverage sports analysis entertainment reviews and cultural commentary donald trump has in a word been a disaster he is too small a man for this big a job over in congress the picture isn t much prettier while americans are out of work running out of money and afraid for their lives and livelihood lawmakers squabble over procedure and petty politics republicans want a stimulus package to include a nearly 450 billion slush fund for the treasury department and president trump to hand out to ailing firms of their choosing democrats have larded up a stimulus bill with galling pet projects for solar and wind energy and big labor while allocating so called emergency funding to everyone from the kennedy center for the performing arts to howard university and the institute of museum and library services congress too is letting americans down in an urgent time of need

conservatives to urge bigger government in a time of crisis federalism is an important political model for self governance but not when states can t get surgical masks and hospital gowns if there s ever a time to feed the beast instead of starve it it is now innovation will come from both the public and private sector and while bernie sanders and other progressives are slamming ceos
