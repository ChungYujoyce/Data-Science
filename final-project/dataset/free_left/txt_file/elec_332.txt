 off message in an exclusive interview for politico s off message podcast barack obama s master strategist says trump will be the nominee and a dangerous one at that by glenn thrush 02 29 2016 05 07 am est david plouffe thinks hillary clinton s greatest advantage is a sophisticated data gathering operation capable of targeting voters one by one in swing states bridget mulcahy a couple of days before hillary clinton won the south carolina primary by nearly 50 points david plouffe eased back in his chair at an anonymous capitol hill hotel and declared that the woman he helped defeat in 2008 had oh a 98 percent chance of beating bernie sanders he felt pretty pretty confident about her odds against donald trump too predicting she could win by an unheard of margin nationally of 6 to 10 points but barack obama s puckish intensely competitive former campaign manager arguably the most successful democratic strategist of his generation offered a who the hell really knows shrug when asked to offer a similarly precise estimate of clinton s odds of beating trump advertisement i don t think we know yet and i think all of us should have learned by now not to get out over ourselves with trump plouffe told me during an episode of politico s off message podcast in which he offered far ranging opinions on clinton s self defeating tendency to doubt her own staff trump s role as an uber like disrupter and bill clinton s not quite obama level status in the presidential pantheon subscribe to politico s off message podcast with glenn thrush my sense though is this that he could completely implode plouffe said of his favorite topic trump tacking on a massive caveat so you say well how could someone you know really ferociously and viciously attack the last former republican president and get into a worldwide verbal tango with the pope and come out ok well he did the trump thing is a living breathing growing organism there are no rules for how you deal with it plouffe the archetypal no drama obama adviser credited with implementing obama s delegate hoarding strategy eight years ago has been informally advising clinton and her staff as needed last year politico reported that he had quietly met with the soon to be candidate at her washington mansion tracing her steps state by state and offering counsel on how to avoid the rending internal dissension that helped scuttle her race against obama plouffe several people in clinton s brooklyn headquarters told me speaks regularly with campaign manager robby mook despite a demanding executive post at uber that demands he travel almost constantly mook was checking in with plouffe daily sometimes multiple times a day during clinton s narrow and bitterly won victory in the iowa caucuses they told me part of the problem he has identified is the sheer number of people the clintons talk to on any given day and the unerring certainty that each had in the quality of their own advice compared with what mook and his team offered and here is where the 48 year old delaware political marketing whiz who was trying to be as tactful as possible in his public dispensing of criticism described what he believes to be the biggest danger to clinton as she grinds through the primary headlong into a bellowing full steam trump off message by politico staff i think you build your team and you stick by your team and you run said plouffe it s got to be very hard for the clintons they ve been on the scene for decades so any time things go wrong they have dozens of people you know in their email box and probably calling saying told you so you ve got to do this you ve got to do this you re going to have your valleys and that s always a test and if the thing you do is sow internal tension and allow voices from the outside to really i think affect the campaign in a negative way you may not win early on it seemed as though the clintons were headed to the same dark place they inhabited for much of 2008 both were in a sour question everything mood in the days after her microscopic victory in iowa when it was clear sanders was about to deliver a humbling and decisive win in new hampshire there was talk of accelerating a re evaluation of staff that had been expected after super tuesday or after she secured the nomination some in clinton s orbit even floated the nonstarter idea that plouffe abandon his lucrative uber gig and jump aboard the campaign despite the finger pointing clinton decided to stay the course and was rewarded with game changing victories in nevada and south carolina and plouffe hopes she doesn t get itchy scratchy when things go south as they inevitably will in a general election fight i think what you do need to figure out whether it s one voice plouffe said of the campaign s overall strategy and please do away with clinton s propensity to summon the clans for 10 to 20 person conference calls anytime things go wrong he urged there has to be you know there s the big call and the big meeting and then there s the real meeting and the real call he added you can t make decisions with 10 people it s impossible so you ve got to figure out and you know the question is who is she talking to and listen they ve got enormous talent joel benenson pollster and strategist mandy grunwald clinton ad maker and all around adviser adman jim margolis jen palmieri communications director these are super smart people so i don t think it s necessarily you know is there a missing person from the outside you ve got to commit to something the test he says will come during the general election when some old clinton hand panics and demands that either hillary or bill scuttle mook s strategy to address some crisis real or imagined there will be moments when there s some bad bull public poll that comes out that shows them tied in pennsylvania and with all due respect ed rendell will call and say you ve got to abandon virginia and come here for three days at this point plouffe is almost certain trump will be clinton s opponent he says it s already too late for republicans to consolidate behind marco rubio or ted cruz even assuming one or the other would drop out in a fit of suicidal altruism from here on out trump basically needs to not implode remarkably this is completely in his control if he can land the plane he wins plouffe says 2016 by kyle cheney while he professes to be alarmed by the developer turned reality star in his capacity as an american citizen he gets a little giddy not a natural plouffian state of being at the process of reverse engineering the donald s teflon candidacy if you end up with a trump clinton matchup that will be one for the ages and one he s pretty sure though not entirely convinced she d win in a walk i think that s a likely possibility that hillary clinton could beat donald trump by an unheard of margin nationally of 6 to 10 points he says but if that s not the case and he s competitive where he ll be competitive is in the upper midwest in the ohios the wisconsins maybe pennsylvanias of the world maybe iowa and minnesota even potentially plouffe is quick to say from an electoral college standpoint i don t see a trump path but he s equally quick to say the greatest threat posed by trump is his unpredictability plouffe is a guy who likes to make a plan and stick with it and trump makes that a near impossibility trump is a wild card and you just don t know he adds the greatest danger is that the public continues to give trump license to change his positions any time he likes with minimal recrimination and that will allow him to take popular stances outside the narrow confines of gop orthodoxy plouffe thinks he ll show openness to taxing the rich nod toward the reality of climate change even recognize some federal government role in providing health care to the poor the idea of deconstructing trump appeals to plouffe but the aspect of his old job he misses most is playing around with the numbers he thinks clinton s greatest advantage is a sophisticated data gathering operation capable of targeting voters one by one in swing states undermining trump s scattershot populist messaging plouffe comes by his numeracy naturally his father a massachusetts native was a physics major who joined the army and rose to the rank of captain where he worked in intelligence and plouffe earnestly says that he can t talk about what his dad did before retiring and taking a job with dupont the son inherited the father s love for math he fondly recalls solving calculus puzzles as a kid and like many political pros he grew up a baseball box score fanatic and later a devotee of sabermetrics but he was also a passionate fan and like many kids in delaware followed the phillies as a young boy and idolized their hall of fame third baseman mike schmidt as any one who has ever worked with or against him knows plouffe is also very very competitive as a pre teen he merged all of his passions into an obsession with a 1970s era board game all star baseball that combined probability cards with the names of his favorite players and the thrill of pure chance in short all the elements of modern politics yet for plouffe politics is ultimately about loyalty in his case an abiding loyalty to obama that s apparent even as he dives enthusiastically into a role as public clinton booster and private unpaid adviser by kristen east his old competitive instincts toward clinton have been mostly but not entirely suppressed he speaks glowingly of her toughness and smarts but when i ask plouffe if he regrets playing hardball with bill and hillary clinton in south carolina he grins not one bit he says not one bit when plouffe compiles his list of consequential presidents over the past century the purpose is to place obama near the top he ticks them off one by one well clearly franklin roosevelt maybe you throw in the combined kennedy johnson years and then barack obama i think on that level and reagan of course i interrupt not bill clinton bill clinton was a very good president he replies very good missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the
