should consider full deportation of all muslims in the country the question is why do we have muslims in the country nehlen asked donald trump who earlier this week declined to endorse house speaker paul ryan in his primary race against nehlen lauded the challenger earlier this week after nehlen complimented trump on his handling of a week long feud with the family of a us army captain who was killed in action in iraq circumstances have clearly changed since captain khan s death nehlen said of humayun khan who was awarded the bronze star after waving off the troops under his command from a truck that later exploded claiming his life but let s be clear muslim americans have been fighting on both sides of the war in fact more muslim americans 20 have been killed since 9 11 fighting for isis than have been killed fighting for america if the break point is sharia and islam is the only major religion that encourages lying nehlen said referring to the term taqiyya which refers to concealing one s religion when facing persecution which has since been misinterpreted by anti muslim polemicists as proof that muslims cannot be trusted if they lie how do you vet something like that nehlen asked the question is why do we have muslims in the country how can you possibly vet somebody who lies when asked whether he was proposing a mass deportation of all muslims from the us nehlen was open to the idea i m suggesting we have a discussion about it that s for sure i am absolutely suggesting we figure out here s what we should be doing we should be monitoring every mosque 7 24pm

bet you ll get kicked out you like electricity i d like to see you jump around 5 29pm bst 17 29 house speaker paul ryan is trying to have it both ways on donald trump s feud with the family of an army captain killed in the line of duty telling a wisconsin radio station that trump s comments attacking the family were beyond the pale and that his endorsement is not a blank check but continues to endorse trump in the interview with wtaq ryan was asked if there would ever be a bridge too far for him to continue endorsing trump s presidential bid but declined to get into specifics i have always said of course there are going to be moments i am not going to get into speculation or hypotheticals none of these things are ever blank checks that goes with any situation in any race when asked whether trump s remarks about the parents of humayun khan who was awarded the bronze star after he was killed in a truck bombing while serving in iraq ryan continued to hedge look i already made my point clear on the gold star family which is you don t do that to gold star families you do nothing but honor gold star families and if anyone earned the right to say whatever they want to express themselves it is gold star families and i put out a statement basically to that effect again i thought the comments with respect to this gold star family and ms khan in particular were beyond the pale and i called it out ryan insisted i actually put out a statement to that effect and i ve done that in the past the judge curiel comments so i don t like doing this i don t want to do this but i do this in order to defend republicans and our principles so that people don t make the mistake of thinking that we think like that 5 11pm bst 17 11 donald trump s latest attack ad depicts hillary clinton as ms pac man gobbling up emails like ghosts 4 52pm bst 16 52 katrina jorgensen republicans face a lot of difficult decisions this year but for the party to come back strong after donald trump s divisive candidacy for it to keep its brand as the free market democracy loving opportunity focused alternative to the democrats the least worst option is a major loss in the presidential race by selecting a nominee that does not reflect the usual fiscal policies a victory for trump will mean a shift in the party s focus even if the rest of the gop holds fast to the platform or to traditional conservative values the president s policies always reshape the party if you have ever promoted a local candidate to voters you know this is true the public looks at the top of the ticket first and judges the party by that person s views many trump supporters will see his win as a referendum on their policies and will work to make the party reflect that fellow republicans will either need to accept that or leave we have no idea what a trump presidency will look like but based on his campaign it will be filled with outrageous gaffes inarticulate interviews on policy and offensive media blitzes focused on non issues trump will most likely lose minorities and women creating a wider divide that the gop must bridge in the future many young voters will continue to associate trump with the party long after he leaves office this would only further damage republicans and set us up for heavy losses in 2018 not to mention the party will continue to hemorrhage its best and brightest candidates staff and volunteers have already walked away from trump and there s no question it will keep happening if trump gains a greater control of the party these people might even be forced out but let s say trump doesn t win and hillary clinton claims the white house if trump only trails her by a few points you can bet he will blame the republicans who voted their conscience or he ll kick up dirt over the rigged system as he has already alluded to trump supporters in the party will go on a witch hunt looking for anyone who acted disloyally to the republican nominee that in fighting could destroy the party 4 45pm bst 16 45 sasha obama the younger daughter of president barack obama and first lady michelle obama is officially roughing it on her family s summer vacation on martha s
