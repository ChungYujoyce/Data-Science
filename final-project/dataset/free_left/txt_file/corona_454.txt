the right testing for everyone who needs it we need to be able to trace contacts isolate quarantine and appropriately while striving to develop a cure bright said there will be plenty of time to look

opening statement that he believes a covid 19 vaccine is a question of when not if but cautioned that 12 to 18 months is an aggressive schedule and i think it will take longer than that to manufacture a vaccine until last month bright led the department of health and human services biomedical advanced research and development authority barda he alleges that his removal from that post was an act of retaliation by trump administration officials because he resisted a push by the white house to promote unproven coronavirus treatments using hydroxychloroquine in his opening statement bright backed tuesday s senate testimony by dr anthony fauci the nation s leading infectious disease expert and a member of the white house coronavirus task force dr fauci delivered a message in a voice that s clear and trustworthy as he encouraged us to act with caution as we return to our daily lives bright said we must increase the public education about the basics washing hands social distancing appropriate face covering bright s written testimony submitted ahead of thursday s hearing had an even stronger warning that without clear planning and quick action the coming winter will be the darkest in recent history he modulated that warning slightly on thursday but still struck a sobering note if we fail to improve our response now based on science i fear the pandemic will get worse and be prolonged bright said there will be likely a resurgence of covid 19 this fall and it will greatly compound the challenges of seasonal influenza in his written testimony bright describes dismissive hhs leadership he said that as early as january he warned the department to ramp up production of ventilators personal protective equipment and testing swabs in anticipation of a pandemic and that his warnings were ignored i was met with indifference saying they were either too busy they didn t have a plan they didn t know who was responsible for procuring those bright said of his push for hhs to obtain more ppe a number of excuses but never any action bright also said in prepared testimony that he was cut out of key high level meetings to combat covid 19 in april bright filed a whistleblower complaint over his removal from the top barda job in the complaint he claims that he resisted a white house push to promote and fund the now discredited antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus remedy over more promising solutions sidelining me in the middle of this pandemic and placing politics and cronyism ahead of science puts lives at risk and stunts national efforts to safely and effectively address this urgent public health crisis bright wrote in the letter the complaint was first reported by michael d shear and maggie haberman of the new york times the office of the special counsel has since concluded that there are reasonable grounds to believe that bright was retaliated against and that he should be reinstated to his former job as barda director the same watchdog reportedly found a substantial likelihood of wrongdoing in bright s removal according to a statement released by his lawyers thursday during thursday s hearing however republicans on the committee focused more on making that case that president trump had good reason to promote hydroxychloroquine than they did on getting to the bottom of the circumstances surrounding bright s removal republicans keep using their questioning time to defend trump by promoting hydroxychloroquine it s beyond parody pic twitter com tquleleikl others attacked bright rep markwayne mullin r ok for
