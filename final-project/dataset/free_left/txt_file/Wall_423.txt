advertisement supported by he attacks joe biden to deflect blame for his terrible handling of covid 19 and record of appeasing beijing by susan e rice contributing opinion writer there is a long history of american presidential candidates using china as a campaign cudgel from bill clinton blasting president george h w bush in 1992 for dealing with a chinese premier known as the butcher of beijing to donald trump s 2016 attack that the obama administration had allowed china to rape the united states while hillary clinton was secretary of state this election year china bashing will reach a new level as mr trump seeks to capitalize on high voter disapproval of china beijing s failure to contain the coronavirus and persistent bilateral tensions between our countries desperate to obscure the reality of more than 90 000 american deaths and 36 million unemployed amid mr trump s utterly incompetent handling of the pandemic republicans have no better strategy than to play the china card the republicans are executing a 57 page campaign memo that recommends branding opponents soft on china and reveals their rationale for repeated refrains of the chinese virus and wuhan lab for mr trump attacking former vice president joe biden on china serves three purposes to dampen turnout among populist democrats to deflect blame for his deadly mishandling of the coronavirus for which he takes no responsibility at all and most cynically to try to turn his own blatant weakness on china into a political weapon mr trump s penchant for projecting his personal failings onto others is one of his most familiar and dishonest ploys whether the subject is corruption nepotism sexual assault or russian interference in the 2016 election as with so called obamagate on china mr trump has much to fear from his own record to preserve his prized phase one trade deal which failed to change china s unfair trading practices after a costly tariff war mr trump downplayed the risk of the coronavirus and heaped praise on president xi jinping fifteen times in january and february mr trump lauded mr xi s leadership on covid 19 he fawned on behalf of the american people i want to thank president xi and insisted that they are doing a very professional job despite strong evidence of china s deceptive handling of the virus since early in his presidency mr trump has repeatedly kowtowed to mr xi gushing about his becoming president for life and proclaiming that his respect and friendship with president xi is unlimited more dangerously mr trump s policies have strengthened china at america s expense by antagonizing our asian and european partners he has lent impetus to china s longstanding goal of rupturing our alliances which constrain china s global ambitions by withdrawing from the trans pacific partnership trade agreement the paris climate agreement and the iran nuclear deal mr trump has left friends and foes alike to doubt american resolve while ceding to china the mantle of steadfast global leader mr trump s refusal even to criticize china s egregious abuses including against the uighur minority and pro democracy protesters in hong kong along with his attacks on the american press and failure to condemn china s expulsion of american journalists have combined to grant mr xi a free pass on human rights violations and spotlight mr trump s abandonment of american moral leadership by undermining the united nations system mr trump has left an international leadership vacuum that china is rushing to fill witness mr xi s announcement on monday at the world health assembly that china will provide 2 billion to help nations confront covid 19 and share any vaccine it develops by contrast mr trump tweeted a letter slamming china and threatening to withdraw from the world health organization on strategic imperatives mr trump allowed china to ease pressure on north korea and failed to counter china s cyberaggression and expansionism in the south china sea yet he saved the chinese pariah telecom firm zte because american sanctions might cause too many jobs in china to be lost mr trump also eagerly enlisted china to serve his personal interests most notably by pleading for china s help in the coming election and allowing his daughter ivanka to pocket plenty of chinese trademarks given such a self serving and shameful legacy it will take some truly trumpian houdini tactics to tar joe biden with being weak on china in reality the opposite is true and mr biden can use the president s dismal record against him starting in january mr biden warned starkly of the dangers of the coronavirus and in february insisted that china be more transparent and admit u s scientists stressing that unlike mr trump i would not be taking china s word when it comes to the coronavirus as vice president he advocated for american journalists in china and made the case for human rights even while on chinese soil further mr biden directly confronted mr xi stressing that u s warplanes would flout china s unilaterally declared air defense zone and back america s asian allies against chinese pressure mr biden also effectively pressed chinese officials to halt cyber and intellectual property theft increase pressure on north korea float its currency and reduce barriers to u s trade and investment lacking any sense of irony or decency mr trump will run his standard play trying to deflect responsibility for his monumental failings by dishonestly projecting onto mr biden his own weakness on china mr trump seemingly will do anything to win in november and his china gambit may prove to be the least of it still campaigning on china while a well worn strategy is particularly dangerous in these tense times when it fuels anti asian hostility at home and anti american sentiment abroad makes governing more difficult and raises the prospect of a costly cold war or worse the times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor we d like to hear what
