advertisement supported by by trip gabriel republicans arriving in cleveland next month to nominate donald j trump will be greeted by as many as 6 000 protesters on the first day a noisy coalition of dozens of groups including black lives matter and the workers world party the demonstrators intend to ignore restrictions keeping them far from the delegates raising fears the violence that accompanied some of mr trump s rallies will be magnified on a mass scale two marches along routes the city has not authorized are planned for the convention s opening day july 18 organizers say they want to avoid violence but they are also gearing up for confrontation with the police including training in civil disobedience if there are people willing to put themselves on the line to be arrested so be it said deb kline a leader of cleveland jobs with justice one of the groups that will march a week later as democrats pour into philadelphia so will an army of bernie sanders supporters planning occupy wall street style protests against what they call the fraudulent nomination of hillary clinton one group occupy dnc convention is circulating information about protecting oneself from tear gas by wearing a vinegar soaked bandanna and swim goggles the divisive nominating contests have produced countercurrents of deep resentment in both parties and next month that bitterness could spill into the streets in large protests just when republicans and democrats and the host cities are trying to present images of unity to the country mass demonstrations have occurred at nearly every modern political convention perhaps none more disastrously than at the 1968 democratic convention in chicago where street riots contributed to hubert h humphrey s loss that november there is no chance of that level of violence officials in both cities insist because modern policing has evolved to be less confrontational philadelphia is considering issuing 100 summonses to marchers blocking highways or failing to disperse rather than arresting them but protest organizers in cleveland say that by imposing strict rules to contain demonstrators the city is increasing the likelihood that unsanctioned protests will erupt leading to violent clashes with the police or between trump supporters and opponents protest groups say the restrictions are less for safety than to minimize their visibility and the american civil liberties union of ohio has sued the city over the rules saying they violated free speech rights the rules limit marches to 50 minutes mostly during the mornings hours before the delegates convene and to a route distant from quicken loans arena the convention site passing over what protest organizers call a bridge to nowhere the parade route is very short and it goes over a bridge which means no one can see them said christine link the executive director of the american civil liberties union of ohio some protest leaders said they would ignore the restrictions and march as close as possible to the arena which will be wrapped in a security perimeter set by the secret service they made this plan to frustrate and aggravate people who want to demonstrate within their rights against the republican agenda said thomas burke a leader of the coalition to stop trump and march on the rnc expecting thousands for a protest on the convention s opening day mr burke said he would ignore the official parade route and march from cleveland s public square to within sight and sound of the arena if the police respect our march i think we have a family friendly event he said if people try to provoke and attack our march i m pretty sure people will take care of themselves we re very well organized even the organizer of a pro trump rally said the city s rules increased the chance of violence by confining all demonstrators to the same route you stick everybody together face to face you re going to have a problem said tim selaty organizer of a group called citizens for trump which expects 5 000 to attend they have created a much more dangerous situation after the 2004 republican convention in new york the city paid out millions of dollars to settle claims of civil rights violations after the police detained 1 800 people including dozens swept up by long orange nets a spokesman for mayor frank g jackson of cleveland defended the prescribed march route and said the police had trained for 18 months to deal with protesters our anticipation is everyone is going to come and do what they re supposed to do and will be able to have a wonderful time said the spokesman dan williams he added that protesters who chose other march routes would not be arrested as long as they used sidewalks and did not block traffic the potential effect on mr trump and mrs clinton as they formally enter the general election is asymmetrical in cleveland mr trump who will be confronted by left wing demonstrators not fellow republicans could potentially benefit from scenes of mayhem that allow him to call for law and order and project strength as he did recently when opponents punched his supporters and burned their make america great again hats in california street chaos if it occurs could overshadow disunion in the convention hall as an increasing array of party leaders nervously break ranks with mr trump democratic leaders are worried about emerging from their convention with an unmollified bernie or bust contingent whose protests could provide jarring split screen images as the party seeks to rally around mrs clinton philadelphia is giving the protesters more leeway than cleveland is allowing daylong rallies of sanders supporters in franklin delano roosevelt park facing the convention site the wells fargo center on all four days of the convention july 25 28 bill taylor an organizer of the rallies said he expected up to 250 000 people still angry that mr sanders lost the democratic nomination by what they believe is a rigged system since the end of the primaries as leading democrats like senator elizabeth warren and labor groups like the a f l c i o have endorsed mrs clinton mr sanders has held off last week he told supporters he would take his movement and more than 1 900 delegates to the convention mr taylor a philadelphia resident with no official ties to mr sanders received a request from the campaign to use one of his permits so mr sanders could hold a rally in roosevelt park on sunday july 24 the convention s eve even as mrs clinton effectively clinched the nomination by securing a majority of delegates many sanders supporters insist there were fraud and voter suppression we feel like democracy has been stolen said laurie cestnick the founder of a facebook group called occupy dnc convention which has more than 25 000 members her group is a hub for ride shares to philadelphia information about bernie buses and tent camping and a friendly warning not to use berniebnb a house sharing app that is already overwhelmed

party chairwoman representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida the end of the use of superdelegates or party leaders who get nominating votes and have overwhelmingly backed mrs clinton and

not met mr taylor said die hard sanders supporters plan to leave the democratic party polls show as many as 30 percent of mr sanders s backers say they will not vote for mrs clinton to symbolize their view of the party mr taylor said we plan on marching coffins down broad street every day advertisement
