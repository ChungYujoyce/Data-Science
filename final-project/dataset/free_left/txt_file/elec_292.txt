 hillary clinton is using president obama s record to help boost her ap hillary clinton is trying to turn bernie sanders measured criticism of the president s record into the stuff of biblical betrayal by edward isaac dovere 02 12 2016 08 52 am est milwaukee barack obama 2016 apparently tying iowa and winning new hampshire is nothing next to the feat bernie sanders has now pulled off making hillary clinton hug obama closer than she ever wanted to and driving obama loyalists so crazy that they ve become devoted to her advertisement now the guy clinton ran against in 2008 and sanders talked about running against in 2012 has become the one they re both running to in the fight for core democrats particularly african americans in the expanded primary campaign you could see it on the debate stage on thursday night when clinton treated a rather innocuous bernie book blurb like it was the equivalent of the kiss of judas a move sanders said was a low blow one of us ran against barack obama he shot back in one of the debate s more memorable lines i was not that candidate by annie karni clinton top strategist and obama pollster joel benenson said thursday night he s even had informal conversations about making the president the focus of a new ads from the campaign in the meantime benenson and pretty much everyone else who worked on obama s campaigns spent the hours after the debate here making a renewed push for people to pull up the 2011 video from the thom hartmann show of sanders calling for candidates supporting a progressive agenda as opposed to what obama is doing please watch and share he s lying when he says he supported potus tweeted obama 2012 battleground states director mitch stewart whose firm is working with the clinton campaign clinton s still on record disagreeing with obama on some big policy ideas including the obamacare cadillac tax the trans pacific partnership deportation raids which she mentioned quickly in passing and creating a no fly zone in syria which sanders tried briefly to point out as a significant difference and used to spend time talking about taking a different approach to the presidency but talking about obama that way for clinton is so 2015 on the debate stage thursday she invoked obama s name 21 times along with phrases like i fully endorse i am a staunch supporter and i think president obama has set a great example obama obamacare obama s financial reforms obama s iranian nuclear deal obama s decision to kill osama bin laden obama s immigration reform executive actions that s the debate clinton wants over the next few weeks particularly with obama all but endorsing her and throwing a line into his homecoming speech on wednesday in springfield ill about not letting someone else decide whether he or anyone else gets to be called a real progressive the obama team is happy to help secretary clinton is a dreamer and a doer barack obama is a dreamer and doer said labor secretary tom perez one of four obama cabinet secretaries to endorse clinton asked how he d define sanders by contrast perez called him a really well meaning individual 2016 by gabriel debenedetti clinton aides blame sanders for making the campaign so much about obama most recently with an msnbc interview taped ahead of the debate thursday in which he said the president had failed in his outreach to congress i wasn t anticipating that senator sanders would go and push off on him as much as he has said clinton campaign chair john podesta a former senior adviser to obama podesta spoke carefully landing on a word about obama that has resonance particularly in the african american community sanders he claimed said it was just disagreement but it borders on disrespect podesta demurred on whether clinton who s often talked about continuing obama s work while insisting she wasn t running for his third term expected to be talking about the president this much instead of answering he turned the question back on bernie does it surprise me a little bit that sanders continues to throw elbows at the president yeah that surprises me a little bit podesta s face screwed up when told that sanders campaign had just insisted the vermont senator had a greater claim to the obama legacy than clinton but across the room after the debate that s exactly what sanders campaign manager jeff weaver argued absolutely weaver said secretary clinton has said she s a moderate and a centrist president obama has brought this country forward with joe biden senator sanders wants to follow in the path of democratic presidents throughout this century which is that each president brings the country further and further forward aside from their differences on trade and tax policy the sanders campaign argues that he s the one who s closer to obama though the clinton campaign eagerly claims that his health care overhaul would tear down obamacare and they leapt all over sanders saying thursday night that race relations would absolutely get better under him than they have been under obama they re trying to place a wedge a wall a division between senator sanders and president obama there s only one problem it doesn t exist said sanders chief strategist tad devine clinton s interest in obama is only tactical devine argued as when during the debate she defended herself on taking wall street contributions by saying obama had taken more financial sector donations than anyone but still signed the dodd frank financial regulations they ve decided they can use the president as a shield whenever he raises an issue that hillary feels uncomfortable wall street s a good example that hillary can say aha if you attack me you attack president obama devine said then there was the time when clinton dismissed priorities usa the super pac now stocked and run by former aides and loyalists as an organization that was set up to support president obama that has now decided that they want to support me particularly among the heavily african american primary electorate in south carolina but across the country in a demographic where obama s numbers are higher than the already sky high approval he has among precisely the kind of committed democrats who vote in primaries this issue matters 2016 by kyle cheney african americans and others elected him twice for someone who wants to be the democratic nominee it s very dangerous to attack him said rep gwen moore d wisc who s supporting clinton but nina turner a former ohio state senator who s all in for sanders was exasperated thursday night when confronted with the question the african american community shouldn t fall for that turner said as an african american woman i find it quite insulting i find it insulting to have a candidate cloak themselves in this president stand up and talk about what you re doing what you re fighting for then there s what happens if clinton wins the nomination embracing obama now means her arms will still be around him in the fall facing voters in a general election who don t have the same love for obama that everyone on the debate stage and in the primaries does benenson said he isn t worried i think she ll run her campaign against the republican she s running against benenson said each election has its own dynamic missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest
