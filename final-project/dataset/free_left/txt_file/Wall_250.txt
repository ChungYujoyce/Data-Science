advertisement supported by mayor bill de blasio said the city s morgues still have the capacity to accommodate the dead but officials are preparing contingency plans by alan feuer and liam stack new york city officials are starting to lay contingency plans if deaths from the coronavirus outbreak begin to overwhelm the capacity of morgues temporarily burying the dead on public land mayor bill de blasio said on monday that the city would consider temporary burials if the deaths from the coronavirus outbreak exceed the space available in city and hospital morgues but it had not reached that point it s going to be very tough but we have the capacity the mayor said at a news conference at the brooklyn navy yard if we need to do temporary burials to be able to tide us over to pass the crisis and then work with each family on their appropriate arrangements we have the ability to do that he said adding we may well be dealing with temporary burials so we can deal with each family later earlier on monday the chairman of the city council health committee mark d levine a manhattan democrat had sparked an uproar among city residents when he said on twitter the that the office of the chief medical examiner was looking into creating temporary mass graves in a public park the mayor firmly denied there were plans to use a park as a temporary grave site his press secretary freddi goldstein said that if such a step became necessary the city would bury people on hart island in the bronx the city medical examiner s office said in a statement that no final decision on using temporary burials had been made and the morgues still had adequate capacity at this time gov andrew m cuomo also said on monday that he had heard nothing about the possibility of burying people temporarily in parks i have heard a lot of wild rumors but i have not heard anything about the city burying people in parks the governor said at his daily briefing after the mayor and governor weighed in and after mr levine s comments caused an stir among some new yorkers the councilman wrote on twitter that what he was describing was a contingency plan and that if the death rate drops enough it will not be necessary in the evening mr levine put out another statement saying city officials had given him unequivocal assurance that no burials would take place in parks last week the medical examiner s office rushed 45 new refrigerated trailers to hospitals around the city which had started to report that their in house morgues were filling up the delivery of the mobile freezer units came as part of a plan the pandemic influenza surge plan for in and out of hospital deaths that the medical examiner has been using to deal with the sharp rise in the number of bodies updated may 12 2020 there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others this is a difficult question because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained a better question might be how will we know when to reopen the country in an american enterprise institute report scott gottlieb caitlin rivers mark b mcclellan lauren silvis and crystal watson staked out four goal posts for recovery hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested it seems to spread very easily from person to person especially in homes hospitals and other confined spaces the pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out it may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face no clinical trials are underway in the united states china and europe but american officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away unlike the flu there is no known treatment or vaccine and little is known about this particular virus so far it seems to be more lethal than the flu but the numbers are still uncertain and it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions not just those with respiratory diseases particularly hard if the family member doesn t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms while also keeping as much distance as possible according to guidelines issued by the c d c if there s space the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if masks are available both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters doorknobs toilets and tables don t forget to wash your hands frequently plan two weeks of meals if possible but people should not hoard food or supplies despite the empty shelves the supply chain remains strong and remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea that s not a good idea even if you re retired having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation or even grows makes sense but retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years watching your balance go up and down can be scary you may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions don t if your employer matches any part of your contributions make sure you re at least saving as much as you can to get that free money mr levine said plans for the possible use of temporary interment had been mapped out as part of that plan he said in a series of twitter messages that the city had to face the reality that traditional burial system has largely frozen up we are relying on freezers now to hold bodies but that capacity is almost entirely used up he said describing temporary interment as essentially an extension of the freezer system in recent days the virus has tripled the number of people dying in the city compared with an average day not only are hundreds of people dying in hospitals straining their morgues but the number dying at home is exploding said aja worthy davis a spokeswoman for the medical examiner s office before the pandemic she said at home deaths ranged between 20 and 25 a day now they average around 200 she said liam stack and jeffery c mays contributed reporting advertisement
