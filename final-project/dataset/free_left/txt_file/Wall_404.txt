advertisement supported by political memo by smearing his opponents championing conspiracy theories and pursuing vendettas president tru mp has reverted to his darkest political tactics in spite of a pandemic hurting millions of americans by alexander burns maggie haberman jonathan martin and nick corasaniti even by president trump s standards it was a rampage he attacked a government whistle blower who was telling congress that the coronavirus pandemic had been mismanaged he criticized the governor of pennsylvania who has resisted reopening businesses he railed against former president barack obama linking him to a conspiracy theory and demanding he answer questions before the senate about the federal investigation of michael t flynn and mr trump lashed out at joseph r biden jr his democratic challenger in an interview with a sympathetic columnist mr trump smeared him as a doddering candidate who doesn t know he s alive the caustic attack coincided with a barrage of digital ads from mr trump s campaign mocking mr biden for verbal miscues and implying that he is in mental decline that was all on thursday far from a one day onslaught it was a climactic moment in a weeklong lurch by mr tru mp back to the darkest tactics that defined his rise to political power even those who have grown used to mr trump s conduct in office may have found themselves newly alarmed by the grim spectacle of a sitting president deliberately stoking the country s divisions and pursuing personal vendettas in the midst of a crisis that has americans fearing for their lives and livelihoods since well before he became president mr trump s appetite for conflict has defined him as a public figure but in recent days he has practiced that approach with new intensity signaling both the depths of his election year distress and his determination to blast open a path to a second term even at the cost of further riling a country in deep anguish his electoral path has narrowed rapidly since the onset of the pandemic as the growth and prosperity theme of his campaign disintegrated in private mr trump has been plainly aggrieved at the loss of his central argument for re election they wiped out my economy he has said to aides according to people briefed on the remarks it is unclear whether he has been referring to china where the virus originated or health experts who have urged widespread lockdowns but his frustration and determination to place blame elsewhere have been emphatic ken goldstein a professor of politics at the university of san francisco said that mr trump and his campaign were going on the offensive in nasty ways in an attempt to shift the attention of the public away from him and onto other targets and ultimately onto mr biden if this election is about trump he probably loses mr goldstein said trump s only hope is to make the election about biden a number of republican operatives believe mr biden s advantage is soft and that his penchant for gaffes will at least make the race more competitive than it would otherwise be amid a pandemic and an incipient economic depression we have a very good story to tell on him and we ve got to do it said corry bliss a republican strategist of the negative narrative his party aims to generate about mr biden still mr trump s behavior has rattled even some supportive republicans who believe it is likely to backfire and possibly cost them the senate as well as the white house it has also further alarmed democrats who have long warned that mr trump would be willing to use every lever of presidential power and deploy even the most unscrupulous campaign tactics to capture a second term in many respects mr trump s approach to the 2020 election looks like a crude approximation of the way he waged the 2016 campaign against hillary clinton attacking her personal ethics often in false or exaggerated terms taking mrs clinton s admitted errors and distorting them with the help of online disinformation merchants and making wild claims about her physical health and mental capacity for the job given that the 2016 campaign the only one mr trump has ever run ended in a razor thin victory for him it is perhaps not surprising that the president would attempt a kind of sequel in 2020 but there are vitally important differences between 2016 and 2020 ones that amplify the risks involved both for mr trump and for the country he is vying to lead he is running against an opponent in mr biden who despite his vulnerabilities has not faced decades of personal vilification as mrs clinton did before running for president and unlike 2016 mr trump has a governing record to defend one that currently involves presiding over a pandemic that has claimed more than 80 000 american lives and he may not find it easy to change the subject with incendiary distractions yet with the responsibility to govern also comes great power and mr trump has instruments available to him in 2020 that he did not have as a candidate four years ago tools like a politically supportive attorney general a republican controlled senate determined to defend him and a vastly better financed campaign apparatus that has been constructed with the defining purpose of destroying his opponent s reputation his attacks over the last week on mr obama have showcased mr trump s persistent determination to weaponize those tools to bolster a favorite political narrative one that distorts the facts about mr flynn the president s former national security adviser in order to spin sinister implications about the previous administration but mr trump also appears to genuinely believe many of the conspiratorial claims he makes people close to him say and his anger at mr obama is informed less by political strategy than by an unbending and unsubstantiated belief that the former president was personally involved in a plot against him this weekend mr trump will huddle with some of his conservative allies in the house at camp david where they are expected to discuss the efforts entirely fruitless up to this point to prove mr obama was involved in a conspiracy of all mr trump s efforts this one may be among the least concerning to democrats given mr obama s strong popularity and the degree to which mr trump s claims of an obamagate scandal have been confined so far to the usual echo chambers of fox news and right wing social media as he did in 2016 mr trump is trying to force other outlets to cover the matter through repetition on his twitter feed democratic anxiety about the president s attacks on mr biden runs higher but in general mr biden s advisers have professed confidence that the severity of the country s problems will make it difficult for mr trump to retake control of the campaign and that mr biden s fundamental political strengths make him well positioned to survive a campaign of attempted character assassination on a conference call with reporters on friday mike donilon one of mr biden s closest advisers said mr trump was transparently engaged in an all out effort to take people away from what they re living through i think that s going to be real hard to do because the country has really been rocked mr donilon said and where the president has succeeded in the past in terms of throwing up lots of distractions and smoke screens and trying to move the debate to other questions i don t think he s going to succeed here the president has been grumbling about his own campaign and this week complained to allies that he had not significantly outraised mr biden in april according to a republican who spoke with mr trump still mr trump s political operation has moved over the last month to devise a plan for tearing down mr biden who does not inspire great enthusiasm in voters but is held in higher esteem by most than the incumbent president the result has been a blizzard of negative digital and television ads battering mr biden on a range of subjects in a way that suggests mr trump s advisers have not yet settled on a primary line of attack the campaign s ads on facebook are as relentless as they are varied as if plucked from a vintage trump rally rant some make unfounded inferences about mr biden s mental state saying geriatric health is no laughing matter others paint the presumptive democratic nominee as china s puppet by highlighting statements that mr biden made when he was vice president like china is not our enemy still others stick to traditional themes of illegal immigration over the last week the trump campaign has spent at least 880 000 on facebook ads attacking mr biden yet there are persistent doubts even within mr trump s political circle that an overwhelmingly negative campaign can be successful in 2020 particularly when many voters are likely to be looking for a combination of optimism empathy and steady leadership at a moment of crisis unlike any in living memory and the more mr trump lashes out at mr biden and others the more he may cement in place the reservations of voters who are accustomed to seeing presidents react with resolute calm in difficult situations private republican polling has shown mr trump slipping well behind mr biden in a number of key states perhaps just as troubling for mr trump it has raised questions about whether his efforts to tar mr biden are making any headway last month a poll commissioned by the republican national committee tested roughly 20 lines of attack against mr biden ranging from the private business activities of his son hunter biden to whether mr biden has lost a step a reference to mental acuity none of the lines of attack significantly moved voter sentiment according to two people briefed on the results there were some lines of attack that had potential one of the people briefed on the results said but they were more traditional republican broadsides about issues like taxes mr trump has also been warned by republican veterans that his efforts to define mr biden in negative terms so far have been slow or ineffective at a meeting with political advisers this week that included karl rove the top strategist for former president george w bush mr rove warned mr trump that he had fallen behind in the task of damaging mr biden people familiar with the meeting said part of the challenge though is that mr trump constantly undermines his own team s strategy in ways big and small while he finally stopped doing his daily press briefings after weeks of pleading from his allies he still makes comments on twitter or to reporters nearly every day that hand democrats fodder and make republicans squirm in addition to his attacks against mr obama he separated himself from the highly popular dr anthony fauci downplayed the importance of testing and has refused to wear a mask and mr trump s appetite for conspiracy theories is often embarrassing to his party several times in recent weeks he has falsely accused a prominent television host of murder and called for a cold case investigation the president also routinely misses even the political opportunities his advisers deliberately tee up for him when mr trump was visiting pennsylvania this week for instance his team scheduled a friendly interview in the hope that he would make the case that mr biden would undermine fracking an important industry in pennsylvania but mr trump made no mention of fracking and instead attacked mr biden s mental condition and called wind power a disaster that kills all the birds he s come back down because that s where his natural state is said terry nelson a republican strategist referring to mr trump s slide in the polls after a short lived bump in march because he s not in position to rally the country in a way a president traditionally would in a
