advertisement supported by chinese citizens are overcoming a lack of reporting on the crisis in the state run media by sharing their own videos and information about the coronavirus outbreak by daniel victor hong kong while china s state run media has urged calm and praised the official response to the coronavirus outbreak a different story is playing out across the country s tightly controlled social media networks in the digital world china s citizens are expressing panic and frustration they are overcoming a lack of reporting in the official media by sharing their own videos and information sometimes inaccurately some are even evading censors who commonly stifle criticism of the government to register complaints about how officials have handled the crisis they have criticized officials for failing to contain the initial outbreak in wuhan the capital of the central province of hubei for limiting residents to overcrowded facilities in the region and for not visiting the affected areas let s not interrupt the leaders while they listen to songs and go abroad for interviews one commenter wrote sarcastically though some barbs have slipped through the censors are still scrubbing material critical of the government or information deemed alarming it has detained at least eight people for spreading what the government has called rumors but residents are still using social networks and messaging platforms to offer on the ground accounts of the crisis that are difficult to find elsewhere users have shared experiences of waiting in lines at hospitals for hours shuttling sick loved ones from hospital to hospital only to be sent home without being tested for the coronavirus some videos like one taken on an unknown date at wuhan no 7 hospital have made their way from china s closed off internet onto networks like twitter several hospitals in affected cities have sent out pleas for donations online saying they were running short of surgical masks gloves and other supplies some health workers spoke of the challenge of getting to hospitals in cities where public transportation has been shut down and taxi services suspended videos circulating in chat groups and social networks show patients in wuhan being loaded into an ambulance by workers wearing full body protective suits outside a primary school or transported in a plastic tube in huizhou a city in the southeastern province of guangdong several videos have emerged of a patient being wheeled through an airport in a sealed off cage the videos often lack crucial identifying information including when they were filmed but many have spread rapidly in recent days among chinese internet users in the absence of more official information the state run media has largely played down the crisis focusing instead on the encouragement of government officials and the heroism of medical workers only a few news outlets have reported critically on the handling of the outbreak by the health care system and the government in the vacuum misinformation has flourished one article claimed to cite a health expert as recommending that people counter the virus by rinsing their mouths with salt water but the expert never said it and the tactic is ineffective another widely read but completely false post claimed that setting off fireworks would sterilize germs in the air updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities china s national health commission even went so far as to debunk popular reports saying that drinking a traditional chinese medicine herb known as indigowoad root mixed with smoked vinegar could prevent infection by the coronavirus still the digital networks have proven useful in conveying the human toll of the virus save my life doctor i have the fever too a woman in a mask wailed in a widely circulated video as hospital workers in protective suits walked in and out of what appeared to
