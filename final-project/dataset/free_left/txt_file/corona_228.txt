senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky was dead set against giving unrestricted funds to states and local governments in the covid 19 relief bill the senate passed tuesday instead he wants states to be able to declare bankruptcy which would mean pension plans government contractors union workers and a whole slew of other stakeholders would suffer he blithely declares after spending trillions of dollars on everything from airline bailouts to small business loans to enhanced employment that we shouldn t borrow to fund state and local governments he might want to check back with the folks in kentucky mcconnell s position is not only hypocritical but unsound and politically dumb state and local governments employ millions of people around the country if mcconnell wants to reopen the economy and stem unemployment the last thing he should do would be to let states and cities founder and institute painful cuts full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic many republicans find his position daft that may include president trump who purportedly told new york gov andrew m cuomo d on tuesday that he would support state and local funding in the next big funding bill republican sen rob portman ohio whose home state governor is also a republican objected the skyrocketing unemployment rate and subsequent decline in tax revenue has left local gov ts stretched to the limit as i told ohio s county commissioners on our call this morning i m working w my colleagues to secure additional and more flexible funding as a political matter the move is hugely damaging to republicans and house speaker nancy pelosi d calif knows it you will notice that she no longer talks about state funding she talks about money for our heroes during an msnbc interview on wednesday she explained that state and local funding means funding for the health care worker the police and fire the first responders the emergency services people the teachers in our schools the transportation workers she added again it is about the people and these people are risking their lives to help save other lives and now they are losing their jobs she will be calling it the heroes act pelosi confirmed that trump seems to favor such spending as well the president himself has even said he has tweeted out that he is ready to do state and local funding that he knows there has to be another bill and there are other measures that need to be addressed in that legislation it is going to be a major package treasury secretary steven mnuchin has also said the federal government will spend whatever it takes to recover from the coronavirus induced recession mcconnell s position therefore makes no practical or political sense it s the herbert hoover mentality all over again as though fiscal tightening is the antidote to recession it nevertheless is revealing of the ongoing contempt many republicans including many in the donor class have for good governance and active nimble government the position is entirely out of step with popular opinion that wants government action now americans who are still employed are fearful of losing their jobs and moreover are deeply sympathetic toward lifesaving first responders and other local government workers right now the opinions section is looking for stories of how the coronavirus has affected people of all walks of life write to us mcconnell as he did in the bill the senate passed tuesday has gotten into the habit of drawing lines in the sand only 250 billion for small business nothing else only to be outmaneuvered by the house and the administration he looks increasingly feckless and out of step even with his own party kentucky voters have an opportunity in november to make a change and elect someone who might actually fight for their state
