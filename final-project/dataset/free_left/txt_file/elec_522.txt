percent followed by senator marco rubio of florida at 10 percent the survey by one of iowa s most respected pollsters comes as mr trump is increasingly hoping that a win in iowa whose caucuses are less than eight weeks away will be a lightning strike on his way to the nomination if we win iowa i think we run the table mr trump said on friday at a rally in des moines he is far ahead in polls of the other early voting states but mr cruz s sudden momentum in iowa complicates mr trump s plan it could set up a protracted primary between mr cruz as the choice of far right republicans mr trump as an anti establishment outsider and perhaps a third candidate representing the center right of the party mr cruz gained 21 percentage points in two months since the last register poll he has visited the state almost weekly making the case that he is the answer to the right s long search for a conservative with unwavering principles and deep resources mr cruz was the top choice in the poll of evangelical christians 45 percent and tea party conservatives 39 percent the poll provided a snapshot of how conservative iowa s likely republican voters are nearly six in 10 say climate change is a hoax more than half want mass deportations of illegal immigrants six in 10 would abolish the internal revenue service with ample opportunities to see candidates up close iowans have distinct

paul of kentucky former gov mike huckabee of arkansas and gov chris christie of new jersey long locked in a mutual nonaggression pact mr cruz and mr trump have teetered on the brink of hostilities in recent days after studiously avoiding any public attacks on mr trump for fear of becoming a target of his derision mr cruz privately told donors on wednesday that mr trump had questionable judgment according to a recording of his remarks the comments came two days after mr trump proposed barring muslims from entering the united states as a way to combat terrorism mr cruz said he disagreed but did not criticize mr trump as others have in a series of twitter posts after his judgment comments became public mr cruz tried to play down any rift while mr trump moved toward escalation mr cruz wrote the establishment s only hope trump me in a cage match sorry to disappoint realdonaldtrump is terrific mr trump struck a different tone looks like tedcruz is getting ready to attack he wrote i am leading by so much he must i hope so he will fall like all others will be easy and in a speech in des moines on friday mr trump criticized mr cruz s opposition to federal support for ethanol an important state industry and in a more audacious attack he questioned mr cruz s faith and by the way i do like ted cruz he said but not a lot of evangelicals come out of cuba mr cruz whose father emigrated from cuba and is a fiery evangelical pastor has succeeded more than any other candidate in enlisting conservative christian support in iowa on thursday he won the endorsement of bob vander

the register poll even before it appeared singling out the newspaper the most influential in iowa during a customary interlude in which he attacks the news media i ll tell you you have one of the most dishonest right here in your backyard the des moines register is the worst he said to cheers and applause some reporter named jacobs she is the worst he said referring to the register s lead political reporter jennifer jacobs he accused the paper s polling which has consistently been among the most accurate in surveying iowa voters of being biased against him mr trump has railed against the register since the paper s editorial board called on him to quit the race in july because he has polluted the political waters the editorial board which endorsed mitt romney before the 2012 caucuses has not yet announced its preference for 2016 on friday mr trump promised to campaign aggressively in iowa as the feb 1 caucuses approach if i win iowa i think it s over he repeated mr trump s fear seems to be that if no candidate enters the republican convention in july with enough delegates to win it would trigger a stop trump movement with lower performing candidates throwing their support to one of his competitors he warned friday of bloodsucker politicians controlling the convention and also repeated his threat to run as an independent you ll know in a month or two whether the establishment is treating me favorably he said advertisement
