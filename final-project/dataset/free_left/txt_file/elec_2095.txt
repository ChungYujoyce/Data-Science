advertisement supported by transcript na by jonathan martin and patrick healy durham n h in a caustic debate on thursday night hillary clinton accused senator bernie sanders of leveling attacks by insinuation and innuendo against her integrity and her credentials as a progressive by portraying her as beholden to wealthy interests and corporations mrs clinton lobbing her harshest assault yet in their race for the democratic presidential nomination said months of criticism by mr sanders over her taking speaking fees from wall street banks amounted to a suggestion that she was corrupt or as she put it a very artful smear it was the sort of cutting remark she usually reserves for republicans and it drew boos from many in the audience at the university of new hampshire there is this attack that he is putting out which really comes down to anybody who took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought she said and i just absolutely reject that senator and i really don t think these attacks by insinuation and innuendo are worthy of you enough is enough if you ve got something to say say it directly mr sanders who largely kept his cool in the debate ignored the broadside and instead reiterated his familiar critique that a super pac supporting mrs clinton is funded in part by banks there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system mr sanders said it is undermining american democracy and it is allowing congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country the ferocity of mrs clinton s remarks in the debate was risky given that many voters including some democrats already have an unfavorable opinion of her she is also running far behind mr sanders in the polls leading up to tuesday s primary in new hampshire and her attacks while geared toward undercutting his popularity here might backfire with some undecided voters who have positive feelings about mr sanders mrs clinton appearing tense and even angry at times was particularly sensitive about receiving millions of dollars in speaking fees including 675 000 for three speeches from goldman sachs she downplayed her turn on the lecture circuit noting that she had also addressed other groups such as the american camping association and that the banks merely wanted to hear her views on world affairs transcript na but she did acknowledge that she had not done the job i should in explaining my record about financial regulation suggesting that is why she had been unable to beat back questions about her speaking fees yet when asked if she would release all the transcripts of her speeches to banks she hedged i will look into it she said i don t know the status but i will certainly look into it from its opening moments the debate devolved into a series of searing exchanges over one overarching theme which of the two democrats was the most progressive an issue that they have been fighting over in recent days as they compete in new hampshire on one level the debate was over semantics the candidates share a similar worldview about aggressive government support for universal health care public education and aid to the poor and both of them used the word rigged to describe the american economy but they kept putting their own personal spin on the word progressive with mrs clinton deriding mr sanders as the self proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism and accusing him of judging her unfairly rebutting mr sanders s claim that she is a political moderate mrs clinton sought to align herself with some of the most popular names in democratic politics to suggest that mr sanders was impugning them not just her with what she described as a purity test the root of that word progressive is progress but i ve heard senator sanders s comments and it s really caused me to wonder who s left in the progressive wing of the democratic party mrs clinton said under his definition president obama is not progressive because he took donations from wall street mr sanders asked if president obama was a progressive at first did not answer the question instead bringing up a comment by mrs clinton when she called herself a moderate but he ultimately took on the question do i think president obama is a progressive yeah i do mr sanders said i disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement but yes i think he has done an excellent job mrs clinton who is leading in national polls and narrowly won the iowa caucuses on monday departed from the approach she used at democratic forums late last year when she largely ignored mr sanders and focused her fire on republicans on thursday though there was only a fleeting mention of donald j trump as she went after mr sanders with an intensity that reflected a nomination fight worthy of the name she portrayed herself as a veteran of the country s political wars who is better equipped to enact a progressive agenda than her more uncompromising rival it was not a message likely to resonate among mr sanders s idealistic young legions in new hampshire but it presaged the one she is likely to carry when the primary moves to nevada and south carolina more moderate states later this month the new york times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign the debate was the first to feature only mrs clinton and mr sanders and the narrower aperture revealed significant differences mrs clinton seemed more tense at times in their rapid fire exchanges mr sanders seemed surprised at times by the level of mrs clinton s vitriol but it never threw him off his central message millions of americans are giving up on the political process and they re giving up on the political process because they understand that the economy is rigged he said he zeroed in on wealthy americans and wall street firms giving huge sums of money to candidates an implicit criticism of mrs clinton though he did not say her by name mr sanders twice let opportunities go by when he could have pressed mrs clinton on her taking speaking fees from banks instead he ignored her and presented his own well honed lecture about what he described as a corrupt system in which the financial institutions have outsize political influence and are treated with kid gloves when they break the law one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk but walk the walk he said we have raised 3 5 million individual contributions averaging 27 dollars apiece that is what the political revolution means mrs clinton repeatedly tried to frame mr sanders as a politician who has had ambitious ideas for decades but little to show for it the numbers just don t add up from what senator sanders is proposing mrs clinton said a progressive is someone who makes progress that s what i intend to do mr sanders dismissed the idea that his record in congress showed he was unable to enact major changes well i haven t quite run for president before he said while their disagreements were more muted the two also clashed over foreign policy and once again it was mrs clinton going on the offensive she suggested the senator was na ve for wanting to insert iranian troops into syria and suggested he would be too hasty to normalize relations with the government of iran you are voting for both a president and a commander in chief she said speaking directly to voters mr sanders responded by invoking her 2002 vote to authorize the iraq war to question her judgment and recalled that in the 2008 democratic primary she had called mr obama na ve because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies mrs clinton asked if mr sanders could win the general election said she had great respect for the sanders campaign but believed he would face the most withering onslaught from republicans she then tacitly suggested that mr sanders s left wing views would not be popular in some states in november it will put the nominee into the spotlight she said i ve been vetted there s hardly anything you don t know about me mrs clinton said she was 100 percent confident that she did not face any legal threat from the federal investigations into her use of a private email server as secretary of state mr sanders in turn said he would stand by his past pledges not to politicize the issue the biting exchanges at the start of the debate though seemed long gone as the forum concluded if i m so fortunate as to be the nominee the first person i will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be senator sanders mrs clinton said mr sanders returned the peace offering noting that campaigns can get out of hand but he said he respected mrs clinton and that their shared views were far superior to those held by republicans this prompted broad smiles from them both an impromptu handshake and a loud ovation from appreciative democrats in the audience advertisement
