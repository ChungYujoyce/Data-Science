the following is a transcript of an interview with dr anthony fauci that aired sunday march 15 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan and we ve just learned that the uk is now advising against non essential travel to the us we turn now to dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at nih dr fauci thank you for making time i know you re quite busy you said this week we are not at the peak dr anthony fauci right margaret brennan and this is going to get worse how much worse dr fauci yeah margaret brennan what are the numbers dr fauci well i can t give you numbers because it s really going to depend on the effectiveness of our response and our response i mean if you just leave the virus to its own devices it will go way up like we ve seen in italy that s not going to happen if we do what we re attempting to do and are doing and that s margaret brennan how do we get ahead of it dr fauci well the way you get ahead of it is that as as i try to explain to people that i want people to assume that i m over or that we are overreacting because if it looks like you re overreacting you re probably doing the right thing because we know from china from south korea from italy that what the virus does it goes percolates along and then it takes off so what we ve got to do is a couple of things and we re doing it one is preventing new infections from coming in hence the travel restriction and the other is doing containment and mitigation within the country and it is correct that the infections are going to go up our job is to make sure it doesn t do the maximum peak and actually blunts within that blunt there will be many new infections we want to make sure we don t get to that really bad peak margaret brennan and american s lives have changed dramatically dr fauci right margaret brennan in the week we just went through and they re going to continue to change people aren t supposed to be visiting nursing homes dr fauci right margaret brennan people are being told to work from home schools are shutting down dr fauci right margaret brennan give us the reality check though what is the mortality rate and what is the recovery rate dr fauci right well the issue is if you look historically right now in the united states we re collecting data looks similar to what we ve seen in some other places if you look at the totality china dominated that previously the mortality was about three percent okay that s quite high for any kind of respiratory disease if you look at the other countries it s somewhat less if you count all the people who are getting infected and are not being counted because they re not coming to the attention of a healthcare provider then mortality will likely come down to somewhere around one percent or less but even that is serious and that s why we ve got to take this seriously because if you look at the typical seasonal flu it s 0 1 percent so this is a virus that transmits readily it s a virus that has a high degree of morbidity and mortality and that s the reason we ve got to do all of our forces now if you look at the recovery rate the recovery rate is minus what the mortality is so if if the mortality is one percent it s 99 percent recovery rate if the mortality is even less overwhelmingly more people recover from this than get into serious trouble there s no doubt about that but we want to make sure that we not only decrease the rate of infection we protect the vulnerable people who are within that percentage that have a much higher degree of morbidity and mortality margaret brennan the president indicated that he is looking at travel restrictions including dr fauci right right margaret brennan within the country should americans get on a plane right now dr fauci well it depends on what the reason for getting on the plane anything that s to my mind particularly if you are a person who s elderly or who falls within the category of underlying conditions you should really think twice before putting yourself in a situation where you re in a crowded place for an extended period of time margaret brennan you wouldn t get on a plane dr fauci right now me for there are a number of reasons why i wouldn t get on a plane but if i were not doing the job that i m doing because of my age i would very seriously think about not doing any travel like that margaret brennan should americans get up and go to the office tomorrow dr fauci well you know it depends on the situation that you re in to the extent possible teleworking should be done to the extent that you could do it i mean there are some jobs you can t telework let s be real but if you can you should you should avoid crowded places and then that s the things that we ve been talking about all along right now the cdc has a nice website you go in you talk about the different kinds of mitigations at different levels of involvement margaret brennan don t go to crowded places france is trying to close down restaurants dr fauci right margaret brennan and cafes and bars dr fauci exactly yeah margaret brennan should that happen here in the united states dr fauci you know every single day we meet with the task force and we take a look at what s going on and you don t want to make a pronouncement that no one should ever go into a restaurant i mean i think that might be overkill right now but everything is on the table it may come to the situation where we strongly recommend right now myself personally i wouldn t go to a restaurant i just wouldn t because i don t want to be in a crowded place i have an important job to do i don t want to be in a situation where i m going to be all of a sudden self isolating for 14 days margaret brennan for those americans who are now returning from europe how do we make sure that that doesn t allow for further spread dr fauci yeah margaret brennan how do you screen them dr fauci you know i think the issue is if you look at what s happening now for people who are coming back from like the european countries when they get back in here they re having en enhanced screening when they come back margaret brennan what does that mean taking their temperature dr fauci well no actually just looking at them seeing if they re sick giving them a piece of paper here s a telephone number here s what you need to watch out for watch out for these symptoms and importantly 14 days of self isolation if you come from one of those countries that are on that list margaret brennan period dr fauci period you come back 14 day of voluntary self isolation margaret brennan now the federal government could invoke authorities to do things like quarantine dr fauci right margaret brennan for places that are hotspots like new rochelle dr fauci right margaret brennan like seattle dr fauci right margaret brennan would you like to see that dr fauci well it depends on the individual circumstance the problem margaret with my making a pronouncement what should be done you ve got to look at what the situation is at the local level i mean for example in new york city in in new rochelle it s a very difficult situation up there so governor cuomo made some important decisions which in my mind looking at what he did were the right decisions margaret brennan the american college of surgeons has told hospitals that they need to prepare to cancel particularly elective surgeries dr fauci right right margaret brennan that implies that hospitals are about to get overwhelmed dr fauci right yeah margaret brennan do we have the hospital capacity to deal with what is coming dr fauci right margaret brennan and if we don t what is the plan dr fauci okay margaret brennan is it to use military hospitals dr fauci well well first of all again you ve got to look at what the the bracket is of the possibility if in a worst case scenario and i don t want to scare people that you always got to consider there s a worst case scenario there s a best case scenario and there s something in the middle we re doing everything we can to not allow that worst case scenario to happen if it happens which i don t think it will because i i can see the effort that we re putting in margaret brennan you don t think hospitals will be overwhelmed dr fauci no no i don t say that i say it s possible that they could be but when you say that people get frightened but concentrate on what you can do to not make that happen but if in fact there s a scenario that s very severe it is conceivable that will happen and that s the reason why you have things like the strategic national stockpile for for ventilators and things like that margaret brennan there s concern about shortages of key supplies like that ventilators dr fauci we we margaret brennan cotton swabs dr fauci margaret we would be unrealistic if we were not concerned that that possibility exists what we need to do is to margaret brennan but can you reassure the public that there is planning for those eventualities dr fauci there is absolutely margaret brennan i know you re saying it s the worst case dr fauci planning there s absolute 100 percent take that to the bank there s planning to address that but we would be unrealistic to not pay attention to the possibility that it could happen margaret brennan so millions of children across this country are looking at the possibility of not being able to go to school for at least a few weeks dr fauci right margaret brennan possibly longer dr fauci right margaret brennan their parents are going to try to figure out what to do with them dr fauci right right margaret brennan can they take them to playgrounds is that safe dr fauci well you know it depends if you have a bunch of kids in the playground i don t think it s a good idea to congregate anybody anywhere to the extent that you margaret brennan of any age period dr fauci yes of course yes margaret brennan because there is that perception that if you re younger dr fauci no margaret brennan you re not as dr fauci well margaret brennan at risk fauci yes indeed but if a if a young individual a child gets infected they may do perfectly well from a physical standpoint but they may bring it home to a person who is susceptible so we can t discount the the issue of children need also to follow certain of these rules margaret brennan so if i were standing next to someone who was later diagnosed with the coronavirus dr fauci right margaret brennan what do i do do i have to wait until i m exhibiting symptoms actually ill dr fauci yeah margaret brennan before i can get a test dr fauci no right now if you feel if you are in a high risk situation and remember just being in the room you know six feet apart or whatever from someone margaret brennan sitting having dinner dr fauci yeah margaret brennan shaking hands dr fauci well see dinner is different it depends if you re having dinner for multiple hours with someone who has symptoms and finds out that that person is sick that puts you at a higher risk that s something that you really need to essentially hunker down get a physician call them up get instructions of what to do if you walk into a room and you find out three days later that somebody in that room was infected and was asymptomatic when they were infected your risk is very low very low margaret brennan and in the circumstance i need that test dr fauci right margaret brennan when will it be available i know you ve made the point it s not just shipping them out it s getting them operational dr fauci exactly margaret brennan how long before that happens dr fauci you know i would hope based on what we ve heard from the ceos of the companies that are now getting involved that they re going to be getting those tests out there in an easy way not only to be out there but to actually get them quite soon they re talking within a several days to a week to start to see it rev up margaret brennan so that means testing within several days or a week dr fauci right but that doesn t mean you re going to be maximum because nothing goes from zero to maximum so if the companies are going to get involved the laboratory groups that do this for a living when they get involved it s going to go like this so that you re going to start seeing tests more and more available until pretty soon they re gonna be quite available but in the next day or so you re going to find people are going to say you know i wanted to get a test and i couldn t get it that s gonna happen but the future as opposed to looking back the future is going to be like this as opposed to the inhibitions we ve seen before margaret brennan several days or a week dr fauci you know again margaret brennan that s your time frame dr fauci the problem with the pinning down the days margaret brennan right dr fauci it s gonna be gotcha if you don t have it margaret brennan well no we we we hear from a lot of viewers on twitter and elsewhere saying they re concerned about being able to get this dr fauci and they should be concerned but what we can say that now that we have the private sector involved we re going to see an entirely different scene than we ve seen the weeks previously for sure margaret brennan dr fauci thank you for your time dr fauci good to be with you margaret brennan and we will be back in a moment
