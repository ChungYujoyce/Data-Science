as the novel coronavirus pandemic brought business to a halt the pain rippled outward blowing up sector after sector according to a detailed analysis of unemployment claims no industry was left untouched after that first chaotic week of lockdowns mid march as officials scrambled to slow the spread of the deadliest pandemic in more than a century restaurants and theaters saw job losses slow while losses in other sectors such as construction and supply chain work accelerated now it appears the economic upheaval is hitting professional and public sector jobs that some once regarded as safe 3 8 million americans sought jobless benefits last week extending pandemic s grip on the national workforce the labor department doesn t release jobless claims by industry so building on the work of economist ben zipperer and his colleagues at the economic policy institute we analyzed industry specific new unemployment benefit claims from 15 states that publish them for a full list see the charts below mass layoffs begin in cities and states amid coronavirus fallout threatening education sanitation health and safety by looking at claims for the past five weeks as a share of each industry s employment we see who has been hit hardest more than 1 in 4 food service workers filed for unemployment from march 15 through april 18 but that doesn t tell us as much about how the pandemic labor market evolved from one week to the next for that we need to focus in on the weekly changes in jobless claims to distinguish between industries where claims are falling and those where claims are steady or increasing the data can also help us estimate how the labor market will change in coming months highest week to week change included accommodation and food services arts entertainment and recreation hairdressers auto mechanics and laundry workers the first week of closures slammed headfirst into industries that require the most face to face customer contact america s hospitality sector more than 7 percent of all restaurant hotel and bar workers filed for unemployment in this first week alone for public officials looking to enforce social distancing bars hotels and movie theaters were obvious targets they re discretionary spending and require significant human interaction another category which the government calls other services but is primarily made up of hairdressers auto mechanics and laundry workers also suffered swift and significant losses the number of newly unemployed filers in all these high contact industries fell off in subsequent weeks but they remain the biggest casualties of the crisis and unemployment claims probably understate the pain of lower earning americans low wage workers often don t qualify for benefits because they haven t spent enough time on the job or aren t being paid enough zipperer said a survey released tuesday by zipperer and his colleague elise gould implies unemployment numbers may be significantly worse than government statistics show for every 10 people who successfully applied for unemployment benefits during the crisis they show another three or four couldn t get through the overloaded system and two more didn t even apply because the system is too difficult highest week to week change included manufacturing construction retail by the second week the shutdown moved from businesses where the primary danger is interacting with customers to those like construction and manufacturing that require in person interaction with large crews of colleagues on march 26 for example spokane wash area custom cabinet maker huntwood industries laid off around 500 employees according to thomas clouse of the spokesman review as a manufacturer whose sales depend on the construction industry it was hit doubly hard by the shutdowns it is a scary time amy ohms 37 told clouse it s kind of unfair i think construction is essential there is a lot of uncertainty as they rushed to maintain u s meat supply big processors saw plants become covid 19 hot spots worker illnesses spike manufacturers were among the first publicly traded companies to note travel and supply chain risks related to the coronavirus outbreak in china in financial filings according to a separate analysis by oxford researchers fabian stephany and fabian braesemann and collaborators in berlin by march manufacturers were noting domestic production issues their analysis also shows that in the middle of march concern about the coronavirus and its disease covid 19 from retail corporations eclipsed that of manufacturers indeed retail struggled mightily in the second week of the crisis more workers were told to stay home and folks realized foot traffic was often incompatible with social distancing the retail sector wasn t hit as quickly or as forcefully as food services or entertainment presumably because the sector includes grocery stores and others who employ workers who were deemed essential highest week to week change included wholesale trade retail trade janitors landscapers laborers and security guards in the third week the pain worked its way up the supply chain as wholesale trade a sector that includes some sales representatives truck drivers and freight laborers got slammed in theory the lockdowns created near perfect trucking conditions traffic vanished diesel keeps getting cheaper and the roads are safer than they have been in decades only one problem there s not much to haul right now don hayden president of louisville trucking firm m m cartage feared he would have to lay off about 70 percent of his 400 employees drivers mechanics and office staff in early april orders from his customers in heavy manufacturing evaporated but just in time he got a payroll protection program loan through his local bank he was shocked at how rapidly his loan was approved and the money arrived and he said the treasury department had done an outstanding job we re good through may and into june he said we have a good workforce we re proud of them we sure would like to retain them at this point in the crisis the focus shifted from huge industry eviscerating swings in jobless numbers to gradual weekly trends that help us guess where the jobless claims will settle in the weeks and months to come as industries fall like dominoes policymakers need to realize the damage isn t contained to a few specific sectors said university of tennessee economist marianne wanamaker a former member of trump s council of economic advisers she said there may be a temptation to extend benefits for difficult to reopen industries such as food service and hospitality but it doesn t comport with the data because the damage is so widespread it s not fair to say hotel and restaurant workers you get these really generous packages and everybody else has to go back to work highest week to week change included management finance and insurance public administration white collar industries have been shedding jobs since mid march albeit at a much lower rate than lower income sectors but as losses in low income sectors subsided white collar jobless claims stayed flat or even intensified by week four categories that contain managers bookkeepers insurance agents and bank tellers saw some of the worst weekly trends of any sector on april 9 the online review site yelp laid off 1 000 workers and furloughed 1 100 more about a third of its workforce as traffic on the site plunged while businesses were locked down the physical distancing measures and shelter in place orders while critical to flatten the curve have dealt a devastating blow to the local businesses that are core to our mission ceo jeremy stoppelman wrote at the time jane oates president of the employment focused nonprofit organization workingnation used to oversee the labor department wing that coordinates unemployment claims and training the big difference between coronavirus and the great recession is that this has completely stopped the economy across so many sectors she said during the great recession she and her team had the luxury of flooding support into areas that were being hit hardest in a particular week or month they went from state to state and industry to industry putting out fires as they arose the labor department can t address individual problems like that during the coronavirus recession she said because everybody s getting shellacked simultaneously highest week to week change included oil gas and mining utilities public administration in the week ending april 18 the most recent for which we have data we can no longer avoid one of the most ominous trends in the entire analysis a rise in public sector layoffs utilities public administration and education services all of which have close implicit or explicit ties to state and local government were among the worst faring sectors on a weekly basis to stem the tide of what could be millions of job losses and furloughs the national league of cities is pushing for a 250 billion bailout of cities throughout the country colleague tony romm reports in broomfield colo a denver area suburb of about 70 000 residents 235 city and county employees were furloughed on april 22 according to jennifer rios in the broomfield enterprise the impact of the covid 19 coronavirus is more significant than any of us could have ever expected for our well being as well as our municipal financial stability rios reports that officials wrote in a letter to furloughed employees state and local governments are typically required to balance their budgets now that they re staring down the barrel of a huge tax revenue shortfall these revenue losses are going to cause government budgets to fall and they re going to lay people off zipperer said you re seeing the beginnings of a big contraction in the public sector he said that s going to be the next huge thing the public sector used to be the bulwark that kept the economy going while the private sector pulled back during a recession zipperer said over the last couple of recessions the public sector hasn t played that traditional role zipperer said as a result we ve seen steeper
