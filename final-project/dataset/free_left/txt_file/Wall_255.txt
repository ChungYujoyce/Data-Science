diary writers in lockdown are like everyone else feeling pale and postoperative the pandemic has thrown a spanner into best laid plans a diary as soldiers prisoners and invalids have long understood can be a good way to write oneself out of a bad spot the chinese novelist fang fang lives in downtown wuhan the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak after that city went into quarantine in january she began keeping an online diary about her experience wuhan remained shut down for 76 days and is still struggling to return to anything resembling normalcy in her diary fang fang wrote about quotidian things food pets sleep friends she talked about weeping and about her country s mental health her diary provided a daily catharsis she monitored newspapers and the internet keeping tabs on what was happening outside her small housing project she told uncomfortable truths about china s fumbling response to the outbreak of the coronavirus censors regularly squelched her chinese nationalists mounted a trolling campaign against her claiming she was besmirching wuhan s rosy cheeked image her entries began to seem like samizdat she kept at her task she gradually became a national hero read by millions starving for something other than the dissembling and patriotic gruel issued by the government and by chinese media conglomerates her diary has now been published in english as an e book wuhan diary dispatches from a quarantined city fang fang captures the shock and panic at the start of the quarantine people in wuhan had been told that the coronavirus was not contagious between people that it was easily controllable and not to worry the truth hit hard the author is in her mid 60s and lives alone with her old and increasingly stinky dog when she runs out of pet food she feeds her dog rice instead she takes the quarantine seriously she has diabetes and is aware the virus could kill her she finds much to admire in people s response to the shutdown neighbors form grocery collectives when the food arrives they lower buckets from their apartment windows and reel it up as if it were minnows in a net she notes the performance of many small kindnesses she has a fascination with the eerie empty city which is quiet and beautiful almost majestic as long as you aren t sick watching the sanitation workers stoically going about their tasks fills her with emotion at the same time she writes you begin to see things you never imagined humans were capable of with hospitals full the sick wander the streets looking for help some of those trapped in wuhan from elsewhere end up living in tunnels forgotten old people subsist on their remaining crackers with borders quickly shut and travel not permitted there are diasporas within diasporas she zeros in on dark scenes she is horrified to see a photograph of a pile of cellphones on the floor of a funeral home their owners have been quickly cremated she writes about the now infamous huanan seafood wholesale market which has been linked to the start of the outbreak after the market was abandoned some fish were left behind she writes and they started to emit a wretched stench there were more than a thousand vendors at the market she writes and nearly all ran legitimate businesses she notes that they are victims too i wonder what the site of the market will become in the future she writes some people have suggested turning it into a memorial hall dedicated to this calamity fang fang discusses chinese versus western medicine because she is plugged into the cultural and academic worlds in wuhan there is a roll call of the deaths of many well known artists journalists and professors there is an interesting sense in this diary of an intellectual proletariat she talks about rumors that the novels of mario vargas llosa have been banned because of an essay he wrote about the virus she is alert to rumor painted full of tongues as shakespeare understood and conspiracy theories she watches as this virus continues to roam the city like an evil spirit appearing whenever and wherever it pleases she studies the way boredom and terror not a combination humans are accustomed to mingle and ferment her world has dwindled to the size of her tiny living space this is an important and dignified book that nonetheless in this adept translation by michael barry has its share of dead space and repetition wuhan diary would have been twice as good at half the length it s a bit easier to praise as tom wolfe said of the william shawn era new yorker than it is to read still the urgency of this account is impossible to deny this book is most scorching in fang fang s calls to hold to account the leaders who downgraded and minimized the virus wasting nearly three weeks and allowing it to seep into the world at large she rallies around this topic like henry v pacing the floorboards before the battle of agincourt she may live meekly during the lockdown but she writes bold sentences she wants chinese culture to change for people to be more willing to admit error to stand up and take blame we are all aching for the opportunity to really let someone have it she writes actually unloading all our anger on someone or something would be a productive psychological outlet for most of us my daughter once asked her 99 year old grandfather what his secret to a long life was his response eat a lot of fatty meat don t exercise and be sure to curse out anyone who deserves it the society needs to pass a kidney stone what advice does wuhan diary have for a world emerging from lockdown what the virus most craves fang fang writes is for more people to start venturing outside she also writes there has to be a way forward that no one has come up with yet
