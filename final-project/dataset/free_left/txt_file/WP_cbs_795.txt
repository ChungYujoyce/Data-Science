doctors and nurses confronting the expanding coronavirus pandemic say getting basic protective equipment such as masks and gowns and life saving equipment such as ventilators remains a big concern by monday there were more than 35 000 reported cases of covid 19 in the u s more than 470 people had died on cbs this morning monday the u s surgeon general dr jerome adams a member of the white house coronavirus task force said i didn t expect to be starting off my week with such a dire message for america but the numbers are going to get worse this week things are going to get worse before they get better and we really need everyone to understand this is serious to lean into what they can do to flatten the curve with regard to the warnings from health officials and governors to the trump administration that shortages of critical medical supplies will be catastrophic dr adams said i m getting those calls every minute of the day i got calls from people literally while i was sitting here waiting to talk to you i want the health care workers of america to understand these are my colleagues these are my friends and i will not rest until you all have the tools you need to keep yourselves safe but why is this so difficult asked co host gayle king pointing out the frustration felt towards the federal government in getting supplies to health care workers the national stockpile purchases one tenth of 1 of all the medical supplies in this country the rest of it is in the market said dr adams we are using the stockpile through fema which has been activated to level 1 to send out supplies there are supplies going out to the places most at need washington california new york we have the military out on the ground in several of these places we sent out cdc teams to provide backup we ve worked with the american society of anesthesiologists to identify 70 000 ventilators that are in the or that can be converted so supplies are going out we know that they re not going out fast enough to keep pace with the demand dr adams reiterated the government s message 15 days to stop the spread asking americans to practice social distancing in a dramatic way we can t ventilate our way out of this problem he said we need to make sure that in addition to getting supplies to people that we re really focusing on getting people out of the streets stay at home he said co host anthony mason asked the president signed the defense production act he can essentially order companies to manufacture these supplies that medical professionals so desperately need at this point why isn t the government doing that the government is using the defense production act to get people to the table he replied we ve worked with 3m we ve worked with honeywell they are already at mass production here s the thing people don t understand you don t need to compel someone to do something that they are already doing every single day there are people saying do we need to compel someone let s make the call okay they re already at max production they re already working around the clock and again we are using the stockpile and fema to get resources out to people who need it we re finding new and innovative people who are stepping up and volunteering like hanes you would never have thought that hanes would produce surgical masks co host tony dokoupil asked we re hearing reports of shortages on personal protective equipment and you re saying we re at mass production does that mean shortages are just going to be the way it is we know there are going to be shortages in some areas dr adams said it s why i wrote an op ed calling on people to stop elective surgeries we need to make sure the supplies are getting to new york to california to washington to the places they need them and they can t get there if people are out doing elective procedures we want to be strategically moving the personal equipment and supplies to where it is most needed and that s both increasing supply and driving down demand on sunday president trump tweeted about the government s 15 day recommendations for social distancing as a means to halt the spread of the virus saying we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself at the end of the 15 day period we will make a decision as to which way we want to go this economic shutdown is very painful for people said dokoupil from a medical perspective realistically is there any chance that at the end of this 15 day period we re going to go back to anything like normal we know it s going to be a while before life gets back to normal dr adams said here s what i want america to know we don t want to wait for 15 days we don t want to wait another day i m driving in d c and seeing people out all over the place getting ready for cherry blossoms you look on the news and you see people still at beaches we don t have a day to waste what we need to do is focus on today this hour right now when asked how far away america is from experiencing a peak in cases dr adams said when you look at the china data they were able to hit their peak and come back down in about six to eight weeks you look at the italy data they re still going up so we are somewhere between the two it s going to be up to everyone coming together to determine whether our curve bends in the direction of china in six to eight weeks or whether it bends toward italy unfortunately we re seeing new york is approaching italy the numbers that you see of cases reflect what happened two weeks ago too many people are waiting too long to really take this 15 days to stop the spread initiative seriously dokoupil asked china didn t have a 15 days to stop the spread voluntary restrictions they were much more draconian than that are you saying we need more stringent recommendations in order to halt the spread of the virus dr adams replied we have a system of federalism the governors are in charge of determining what s appropriate for their states we ve worked well with many of the governors most of the governors if you aren t seeing cases now now is the time you need to be making sure you re doing the things so that you don t become the next new york or the next italy visit thecenters for disease control and prevention websitefor detailed information on coronavirus treatment and prevention david morgan is a
