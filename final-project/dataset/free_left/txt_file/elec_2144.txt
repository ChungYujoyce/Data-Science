 congress republicans fear the conservative firebrand accused of sexual misconduct will cost them a crucial senate seat by burgess everett 06 20 2019 04 42 pm edt updated 06 20 2019 05 15 pm edt republicans are promising to do everything they can to obliterate roy moore in the alabama senate primary a push is underway to get president donald trump involved in derailing moore republicans are actively moving to recruit jeff sessions to run for his old seat and gop leaders are warning the party will jeopardize perhaps its only chance at picking up a senate seat next year if they let democrat doug jones get his favored match up advertisement there will be a lot of efforts made to ensure that we have a nominee other than him and one who can win in november said senate majority whip john thune r s d he s already proven he can t added senate majority leader mitch mcconnell we ll be opposing roy moore vigorously moore famously lost to jones in 2017 after the alabama republican was besieged by sexual misconduct allegations from his past and he lost the support of key gop officials his reemergence as a candidate thursday evoked palpable disgust among republican senators as it dawned on them they will have to confront him once again before he potentially costs them another seat give me a break this place has enough creepy old men said sen martha mcsally r ariz referring to washington when asked about moore s candidacy the people of alabama are smarter than that said sen cory gardner r colo who as leader of the party s campaign arm at the time vowed to try and expel moore from the senate if he won they certainly didn t choose him last time why would they choose him this time a moore candidacy could harm republicans national brand if he catches fire again and incumbents running in purple states like gardner and mcsally are loath to find themselves tied to him and facing a tougher 2020 map with several battleground seats in play republicans are eager to beat jones and cushion their majority if republicans do defeat jones that would require democrats to pick up a minimum of four seats elsewhere to take the senate alabama should be an easy pickup for republicans given the state s bright red hue and trump s popularity which is why moore s new run is causing such alarm in the gop you think it s been divisive before it gets really divisive on the other side jones said of moore s senate bid moore defeated former sen luther strange r ala in 2017 despite significant support from the party establishment doug jones greets supporters after defeating roy moore at the sheraton hotel on december 12 2017 in birmingham alabama justin sullivan getty images sen tim scott r s c has talked to sessions about running for his old seat which he left to become attorney general for trump sessions did not indicate to him whether he will run but republicans said privately that the four term senator could face his own problems as a candidate given trump s antipathy for sessions service in his administration sessions suggested last year in an interview with politico that he was done with politics raising doubts that he would try and take on moore if sessions runs i think he would dominate the field now i don t know if he ll run he hasn t said he wouldn t run said sen richard shelby r ala i would oppose roy moore i will not be by myself i hope i think alabama can do better than that rep bradley byrne r ala and former auburn coach tommy tuberville are already in the race and rep gary palmer r ala is considering it but that crowded field could easily play to moore s advantage given his past popularity with the state s most conservative voters what s more moore also could conceivably win a general election with trump atop the ticket a nightmare for the senate gop that would then have to deal with a bomb thrower in the caucus the president and his son donald trump jr have already expressed their dissatisfaction with moore s run trump tweeted last month that moore cannot win and trump jr tweeted thursday that roy moore is going against my father and he s doing a disservice to all conservatives across the country in the process the people of alabama rejected roy moore just a few months ago and i don t see that anything has changed said sen todd young r ind chairman of the national republican senatorial committee yet moore has been unbowed by that criticism seeking to run once against as an outsider against the establishment republicans largely pulled their support from his bid after the sexual misconduct allegations were reported by the washington post leaving moore adrift in a race that should have been an easy gop hold the people of alabama rejected roy moore just a few months ago and i don t see that anything has changed said gop sen todd young zach gibson getty images on thursday moore called out young for opposing his candidacy and slammed both the nrsc and the senate leadership fund an outside group that spent heavily against moore in 2017 he accused the nrsc of running a smear campaign and bashed shelby for doubting his viability why such a hatred and opposition to somebody running why does mere mention of my name cause people just to get up in arms in washington d c moore said at a news conference thursday that combative stance is leading some republicans to suggest trump may have to do more because otherwise we probably lose the seat said sen john cornyn r texas i m concerned cornyn said if president trump came out forcefully against him that would certainly make it more likely that somebody else will get nominated yet republicans are also wary of doing anything that could repeat the debacle of 2017 when support from senate republicans seemed to weigh on strange and give moore an opening in the primary the senate leadership fund is not yet vowing to spend in the race waiting to see if his candidacy will fall apart on its own and senators said they need to have a lighter touch this time around to stop moore from succeed we will do everything we can to stop him but we need to be careful about that said one republican senator we have to be more elegant james
