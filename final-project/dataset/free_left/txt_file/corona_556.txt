sometime in november or december a novel coronavirus infected a person in wuhan china leading to an outbreak that became a global pandemic and exposed huge weaknesses in governance and leadership in the case of china the weakness was the system a closed authoritarian government repeatedly deceived and covered up the truth as the virus spread it is wrong to accuse china based on present evidence of willfully releasing a plague on the world it is right to point out that china s system and its deceptions made the situation worse and the proper remedy would be more transparency and full disclosure full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic the novel coronavirus probably went through natural selection a series of mutations that gave it the ability to infect and spread among humans it could have evolved in animals or after making the leap to people studies show that the genetic material in the current virus is an 82percent match for the earlier sars virus another type of coronavirus found in bats is an 89 percent match some but not all of the early victims had visited a wuhan seafood market where live animals were also sold a so called wet market a more troubling explanation is that the coronavirus was inadvertently spread from the wuhan institute of virology which had carried out research on bat coronaviruses and possessed a biosafety level 4 facility the most secure for handling highly pathogenic and infectious diseases it is not beyond possibility that an accident or spill occurred most experts say there is no evidence that china deliberately engineered the virus as a weapon enough of that conspiracy talk but whether the source was an animal or an inadvertent spill more investigation is needed china ought to be absolutely transparent about what it finds after the 2002 2003 sars disaster in which the spreading infection was concealed china put in place an infectious disease reporting system that was supposedly immune from meddling the information would go straight to beijing but when unusual cases of illness that looked like pneumonia began to accumulate in wuhan in december the system broke down sign up for our coronavirus updates newsletter to track the outbreak all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access local officials attempted to clamp down on information when eight doctors in the city expressed concern about the new sickness they were reprimanded for spreading rumors one of them liwenliang a 34 year old ophthalmologist later died of the virus he had spoken up in an online chat group on dec 30 at the time the wuhan health commission was telling hospitals not to say anything publicly in the critical early weeks of january as the virus spread the local and national governments kept the lid on public information we know from transcripts that president xi jinping has said he was aware of the virus spread on jan 7 a pair of annual party meetings were held in wuhan from jan 12 to jan 17 and a huge potluck supper for 40 000 families was held jan 18 in that period a city health commission issued public statements that no new cases were detected on jan 14 the head of china s national health commission ma xiaowei laid out a grim assessment of the situation in a confidential teleconference with provincial health officials according to a memo of the session disclosed by the associated press he said the situation was severe and complex and clustered cases suggest that human to human transmission is possible the memo said the risk of transmission and spread is high all localities must prepare for and respond to a pandemic the national health commission issued a 63 page document on response procedures but it was labeled internal not to be spread on the internet and not to be publicly disclosed but the very next day li qun head of china s disease control emergency center told state television that the risk of sustained human to human transmission is low again the system opted for deception at the expense of public health mr xi did not warn the public until jan 20 seven days after the health commission teleconference the opinions section is looking for stories of how the coronavirus has affected people of all walks of life write to us wuhan was put into lockdown jan 23 china marshaled resources as only an authoritarian regime could the measures bought time for the rest of the world to its credit china shared the whole genome sequence of the virus on jan 11 an important contribution toward preparing diagnostic tests china s official death toll seemed far too low considering the size of the population and anecdotal evidence described many more deaths on friday china revised the wuhan death toll upward by 50percent to 3 869 based on a reexamination this is welcome must be done for the whole country and is precisely the attitude that china needs to embrace a search for and admission of the truth china has now launched a wide ranging campaign to portray mr xi as the hero who vanquished the virus some chinese officials have gone so far as to claim that the united states created it conspiracy talk just as ugly as that heard in washington but the part of china s campaign that is most troubling is the claim now being disseminated widely that china s system should be emulated global times the strident nationalist daily declared the other day that china s model is the only successful one to extinguish the virus an article thursday went so far as to declare china s rise was coming about because of the west s decline this sharpening of the knives is dangerous the united states and china need to cooperate to deal with the pandemic and its aftermath china is critical in the global supply chain for drugs and personal protective equipment and is an economic superpower china and the rest of the world must also confront infectious disease together not use it to score points but no one should conclude that china s authoritarian model is one to be emulated the model deception coverup and rewriting history is part of the problem not the solution read more we need smart solutions to mitigate the coronavirus s impact here are 23 megan mcardle
