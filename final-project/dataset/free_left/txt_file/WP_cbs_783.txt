the following is a transcript of the interview with democratic sen joe manchin of west virginia that aired sunday june 2 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan we re back now with west virginia senator joe manchin he s a moderate democrat who has pushed for bipartisan background check legislation he joins us this morning from charleston senator you ve tried and failed to get these restrictions or more background checks passed do we need this would it have prevented what happened in virginia beach senator joe manchin well here s the thing we couldn t even get the most common sense legitimate gun owners you know law abiding gun owners to understand we re not afraid to have background checks and we re not going to do anything wrong with our guns but there should be a balance of how you basically prevent people in commercial settings from not getting a gun when you don t know who they are and what their background is we couldn t even get that done margaret and i i i m just asking my republican colleagues and friends to use some common sense and let s do things that basically will protect the public and give us some certainty that we re trying to move in in a commonsense manner margaret brennan i want to ask you about a trip you just took to a number of countries sen manchin yeah margaret brennan and you saw what was happening in the arctic which american scientists say is melting faster twice the rate than the rest of the world what impact did you see and is the economic benefit of some of this which the trump administration argues there is offset this catastrophic effect for the climate sen manchin well the climate change is real i saw it firsthand i read about it before and heard and listened to all the scientists the thing of it is if you go up in that fragile ecosystem that we have and then you look at the geopolitics that s involved we met with the parliamentarians of the eight arctic nations we listened to each one of them from russia to canada the u s and then you have finmark denmark finland sweden norway and iceland they all absolutely will show you not just tell you they ll show you the changes that are happening the fish migration the changes of that the melting of the ice we were in greenland went up to the ice shelf there and saw how it s retreated in a very short period of time so we as humans have a responsibility to do something i m not for elimination because that s not practical you re not going to stop the rest of the sovereign countries of the world from using the energy in their backyard but we can use it much cleaner i was at the university in in stockholm in aberdeen and saw carbon capture utilization not sequestered trying to pump it in the ground by using it as byproducts and valued and valued assets it s going to be unbelievable if we start working in a way that that basically science has proven that we can do it margaret brennan you also heard though from the trump administration that national security officials are warning that russia might have been conducting in that area low yield nuclear tests have you seen any evidence of that sen manchin i didn t see i didn t see that what i did see and what i know russia is spending more of their money more more of their effort and money in the arctic region they have a tremendous landmass that s in the arctic they re spending more money there than they are in entire social services for russia it s unbelievable the commitment they ve made we ve seen more activity of aircraft flying in those spaces we ve seen submarine activity from russia more so than we have during the cold war so there is a lot of activity there they open up the northwest passage that s a whole nother that s a game changer we have got to be on top and the united states has got to start getting involved to make sure that we re a leader up there and not a follower because i can tell you what russia is doing what china is doing china is using their money trying to buy their way into the arctic to be a big player it s unbelievable and we should be alerted and we should start acting margaret brennan well i do want to talk to you more about that and because you are one of three democrats who voted to confirm the attorney general i want to hear your views on what he said this week but we have to take a break and we ll have those questions when we come back commercial margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation senator joe manchin is still with us senator as i mentioned you were one of three democrats who voted to confirm the attorney general bill barr for his post and you heard in this exclusive interview with my colleague jan crawford this week he said that some of the investigators in the russia probe may have been misguided and what they did quote antithetical to the democratic system what do you make of that characterization sen manchin well first of all i ve i ve basically voted for many of the president s executive decisions they ve made as far as who their appointments would be i ve always felt that the executive should be able to put their team together if the person s qualified and has no background a criminal background and has good experience level barr met all that with that you re seeing the decisions he s making and how he s making them now in lieu of mueller s report no one has done a more extensive report than mueller i was on intelligence committee last year and we ve been delving into this for quite some time but there s been an awful lot of investigations done by honorable people who have done what they felt was the right thing mueller making the decision he made put it out there i always wanted to hear from mueller to come before the before congress and hear from his own mind and his own his own mouth if you will what his intentions were and if he thought he was impeded and could not have gone farther or did he find anything i don t think that there was a collusion a quid pro quo but i think there was an awful lot of people that were riding that pretty high for themselves trying to put themselves in the best position they could to enhance their own their own wealth if you will margaret brennan you re talking about contact between the trump campaign and russia but in terms of the attorney general s allegations that the counterintelligence probe was in some way either misguided due to politics or by people thinking they re helping but hurting the country i mean that s a pretty strong assertion do you regret voting to confirm the attorney general sen manchin well i ve said this if he basically takes the position that he s more the lawyer from the executive point of view and not for the people s point of view i would have made a mistake i wanted to hear from mueller exactly but now in hearing where he s coming from it really gives me pause and concern that he s the people s attorney he should be looking out to prevent protect the constitution and all of us who are protected by that constitution margaret brennan well he argues he is sen manchin and still has to basically be appointed yeah he argues he is i think he s wrong in that assertion that they were misguided or intentionally going a different direction i think that bob mueller was beyond reproach i think we all felt that he was extremely capable honorable and did a great job with that people don t like this him not coming out with more of an infinite definitive if you will but i think it was very clear he said that the rules are you re not going to impeach or bring charges against a sitting president if that s the case he s put everything out there here s the thing i ve said you ve got a little over 17 months to the next election if you want to go through an impeachment we get very little done there anyway margaret brennan yeah sen manchin we re getting nothing done if you go into that and next of all there s not one republican in the senate that would vote for an impeachment so why waste your time you have an election coming up voice your opinion there and make your choice that s where it should be done margaret brennan very quickly yes or no do you support the president s tariffs on mexico sen manchin oh no no not not the way we re going here i ve said mr president please the 2013 major immigration bipartisan bill that we passed is a bill that needs to come back please mr president let s fix immigration and border security we need both margaret brennan senator manchin thank you for joining us watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital
