an obscure republican official traced as the source of an evidence free claim that millions illegally voted says in an interview he has received threats and abuse david smith in washington and martin belam in london thu 1 dec 2016 13 30gmt last modified on fri 9 feb 2018 18 59gmt when donald trump tweeted that millions of people voted illegally in the presidential election headline writers were quick to point out that he had no evidence the us president elect had not given his source but fact checking websites and newspapers traced it to a two week old random tweet by a little known former republican party official in texas gregg phillips claimed on 12 november to have found more than three million votes cast by non citizens but he too failed to provide data accused of the very topical sin of spreading fake news all the way to the white house phillips is unrepentant he stands by his original assertion though he still offers no evidence and denies that he was trump s inspiration in any case the tweet that i put out had died down nothing else was being said phillips told the guardian on tuesday and then when mr trump came out with his tweet it seemed to erupt again because somebody erroneously linked me to mr trump s tweet the campaign came out and cleared that up what he was talking about was a washington post article indeed when asked to explain trump s claim of illegal voting his transition team pointed journalists to a 2014 article in the washington post by two academics which the post s website has since prefaced with a disclaimer along with a 2012 pew research study neither proved that non citizens voted in 2016 media analysts still believe however that phillips s twitter born conspiracy theory as the washington post put it is the most likely explanation for trump s unsubstantiated outburst on 27 november the episode offers a study in the power of lone activists to make claims that soon become reported with the confidence of facts on myriad websites it also illustrates the blowback they can endure when rightly or wrongly trump is perceived as having recycled those claims to serve his dangerously selective worldview phillips a 56 year old grandfather based in austin texas said i m on the edge and you can probably hear it in my voice in the last couple of days i ve been called a child molester somebody posted something up there that i ve been arrested for armed robbery it turned out that if you drilled into that it was some black guy that was 15 years younger than me they ve accused me of being a nazi a fascist a russian spy an israeli spy they ve called me all sorts of words that i won t even repeat on here phillips is no political novice the former republican official in alabama and mississippi was managing director of a super pac that supported newt gingrich s 2012 campaign for president he has worked for the state governments of mississippi and texas and now runs a company that provides data analytics and fraud protection to healthcare providers he has also long taken an interest in the issue of voter fraud and says he is on the board of true the vote a conservative campaigning organisation focused on us electoral standards so it did not come out of the blue when phillips tweeted four days after the election completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations number of non citizen votes exceeds 3 million consulting legal team completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations number of non citizen votes exceeds 3 million consulting legal team phillips did not provide any data to support his assertion and still declines to do so the website politifact rated the claim of 3 million illegal aliens casting votes in the election as false other fact checkers concurred but a tweet can travel halfway round the world while the truth is putting on its shoes on 14 november infowars a conspiracy laden site run by austin based shock jock alex jones ran a story that began three million votes in the us presidential election were cast by illegal aliens according to greg phillips of the votefraud org organisation an exact text search for the phrase according to greg phillips of the votefraud org organization in google shows it has been incorporated into hundreds if not thousands of versions of the story dan cassino a political scientist at fairleigh dickinson university said the involvement of infowars gave the phillips s assertion the momentum of a runaway train there are whole parts of the internet where it then becomes accepted by lots of people it essentially becomes non falsifiable at that point it s incredibly difficult to counteract because the ones to whom it appeals are the ones who least trust the debunking the infowars story made it to the top headlines on the hugely influential drudge report claim 3 million votes in presidential election cast by illegals finally trump stung by his 2 million popular vote deficit to hillary clinton and efforts for a recount in three states lashed out by apparently recycling the story for his own ends in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally he tweeted articles by the the washington post austin american statesman and others drew a causal link between trump and phillips who was bewildered to find himself in the eye of a storm i m just an ordinary guy who has an interest in free and fair elections he said on tuesday this has been a passion in my life this is not something i decided to do on 12 november i m not a public figure i m not an elected official i have no authority in the world about this i m doing this on my own dime phillips who voted for trump denies that what happened is an example of the so called post truth era in which mainstream media is distrusted this is not false news he said just because you haven t seen it and just because the haters on twitter haven t seen it doesn t make it false some of these nutbags who already talking about killing me if i release the data does that mean they re really going to do it who knows right this is absurdity this is the land of the absurd but this stuff s real this is not a joke i ve been doing this for seven years it s real phillips claims to have started building a database in 2009 of all voter registrations in the us with details including geocoding we know where everyone lives we can look at it on a map we can see shifts we can see how things go move and operate if i m wrong it s a matter of degree is it bigger is it smaller what we know is that non citizens voted if only people would put the passion they ve had about my tweet into agreeing to sit down and fix the frigging problem until phillips can back his claims concerns will persist that twitter rumours can start a rightwing media firestorm that bears little relation to reality and engulfs even the white house cassino said it s incredibly difficult to counteract because the ones to whom it appeals the most are the ones who least trust the mainstream media who are doing the debunking it needs media on the right people like rush limbaugh to take a stand about the truth so those people will listen the establishment media has been declawed as a fact checker
