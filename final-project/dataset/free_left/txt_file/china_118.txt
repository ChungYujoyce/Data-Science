hong kong for months clashes between police and pro democracy protesters here proceeded in a worrisome but almost predictable rhythm water cannons and tear gas dispersed throngs of masked demonstrators only to find them amassing again the next weekend despite an intensifying crackdown by the pro beijing government that uneasy rhythm was jolted violently monday in the morning a police officer claiming self defense shot a young apparently unarmed protester in the abdomen at point blank range unleashing a chain of chaotic events as thousands of demonstrators clashed with riot police in the city s financial district and violent confrontations erupted at university campuses hours later a man who was castigating protesters purportedly involved in vandalizing a rail station was doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire authorities later identified the victim as a 57 year old construction worker and said they are investigating the incident as an attempted murder he was in critical condition the immolation prompted hong kong chief executive carrie lam to tag the protesters as the people s enemy words heard often from beijing for those targeted for incarceration or worse lam who said about 60 people were injured in monday s clashes said protesters were destroying society the government she vowed would not bow to such pressure hong kong police shoot at pro democracy protesters the unrest which continued tuesday morning at several hong kong universities marks the worst violence in the city in decades posing a quandary for china s leader xi jinping who has sought to bring hong kong to heel without resorting to tiananmen square style bloodshed that confrontation left hundreds dead when the chinese army beat shot and crushed people gathered to protest government oppression few fear a repeat of tiananmen square in hong kong in part because social media and the ability to send images at lightning speed to a watching world may serve as a deterrent against such extreme government violence but the developments on monday captured on videos that quickly went viral have led many to worry that the government in hong kong may now feel justified if not emboldened to use ever more severe methods to put an end to the protests once and for all senior officials have issued very draconian comments regarding the promulgation of a national security law and stepping up overall control said willy wo lap lam a professor of chinese politics at the chinese university of hong kong this together with the death of the student protester last week is responsible for today s outbreak of disorder student protesters see no future ahead of them because of the government s crackdown and refusal to compromise added lam no relation to carrie lam it seems like beijing wants to use the escalating protests as an excuse to impose tougher measures in beijing foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang declined to comment on the shooting of the protester referring reporters to other government departments the state council office responsible for issues pertaining to hong kong did not respond to a request for comment it s a police state in hong kong said jerry 26 a finance worker who joined the protests and gave only one name out of fear of retribution police are murderers this is not the first time hong kong has experienced violence since the protests began this summer a young woman became a symbol of the pro democracy demonstrations after being shot in the eye by a rubber bullet fired by police a protester was shot in a confrontation with an officer last month and another fell to his death under questionable circumstances last week protesters have set fires in subway stations and vandalized businesses they suspect are owned by those sympathetic to beijing throughout more than five months of unrest beijing has exhorted hong kong s leaders to clamp down harder on the dissenters hong kong authorities have obliged with thousands of arrests draconian new laws a barrage of tear gas and the detention of pro democracy lawmakers yet far from blunting the democracy movement the intensifying crackdown has prompted protesters to adopt more aggressive tactics with the deeply divided city descending into disorder there has been no sign that beijing might change tack or allow the hong kong government to offer a political compromise buffeted by trade war and hong kong protests china s xi jinping seeks to project stability protests began in june when the hong kong leader tried to push through a now withdrawn extradition proposal that would have allowed criminal suspects to face trial in mainland china but the movement has widened into an uprising against beijing s encroachment on hong kong s autonomy encompassing demands for full democracy and police accountability the unrest has pushed the city into recession on monday numerous shops were closed train lines were shut and many workers were unable to reach their offices

told reporters the condition of the man who was struck in the abdomen was not life threatening kwok said in the united states congress is considering a bill that would pave the way for sanctions against people who undermine hong kong s autonomy the bill approved unanimously by the house of representatives would require the u s government to consider annually whether it should continue to treat hong kong as a trading entity separate from mainland china in response to political developments however the bill is stuck in the senate where majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky so far has declined to bring it to a debate in a statement the u s state department condemned the violence in hong kong urged the government to build on its dialogue with the public and said the united states is

and civil liberties which are key to preserving its special status under u s law hong kong is governed by a one country two systems arrangement under which beijing pledged to maintain the territory s relative freedoms and autonomy for half a century after its return to chinese rule in 1997 but china has been tightening its grip triggering anger in hong kong and uncertainty about its status as a
