advertisement supported by by peter baker michael d shear and katie rogers cape girardeau mo president trump on monday closed out an us against them midterm election campaign that was built on dark themes of fear nationalism and racial animosity in an effort to salvage republican control of congress for the remaining two years of his term mr trump s fiery invective filled campaigning produced what may be the most polarized midterm contest in modern times as he played to tribal rifts in american society in a way that no president has done since before the civil rights era the divisions exposed and expanded over the past few weeks seem certain to last well beyond election day on tuesday voters will choose a new house decide one third of the seats in the senate and select new governors for battleground states that will be critical to the 2020 presidential campaign on the line for the president will be his ability to legislate build his promised border wall appoint new judges and ultimately set the stage to run for a second term more than most midterms this election became a referendum on mr trump as he himself has told his audiences it would be the president s energetic rallies appear to have bolstered republicans who were trying to match democratic fervor rooted in antipathy for mr trump even before election day 36 million ballots were cast with early voting higher than four years ago in 25 states and the district of columbia the math currently favors the democrats in the house and the republicans in the senate democrats appeared poised to recapture control of the house and governors mansions in key midwestern states but republicans were confident they would hold onto their razor thin 51 to 49 majority in the senate and possibly even build on it a split decision could set the stage for two years of partisan warfare led by subpoena powered democratic committee leaders intent on investigating everything from the president s taxes to russia s involvement in the 2016 election meet the democratic leaders whose house committees could torment president trump mr trump spent monday barnstorming the midwest on behalf of allies in close races drawing loud and enthusiastic crowds of thousands at rallies in cleveland fort wayne ind and finally here in cape girardeau his remarks were laced with his usual acerbic attacks on his adversaries radical left wing socialists corrupt the democrat mob and accusations that democrats would raise taxes destroy medicare and take over the american health care system the democrat agenda will deliver a socialist nightmare mr trump said in fort wayne but he again reserved his most vitriolic language for immigration repeatedly prompting loud boos as he warned that if democrats win they would invite murderers to come into the united states to kill men women and children democrats are inviting caravan after caravan illegal immigrants to flood into our country mr trump boomed in cleveland he falsely said that democrats want to give health care benefits to undocumented immigrants and are openly encouraging undocumented immigrants to vote led by president barack obama who has attacked his successor in a sharper more sustained way than any former president in decades democrats sought to make the vote not just a decision on immigration health care and other issues but a test of the nation s values the character of this country is on the ballot mr obama his voice hoarse from days of campaigning said during an appearance on monday in virginia on behalf of senator tim kaine and jennifer wexton a top house prospect who we are is on the ballot mr obama said what kind of politics we expect is on the ballot how we conduct ourselves in public life is on the ballot how we treat other people is on the ballot long before mr trump presidents have waged fierce campaigns during midterm elections often demonizing the other side when he was in office mr obama painted republicans as zealots ready to sacrifice medicare education and other priorities on the altar of tax cuts for the rich president george w bush accused democrats of being willing to wave the white flag of surrender to terrorists an hour by hour mapped guide to the races at stake in the midterm elections across the country but mr trump has gone even further not only taking on individual democratic officeholders by name which most presidents avoid but also ridiculing them and insulting them with playground style taunts describing himself as a nationalist mr trump has vilified immigrants both legal and illegal in racially charged language that was once considered unacceptable in national politics what you didn t have in past midterms was a systematic and very personally addressed series of attacks and very inflammatory and frankly untrue images and arguments being used said anita dunn a democratic consultant working on races in ohio and elsewhere what s most interesting about it of course is it is in many ways a strategy that is designed to exacerbate his biggest negatives democratic strategists predicted that it would backfire the president s campaign efforts over the last two weeks should be counted as an in kind contribution to the democratic party said guy cecil the chairman of priorities usa a democratic super pac instead of allaying the fears of many suburban and exurban voters he confirmed everything that democrats have been saying about him for two years at the same time he was motivating our base but mr trump s supporters cheered him on embracing a leader they said was finally taking on the cosseted elites and guarding the country against outsiders advisers to the president said his foes take his campaign rally language too literally as outrageous as it might seem it is more entertainment intended to generate a crowd reaction the challenge for republicans in a midterm election when you control everything is a lot of your voters are complacent said marc short a former white house legislative director under mr trump trump has the challenge of how do i get my people who maybe don t love republicans in congress to turn out there s evidence to show that he s making progress in that asked by reporters on monday if the elections were turning as much on his style of leadership as anything else the president said i don t think so but i mean i m willing to accept that he made no effort to distance himself from the harshness of his campaign including an advertisement it produced that was deemed racist and was ultimately rejected by several networks including his favorite fox news as too offensive to air a lot of things are offensive mr trump said your questions are offensive a lot of times in an interview released later in the day however mr trump expressed some regret for the tenor of his two years in office i would like to have a much softer tone he told sinclair broadcasting attributing his no holds barred style to a desire to get things done the 2018 election season has raised new questions about gender and power that could affect the outcome tuesday for the record numbers of women seeking office here are a few of those questions that might reshape conventional wisdom about women and politics he suggested he could change after the midterm i would love to get along and i think after the election a lot of things can happen he said but right now they are in their mode and we are in our mode and you know if you re criticized you have to hit back or you should mr trump used the final day of the campaign to raise the possibility of voter fraud law enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any illegal voting which may take place in tuesday s election or early voting he wrote on twitter anyone caught will be subject to the maximum criminal penalties allowed by law the president offered no basis for suggesting large scale fraud was likely there are a lot of people a lot of people in my opinion and based on proof that try and get in illegally and actually vote illegally he said but the invocation of voter fraud could foreshadow mr trump s reaction if democrats win the house after he lost the popular vote in 2016 he explained it away by asserting without any foundation that three million illegal immigrants voted so far millions have headed to the polls or mailed in ballots showing more enthusiasm compared with advance voters in the last midterm election for his last campaign swing of the cycle mr trump stuck to territory he won in 2016 urging supporters not to believe red state democrats who tack to the middle near election day like senator joe donnelly of indiana he s gone rogue on the democrats because now he likes trump a lot the president said but on wednesday they go back to who they are mr trump grew visibly annoyed with protesters who kept popping up throughout his fort wayne rally noting that he had not seen many lately and then beginning to taunt them directly go home to mommy he told one protester can we have our law enforcement take him out of here please after the third protester of the event mr trump blamed the disruptions on his host state i don t know what it is about indiana but i m not surprised he said that s indiana for you going back home to mama underscoring the emphasis on his conservative base mr trump was joined at his last rally by the radio host rush limbaugh who was born and raised in cape girardeau on the banks of the mississippi river mr limbaugh s family is such a fixture here that the courthouse is named for his grandfather and tourists are offered a self driven tour of the broadcaster s childhood home school and first radio station mr trump also brought onstage two fox news personalities sean hannity and jeanine pirro both of whom gave short speeches promoting him after the campaign initially said mr hannity would be a special guest at the rally mr hannity denied that he would be participating saying he would be covering it and interviewing mr trump i will not be on stage campaigning with the president he tweeted when he took the stage after all mr hannity said he was surprised to be invited to the microphone for his part mr limbaugh defended mr trump against the charges of promoting discord they say we re divisive but we re not divisive mr limbaugh told the crowd we re defending an america that has strayed from our founding nothing to do with race nothing to do with gender nothing to do with any of these identity political labels it has to do with culture it has to do with defending the constitution advertisement
