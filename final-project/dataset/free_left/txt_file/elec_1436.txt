it was a bad time for sen cory gardner to be caught in an elevator with a reporter donald trump had just referred to sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts as pocahontas again and the republican freshman from colorado was struggling to figure out how to respond i think people need to be treated with respect and that s what we ve demanded from everyone he offered but was it racist gardner clammed up he politely referred further questions to his press secretary so it went for republicans on capitol hill on friday forced to contend with yet another provocative comment by their presumptive presidential nominee clambering for safety as trump launched another boundary pushing attack in florida trump attacks rivals and not just the democrats get used to it said republican pollster whit ayres a trump critic this is your life for the next five months the furor over trump s assaults on the impartiality of a latino judge had just begun to subside when he lobbed two tweets friday morning responding to warren who had lambasted him as a thin skinned racist bully in a speech the previous evening pocahontas is at it again trump wrote in one goofy elizabeth warren one of the least productive u s senators has a nasty mouth no seriously delete your account warren tweeted back one of the senator s supporters secured pocahontas com and redirected it to warren s campaign site elizabeth warren joe biden lead coordinated democratic attack on donald trump the real estate developer hasrepeatedly invoked the 17th century native american figure to refer to warren an allusion to controversy about her heritage the senator has said she grew up amid family stories about her cherokee lineage but that account has not been proved trump began going after warren s claimed ancestry earlier this year responding to the senator s repeated slams of him as a loser and a bully who s that the indian he said at a march news conference when asked about warren you mean the indian his swipes at her have intensified as the senator has emerged as one of his fiercest adversaries on thursday she endorsed presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton and the two women met privately on friday the latest gibes come amid a weeks long uproar over trump s repeated criticism of u s district judge gonzalo curiel as biased and unfair because of his mexican heritage the claim drew a storm of denunciation including a strong rebuke from house speaker paul d ryan r wis who called it the textbook definition of a racist comment by comparison the response to the pocahontas remarks have been mixed and in many cases muted a sign of how jittery gop leaders are still trying to find their comfort level with his rhetoric oh i think it s done in good humor said sen roger wicker r miss who heads the national republican senatorial committee the organization charged with electing republican senators in 2016 sen lindsey o graham r s c normally a ferocious trump foe was similarly unfazed it s pretty funny i thought graham said i think what he said about the judge was racist when you re talking about a politician you got to be able to take a joke if this bothers you you need to get out of politics but others were alarmed he needs to quit using language like that said rep tom cole r okla a member of the chickasaw tribe and one of two native americans in the house it s pejorative and you know there s plenty of things that he can disagree with elizabeth warren over this is not something that should in my opinion ever enter the conversation it s neither appropriate personally toward her and frankly it offends a much larger group of people so i wish he would avoid that sen john mccain r ariz who is up for reelection in a state with one of the highest proportions of native americans in the country also chastised trump i just don t engage in personal insults that is a personal insult he said as he moves campaign to battlegrounds which donald trump will show up the pocahontas line spurred chatter at former massachusetts governor mitt romney s ideas summit friday in park city utah where some attendees said they were aghast at trump s many race based lines of attack stuart stevens the chief strategist on romney s 2012 presidential bid who like romney has vowed not to vote for trump said the candidate s use of pocahontas to attack warren was both racist and inappropriate if you said this in a sixth grade class the teacher would tell you don t say this stevens said this is a sick guy and americans are not longing for a president who s going to go out and use ethnic slurs against people he said it s amusing in the same way telling dirty jokes around a frat house can get laughs but most people grow out of that it s childish romney told cnn on friday that he was worried trump s language could lead to trickle down racism in the country when asked why he persists in calling warren pocahontas and what he makes of the alarm it has caused among some republicans trump responded bluntly in a statement friday because she is a nasty person a terrible u s senator and it drives her crazy the republicans should find it offensive that she scammed the system by faking her heritage not that i am unafraid to point that out he continued in the statement which was provided by his spokeswoman hope hicks actually goofy elizabeth her nickname is far worse pocahontas is the nickname of the daughter of a powhatan chief who was kidnapped by the english about 1613 she converted to christianity and married an englishman a union that is credited with bringing a lull to hostilities between the settlers and american indian tribes her story inspired the popular 1995 disney animated film of the same name furthering perceptions of pocahontas as a princess although historians say much of what has been written about her is a romanticized legend at odds with the hardships she endured stephanie fryberg an associate professor of psychology and american indian studies at the university of washington said her studies have found that exposing native american children to images of pocahontas lowered their sense of collective self worth mr trump s comments reinforce broad stereotypes of native americans as indian chiefs mascots and princesses rather than contemporary people who are contributing to society she said adding he s not using the term in any way to be honorific he using it to mock her trump has repeatedly rejected the notion that he is playing to racial fears in his campaign i am the least racist person that you ve ever encountered he told the washington post on thursday trump has been accused of peddling native american stereotypes in the past in 1993 he created an uproar at a house subcommittee hearing by testifying that organized crime is rampant in indian casinos around the nation at the time the developer was fighting the expansion of gambling on tribal lands a direct threat to his casino empire ditching a seven page statement he planned to deliver as too politically correct trump claimed that he could keep mobsters out of casinos but that native americans would not be able to that an indian chief is going to tell joe killer to please get off his reservation is almost unbelievable to me he said prompting objections from lawmakers and indignant scoffs from the audience trump also questioned the legitimacy of the mashantucket pequots who operate the foxwoods resort casino in connecticut they don t look like indians to me he said and they don t look like indians to indians in 2000 he secretly financed newspaper ads in upstate new york warning that a casino sought by the st regis mohawk nation would attract criminals and drug users this spring trump has repeatedly tweeted about warren s phony native american heritage he tried out the pocahontas line in a may interview with new york times columnist maureen dowd who had asked about his feud with warren you mean pocahontas he replied donald trump just called elizabeth warren the indian here s what that s all about he has continued to refer to her as pocahontas on the campaign trail since then a cree reporter in north dakota chastised him for use of the name declaring that s very offensive on friday trump s latest barrage left many republican leaders squirming sen susan collins r maine ignored a question about his use of the name delivering instead a long explanation about why she had to turn her attention back to a discussion about trade issues i m not going to enter into the daily visitation of trump s comments said sen bob corker r tenn chairman of the senate foreign relations committee who warned earlier this week that the real estate mogul has a dwindling amount of time left to elevate the tenor of his campaign for his part sen john barrasso r wyo said he was withholding judgment i haven t seen it he said of trump s tweet until i see something i m very careful paul kane in
