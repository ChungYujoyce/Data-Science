and built out organization jeff weaver a senior advisor to bernie sanders told reporters thursday south carolina with the news of former massachusetts governor deval patrick entering the 2020 race cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchellasked south carolina leaders what his run says about the current field of democratic presidential candidates former south carolina governor jim hodges told cbs news that while he doesn t think there s a measure of unhappiness with the current field there isn t a dominating figure in the democratic primary i think the issue is that no one s pulled away and that opens the door for people like deval patrick and michael bloomberg and god knows who else to get in the race said hodges it also speaks to some of the changes that have occurred in the democratic party over the past 10 years there s no one that really has been able to cross over and show some appeal to both moderates and more liberal voters hodges added that because no one has been able to unify those constituencies it opens the door for someone like deval who can enter a bit late and appear to be a fresh face with an opportunity to see if he can unify those constituencies in 2020 african american voters are expected to make up as much as 60 of the state s democratic electorate chester mayor pro tem angela douglas says it s exciting that there could be three african american contenders for south carolina voters to decide upon in february whether it s in the democratic party or in the general elections we haven t really seen a lot of choice of people who look like us said douglas i think it may actually bring more african americans out to see that there are people who would like them on the ballot some leaders who spoke withmitchellbelieved patrick is entering the race too late however chair of the south carolina democratic party black caucus johnnie cordero said patrick is credentialed up the kazoo and listed off qualifications from his r sum including work with the naacp legal defense fund and being a former president of the harvard legal aid bureau we love the underdog we always love the underdog and deval patrick is coming into this with no money no ground game and late in the game so what that means is all the odds are against him but what he represents i think is powerful said cordero what is most important is he s talking about those people who were left out and a lot of us feel left out center stage ten democratic presidential candidates are expected to take the stage in georgia next week for the fifth democratic presidential debate the dnc
