system of information quality control and lab science all need fixing by siddhartha mukherjee at 4 18 a m on february 1 1997 a fire broke out in the aisin seiki company s factory no 1 in kariya a hundred and sixty miles southwest of tokyo soon flames had engulfed the plant and incinerated the production line that made a part called a p valve a device used in vehicles to modulate brake pressure and prevent skidding the valve was small and cheap about the size of a fist and roughly ten dollars apiece but indispensable the aisin factory normally produced almost thirty three thousand valves a day and was at the time the exclusive supplier of the part for the toyota motor corporation within hours the magnitude of the loss was evident to toyota the company had adopted just in time j i t production parts such as p valves were produced according to immediate needs to precisely match the number of vehicles ready for assembly rather than sitting around in stockpiles but the fire had now put the whole enterprise at risk with no inventory in the warehouse there were only enough valves to last a single day the production of all toyota vehicles was about to grind to a halt such is the fragility of jit a surprise event can paralyze entire networks and even industries the management scholars toshihiro nishiguchi and alexandre beaudet observed the following year in a case study of the episode the new yorker s coronavirus news coverage and analysis are free for all readers toyota s response was extraordinary by six thirty that morning while the factory was still smoldering executives huddled to organize the production of p valves at other factories it was a war room one official recalled the next day a sunday small and large factories some with no direct connection to toyota or even to the automotive industry received detailed instructions for manufacturing the p valves by february 4th three days after the fire many of these factories had repurposed their machines to make the valves brother industries a japanese company best known for its sewing machines and typewriters adapted a computerized milling device that made typewriter parts to start making p valves the ad hoc work around was inefficient it took fifteen minutes to complete each valve its general manager admitted but the country s largest company was in trouble and so the crisis had become a test of national solidarity all in all toyota lost some seventy thousand vehicles an astonishingly small number given the millions of orders it fulfilled that year by the end of the week it had increased shifts and lengthened hours within the month the company had rebounded every enterprise learns its strengths and weaknesses from an aisin fire moment from a disaster that spirals out of control what those of us in the medical profession have learned from the covid 19 crisis has been dismaying and on several fronts medicine isn t a doctor with a black bag after all it s a complex web of systems and processes it is a health care delivery system providing antibiotics to a child with strep throat or a new kidney to a patient with renal failure it is a research program guiding discoveries from the lab bench to the bedside it is a set of protocols for quality control from clinical practice guidelines to drug and device approvals and it is a forum for exchanging information allowing for continuous improvement in patient care in each arena the pandemic has revealed some strengths including frank heroism and ingenuity but it has also exposed hidden fractures silent aneurysms points of fragility systems that we thought were homeostatic self regulating self correcting like a human body in good health turned out to be exquisitely sensitive to turbulence like the body during critical illness everyone now asks when will things get back to normal but as a physician and researcher i fear that the resumption of normality would signal a failure to learn we need to think not about resumption but about revision start with health care as a delivery system in this state of emergency delivering care has required both personal protective equipment masks gowns gloves for medical personnel and devices including supplemental oxygen and ventilators for patients in the absence of effective drugs care is mainly supportive as the pandemic advanced the delivery of these goods to hospitals and clinics should have been akin to a soldierly deployment a meticulous co rdinated response toyota reassembling a supply chain within a matter of days instead the medical infrastructure of one of the world s wealthiest nations fell apart like a slapdash house built by one of the three little pigs n95 respirators those heavy duty face masks with two straps and a metal nose bridge are a case in point before the pandemic each cost between fifty cents and a dollar or so they come in various sizes and styles and every year health care workers have their size fit tested to make sure that air can t get in around the edges a puff of aerosolized saccharin might be sprayed near your face if you can detect the sweetness the mask isn t fitting properly the n95 meant for a single use is designed to filter particulates as small as 0 3 microns in diameter in the pre pandemic world when i encountered a patient suspected of having influenza or tb say i would put one on and discard it in the biohazard trash after each use but mid crisis when the need for these masks in hospitals and clinics was most acute doctors and nurses ran short an anesthesiologist from new jersey told me that he was forced to reuse his mask for the whole day we get one per shift per day his nursing staff he said initially got none a resident in boston who worked in an e r told me that he had no n95 mask until the end of march the few that were available were reserved for medical staff performing intubations and bronchoscopies procedures that can send viral particles airborne and pose the highest risk of infection he recalled seeing a patient with symptoms that could have signalled covid 19 when i went to examine him i had a surgical mask a simple clothlike cover leaky at the sides and a face shield i had been cleaning and reusing for a month we ve all heard stories about the absence of masks in hospitals we know that their production was typically outsourced to suppliers in china which were buffeted by the very contagion that made these devices so necessary meanwhile the shortage of these mass manufactured fifty cent items has imperilled the safety of our medical personnel the question is why days after the aisin fire a typewriter factory was putting out brake system components why weren t our suppliers responding with the same urgency and resilience the story of mike bowen a manufacturer in north richland hills texas offers some clues his company prestige ameritech which he and his partners started fifteen years ago is among the country s largest domestic manufacturers of surgical and n95 masks because companies that moved manufacturing abroad including bowen s old employer kimberly clark would undercut him on price he often had a hard time landing orders hospitals typically don t order masks as individual buyers he told me he spoke deliberately with the slightest texan drawl instead they negotiate contracts as members of a group purchasing organization representing hundreds or thousands of hospitals and as bowen explained the g p o always chooses the cheapest bid his business struggled in 2009 though preparations were made for the h1n1 influenza pandemic and bowen was asked to ramp up his production of face masks to meet the anticipated demand we bought the old kimberly clark factory he recalled we outfitted it with new machines we hired an extra hundred and fifty people and then when it ended the whole thing fell apart the people that we helped went back to the foreign made masks so we had to lay off all of those people bowen almost went bankrupt hospitals promised to retain us as suppliers after the flu but promises are not contracts we were just na ve he said bowen kept thinking about the next pandemic when the supply of masks from china might plummet and the demand for domestic masks might surge again he sent letters warning about a potential supply chain problem to president obama in 2010 and to president trump in 2017 he wrote to the defense secretary to hospital safety associations to officials at the centers for disease control hundreds of letters in all he must have seemed at times like an obsessive crank i got a form letter from the white house thanking me for my concerns he said everybody ignored it when covid 19 hit china shut down many of its factories and retained most of its diminished production of masks for its own use for a while exports declined to a trickle today bowen s company has increased its manufacturing almost fourfold producing at least a million masks a day but that s only a fraction of the demand he has had to turn away orders for hundreds of millions a day there s another place that hospitals and clinics could have looked to for masks gloves and gowns the strategic national stockpile a repository of emergency equipment that can be deployed on short notice during a crisis on march 4th six weeks after the first case of covid 19 had been reported in america the s n s announced its intention to buy six hundred million n95 respirators in the next eighteen months even if private sector orders were cancelled when the pandemic subsided the contracted companies honeywell dr ger 3m moldex and o m halyard would thus have a guaranteed buyer but pandemics don t go on hiatus for eighteen months patiently waiting for medical supplies to accumulate the day after the s n s announcement the state of massachusetts requested seven hundred and fifty thousand n95 masks and a similar number of surgical gowns and gloves to protect its doctors and nurses two weeks passed each bringing grim news of viral spread before the state received a tenth of that number when i e mailed the strategic national stockpile a spokesperson emphasized that the role of the s n s was to supplement her emphasis state and local supplies during public health emergencies not to fulfill everyone s needs but how many n95s were there in the stockpile to start with the answer was thirteen million new york and california between them have about three million health care workers if a fifth of that workforce were involved in some contact with virus infected patients and if no more than two n95 masks were used per worker each day the entire s n s supply would last eleven days our delivery mechanisms have also broken down for the people trying to measure and manage the crisis in this effort the most important tool is the detection kit at a population level detection enables mapmaking quantifying the size and the sources of an infection and tracking its movements for an individual patient it enables plan making assessing whether you ve been infected and should be isolated and tracing whom you ve put at risk in the later stages of a pandemic the ability to test on a wide scale allows agencies to concentrate on hot spots and contain them with limited local lockdowns the c d c which had known about the wuhan outbreak since december started making detection kits in january according to reporting from the washington post on february 8th one of the first c d c made detection kits for the new coronavirus freshly approved by the food and drug administration arrived at a public health lab in manhattan it contained a set of chemicals or reagents meant to isolate the virus s genetic material and a set of three probes to amplify the material and then determine whether it was from the coronavirus time and again technicians in new york found one of the probes probe n3 registered false positives even distilled water triggered a positive result as the days dragged by researchers at the c d c tried to rejigger the test and make sure that its results were reliable the f d a says that the original design it approved had performed well the trouble arose when additional lots of the kit were manufactured although the world health organization had distributed a quarter of a million tests manufactured by a german lab and widely used elsewhere the f d a had authorized only the c d c kit when labs at american hospitals and elsewhere devised detection assays of their own the agency prohibited their use until an emergency use authorization had been applied for and granted the emergency use authorization protocol less demanding than the ordinary approval process was designed to make the agency nimbler while preventing people from peddling useless tests drugs or devices during an emergency yet for some researchers it would prove to be a roadblock in itself i spoke to alex greninger the assistant director of the virology lab at the university of washington it s one of the largest virology labs in the country and researchers there began developing a test just days after the first case of covid 19 was detected on american soil a thirty five year old man who appeared at a clinic in snohomish county washington on january 19th coughing and feverish greninger a square jawed athletic figure who favors hoodies over suits didn t blame anyone at the c d c or the f d a in fact he told me that he found the officials extremely responsive and easy to work with as he described the situation it was the process that failed for greninger s team devising a lab test for the new coronavirus sars cov 2 wasn t particularly difficult its genomic sequence was already available which made it possible to design the right probe for detecting the viral material securing samples of that material to validate the test wasn t easy but greninger found a way the next step was getting the f d a to permit its use he and his colleagues spent almost a hundred hours filling out a baroque thirty page form filing the authorization request on february 19th still no dice he had e mailed the material and the f d a insisted that he print it out and mail a hard copy along with the digital file in physical form such as a thumb drive or a cd to a separate documentation office this requirement was later withdrawn they worked as efficiently as they could greninger said but the hard copies probably increased the turnaround by several additional days the f d a says that on the contrary it reviewed the electronic application immediately what gave the matter particular urgency is that the bulk of patient testing is done by commercial clinical labs or academic labs and the c d c initially distributed its kits only to c d c authorized military and state and county public health labs which do a fraction of over all testing meanwhile the infection spread on flights and in movie theatres and during visits to grandparents seeding itself in other cities and states new york new jersey louisiana connecticut yet by the last week of february only a few hundred tests per day were being performed on february 28th greninger and colleagues sent a letter to congress noting no test manufacturer or clinical laboratory has successfully navigated the e u a process for sars cov 2 to date the next day the f d a relaxed its position allowing high complexity clinical labs to test for virus infection in advance of agency review and approval a simplified e u a form was soon made available greninger e mailed me two versions of the e u a application the original one from january 19th was thirty pages and filled with dense boilerplate in the first version greninger told me they suggested the lab test twenty five positive cases but when we were looking at this in mid february there were only fourteen confirmed cases in the u s this posed a metaphysical question how can one validate an emergency test before an emergency occurs the f d a duly worked with the c d c and the n i h to make more viral samples available loweringthe hurdles for test validation without compromising the quality of the test a later version of the e u a form from march 7th was just seven pages between february 28th and march 1st greninger s team worked around the clock to prepare the virology lab for testing hundreds of patient samples by monday march 2nd the lab had begun its first tests a full forty three days had passed since that covid 19 patient turned up in snohomish county this is hardly the first time that the f d a has faced the challenge of finding the right balance between safety and speed in october of 1988 fifteen hundred aids protesters from the direct action group act up arrived at the agency to stage a takeover while agency scientists horrified and confused peered out of their windows activists draped banners and put out tombstone shaped signs rip killed by the f d a as the h i v aids researcher and activist mark harrington recounted it was part of act up s drugs into bodies agenda propelled by an urgent logic aids was nearly always fatal and time consuming precautions seemed the opposite of cautious patients were being protected to death the logic sank in one way that the f d a eventually responded was by developing an accelerated approval process it would permit the use of surrogate metrics to judge the success of a medicine that is rather than waiting to measure patient survival rate over some period of time researchers could establish effectiveness simply by documenting a decrease in viral loads or the recovery of the immune system trials became leaner and swifter expediting the development and approval of the antiviral cocktail therapies that are now used to treat patients with h i v for covid 19 in turn the f d a has sought to fast forward trials by means of its coronavirus treatment acceleration program working with developers of treatments and vaccines still the speedier approach has its own pitfalls it makes it easier for products that are marginally effective or outright ineffective to slip into the system drugs into bodies too easily devolves into bad drugs delivered into vulnerable bodies the same applies to devices and detection assays a recent fiasco in the u k illustrates the point the government spent twenty million dollars on covid 19 tests peddled by two chinese companies that proved unreliable as greninger was quick to point out without some f d a approval process testing could become a free for all and in the aftermath of the testing debacle we re seeing a pendulum shift toward underregulation the f d a has allowed more than ninety companies to offer antibody tests meant to determine whether someone has already been infected and possibly acquired immunity but it has reviewed and authorized only four in short the f d a has essentially recused itself from evaluating these tests before they come on the market poorly regulated and unreliable tests could unfortunately complicate recovery some nations such as italy and the u k are considering giving return to work immunity passports to those who have antibodies against the virus this is a divisive ethically fraught approach to begin with add in diagnostic errors and it could be a lethal one tests drugs devices procedures all these draw on medicine as a research program major innovations in clinical care are often driven by scientists working with cell cultures animal models and even computational models work done in vitro in vivo in silico lifesaving treatments found in i v bags and pill bottles generally had their origins in petri dishes and microarrays scant the lab research and a patient will pay the price i am busier than i have ever been susan weiss a professor of microbiology at the university of pennsylvania told me instantly recognizable in the long passageways of the lab by her nimbus of curly brown hair she has spent her career working on coronaviruses while other labs at the university are under lockdown hers is now in hyperdrive she is studying coronavirus proteins and their interaction with the human immune system a topic she has pursued for forty years her work has helped that of other penn scientists including the virologist sara cherry who are searching for drugs that might block coronaviruses from entering cells and replicating but this flurry of attention was preceded by a long period of neglect just a few decades ago we were on the periphery even among virologists weiss told me the first coronavirus conference was organized in 1980 in w rzburg germany there were sixty people at the conference virtually the entire coronavirus group at that time federal grants were scarce and her lab along with the small band of researchers struggled for decades with minimal funding then in 2003 sars hit and of course suddenly everyone was interested weiss recalled that september the national institutes of health put out a request for applications to study sars the n i h organized workshops featuring international experts in the fields of coronavirus biology and blue ribbon panels on topics like priority pathogens biodefense and vaccines we were suddenly in the middle of all attention weiss said then sars stopped spreading and the interest evaporated but surely i asked weiss someone should have anticipated that another similar pandemic might arise you would think so wouldn t you weiss said her voice tightening in indignation you would think so if the research on coronaviruses had kept pace we might have had an array of treatment options even a vaccine platform that could be adapted for the coronavirus now circulating a cousin of the one that causes sars i searched a database called grantome to confirm weiss s observations the plot of federal grants awarded for coronavirus research in the past few decades looks like a bell shaped curve in the nineteen nineties and early two thousands there were typically between twenty and thirty such grants a year these were the lean decades that weiss had referred to predictably the number surged after 2003 when sars arrived reaching its peak of a hundred and three in 2008 and then came the decline this year no doubt the line will rise again the investigators came and then they left stanley perlman a microbiologist at the university of iowa told me he s another veteran coronavirus researcher who has watched labs drift away from his field of concern to be fair the n i h awards most of its grants based on unsolicited applications it receives from scientists and it must balance national priorities look we live in uncertain times michael lauer a senior administrator at the n i h said the n i h cannot predict pandemics any more than anyone else can and he stressed there s already an internal effort to maintain a diverse portfolio within the institutes the whole of the n i h evaluates its entire portfolio every five years and some of the grants build the infrastructure to pay for clinical trials that can be rapidly deployed during a pandemic a network of clinicians who can move as a body when needed still the bell shaped curve of coronavirus funding nagged at me boom and bust cycles in research have consequences lab technicians are skilled workers who are laid off or retrained as priorities shift when i worked in a viral immunology lab as a grad student at oxford our research infrastructure was supported by dozens of technicians each trained one on one by yet another layer of skilled technicians it was a product of time and the accretion of expertise a well run focussed lab is like a village not a quonset hut you can put up overnight what s more it was known that sars and mers were deadly coronaviruses with animal reservoirs that could hop to humans disease modellers had determined that a respiratory virus with modes of transmission similar to sars cov 2 was a likely culprit in a future pandemic why wasn t our research investment remotely commensurate with our threat assessments on sunday april 4th tatiana prowell a doctor at johns hopkins messaged me on twitter she forwarded an e mail from a radiologist in los angeles along with a ct scan of a young patient s lung with a golf ball size clot an unusual finding was cropping up in patients with severe sars cov 2 infections blood clots in the lung called pulmonary emboli p e s and strokes caused by clots in the brain some were tiny nearly undetectable and some were huge i think this is a major unrecognized cause of mortality prowell wrote my phone is full of msgs from physicians from every specialty asking if others are also seeing unexpected thromboembolic events in young healthy patients with covid 19 neurologists getting consulted for stroke cardiologists finding large clots on echocardiograms nephrologists noticing dialysis catheters clotting radiologists finding pes on scans i think there is a slow collective awakening to the fact that this is not an isolated phenomenon in fact the slow collective awakening was already well under way elsewhere chinese doctors had apparently seen such blood clots and started giving patients blood thinners to prevent them why are american doctors so resistant to learning from excellent chinese doctors who have been on the front line longer someone admonished me on twitter one patient a man in his twenties texted me a picture of bluish spots on his thighs evidently a scattering of minuscule clots in the skin i e mailed a doctor in london in autopsies he told me we are finding micro emboli small clots in the lungs during the next few days my in box and my twitter feed brimmed with notes from doctors and researchers remarking on these findings and wondering about trials for virus infected patients and blood thinners is this loose informal transmission of anecdotal findings call it chatter call it rumor part of medicine it isn t what anyone is taught in medical school it doesn t fit in with the professional s image as a purveyor of rigorously tested interventions but continuous iterative clinical knowledge the kind that can be updated minute by minute is invaluable during this tumult when time is of the essence and there s scant research to fall back on such updates are like weather reports in the middle of a storm they matter in the moment once the storm passes they re yesterday s news covid 19 has similarities to familiar conditions but it is a new condition and like all new conditions it has its peculiarities when doctors exchange notes on their experiences about an odd incidence of blood clots about a ventilator setting that seems easier on the lungs about the results of putting patients in a prone position in order to ease breathing they can adjust treatments and improve patient outcomes not every provisional finding will pan out medical chatter can prove misguided just as there s plenty of bunk in open research archives still anecdotal patterns can lay the groundwork for a case series and then a case control study and ultimately a randomized controlled trial of a clinical approach already observations that began as scattered tweets about emboli in covid 19 cases have migrated into preprint journal articles webinars and official recommendations from professional bodies the way clinicians have made use of twitter and facebook during this crisis has been a heartening development we ve cobbled together an informal medical bulletin board for the pandemic even as we wade through the muddy slop of fake news we have a forum of exchange that is flexible versatile and timely this is a story of something that s gone right and of something that s gone very wrong that s because clinical medicine is among other things an information system and a central part of that system is broken patient records that once were scribbled on clipboards now sit in electronic medical record e m r systems many of them provided by the wisconsin based software company epic a standardized digital database of patient care records searchable across hospital and medical care systems could be an invaluable way of identifying effective approaches to a novel disease like moving from a patchwork meteorological system where towns keep their own records of wind and rainfall to a national weather tracking grid a putative advantage of digital hospital records is to enable on the fly searches not the kind of data project that the n i h might fund its grants take weeks to process even on an accelerated schedule but the kind that might be completed in an hour perhaps i thought we should be advising covid 19 patients to call us if they suspected clots if their breathing rate and heart rate increased suddenly for instance perhaps our hospital system s emergency department should be alerted because clotting is a frequent issue among patients with cancers i called my colleague azra raza the director of columbia s myelodysplastic syndrome center to ask if we could search through the database of her patients for any who had reported being infected and if so had experienced blood clots she sighed i can t think of a simple way to do this she told me and in any case because of all the concerns around privacy if you wanted to report the findings you would have to file with the institutional review board but that would take a month at least i protested in recent weeks many hospitals have accelerated their review process to deal with the pace of the pandemic it s the way the system is she said if you want to report the number of times a patient has cut her nails in the last week you would need approval and it s not easy at all to search the e m r for any of this information you d have to hire someone specifically to look through it a cardiologist at massachusetts general hospital in boston echoed this frustration on twitter why are nearly all notes in epic basically useless to understand what s happening to patient during hospital course another doctor s reply because notes are used to bill determine level of service and document it rather than their intended purpose which was to convey our observations assessment and plan our important work has been co opted by billing the promise of bringing medical recordkeeping into the digital age was to maintain a live record of a live patient enabling clinicians to track patient care across hospital systems and over time instead we ve been saddled with systems that cut into patient care clinicians typically spend an hour feeding documentation into a computer for every hour they spend with patients and often are too fragmented to allow a patient s file to follow her from one medical center to another the e m r as a colleague of mine put it is electronic in the same sense that your grandfather s radio is electronic the energized improvisatory role of medical twitter inevitably draws attention to what our balky billion dollar systems should have been providing to the cost in dollars and lives of the rapid clinical learning that we ve forgone it s hardly news that our e m r systems have failed medicine and yet an executive order from new york state issued at the end of march by governor andrew cuomo amounted to a grim epitaph health care providers are relieved of recordkeeping requirements to the extent necessary for health care providers to perform tasks as may be necessary to respond to the covid 19 outbreak any person acting reasonably and in good faith under this provision shall be afforded absolute immunity from liability a system designed to expedite and improve the delivery of health care was officially recognized as an obstacle when the tide goes out warren buffett once said you discover who has been swimming naked the pandemic has been merciless in what it has exposed in many cases the weaknesses in our medical system were ones that had already been the subject of widespread attention such as the national scandal of health care coverage that leaves millions of americans uninsured in others they should have been the subject of widespread attention because we had plenty of warning again and again in the past several weeks we ve heard of shortages shortages of protective gear of ventilators of pharmaceuticals yet even before the crisis medicine was dealing with troubling scarcities of needed drugs and support systems last summer long before the pandemic pulmonologists were raising concerns about a lack of oxygen supplies the result of cost cutting measures by suppliers of durable medical equipment competitive bidding programs drove margins down so low that more than forty per cent of such companies responsible for the supply of portable oxygen tanks and concentrators went out of business inventory diminished delivery times increased patients suffered neeta thakur a pulmonologist and researcher at the university of california in san francisco told me about the byzantine process involving ten to fifteen disconnected steps that was required in order for a patient to receive oxygen at home a patient who is then at the mercy of the intermittent delivery schedules of understocked venders the problem builds into a failure cascade if patients cannot be discharged from the hospital because they cannot have oxygen at home the resultant logjam delays the treatment of other patients who need those beds for acute care the pharmaceutical system was clearly fraying as well vincristine which i use to treat blood cancers was among a hundred important drugs that have been in critically short supply in recent years even bags of sterile saline solution the most basic i v fluid nothing more than salt and water were hard to source many american hospitals used bags made by a single manufacturer in puerto rico which was devastated by hurricane maria an f d a report published in october noted that manufacturers had little incentive to produce less profitable drugs that the market failed to reward mature quality systems that focus on continuous improvement and early detection of supply chain issues and that logistical and regulatory challenges make it difficult for the market to recover from a disruption if one factory went offline the entire nation s supply of a critical drug could be imperilled as such pre pandemic stories proliferate they point toward more fundamental reckonings leave aside the tragedies of those who died alone in isolation rooms in hospitals or of the disproportionate disease burden borne by african americans and working class immigrants leave aside the windblown avenues of an empty joyless city the generation defining joblessness that has shifted so many from precarity to outright peril to what extent did the market driven efficiency obsessed culture of hospital administration contribute to the crisis questions about best practices in management have become questions about best practices in public health the numbers in the bean counter s ledger are now body counts in a morgue for decades consultants had taught the virtues of taut business practices slack underutilized resources inventory waiting to be put to use was shunned i spoke to david simchi levi an m i t professor who studies supply chain economics and how enterprises respond to disasters cost is easy to measure he told me but resilience is much harder so we reward managers for efficiencies and overlook any attendant fragilities his view can be summarized simply we ve been overtaught to be overtaut we ve been teaching these finance guys how to squeeze willy shih an operations expert at harvard business school told me emphasizing the word squeeze more efficiency squeeze cost squeeze more products out at the same cost squeeze out storage costs squeeze out inventory we really need to educate them about the value of slack simchi levi is particularly interested in two variables that could serve as metrics for resilience the first is the time to survive that is how long can an enterprise endure when there s a sudden shortage of some critical good the second is the time to recover how much time will it take to restore adequate supplies of some critical good by quantifying each variable under different scenarios a business can model its ability to recover from a disaster he told me about floods in thailand that shut down factories responsible for critical computer and automotive parts afterward some companies expanded their supply lines to other parts of asia having seen the fragility of a tight chain those companies had now established a network with some spring in it in the future their time to survive would exceed the suppliers time to recover toyota s recovery from the aisin factory fire in 1997 can sound like a story of triumph as in many respects it was but the company s executives realized that it was also a story of failure the company shouldn t have been so vulnerable to such an event the fire along with a later disaster the 2011 earthquake which cut off its supply of a crucial microchip taught toyota the value of redundancy and risk assessment it modified its just in time system to allow for at least a month s worth of specialized components building strategic slack into its operation it created a database called rescue with dozens of companies organized into tiers their risks regularly evaluated under conditions of adversity and information on sixty eight hundred parts continually updated the company maintains constant communication with its suppliers under ordinary operating conditions but it also trains employees to operate during disasters and evaluates the risk to the entire company if nodes in the network should falter no enterprise is truly disaster proof but in cultivating networks of mutual loyalties the company has engineered resilience yet resilience isn t simply a matter of having supplies at hand in shih s view the most critical kind of slack doesn t take the form of a stockpile rather he told me i think of slack as capacity and capabilities what you really want to measure model and establish is the capacity to build something when a crisis arises and this involves human as well as physical capital we need to measure talent versatility and flexibility overtaut strings inevitably break resilience in our medical system will involve more than considerations of physical supplies take the debacle of the c d c detection kit here s where attention to mature quality systems matters south korea has so many test kits that it s now exporting them for use in the united states what was its approach the government identified more than twenty reputable venders certified their products through a sound evaluation process and set their factories loose to meet the demand that s what the c d c should have done long before the pandemic arrived on these shores in preparation for a future pandemic the c d c could run the equivalent of fire drills identifying the capacity almost on the model of toyota s rescue database to create and mass manufacture such kits during a time of crisis the organization rather than closing itself off working chiefly with state and military labs could fortify lines of communication with the commercial and clinical labs that actually serve the vast majority of patients the f d a could have had a streamlined e u a form already in hand preferably without a requirement that it be sent by pigeon post rather than having labs waste critical time placating its bureaucracy before the next public health crisis emerges the f d a must think hard about how to balance speed and oversight adjusting the ratio to meet the moment but abandoning neither slack can be costly as greninger put it right now i have machines and reagents to test tens of thousands of patients for sars cov 2 that s basically all the clinical virology lab is doing what will happen when the epidemic is over once the incidence of covid 19 subsides so will the sense of urgency when it comes to building infrastructure or stockpiling equipment masks ventilators reagents that might sit unused in warehouses for a decade or more we need purchasing procedures that control costs without creating conditions in which critical supplies vanish during a crisis we need a strategic national stockpile that has sufficient inventory to ease temporary shortages but most of all we need an identified capacity a network that can be activated on demand repurposing manufacturing lines recalibrating agency protocols in research too we need strategic reserves and cultivated capacities a scientific infrastructure directed at our existential threats categories of pathogens with the potential to disrupt human communities en masse this may require regular requests for applications determined by an advisory panel that will encourage researchers both to advance our microbiological understanding of such agents and to develop interventions and therapeutic platforms the n i h has many funding priorities this agenda must take its place among others yet it cannot be allowed to slip to the margins as ambitious researchers move towardnew areas of excitement research does not benefit from a feast or famine ecology finally we need to acknowledge that our e m r systems are worse than an infuriating time sink in times of crisis they actively obstruct patient care we should reimagine the continuous medical record as its founders first envisaged it as an open searchable library of a patient s medical life think of it as a kind of intranet flexible programmable easy to use right now its potential as a resource is blocked not least by the owners of the proprietary software who maintain it as a closed system and by complex rules and regulations designed to protect patient privacy it should be a simple task to encrypt or remove a patient s identifying details while enlisting his or her medical information for the common good a storm forecasting system that warns us after the storm has passed is useless what we want is an e m r system that s versatile enough to serve as a tool for everydayuse but also as a research application during a crisis identifying techniques that improve medical outcomes and disseminating that information to physicians across the country in real time no set of reforms will deal with every
