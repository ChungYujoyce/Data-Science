always done by michael kruse january 31 2016 michael kruse is a senior staff writer for politico michael kruse is a senior staff writer for politico in a boardroom on the 26th floor of trump tower in a meeting in the late 1980s in the offices of the trump organization one of donald trump s deputies had had it blanche sprague earlier in the day had learned of the death of a friend in a car wreck and trump was berating one of the people seated at the conference table and so sprague angrily stood up it just became too much she said the other day on the phone from new york and i said i can t take it anymore and i just walked out she regretted it immediately thinking surely trump would fire her then her phone rang it was him she told him she wanted to write letters of apology to the 20 or so people at the meeting advertisement don t trump said he said no that would hurt you possibly change you i don t want you to do it sprague said he didn t want to put me in a position of having to be weakened by my mistake over these last 40 lime lighted years trump has won a lot but he has lost a lot too four corporate bankruptcies two failed marriages and a vast array of money squandering business ventures he lost his signature trump shuttle airline to his lenders his self branded casinos in atlantic city struggled consistently to turn profits in each case though he has heeded a form of the advice he gave that day to sprague never acknowledge failure never admit defeat on monday after months of denouncing rivals and critics as losers the man who has promised so much winning america will get bored with winning and who has broken every conventional campaign rule on his improbable rise to the top of the gop field will face his first real electoral test finally there will be quantifiable results though the latest polls suggest otherwise trump might lose and if it doesn t happen in iowa maybe it will in new hampshire or south carolina or nevada or in any of the many primaries to come over the next frenzied few months and if that happens he will deny and distort and belittle his critics and change the subject he will say that he won he always has he s probably the greatest self promoter and self spinmeister that s ever lived said harry hurt iii the author of lost tycoon the many lives of donald j trump by claiming victory over and over again it starts to become a self fulfilling prophecy he s been able to create his own reality said wayne barrett the author of trump the deals and the downfall it s admirable in a way how he defines himself as succeeding where others see failure said michael d antonio the author of never enough donald trump and the pursuit of success it s a remarkable performance and one he s been giving all his life man is the most vicious of all animals trump told people in 1981 and life is a series of battles ending in victory or defeat two years after he said that he bought the new jersey generals of the second rate united states football league it got him in sports illustrated and on the back page of the new york city tabloids adding considerably to his fledgling celebrity eager to challenge the national football league he wanted the usfl to shift its schedule from the spring to the fall most of his fellow owners didn t want that tv networks weren t interested in putting the usfl up against the better quality nfl trump sued the nfl and its commissioner saying the nfl was a monopoly seeking more than 1 billion in damages jurors ruled that the nfl essentially was a monopoly but that the usfl was the cause of its own problems the nfl was ordered to write a check to the usfl for 3 76 usfl owners had lost more than 150 million trump had lost 22 million the usfl folded in 1986 many people blamed trump trump the sports business is a lousy business he told playboy years later in an interview with the buffalo news he drastically underplayed his role in the decisions that led to the usfl s demise that wasn t a trump thing he said in the late 80s he went on a shopping jag overpaying for properties with hundreds of millions of dollars borrowed from banks he bought for 29 million a 282 foot yacht which could sleep 52 staff and came with gold doorknobs and a sundeck protected by bulletproof glass he used it primarily as a trophy i m not even interested in boats he told the chicago tribune he took out a 425 million loan personally guaranteeing 125 million of it to buy the plaza hotel in manhattan for 407 5 million the most money ever paid for a hotel without even doing a careful inspection according to gwenda blair in her book the trumps he bought the space for a full page open letter in the new york times for the first time in my life i have knowingly made a deal that was not economic for i can never justify the price i paid no matter how successful the plaza becomes he said he had purchased a masterpiece the mona lisa he took out a 400 million loan personally guaranteeing 100 million of that to buy the eastern air shuttle for 365 million even though the company itself had just valued the shuttle at 300 million talking to reporters he compared this too to the mona lisa he wanted to decorate the insides of the planes with marble before being told that would make them too heavy to fly in 1990 he opened his third casino in atlantic city new jersey the trump taj mahal joined the trump plaza and the trump castle and the launch was chaotic with underprepared overburdened staff and malfunctioning slot machines trump went on cnn and told larry king his casino was doing so poorly because his casino was doing so well the machines he suggested simply couldn t keep up with the demand it would be like too much use king asked they were virtually on fire trump answered but soon it was clear trump was more than 3 billion in debt 900 million of which he had personally guaranteed and his casinos were struggling in a city that was struggling in an economy that was struggling trump blamed it on the recession he blamed it on the invasion of kuwait by saddam hussein that madman he blamed his employees in the new york times he denigrated the president of one of his casinos calling him a type c personality and he said he also was upset with the people running the trump shuttle he said the press was dishonest he said people were jealous trump s marriage was crumbling too due in part to his infidelity this was the first of his divorces but he saw it at least as a publicity victory because the high profile unraveling made him and his name fixtures on the fronts of well read tabloids this is great for business trump told john o donnell a president of one of his casinos not the one with the type c personality according to a book he wrote later called trumped the way this works is this ll bring all the men in o donnell said trump told him they re going to want to be with trump o donnell wrote the book after he quit working for trump in it he portrayed trump as an intemperate incompetent self centered racist o donnell trump said was a fucking loser in late 1990 in palm beach florida banks forced him to hold an auction to get rid of empty unsold condos in a building of his embarrassing you know what i think he said i think there s something very sophisticated and intelligent about auctions letter from britain by alex massie history dept by kevin baker 2016 by politico magazine he slipped off the forbes list of the 400 richest people in the country after years of angling for higher positions in the rankings he constantly calls an editor of the magazine told tim o brien for his book trumpnation trump trashed the publication calling it sloppy and arbitrary ultimately though the banks gave trump a break because they were as tethered to him as he was to them trump lost control of the plaza and the shuttle he sold the yacht to a saudi royal but the banks loaned him 65 million they deferred all his payments for three to five years they put him on an allowance of 450 000 a month it s a good deal trump told fortune in a book he co wrote that came out that year titled surviving at the top he said it was a great victory he also in the book recounted a recent trip to west point where he had been strolling the grounds while talking with some military men at which point he came upon a statue of general douglas macarthur he read the inscription of something macarthur had said your mission remains fixed determined inviolable it is to win wars this made trump think of himself just win wars he wrote in the book the general was talking to soldiers of course but i felt that what he said applied to me as well my main purpose in life is to keep winning the trump taj mahal went bankrupt in 1991 the trump castle and the trump plaza went bankrupt in 1992 thanks though to the gilded too big to fail reprieve trump had gotten from the banks and then loans from his siblings from their inheritances from their father who had made hundreds of millions of dollars building apartments and homes for middle class families in brooklyn and queens trump managed to avoid personal bankruptcy he then took his casinos public in the mid 1990s transferring their debt hundreds of millions of dollars to shareholders he declared it to be a very good deal in 2000 a gallup poll ranked trump as the nation s most famous businessman pegging his name recognition just a tick shy of total 98 percent he toyed with the idea of running for president he wrote another book it was called the america we deserve trump hotels and casino resorts kept not making a profit it hadn t in 1995 or 1996 or 1997 or 1998 or 1999 and it didn t in 2000 and 2001 and 2002 and 2003 and in 2004 corporate bankruptcy loomed again in march he told the new york times he had a limited role and that he was but a major shareholder this has nothing to do with me he said in july after another alarming quarterly report trump tried to drown out that news by announcing his intention to erect the tallest building in las vegas trump hotel las vegas not the tallest building in las vegas actually was built four years later in august when the company decided to file for bankruptcy trump issued a press release touting a new line of trump branded suits the banks negotiated with trump and his representatives to restructure debt and reorganize the company and here there were echoes of the early 1990s trump emerged relatively unscathed retaining the title of chairman plus an annual salary of 2 million with a three year contract assuring that mr trump shall not be required to devote any fixed amount of time to the performance of his duties according to the atlantic city press i don t think it s a failure trump told an associated press reporter it s a success somehow the b word never caught on very well in this country he said to o brien referring to bankruptcy but the smartest people in the country call me and say how the fuck did you pull that off out came another book this one how to get rich if i ever had a weak company that i wanted to make look strong i d hire donald alan marcus a business consultant who ran trump s public relations from 1994 to 2000 told o brien for trumpnation everything that fails he spins into victory trump sued o brien calling him a terrible writer for 5 billion for damaging his brand because o brien s reporting showed trump to be a millionaire not a billionaire in a deposition trump admitted that he exaggerated i think everybody does he said the judge dismissed the suit in 2009 trump entertainment resorts formerly trump hotels and casino resorts filed for bankruptcy again and in 2011 engaged in what had become one of his cyclical headline generating flirtations with the presidency trump publicly pestered president barack obama so much about whether or not he was born in the united states that the white house released his long form birth certificate it showed of course that obama had been born in hawaii not kenya egg on his face trump crowed that he had been the first person to get obama to give up the document i am very proud of myself he told reporters by this time he was seven years into his run as the star of the apprentice the reality tv ratings hit a show that let him play a better more edited less complicated version of himself and without which he could not have mounted a presidential bid that can only be described at this juncture as a startling success even though his record is riddled with defeat last august in the first republican debate way back when everybody thought they knew how this would go chris wallace of fox news asked trump a question mr trump wallace said you talk a lot about how you are the person on this stage to grow the economy i want to ask you about your business records trump corporations casinos and hotels have declared bankruptcy four times over the last quarter century question sir with that record why should we trust you to run the nation s business trump was ready he had been asked this before in 2011 for instance it came up on abc s this week i never went bankrupt he had said then he never went bankrupt his companies though filed for chapter 11 the chapter of the bankruptcy code that lets debtors reorganize and restructure in an effort to save a company instead of shutter it that s what trump has done four times he has used twitter too to stress the distinction i never went bankrupt he has tweeted over and over dopey he once tweeted at a person with 42 followers i never filed for bankruptcy so on fox news from the debate stage in cleveland he unleashed because trump told wallace i have used the laws of this country just like the greatest people that you read about every day in business have used the laws of this country the chapter laws to do a great job for my company for myself for my employees for my family et cetera i have never gone bankrupt by the way he said i have never wallace pressed trump talked over him using his characteristic verbal stop sign excuse me excuse me that s your line wallace said but your companies have gone bankrupt excuse me wallace kept trying sir he said let s just talk about the latest example which is trump entertainment resorts which went bankrupt in 2009 in that case alone lenders to your company lost over 1 billion and 1 100 people were laid off well i trump said is that the way you d run our country wallace asked let me just tell you about the lenders trump said first of all these lenders aren t babies these are total killers these are not the nice sweet little people that you think okay you know i mean you re living in a world of the make believe chris you want to know the truth and i had the good sense to leave atlantic city which by the way caesars just went bankrupt he motioned toward chris christie his fellow candidate for president the governor of new jersey every company chris can tell you every company virtually in atlantic city went bankrupt every company and let me just tell you i had the good sense and i ve gotten a lot of credit in the financial pages several years ago i left atlantic city before it totally cratered and i made a lot of money in atlantic city and i m very proud of it i want to tell you that very very proud of it the crowd in cleveland laughed and clapped and cheered what will trump say monday night if the latest polls aren t right if the weather in iowa is bad and his most fervent supporters can t be bothered to come out if more people caucus for ted cruz or marco rubio if the headlines on a hundred news stories say trump loses i can about guarantee what he won t say longtime new york public relations expert paul holmes said holmes back in 2004 in something he wrote for pr week made clear his disgust with the selection of trump as the keynote speaker for that year s annual conference of the public relations society of america saying the group had gone with sizzle not steak he won t say he made a mistake holmes said last week he won t say anything that happened was his fault it ll either be a case of voters not being smart enough or some dark conspiracy involving the republican party or fox news it certainly won t be a case of him saying boy i was wrong about something any admission of weakness or failure on his part would destroy the brand he s been building here said blair the author of two books on trump is what he will say i stood up to fox news i am a man of the people i m the strongest guy in the room i am a winner i never back down i m never defeated something like that maybe exactly that i think what he ll say is you know i was unfairly treated by the press said hurt who wrote lost tycoon but it s going to be on in new hampshire i m leading and i m going to win that s if he loses and if he doesn t if the winner is trump god help us all said hurt california by jeremy b white updated 05 08 20 09 44 pm edt by sam sutton and carly sitrin by bill mahoney and josh
