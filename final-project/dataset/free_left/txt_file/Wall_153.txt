advertisement supported by news analysis smaller countries like australia are trying to build a new kind of alliance by first investigating what went wrong in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic by damien cave and isabella kwai sydney australia when australia started pushing for a global inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic no other countries were on board and officials had no idea how it would work or how harshly china might react europe soon joined the effort anyway moving to take up the idea with the world health organization later this month and australia in its newfound role as global catalyst has become both a major target of chinese anger and the sudden leader of a push to bolster international institutions that the united states has abandoned under president trump we just want to know what happened so it doesn t happen again prime minister scott morrison said on friday describing his conversations with other nations confronting a once in a generation crisis the world s middle powers are urgently trying to revive the old norms of can do multilateralism countries in europe and asia are forging new bonds on issues like public health and trade planning for a future built on what they see as the pandemic s biggest lessons that the risks of china s authoritarian government can no longer be denied and that the united states cannot be relied on to lead when it s struggling to keep people alive and working and its foreign policy is increasingly america first the middle power dynamic may last only as long as the virus but if it continues it could offer an alternative to the decrees and demands of the world s two superpowers beyond the bluster of washington and beijing a fluid working group has emerged with a rotating cast of leaders that has the potential to challenge the bullying of china fill the vacuums left by america and do what no lesser power could do on its own australia is resetting the terms of engagement so we have more strategic freedom of action and in order to do that you need to build a coalition of like minded nations said andrew hastie a backbencher in the australian parliament who leads its joint committee on intelligence and security to act on the global stage as a middle power you need to do it from a position of strength that includes strength in numbers mr hastie said mr morrison has insisted that his call for a global inquiry is not directed at any one country but all available evidence points to china as the birthplace of the pandemic which means australia could hardly have chosen a more sensitive subject for its leap onto the world stage china s leaders have made clear that they see criticism of their initial response to the coronavirus which included a cover up that allowed the contagion to spread as a threat to communist party rule even a fact finding mission appears to be too much for china s leadership the country s ambassador to australia cheng jingye called the inquiry proposal which china is expected to block at the w h o a dangerous move that could lead to an economic boycott if the mood is going from bad to worse he said people would think why should we go to such a country that is not so friendly to china the tourists may have second thoughts he added that chinese consumers might refuse to buy australian wine and beef or to send their children to australian universities the economic pain if actually meted out could be severe china is australia s no 1 export market its largest source of international students and its most valuable market for tourism and agricultural products on sunday the country s grain industry warned that china is threatening to place a hefty tariff on australia s barley exports in what some members of parliament are describing as payback australian officials however are betting that china will remain a major customer including for the coal and iron ore it needs to spring back to life post pandemic and they are convinced that the australian public will tolerate some chinese punishment if it means relying less on a country that according to polls it had already distrusted a negative view that is widely shared in western europe the frustrations have been building for years under president xi jinping china s hacking and intellectual property theft have increased communist party proxies have tried to interfere in the domestic politics of australia and other countries while beijing increasingly demands obedience across the globe leaving no room for either foreign companies or countries to question its policies peter jennings a former defense official and the executive director of the australian strategic policy institute said that covid 19 had stripped away the last illusions of a benign china the idea that a country could do business with china without worrying much about how it was governed by suppressing information about the virus when it appeared in wuhan china s government put on full display the dangers of its authoritarian system not just for its own people but for the world and instead of acknowledging its missteps it has doubled down spreading conspiracy theories insisting that its response be celebrated and stridently attacking anyone who suggests otherwise our senior leaders to use an australian saying have had a gutful of china mr jennings said frankly i think they re just fed up in such situations australia would usually turn to america for the seven decades after the end of world war ii the united states was seen as a defender of transparency and cooperation but relying on washington for that kind of leadership seems impossible now much of the world views with disappointment and sadness an america laid low by the virus and mr trump s erratic response the president has shown little interest in working with any other country he has said his administration is conducting its own investigation of china but that move is widely seen as an effort to shift blame away from his own botched handling of the pandemic mr trump has also said he is temporarily halting funding to the w h o and the united states did not contribute to a recent fund raising effort led by the european union for research into vaccines further undermining u s credibility mr trump has floated outlandish treatments like disinfectants while pushing an unsubstantiated theory that the virus originated in a wuhan lab a claim that australian intelligence officials discounted as unlikely normally however imperfectly america would also have mobilized the world kevin rudd a former australian prime minister wrote in a recent essay this time in america s absence nobody did that void predates the pandemic in 2018 after the united states had pulled out of the trans pacific partnership 11 countries including australia canada japan new zealand mexico and vietnam signed a trade pact of their own as a hedge against china but covid 19 has accelerated that interaction many middle power countries have been swapping details of their responses supporting shared solutions like vaccines and starting to look ahead on thursday night mr morrison joined a call with leaders from nations that are calling themselves the first movers countries that acted quickly against the pandemic and have flattened their curves of infection including austria denmark greece israel singapore and new zealand australian officials have also been part of a weekly dialogue on the post pandemic future with a group of countries that includes india japan south korea and vietnam the united states is also involved but notably as a participant not the group s leader said rory medcalf a former diplomat and the head of the national security college at the australian national university historically australia a country of 25 million people has seen itself as too small to exert much influence on the world stage though its economy is nearly as large as russia s in interviews officials described an ingrained ambivalence competing with nascent confidence built in large part on their sense that australia has forged a track record of resistance and survival in relation to china one that much of the world could learn from australia was among the first countries in 2018 to ban the chinese companies huawei and zte from supplying its 5g network it has also passed sweeping foreign interference legislation the push for a coronavirus inquiry however represents a leap up the idea emerged somewhat ad hoc when marise payne the foreign minister announced it on a sunday morning news show she surprised the world france s leader emmanuel macron initially told mr morrison it was not yet time for an investigation though he appears to have since come around to support the proposal secretary of state mike pompeo praised the idea suggesting incorrectly that australia was supporting a u s investigation highlighting one of australia s enduring obstacles the informed perception that mr morrison is too eager to please his ally mr trump making the inquiry a reality may require more proof of independence and the kind of sustained careful effort that australia has yet to master the real test will be what does australia do next mr jennings said he argued that if the proposal died at the w h o australia should create pay for and lead an independent commission of investigators from all over the world ultimately it is unclear just how much a group of middle power countries without fixed leadership can accomplish at some point australia and the other nations will have to decide whether to focus on reforming the old system or trying to build something new skepticism already surrounds the w h o it has been accused by many countries including the united states and japan of being too trusting of the chinese government and of ignoring early warning signs of the pandemic from taiwan which china barred from the organization many of its critics believe the way out of the pandemic and the intensifying u s china conflict may involve new forms of organization drawn from countries that are already trying to revive global cooperation to defeat a killer that does not respect national borders concetta fierravanti wells a federal lawmaker in australia who has often been a tough critic of china said the world needed to be bold and resist business as usual for the rules based international order to mean anything it needs to be upheld she said if the world doesn t respond and act now when will it ever act advertisement
