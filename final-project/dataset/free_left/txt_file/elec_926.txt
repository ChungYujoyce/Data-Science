 philadelphia hillary clinton on tuesday became the first woman to be nominated for president by a major political party on a historic night during which her campaign also sought to reintroduce her to skeptical voters and calm continuing tensions here part of that task fell to former president bill clinton who delivered a keynote speech at the democratic national convention that began by recounting his courtship of his wife and detailed her lengthy career in public service including helping children immigrants and people with disabilities she s the best darn change maker i ever met in my entire life the former president said this woman has never been satisfied with the status quo on anything she always wants to move the ball forward that s just who she is bill clinton also argued that republicans had tried to turn his wife into a cartoon during their national convention last week in cleveland what s the difference in what i told you and what they said he asked one is real and the other is made up you just have to decide which is which my fellow americans hillary clinton along with her daughter chelsea are scheduled to address the convention thursday when she formally accepts the nomination but tuesday night she appeared on a large screen remote from new york thanking the delegates for helping her put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet winners and losers from the 2nd night of the democratic convention clinton formally secured the nomination earlier in the night during the roll call of states which ended with a symbolic gesture her primary rival sen bernie sanders of vermont asked that clinton be declared the nominee by acclamation a move that prompted resounding cheers soon after clinton sent out a video on twitter showing sanders s remarks and declaring stronger together her campaign motto sanders s action however was not sufficient to bring onboard all of his delegates some of whom walked out of the hall in protest that added to the party s difficulties this week in displaying unity as clinton fights a pitched battle against republican nominee donald trump the program then turned to a long series of speakers offering testimonials to clinton s character and record of service only the clintons why bill s speech tonight will be unlike anything we ve ever seen they included a series of mothers who have lost their children to gun violence or in police custody and are now fighting for reforms hillary is one mother who can ensure our movement will succeed said sybrina fulton the mother of trayvon martin who was fatally shot by a

democratic party for president of the united states sanders said with the motion seconded a loud roar of aye s arose making her the nominee at 6 56p m eastern as clinton makes history some already take it for granted the orchestrated show of unity followed a rocky first day of the convention monday when it became clear that some of sanders s supporters were not ready to accept clinton as the party s nominee despite the senator urging them to do so after the roll call some exited the hall chanting walkout walkout walkout as the program continued most of the seats in delegations from maine kansas alaska and oklahoma all states sanders won against clinton were empty several oregon delegates meanwhile wrapped black cloth around their jaws as gags and headed into the hallway of wells fargo center there they met dozens of angry delegates from other states the anger of the protesters was fueled in part by leaked emails showing that some democratic national committee staff members discussed ways to help clinton and hurt sanders in the primaries the party s chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz announced her resignation monday after the revelations ryan drundle a sanders delegate from louisiana walked out wearing a button with the unprintable initialism dnc gfy the whole election process has been a farce from the get go drundle said there are a dozen states with election fraud investigations and nobody s saying anything about it it s a sham the nominating process began shortly before 5 p m with sanders s name put forward by rep tulsi gabbard d hawaii she affectionately

final yes after the nomination was complete speakers offered testimonials about clinton s public service across a range of areas and her campaign aired an accompanying series of videos with archival footage showing her efforts the program billed as fights of her life appeared aimed at rehabilitating the image of a candidate with unusually high unfavorable ratings though not quite as high as her
