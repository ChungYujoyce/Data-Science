advertisement supported by news analysis by peter baker and maggie haberman washington president trump does not readily admit defeat knocked to the mat in alabama with the stunning loss of a senate seat he got right back up on wednesday and defiantly claimed that he had known his candidate would lose all along he may have been humbled by voters but mr trump does not exactly do humble aides to the temperamental president reported being pleasantly surprised that he did not rage against the setback in private as he is wont to do in moments of difficulty but neither did he concede a mistake in backing the republican candidate roy s moore despite sexual misconduct allegations attributing the loss to mr moore and the national party establishment that abandoned him all but ignoring the political earthquake in alabama in public appearances on wednesday mr trump pushed forward with his drive for major tax cuts giving little indication that he shared his party s panic about potentially worse defeats to come in next year s midterm congressional elections while aides anticipate possible staff changes mr trump showed no signs of shifting from the strident base oriented politics that have animated his presidency i don t think it s going to affect it mr trump said of the election s impact on his agenda as he met with republican lawmakers writing the final version of his tax legislation i think we re doing a lot this is the biggest thing that we ve worked on behind the scenes some advisers hoped the loss would persuade mr trump to stop listening to stephen k bannon his former chief strategist who has vowed war against the republican establishment but mr trump talked with mr bannon for 15 minutes by phone on tuesday aides said and seemed disinclined to cut the adviser from his circle nor was it clear that mr trump was any more eager to reach across the aisle and build new coalitions with democrats even as his party s control of the senate narrowed to a single seat with wednesday s agreement on a final tax cut bill mr trump seems poised to push through his first major achievement after a year of legislative frustrations but it remained uncertain how he would proceed after that i think he s going to have a compelling story to make that my agenda is making the country better said matt schlapp the chairman of the american conservative union but he recommended that mr trump recruit democrats for legislation on criminal justice and infrastructure i think the president and the administration should look for allies outside of the leadership as well not in opposition to leadership but there are other voices that might lead to a different coalition of members that would support their agenda mr trump flirted with bipartisanship briefly during the fall when he cut a three month spending deal with senator chuck schumer of new york and representative nancy pelosi of california the democratic leaders but when he sought to extend that cooperation with an agreement to allow younger immigrants brought into the country illegally to stay conservatives objected and he quickly retreated other presidents have been knocked off stride by special elections that ultimately presaged greater defeats in 1991 george bush was stunned when his attorney general dick thornburgh lost a special election for senate against harris wofford a little known democrat whose strategists went on to help bill clinton topple the incumbent president a year later in 2010 barack obama was likewise thrown by the election of scott brown a republican to fill a vacant senate seat in heavily democratic massachusetts the election not only cost democrats their filibuster proof supermajority just as they were trying to pass health care legislation but it also foreshadowed a republican landslide in midterm elections later that year it becomes the chink in the armor of the person who just a year before or 18 months before was the most popular figure in the country recalled jennifer psaki a veteran of mr obama s white house for us it was certainly the case that you have a moment of depressed sulking and then you have to pick yourself up and figure out how to move forward for mr obama the special election forced a strategic re evaluation some aides advised him to trim his ambitions for health care and seek a narrower bill but mr obama opted to push for his original more sweeping legislation ultimately he pushed it through without republican backing but it never developed bipartisan support and remains a target of efforts to repeal it for mr trump who has already endured off year republican election defeats in new jersey and virginia alabama has now delivered not one but two humiliating defeats in a state that he won by 28 percentage points just a year ago in a republican primary to fill the senate seat vacated by jeff sessions now the attorney general mr trump first endorsed luther strange the choice of the party establishment only to watch him lose to mr moore who was backed by mr bannon undeterred by allegations that mr moore sought sexual contact with teenagers as young as 14 mr trump endorsed him against the advice of white house advisers but as he sat watching the results in the white house residence on tuesday alone for much of the evening with the first lady out of town mr trump once again saw his preferred candidate defeated in this case by doug jones a democrat in a state that had rebuffed democrats for decades analysis of the u s senate election results both statewide and broken down by key counties and voter groups mr trump called mr jones on wednesday to congratulate him but he also sought to justify himself the reason i originally endorsed luther strange and his numbers went up mightily is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election he wrote on twitter on wednesday morning i was right roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him for the rest of the day mr trump solicited the opinion of almost every adviser he encountered asking what they thought of his tweet or whether he had made a mistake supporting mr moore in private conversations the president said he had been left with several bad options aides said he had backed mr strange but he had said he would back the republican nominee some white house aides hoped that mr trump would write off mr bannon after the loss but mr bannon has served as a kind of seeing eye dog for the president mr trump is a reactive politician who relies on the sights and sounds of his rallies with fewer such events these days he is left more reliant on the reconnaissance of others mr trump is also relieved that mr bannon serves as something of a human shield absorbing criticism that otherwise might be directed at him according to two advisers the defeat may prompt or at least coincide with staff changes even as votes were counted in alabama on tuesday night omarosa manigault newman a former contestant on the apprentice who worked in the white house office of public liaison resigned after criticism that the office had not done enough to build coalitions another aide who came in for finger pointing primarily from outside the white house on wednesday was bill stepien the president s political director mr trump has appeared more open to the need for change two advisers said and they anticipated that mr stepien s influence might be diminished by the addition of other aides mr stepien who worked for gov chris christie of new jersey and was a figure in the bridge closing scandal is well liked by most of the white house employees and seen by some as an unfair straw man for larger problems mr trump made no public mention of staff on wednesday but ever ready for a fight he seemed to hark back to last year s election by referring to an insulting term that hillary clinton once used for some of his supporters somebody else called me and everybody else the deplorables he said at a white house event with families he said would benefit from his tax plan have you ever heard that term right we re proud to be the deplorables and we re doing well advertisement
