advertisement supported by transcript na by robert pear and maggie haberman washington donald j trump calls for a full repeal of obamacare but says that everybody s got to be covered initially he liked the mandate a central feature of the affordable care act that requires most americans to have insurance or pay a penalty but he backed off that position under fire from conservatives he would allow people who purchase insurance on the individual market to take tax deductions for their premium payments but aides acknowledge that this tax break would not be worth much to people whose income is so low they pay little or nothing in federal income taxes for them trump aides say there would be medicaid which the billionaire businessman says he would not cut but would turn into a block grant to state governments this whipsaw of ideas is exasperating republican experts on health care who call his proposals an incoherent mishmash that could jeopardize coverage for millions of newly insured people but for mr trump s campaign such criticism appears only to bolster the candidate s outsider status his chief policy adviser sam clovis said mr trump was running against the political establishment in washington and was therefore not relying on advice from traditional establishment republican people instead mr clovis said in an interview mr trump is receiving advice on health care policy from at least half a dozen very prominent people but he declined to name them they are not ready to have their support of the trump campaign known mr clovis said some experts outside mr trump s campaign have been unsparing if you repeal the affordable care act you ve got to have a serious way to expand coverage to replace what you have taken away said gail r wilensky who was the administrator of medicare and medicaid under president george bush from 1990 to 1992 there s nothing i see in trump s plan that would do anything more than cover a couple million people robert laszewski a former insurance executive and frequent critic of the health law called mr trump s health care proposals a jumbled hodgepodge of old republican ideas randomly selected that don t fit together mr clovis the national co chairman of the trump campaign acknowledged that the ideas mr trump has offered to replace the health law were just a starting point a framework he said mr trump would have a detailed comprehensive plan to replace the law if congress repealed it and added that any replacement must be bipartisan asked if mr trump s plan would insure all those who have gained coverage under the health law mr clovis said that might be correct but we really don t know that a lot of it depends on what initiatives we can get through congress mr trump s health policy can be pieced together from speeches television interviews twitter posts and a seven point plan titled health care reform to make america great again he says congress should encourage the sale of health insurance across state lines and allow individuals to take tax deductions for insurance premium payments his medicaid proposal would send lump sums of federal money to each state to provide health care to low income people although unlike other republicans he has vowed not to cut overall medicaid spending that mr trump s ideas confound democrats is no surprise more interesting are the acerbic comments of serious students of health policy often aligned with republicans mr trump s health care platform resembles the efforts of a foreign student trying to learn health policy as a second language said thomas p miller a health economist at the american enterprise institute and a harsh critic of president obama s health law millions of low income people have gained coverage under the affordable care act and could lose it if congress repealed the law mr trump s proposal for a tax deduction for premium payments would not help them much mr miller said because they do not pay much in income taxes mr clovis called that an excellent point and he suggested that low income people could obtain coverage through medicaid even as mr trump seeks to slow the growth of medicaid spending with a block grant at the same time mr clovis said some workers with employer sponsored coverage might prefer to take the tax deduction and buy health insurance on their own the trend will eventually be that employers will provide income to buy insurance on your own and the employers will get out of the group policy business mr clovis said this trend he said could help workers who are now held captive by their benefits in a business or company they work for james c capretta a senior fellow at the ethics and public policy center a conservative nonprofit group said mr trump underestimated how difficult it would be to uproot a law that was now embedded in the nation s health care system it took a herculean political effort to put in place the affordable care act said mr capretta who worked at the white house office of management and budget from 2001 to 2004 to move in a different direction even incrementally would take an equally herculean effort with clear direction and a clear vision of what would come next i just don t see that in trump s vague plans to repeal the law and replace it with something beautiful and great many of the proposals mr trump has embraced have been republican standards for years such as allowing insurers to sell their products across state lines in a debate in houston in late february mr trump said repeatedly that he wanted to get rid of the lines around the states and he explained instead of having one insurance company taking care of new york or texas you ll have many they ll compete and it ll be a beautiful thing but mr laszewski the former insurance executive said this was no panacea before a texas company could for example sell insurance in new york he said it would need to establish or rent a network of doctors and hospitals to meet the needs of consumers moreover state insurance officials have resisted such legislation saying it could undermine their power to regulate insurance and their ability to protect consumers grace marie turner the president of the galen institute a champion of free market health policy said mr trump s proposals were sketchy and inadequate he has to discard some of his ideas like the importation of prescription drugs because they would be damaging and unworkable ms turner said and he has to flesh out his other proposals with much more detail if he hopes to persuade voters that he has a credible plan to replace obamacare mr trump has called for removing barriers to imported drugs from other countries such as canada saying it will lower drug prices and offer consumers more options democrats have long embraced the idea but have been blocked by pharmaceutical industry opposition as well as concerns over drug safety mr trump s views have evolved writing about health care in his 2000 book the america we deserve he said i m a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one and he expressed interest in the idea of a single payer plan with consumers free to choose from competing private options he backed away from that idea in an interview with the new york times in 2011 when he was flirting with a white house bid and his conservative credentials were under scrutiny a populist theme still runs through many of mr trump s statements the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians he said in a debate last year for a similar reason he says drug companies get away with overcharging consumers mr trump says medicare should be able to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies a proposal embraced by democrats and blocked by republicans in congress for more than a decade and he promises that if elected he would negotiate like crazy advertisement
