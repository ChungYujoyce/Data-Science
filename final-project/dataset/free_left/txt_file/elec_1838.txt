 2016 here voters once demanded close contact now they are rewarding contenders who keep some distance by shane goldmacher 12 02 2015 05 17 am est the event in northern new hampshire was donald trump s 16th visit to the state this year ap photo waterville valley n h high flying donald trump landed in new hampshire on tuesday afternoon and was headed for the exits by the end of the evening it was just another quick stopover in a state that demands persistent and extended attention from presidential candidates at least it has until now advertisement instead of the traditional one on one conversations at parties and handshakes in diners new hampshire voters are getting mostly distant waves and occasional autographs from trump at big rallies and they re rewarding him nonetheless right now trump s going to win new hampshire said dave carney a longtime gop strategist in the state who is not connected to any of the 2016 contenders it s a jump ball for second trump has led every poll taken here since july and pulled in double the support of his closest competitor in four of the last five surveys in new hampshire we re really doing well trump relayed to the adoring crowd really really really doing well the event in northern new hampshire was trump s 16th visit to the state this year and yet not once according to the new england cable news candidate tracker has he spent the night here to campaign on back to back days he ferries himself to and from on his private jet new hampshire institutionalists fret that trump s celebrity based and media fueled candidacy threatens to undermine one of the last bastions of hand to hand campaigning left in national politics and the chance for underfunded underdogs to break through we always prided ourselves on insisting on retail campaigning said donna sytek who was the first female speaker of new hampshire s house of representatives donald trump has turned tradition on its head 2016 by anna palmer but he s not alone in dismissing the traditional new hampshire approach and gaining ground in the process both ben carson who until recently had been among the top contenders here and the steadily climbing marco rubio have both dedicated less time to glad handing in new hampshire than contenders stuck at the bottom of the 2016 polling including jeb bush john kasich and chris christie trump s campaign says his popularity simply makes traditional retail campaigning all but impossible stephen stepanek co chair of trump s new hampshire campaign and a state representative hosted trump s first 2015 appearance at his home in amherst back in march he expected a small affair 350 people showed up it was like after that every time we announce an event we get literally thousands of people stepanek said we would love to be able to do some of the smaller events but there s too much demand for them every time we put something out there we just get an incredible crush of people who want to see him on tuesday trump packed multiples of waterville valley s 247 person population into his event even as freezing rain fell across northern new hampshire trump told the crowd his own motorcade slipped on the icy roads more than once en route he vowed to drive slower during his departure steve duprey new hampshire republican national committeeman said trump is simply taking advantage of an option available to no other 2016 rival if you ask every candidate who s doing a town hall in front of 50 people you can do a rally in front of 2 000 would you like to do it every candidate will take you up on that offer duprey said of trump duprey added his version is i m doing a town hall it s just in front of 2 000 people don t blame me because i m beautiful trump has drawn comparisons to endless flavor of the month candidates from 2012 rick perry michele bachmann newt gingrich and herman cain who appeared alongside trump at a rally in georgia this week but his durability atop the polls now appears more akin to mitt romney than his fallen 2012 challengers by eliza collins how many times are you going to say he s going to fall and he hasn t he doesn t said carney the gop strategist there s no law of politics that the wild assed unsophisticated showman has to fall apart still trump s rivals especially those employing more traditional tactics hope his big rallies will amount to a temporary sugar high and won t engender the same level of devotion as they say they are securing through private conversations with new hampshire s voters across the state from trump s event on tuesday for instance christie celebrated his 50th day campaigning in new hampshire where he has held more than 100 events i ve been here more than any other candidate and mary pat christie has been here more than any other candidate but me so we re thrilled to be back in new hampshire christie said in a londonderry diner christie picked up the influential endorsement of the new hampshire union leader newspaper this week as well as the backing of some other state leaders sytek was among the recent christie endorsers but she still worries about trump for people who are card carrying members of the gop establishment sytek said counting herself among them we worry he has hijacked our primary and we won t know until february whatever the outcome fergus cullen a former chairman of the new hampshire republican party who recently filed a petition to keep trump off the ballot in the state said the trump campaign was setting poor precedent the lesson for future candidates will be i don t need to troop all over grafton county in the north country i just need to hang out in a cable tv green room and wait for my next cable hit cullen said in 2016 recognizing the increasing value of national media exposure over local politicking is not unique to trump rubio after an appearance at a vfw hall in new hampshire on monday retreated to a quiet corner to tape a segment for on the record with greta van susteren on fox news local reporters watched from 20 feet away with iphones microphones and notebooks in their outstretched arms rubio left without taking any of their questions by seung min kim and jennifer haberkorn as for trump what his events lack in intimacy they make up for in entertainment value some drove for hours to see it tuesday and dressed up for the occasion as if attending the symphony we re going to see a classy guy said jodi laboffa who made a three hour drive from massachusetts and arrived in heels and a patterned dress why not look classy in a sop to new hampshire tradition trump took questions on tuesday something different he told the crowd and variedly called his questioners cute beautiful and good looking the final question came from a young boy who asked trump what would be different if trump became president if i become president he said your life will be much better than it would have been if i didn t become president moments later the event was over go out and vote trump told them he signed autographs and shook hands before he was on his way there was after all a rally in virginia to get to on wednesday missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico
