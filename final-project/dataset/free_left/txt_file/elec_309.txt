 2016 with a host of presidential contests coming up the gop front runner is about to find out if the cruz resurgence is real or if saturday was a blip by patrick reis 03 08 2016 05 04 am est donald trump speaks during a campaign rally on march 5 2016 in orlando fla ap photo on tuesday donald trump will discover whether his weekend struggles were a speed bump or the first signs of larger troubles ahead if the polls are to believed trump is in for a dominant day with blowouts in michigan and mississippi to be complemented by another win in idaho if trump falls short and particularly if he falls short to ted cruz for the second time in four days the businessman s delegate math gets more complicated and the soothsayers who ve long predicted trump s collapse will finally see hope for vindication advertisement for the first time since iowa a non trump republican took home the day s largest haul of delegates last weekend as cruz on saturday won handily in maine and kansas and ran a close second in louisiana and kentucky repeating that feat tuesday would put more momentum behind the texas senator s campaign and strengthen his case as the gop s best only hope of nominating someone other than trump trump s standing among republican registered voters down 3 points from january nationwide fell slightly in the latest abc news washington post national poll released tuesday while the poll put cruz up 4 percent though trump maintained a 9 point lead over cruz in the poll a relative lack of polling adds unpredictability to tuesday s votes while michigan has been heavily surveyed hawaii has gone uncovered and sparse polls in mississippi and idaho are now out of date trump had large leads in past surveys but they were conducted before marco rubio and several super pacs went all out against trump before two raucous anti trump debates and before his losses to cruz on saturday if trump falls short of expectations he ll have a chance to make amends during the next week s winner take all delegate bonanza in ohio and florida but if he wants to bury cruz and avoid a delegate by delegate slog to the convention tuesday s races seem like a solid place to start at the other end of the spectrum john kasich has invested heavily in michigan and his campaign can no longer explain away losses with its wait until the midwest line and while rubio s campaign is undoubtedly more concerned about next week s contest in florida another set of back of the pack finishes this week would hardly be encouraging the florida senator s win in puerto rico on saturday was just his second in 20 contests and there are only so many times one can fail to win without being labeled to borrow a phrase from trump a loser republicans in michigan mississippi idaho and hawaii will dole out 150 delegates on tuesday here s a look at the stakes the rules and the state of play in each state michigan primary 59 delegates the rules this is a good time to brush up on the difference between a majority and a plurality because michigan s rules make the outcomes radically different there per the republican national committee if any candidate takes above 50 percent of the vote that winner gets at least 56 delegates and quite possibly all 59 if the winner doesn t reach a majority michigan allocates 59 delegates proportionally by eliza collins state of play the kasich campaign got a jolt of excitement last week when one poll put the ohio governor ahead of trump leading 33 percent to 31 percent for a candidate who has staked his campaign on the midwest and once called michigan a must win it was a shot of good news but the chasers have been far more bitter subsequent polls put trump ahead of kasich by 15 points 36 21 and 22 points 42 20 the big loser here could be rubio as recent polls show him short of the 15 percent threshold to claim any at large delegates mississippi primary 40 delegates the rules mississippi republicans dole out 25 delegates proportionally based on the statewide vote with candidates needing at least 15 percent to qualify twelve more are awarded based on proportional results of each of the state s four congressional districts though any candidate scoring a majority in a given district gets all three of its delegates the final three delegates are rnc members state of play republicans all out assault on trump is about to be tested again when magellan strategies polled likely gop voters on the last day of february trump led by 24 percentage points besting cruz 41 percent to 17 percent it was a prelude to trump s super tuesday romp through the south a day later since then though cruz rubio and the full might of the republican establishment have targeted trump the poll also came before cruz s successes on saturday when he surged among election day voters in next door louisiana if trump stumbles here tuesday either the poll had it wrong to begin with or there s real evidence that the party wide war on trump is working idaho primary 32 delegates the rules if anyone wins an outright majority he collects all 32 delegates failing that things get divvied up in complicated fashion in that scenario 29 delegates will be issued proportionally based on the statewide vote but candidates need to earn at least 20 percent to get a piece of the action the final three are members of the rnc the primary is open to registered republicans only but voters can fill out gop affiliation cards on election day state of play the good news for trump here is that in the lone prominent poll he led with 30 percent ahead of cruz 19 percent rubio 16 percent and kasich 5 percent if those numbers hold trump would own all the statewide based delegates with nobody else clearing the 20 percent threshold by nolan d mccaskill the good news for everyone else is that the poll was conducted in late february before cruz and rubio turned a pair of debates into anti trump pile on sessions and before rubio launched a slew of trump style attacks on the billionaire s appearance and mental fitness rubio spent time cultivating the state and its donors in 2015 but cruz who spent saturday night in idaho may be best positioned among trump s opponents to get at least a share of the statewide pool particularly given his recent success in other primaries limited to registered republicans hawaii caucuses 19 delegates the rules hawaii s caucuses keep it simple the party doles out 10 delegates based on the statewide vote it allocates six proportionally based on the vote at the district level the final three are rnc members to vote participants need to sign a republican party card at the door if you re waiting for results on the east coast get ready for a late night the caucuses close at 8 p m hawaii time 1 a m eastern state of play polling in hawaii is notoriously unreliable and there haven t been any public surveys anyway there are few big endorsements to track either the governor and all four members of the state s congressional delegation are democrats traditionally however the state s small republican contingent tends to be moderate and has a record of supporting establishment candidates mitt romney won the caucuses in 2012 while john mccain romped there in 2008 missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020 politico llc
