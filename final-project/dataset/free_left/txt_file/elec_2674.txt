advertisement supported by despite his age he promises a true break with the past by jamelle bouie opinion columnist if he wins the nomination whether outright or at the democratic party convention this summer senator bernie sanders will be the most left wing politician ever nominated for president and the only self described socialist to ever run on the ballot line for either of the two major parties many democrats especially moderates think this is a disaster in waiting they look back to 1972 when a different left wing senator george mcgovern of south dakota was crushed by richard nixon losing his home state and 48 others they see a winnable election against a vulnerable incumbent potentially squandered by a candidate with radical views they think sanders will give trump not only a victory but also a decisive one this could happen but it probably won t the persistent belief that sanders is unelectable is unfounded the evidence says he can win the first step to winning is unifying the party and sanders can do that he has a higher favorability rating among democratic voters than any other candidate a recent monmouth university poll gives him a net rating of 53 points 72 percent favorable to 19 percent unfavorable compared with 48 points for elizabeth warren and 38 points for former vice president joe biden quinnipiac shows a similar spread as well as strong ratings from moderate and conservative democrats and a vast majority of democrats 93 percent say they would back sanders against trump as a point of comparison 88 percent say the same for pete buttigieg sanders also fares well against the president in preliminary matchups he has led trump in nearly every poll since the start of 2019 and does better than most other candidates in the crucial swing states michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania that delivered trump the white house yes head to head polls aren t as reliable now as they ll be in the summer after the conventions or in the fall when the general election campaign starts in earnest but if on the strength of the polls you believe a candidate like biden can beat trump then you should think the same of sanders as for the fear that sanders would be another mcgovern hyperpolarization makes that highly unlikely in today s political environment winning either party s nomination gives you a high electoral floor if sanders does lose he won t lose big the easiest objection to all of this is that sanders has never been scrutinized like a presidential nominee what will voters think when they learn he s a socialist democratic or otherwise how will they react to footage of sanders praising cuba or singing this land is your land while on a honeymoon in the soviet union sanders has strong personal appeal but can it survive an onslaught of republican attacks will voters punish him for flying too far from the mainstream again it s possible but it s also true that the mainstream isn t as conservative as many believe lots of progressive ideas are popular with the public sometimes incredibly so and while voters are skeptical of the most expansive proposals they aren t reflexively hostile there s something else to consider in a world where democrats as moderate as bill clinton have been accused of socialism the word has simply lost its punch republicans can say it and voters will hear it but they may not care at the end of the day sanders is the only candidate who can plausibly unite the anti trump majority of the electorate he s as popular with people who dislike partisan politics as he is with rank and file democrats with his forceful attacks on corruption and bigotry he can speak directly to the concerns about trump s character and personality that have alienated moderate suburban whites and helped give democrats the house of representatives his independent persona might alienate people in the democratic establishment but it s a powerful asset for the general election it makes him a different kind of democrat removed from washington in a way that appeals to much of the public that is why sanders is uniquely electable despite his age he promises a true break with the past the times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor we d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles here are some tips and here s our email letters nytimes com follow the new york times opinion section on facebook twitter nytopinion and instagram advertisement
