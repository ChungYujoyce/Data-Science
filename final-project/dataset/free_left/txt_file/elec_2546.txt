advertisement supported by political memo by amy chozick in the past week as a swirl of sexual assault accusations against donald j trump has prompted a loud national discussion about male power and women s rights the first woman to be a major party s presidential nominee was barely heard from though hillary clinton has stood at the center of feminist debates for more than two decades she has at times been an imperfect messenger for the cause that has never been more apparent than now as her old missteps and her husband s history have effectively paralyzed her during a moment of widespread outrage the most impassioned speeches on the topic have come not from her but from the first lady michelle obama who said mr trump s words had shaken me to my core and from president obama and others when mrs clinton herself spoke she quickly changed the subject to other groups of people mr trump had insulted and she tried to lighten the mood with a joke about watching cat videos it makes you want to turn off the news it makes you want to unplug the internet or just look at cat gifs mrs clinton told donors in san francisco on thursday making her first remarks on mr trump s treatment of women since several came forward to accuse him i ve watched a lot of cats do a lot of weird and interesting things she said drawing a few laughs but we have a job to do and it ll be good for people and for cats the virtual silence from mrs clinton speaks volumes about the complicated place she has occupied as a 1960s wellesley feminist who stayed as a devoted wife to her husband through infidelities and humiliation forcefully denouncing sexual assault would most certainly provoke ugly attacks on bill clinton and mrs clinton s role in countering the women who accused him of sexual misconduct that painful past haunted mrs clinton last sunday when mr trump invited some of her husband s accusers to the second presidential debate in the days since mrs clinton has had to once again navigate the messy crosscurrents of politics symbolism and her ambition to shatter that highest hardest glass ceiling of being elected the first female president now when the collective voice of american women and victims of sexual assault seems to be letting out a cathartic scream mrs clinton has deferred to another first lady to speak for her at the san francisco fund raiser on thursday she pointed to mrs obama s speech earlier that afternoon when the first lady placed her hand on her heart and spoke out for the many who were outraged speaking to college students in new hampshire mrs obama called mr trump s lewd remarks about how he had forced himself on women disgraceful and intolerable i can t believe i m saying that a candidate for president of the united states has bragged about sexually assaulting women mrs obama said as a crowd of young women watched with silent and somber expressions i can t stop thinking about this it has shaken me to my core mrs clinton has every political reason to avoid wading into the discussion of sexual assault that has riled a nation and thrown her republican rival s candidacy into chaos not known as a naturally emotive public speaker mrs clinton risks stumbling if she embraces the issue at a time when polls show that she is in her strongest position yet to defeat mr trump on nov 8 she has played it safe all but disappearing from the campaign trail until the next debate in las vegas on wednesday but then again two decades ago it was mrs clinton who as a 47 year old first lady in a powder pink suit defied her husband s west wing advisers and captured the attention of women worldwide by declaring human rights are women s rights and women s rights are human rights once and for all last summer mrs clinton began her campaign by declaring that she wanted to create an america where a father can tell his daughter yes you can be anything you want to be even president of the united states since then allegations of sexual harassment have led to the ouster of roger ailes as chairman of fox news college campuses have been shaken by the six month jail sentence given to brock turner a former stanford university student found guilty of sexual assault and women continue to come forward with allegations against mr trump at the same time mrs clinton so close to becoming the first woman to win the white house amid national outrage over reports of her rival s male lechery has all but abandoned gender as an issue on thursday mrs clinton appeared to get choked up on the set of the ellen degeneres show when during a taping ms degeneres played a portion of mrs obama s speech but mrs clinton quickly composed herself and in a remarkable post gender punt pivoted to a laundry list of other constituencies whom she said mr trump had offended it s not just what trump has said about women as terrible as that has been mrs clinton told ms degeneres it s what he has said about immigrants and african americans and latinos and people with disabilities and p o w s and our military and muslims and everybody on friday without mentioning the accusations against mr trump mrs clinton told volunteers in seattle this election is incredibly painful i take absolutely no satisfaction in what is happening on the other side with my opponent asked if mrs clinton would be speaking more directly about the issue jennifer palmieri the campaign s communications director noted that mrs clinton had confronted mr trump at the last debate about the recently released 2005 video in which he bragged about groping women you should expect that she ll continue to do that ms palmieri said mrs clinton has battle wounds from wading into gender in the past in 1992 she seemed an affront to stay at home mothers when she defended her legal career saying i suppose i could have stayed home and baked cookies as a working mother in the white house mrs clinton redefined the role of first lady when she tried and subsequently failed to overhaul health care but she also played the role of a traditional wife when she stayed with mr clinton despite his affair with monica lewinsky in hacked emails released by wikileaks this week mrs clinton was shown in an interview transcript pondering at length the many complexities of running to be the first female president when i ran the last time the research was pretty clear that there was a resistance to a woman president not just among republicans and independents but among democrats she said in one of the thousands of emails obtained by hackers who illegally breached a top aide s account they didn t think a woman was qualified could do the job didn t see a woman as commander in chief mrs clinton continued so in 2008 she played up her fortitude and tried essentially to run as if she were a man eight years later mrs clinton talks regularly about being a mother and a grandmother and she doesn t shy away from embracing her potential to make history she has also promised that as president she would advance policies that would help women including doubling the child care tax credit increasing the minimum wage and pushing for 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave and yet mrs clinton has found in her second presidential campaign that young women aren t particularly moved by her promise to make history many of them voted instead for mrs clinton s primary opponent senator bernie sanders of vermont thinking about her current campaign mrs clinton said in the transcript you know i mean i m damned if i do i m damned if i don t advertisement
