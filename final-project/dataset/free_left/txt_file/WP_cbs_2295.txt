million people who had job based health coverage will become eligible for affordable care act coverage cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall wicesays the kaiser family foundation analysis estimates 26 8 million people nationwide would become uninsured if they don t sign up for other coverage due to job losses the vast majority of those people are eligible for coverage under the affordable care act including 12 7 million through medicaid and 8 4 million in the aca marketplaces another 5 7 million are not eligible and would have to pay the full cost of their coverage and more will likely remain uninsured unlike in past recessions most of those who lose their job based coverage will be eligible for health coverage because of the affordable care act though some may find coverage unaffordable even with subsidies kff executive vice president for health policy larry levitt said in a statement as unemployment benefits expire however about two million more people in states that did not expand their medicaid programs under the aca will move into the medicaid coverage gap and have no affordable option the analysis found about 150 000 people who live in states that did not expand medicaid programs would fall into the coverage gap meaning they are ineligible for medicaid but have incomes too low to qualify for tax credits to help cover costs in the marketplace the group will grow to 1 9 million by january 2021 when worker unemployment benefits expire leaving them with incomes below the threshold to qualify for tax credits the study comes as lawmakers are grappling with how to navigate the health care debate as a case over the affordable care act heads to the supreme court on sunday republican senator lamar alexander was asked if he was disappointed that the president decided to go ahead with the obamacare lawsuit after arguments in the case were filed with the country s highest court last week well the answer to your question is yes i thought the justice department argument was really flimsy said alexander the case focuses on the aca s individual mandate after a lower court used it to find the entire law to be unconstitutional what they re arguing is when we voted to get rid of the individual mandate we voted to get rid of obamacare alexander said i don t know one single senator that thought that this week republican senator john cornyn of texas was also asked by a local anchor in austin what people can do if they ve lost job based insurance texas is one of just over a dozen states that have not expanded medicaid well the good news is that if you lose your employer provided coverage which covers about a 180 million americans that is a significant life event which makes you then eligible to sign up for the affordable care act cornyn responded and as you know it has a sliding scale of subsidies up to 400 of poverty so that s an option for people democrats have seized on the health care issue making it a major focus of their messaging in an election year after it played a central role in the 2018 midterm elections both alexander and cornyn have voted to repeal and replace obamacare in the past but democrats are also facing questions over how to address the rising costs of premiums some are advocating for single payer government run medicare for all the kff study found coverage losses due to losing employer provided insurance will affect at least a million people in each of eight states includingcalifornia texas pennsylvania new york georgia florida michigan and ohio several of these states are considered battlegrounds in the november election from the candidates joe biden joe biden announced working campaign panels comprised of mostly prominent biden and senator bernie sanders supporters

that his secret service detail has been tested i should be tested biden said so that s that s in play we ll see how that goes president donald trump president trump told reporters today he continues to keep his distance from the vice president after his press secretary katie miller tested positive for the virus last week i haven t seen mike pence and i miss him trump quipped adding that the two speak on the phone often i guess we said for a little while we ll stay apart because you don t know what happens with this crazy horrible disease the president added referring to the covid 19 outbreak the president also called reports of former vice president joe biden s possible involvement in efforts to unmask former national security advisor michael flynn a massive thing taunting his likely democratic rival reportscbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga he said he knows nothing about anything trump said of biden i suspect you ll have if it s possible even bigger stories coming out he added joe biden s limp claim that he doesn t know anything about the railroading of gen michael flynn just got even more unbelievable trump campaign manager brad parscale wrote in a statement biden is listed among the obama administration officials who requested the unmasking of flynn we already knew biden was briefed on the flynn case before president trump took office and now we know that he wanted flynn unmasked americans have a right to know the depth of biden s involvement in the setup of gen flynn to further the russia collusion hoax in an interview on good morning america on tuesday biden acknowledged he was aware that they asked for an investigation into flynn while he was vice president but said renewed discussion over the matter is all about diverting attention from the trump administration s handling of the coronavirus pandemic look think about this can you imagine any other president of the united states focusing on this at a moment when the country is absolutely considered about their health of their children the health of their families he said this is all about diverting attention focus on what is in front of us ina statement wednesday biden campaign spokesman andrew bates said the release of the list was an attempt at dishonest media manipulation to distract from his response to the worst public health crisis in 100 years these documents simply indicate the breadth and depth of concern across the american government including among career officials over intelligence reports of michael flynn s attempts to undermine ongoing american national security policy through discussions with russian officials or other foreign representatives bates said the only people with questions to answer are grenell sen grassley and sen johnson for their gross

reservationshave already been placedin the senate race by other groups per kantar cmag data issues that matter cleaning up nearly 600 000 thousands jobs in the clean energy industry have been lost since the beginning of the pandemic according to an analysis from the bw research firm cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidarsays the majority of these jobs were lost in april and total cumulative losses now represent more than double the past three years of industry wide clean energy employment growth a 17 drop in clean energy employment has essentially erased all the growth the industry experienced the last few years bw research previously estimated that half a million or about 15 of all clean energy jobs would be lost by the end of june now forecasts predict a quarter of the clean energy workforce or roughly 850 000 jobs could disappear by the end of the second quarter seven out of every ten clean energy jobs lost over the last month came from energy efficiency the largest clean energy sector renewable electric power generation is also experiencing steep job declines as is clean vehicle work and the clean transmission distribution and storage sectors california has been hit the hardest losing nearly 80 000 jobs or 15 of the clean energy workforce florida georgia texas and michigan have all lost more than 20 000 clean energy jobs vote by mail a new non profit organization voteamerica backed by more than 5 million in initial funding will focus on vote by mail efforts ahead of the november presidential election the organization led by voting rights activist debra cleaver is also launching a new tool that lets voters request an absentee ballot online without having to interact with hard to navigate government processes cleaver toldcbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidarthat her goal is to proactively reach out to voters and guide them through the process we re not even looking at this point to increase turnout we are just looking to maintain an acceptable level of turnout because it is entirely possible that if people don t navigate the vote by mail process that we will have midterm level turnout in a presidential election year cleaver said the new online tool available atvoteamerica comallows voters to check their voter registration status and apply for an absentee ballot cleaver explained that voter registration tools are much easier because every state except wyoming and new hampshire will accept the same form but registering to vote by mail is a bit more complicated cleaver said because it s all state and election specific cleaver said her organization s new tool gives voters who want a mail in ballot the right form and it also gives you the right mailing address there are 10 000 mailing addresses and it is so much more complicated than voter registration cleaver said another feature that her team is working on will allow voters in 15 states to give her organization permission to submit vote by mail request forms on their behalf according to cleaver 15 states don t have an online tool for voters to submit requests for vote by mail and require them to fax in the form no one has a fax machine cleaver said this means that they don t need to print and then mail this seems like such a small thing but asking people to print and mail a form in 2020 is asking them to do something that is almost impossible she is urging states to be proactive about vote by mail efforts ahead of the november presidential election and thinks it s possible that we will only be able to hold this election via vote by mail unless we have a vaccine by election day cleaver said the majority of americans are going to vote by mail this year congressional coverage in the house california former navy fighter pilot mike garcia is poised

november race where the two are slated for a rematch this is only one step in the process and i look forward to having a vigorous debate about the issues in the upcoming november 2020 election

california democrats the republican national committee and the republican party of california spent nearly 1 million in support of garcia the investments included field staff four different unique pieces of mailers that went out to about 100 000 voters and data to target voters needed for turnout the republicans working on this race made over 1 4 million voter contacts in the district and the team sent over 300 000 texts to voters in cd25 trump victory spokesperson samantha zager said the gop s path to winning back the house runs through california zager added that despite the best attempts of gov gavin newsom and california democrats to rig the election in favor of their failed candidate californians rejected their tired socialist policies in favor of mike garcia eight house seats including the one california s 25th congressional district will be up for re election this november nebraska kara eastman locked up the democratic nomination in nebraska s 2nd congressional

omaha metro suburban district biden 52 vs trump 41 the national republican congressional committee has previously called eastman comrade kara in anticipation that she would be the nominee again
