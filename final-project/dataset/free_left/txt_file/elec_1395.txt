the big idea hillary clinton and donald trump each reluctantly backed down last night on major things that threatened to derail their campaigns the clinton foundation announced it will no longer accept donations from corporations or foreign entities if hillary is elected president bill clinton told foundation staff that the final meeting of the clinton global initiative will be held next month and he announced that he will stop giving paid speeches the former president who turns 70 on friday said he will resign from the board and the foundation will only accept contributions from u s citizens and independent charities according to the ap s ken thomas who broke the story meanwhile trump expressed remorse for the first time since he got into the race 14 months ago sometimes in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues you don t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing i have done that the republican nominee reading from a teleprompter said during a rally in charlotte and believe it or not i regret it i do regret it particularly where it may have caused personal pain both candidates are extraordinarily reluctant to ever acknowledge wrongdoing even tacitly because they believe doing so projects weakness this is why last night was so remarkable and may represent a true pivot point in the race think about clinton s evolving explanations for her private email server through the 2016 cycle and her defense of her support for the iraq war during the 2008 race it took her until 2014 to say a 2002 vote was a mistake there are literally dozens of examples of trump hurting himself by refusing to admit that he went too far think about his attacks on gold star parents khizr and ghazala khan john not a war hero mccain judge gonzalo curiel and ted cruz s father rafael whom he claimed was with lee harvey oswald shortly before john f kennedy s assassination he also declined to express regret after mocking a reporter with a disability and calling mexican immigrants rapists hillary has now implicitly acknowledged that the clinton foundation is a major liability to her campaign regardless of her campaign s spin and inevitable denials the decision comes amid mounting criticism of how the foundation operated during her tenure as secretary of state potentially allowing donors to seek special access through her government post abby phillip and rosalind s helderman report donald a former donor to the group often accuses hillary of engaging in pay to play practices in particular he says the 25 million the foundation took from saudi arabia undercuts his opponent s rhetoric on women s rights but he s inconsistent about his messaging he also often levels unsubstantiated charges that overshadow any accurate lines of attack and make it easier for the war room in brooklyn to push back by muddying the water a traditional gop opponent running a disciplined campaign and spending meaningful money on negative tv ads could probably more effectively use the clinton foundation as a bludgeon to depict hrc as a shady shakedown artist who looks out more for her rich cronies and deep pocketed foreigners than working class americans struggling to catch a break message testing and focus groups including those conducted by democrats have shown there are some particularly potent and totally true lines of attack among them there is no evidence that hillary clinton or her top aides completed ethics training when they started at the state department as required by federal law mcclatchy s anita kumar reported yesterday state department records show only three of nine top clinton aides took the mandated training for new employees records also suggest that none of seven top aides required to take subsequent annual training completed it no records indicate whether clinton herself took any training many of the aides still work for clinton clinton s campaign did not respond to questions clinton has been getting hammered in the court of elite opinion the post s editorial board lamented the porous ethical wall between the foundation and the state department in a sunday editorial as secretary she pledged to keep her official world and her family s foundation separate and she failed to keep them separate enough such sloppiness would not be acceptable in the white house a tuesday editorial in the boston globe that went further calling for the clinton foundation to shut down altogether went viral it d be impossible to keep the foundation open without at least the appearance of a problem former pennsylvania governored rendell a close clinton ally told the new york daily news last week back to trump s speech in charlotte last night showed that kellyanne conway is now calling the shots in covering this week s shake up the 202 has primarily focused on breitbart executive stephen bannon becoming the campaign s chief executive and probably has given insufficient attention to conway taking over as manager conway is a pollster who specializes in helping conservative men reach out to women in early july she told our danielle paquette that she didn t like trump s name calling and said she really wants him to avoid criticizing people s looks and mental capacity maybe she said it s just the mother in me the full piece is worth rereading we ve written a lot about bannon s push to let trump be trump but clearly conway is trying to talk some political sense into the candidate and explaining how much his insult laden approach has damaged his standing with the women who will decide this election but there are many reasons to doubt the sincerity of trump s 11th hour conversion he s clearly desperate to turn around his sinking campaign and he did not specify last night what he was apologizing for or to whom and just like the man who faux apologizes to his wife by saying i m sorry you re mad trump at one point couched his penchant for divisive rhetoric by saying sometimes i can be too honest was he being too honest when he laced into mccain curiel and the khans trump has until very recently refused to express any regret for what he said about them what changed it was the third time in the past four days that trump read a speech off a teleprompter a practice he once routinely mocked he clearly did not write the words he uttered the language and tone sounded nothing like him the humility he expressed last night is part of a broader and renewed effort to rebrand trump as more presidential jose a delreal robert costa and jenna johnson report that effort will continue today with a trip to louisiana to tour flooded areas conway said on cnn yesterday that trump will finally begin preparing for the first debate this weekend evidence that the candidate recognizes he must deliver a command performance to keep his hopes alive how long can this last we still believe that the 70 year old is at heart fundamentally incapable of changing it is hard to imagine him going on some kind of apology tour and becoming self disciplined in a sustained way he s plainly happiest when he s feuding with someone and putting down others while you were sleeping

damagingproperty at a gas station in rio from dave sheinin dom phillips and joshua partlow an officialapology overnight the u s olympic committee issued a statement that acknowledged a version of events that involved an argument spurred by an act of vandalism committed by one of the athletes the statement concluded by saying we apologize to our hosts in rio and the people of brazil for this distracting ordeal in the midst of what should rightly be a celebration of excellence an attorney for jimmy feigen said he will pay more than 10 000 to a brazilian charity to leave the country under brazilian law his attorney said a donation can be made to avoid criminal prosecution he did not say what charge was potentially facing feigen matt bonesteel lochte remainsin the u s having left rio on tuesday and teammates gunnar bentz andjack conger were cleared to leave last night what really happened the incident appears to have stemmed from a drunken pit stop at a gas station bathroomaround 6 a m surveillance footage appears to show at least one of the swimmers pull off the metal door to the bathroom in the video gas station employees observe the athletes then escort them out of the bathroom in another clip from a different camera angle the athletes quickly seat themselves on the ground and raise their hands as if ordered by a person with a gun the police chief confirmed a guard had produced a firearm to contain the swimmers so they could not leave without paying damages the firearm was used in a situation in which they were contained when they were contained the firearm was put away he said brazilians have reacted with anger and indignation at an apparently false crime report that only served to boost the perception of rio de janeiro as a lawless chaotic city that was unprepared to host an olympics the city police chief said lochte and the others owed rio an apology for having stained the city for a fantasy as the american swimmers left the police station thursday evening they were swarmed by a crowd of journalists amid shouts of liars by some in english the post s sally jenkins eviscerates lochte as the dumbest bell that ever rang in a spot oncolumn two things are going on here lochte s self promoting prevarications and the sensitivity of rio authorities who have been portrayed as incapable of keeping athletes safe amid other olympic breakdowns there have been a lot of genuine robberies of olympic athletes and officials the police need to show that fears are overstated and these games are secure though they are not particularly and the stupid americans offered them something with which to save face lochte s conceit intersected with a delicate political issue and it made a perfect storm his claim to nbc that men posing as police pulled over the taxi and he heroically resisted the robbers with a gun pressed to his forehead was an especially ludicrous detail and the very thing that drew the attention of authorities who know full well that anyone who defies a bandit in rio gets shot on the spot and they don t leave you with your cellphone lochte s done as a public figure of course which is probably the most effective form of justice for someone who apparently so craves attention oblivion is what he deserves how it s playing in the tabloids tomorrow s cover ryan lochte is everything the world hates about americans https t co

november trump spokeswoman katrina pierson on live television accused clinton of a rare brain disease with which she has never been diagnosed what s new are the other reports of the observations of clinton s behavior and mannerisms specifically with what you just showed in those previous clips as well as her dysphasia the fact that she s fallen she has had a concussion pierson charged on msnbc dysphasia is defined as the loss of or deficiency in the power to use or understand language as a result of injury to or disease of the brain pierson s accusations come after clinton s campaign has refuted the conspiracy theories releasing multiple fact checking articles and a statement from clinton s doctor saying she is in excellent health it s something that needs to be addressed pierson continued she s taken a lot of time off the campaign trail aaron blake gov scott walker pushed back on trump ally roger stone s allegations that he and the reince priebus machine rigged as many as

columbia he quipped wisconsin state journal david a fahrenthold has the latest on trump s dubious claims of charitable giving this time on his nbc show the apprentice for trump the apprentice and later the celebrity apprentice helped reestablish him as a national figure after his fall into debt and corporate bankruptcies in the 1990s on screen trump was a wise tough businessman and at times a kind hearted philanthropist willing to give away thousands on a whim on air trump seemed to be explicit that this wasn t tv fakery the money he was giving was his own out of my wallet trump said in one case out of my own account he said in another but when the cameras were off the payments came from other people s money the post tracked all the personal gifts that trump promised on the show but could not confirm a single case in which trump actually sent a gift from his own pocket in 2012 trump became more generous on the air giving six 10 000 donations in a single episode in one example his gifts brought one insult comedian to tears but a mystery remained what happened in 2012 to make trump so much more generous on the air in the tax records of the trump foundation there is no record of a donation from trump himself in 2012 but in 2012 the trump foundation s records show a large gift from nbc the network that aired the show that was more than enough to cover all the foundation s gifts to celebrity apprentice contestants charities both before 2012 and since for nbc trump s personal donations made for better tv giving uplifting notes to the firings and burnishing the reputation of trump the show s star did nbc give trump s foundation money so that trump could appear to be more generous on camera three must reads about paul manafort tom hamburger dana priest and andrew roth have the backstory on how trump s campaign chairmanrevived his career and his business fortunes in ukraine manafort s 2005 entry into ukrainian politics and finances came when he signed on as an adviser to the steel magnate rinat akhmetov one of ukraine s richest oligarchs and a key supporter of yanukovych and the party of regions manafort s first job was to burnish the local and international reputation of a company owned by akhmetov based in the russian speaking industrial donetsk region over time manafort s role with the party expanded as manafort built a political consulting practice in ukraine he also developed financial connections with wealthy figures in the region some of whom face ongoing scrutiny from the justice department in 2008 he tried to develop an 850 million manhattan luxury apartment project with dmitry firtash a ukrainian energy tycoon with a history of legal trouble u s prosecutors charged firtash in 2013 with money laundering and bribery in another business venture oleg deripaska a russian aluminum magnate accused manafort in a court in the cayman islands of taking nearly 19 million intended for investments then not accounting for the money manafort insisted he had cut his ties with his ukrainian client in 2014 but former colleagues however say he continued to work for the party and was seen in the country as recently as october ukraine releases more details on payments for trump aide from the new york times the ukrainian authorities under pressure to bolster their assertion that once secret accounting documents show cash payments from a pro russian political party earmarked for manafort on thursday released line item entries some for millions of dollars the former party member vitaly a kalyuzhny for a time chairman of the ukraine parliament s international relations committee had signed nine times for receipt of payments designated for manafort according to serhiy a leshchenko a member of parliament who has studied the documents the ledger covered payments from 2007 to 2012 when mr manafort worked for the party and its leader viktor f yanukovych ukraine s former president who was deposed trump advisers waged covert influence campaign by the ap s jeff horwitz and chad day a firm run by trump s campaign chairman directly orchestrated a covert washington lobbying operation on behalf of ukraine s ruling political party attempting to sway american public opinion in favor of the country s pro russian government manafort and his deputy rick gates never disclosed their work as foreign agents as required under federal law the lobbying included attempts to gain positive press coverage of ukrainian officials in the nyt wsj and the ap another goal undercutting american public sympathy for the imprisoned rival of ukraine s then president the emails appear to contradict the assertion that the nonprofit s lobbying campaign operated independently from manafort s firm in papers filed in the u s senate mercury and the podesta group listed the european nonprofit as an independent nonpolitical client the firms said the center stated in writing that it was not aligned with any foreign political entity the emails show that gates personally directed two washington lobbying firms to set up meetings between a top ukrainian official and senators and congressmen on influential committees involving ukrainian interests gates noted in the emails that ukraine s foreign minister did not want to use his own embassy in the united states to help coordinate the visits and gates directed efforts to undercut sympathy for yulia tymoshenko an imprisoned rival of then president viktor yanukovych more fallout fromthe breitbart ization of the gop former breitbart news spokesman kurt bardella slammed stephenbannon for regularly disparaging minorities women and immigrants saying editorial meetings for the publication often sounded like a white supremacist rally this is someone who has a very low moral compass he said on abc s powerhouse politics podcast and the idea that this is the type of person that donald trump as the republican nominee as president would have closest to him is very disturbing bannon s ascension to the post of trump campaign ceo represents a dangerous seizure of the conservative movement by the alt right anotherex breitbart employee ben shapiro writes in an op ed for the post it comes as a surprise or at least it should that the rnc appears ready to go along with the bannon breitbart trump takeover over the party even as the trump campaign s latest move means rnc chairman reince priebus now sits effectively side by side with alt right trump fans broad swaths of the alt right by contrast believe in a creed free race based nationalism insisting among other things that birth on american soil confers superiority the alt right sees limited government constitutionalism as pass it holds that only nationalist populism on the basis of shared tribal identity can save the country it s a movement shot through with racism and anti semitism now it is this is the cast of characters and their enablers to whom trump has turned bannon is the guy who ushered along the twisted turn at breitbart if republicans aren t careful he ll inflict similar damage on their party now that he s the top man running their standard bearer s campaign reacting to trump bringing on bannon stuart stevens mitt romney s chief strategist in 2012 told bloomberg this is the bunker scene in downfall only the trump crowd won t tell hitler the truth it s utter madness trump is a nut and he likes to surround himself with nuts bannonis already making animprint the trump campaign hired an ex sarah palin aide pam pryor to oversee its faith and christian outreach per thewall street journal a secretive donor has more sway than ever over trump s orbit the new york times nicholas confessore reports on how his deep pocketed family helped put the shake up into motion and now has close allies in positions of authority bannon s ascension on wednesday urged on mr trump by rebecca mercer among others shows how a cadre of strategists super pacs and political organizations quietly nurtured by her family have emerged to play a pivotal role in mr trump s presidential campaign over more than half a decade ms mercer s father the new york investor robert mercer has carved an idiosyncratic path through conservative politics spending tens of millions of dollars to outflank his own party s consultant class and unnerve its established powers his fortune has financed think tanks and insurgent candidates super pacs and media watchdogs lobbying groups and grass roots organizations many of them are now connected one way or another to mr trump s presidential bid mr trump s new campaign manager kellyanne conway is a veteran republican pollster who previously oversaw a super pac financed by the mercers and bannon oversees breitbart a company to which mercer reportedly invested 10 million several years ago and likely still has a stake when in doubt blame the media in charlotte last night trump said the media created some of the controversies that have dogged him the establishment media doesn t cover what really matters in this country or what s really going on in people s lives he said they will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what i said in new hampshire yesterday mike pence said the press not trump is to blame for the ticket s slide in the polls just about every day the national media latches onto some issue about my running mate it really does the indiana governor said in manchester i mean the media is so busy parsing every word that donald trump said in the last 30 minutes they don t have time to cover what the clintons have been up to for the last 30 years time but at what cost an important factor in the rise of trump only 32 percent of republicans trusted the media a great deal or a fair amount in gallup polling from last year which is one reason so many of the tough stories on trump have been tuned out by his supporters we ve created this monster business insider s oliver darcy posted the transcript of a thought provoking interview he did with conservative wisconsin radio host charlie sykes a prominent critic of the gop nominee about how significant distrust of the media has been in both the rise and resilience of trump it s worth reading in full we ve basically eliminated any of the referees the gatekeepers sykes said there s nobody let s say that donald trump basically makes whatever you want to say whatever claim he wants to make and everybody knows it s a falsehood the big question of my audience it is impossible for me to say that by the way you know it s false and they ll say why i saw it on allen b west or they ll say i saw it on a facebook page and i ll say the new york times did a fact check and they ll say oh that s the new york times that s bull expletive there s nobody you can t go to anybody and say look here are the facts and i have to say that s one of the disorienting realities of this political year you can be in this alternative media reality and there s no way to break through it and i swim upstream because if i don t say these things from some of these websites then suddenly i have sold out then they ll ask what s wrong with me for not repeating these stories that i know not to be true when this is all over we have to go back there s got to be a reckoning on all this we ve created this monster sykes added and look i m a conservative talk show host all conservative hosts have basically established their brand as being contrasted to the mainstream media so we have spent 20 years demonizing the liberal mainstream media and by the way a lot of it has been justifiable there is a real bias but at a certain point you wake up and you realize you have destroyed the credibility of any credible outlet out there and i am feeling to a certain extent that we are reaping a whirlwind at that and i have to look in the mirror and ask myself to what extent did i contribute i ll be honest the bias of the mainstream media has been a staple for every conservative talk show host every conservative pundit for as long as i can remember going way back into the 1960s with william f buckley jr the daily hillary clinton told fbi investigatorsthat colin powell advised her to use a private email account the account is included in the notes the federal bureau of investigation handed over to congress on tuesday relaying details behind the fbi s decision not to charge clinton the new york times samy chozick reports separately in a 2009 email exchange that also emerged during the f b i questioning mrs clinton who had already decided to use private email asked mr powell about his email practices when he was the nation s top diplomat under george w bush according to a person with direct knowledge of mr powell s appearance in the documents clinton held a closed door meeting with top law enforcement officers from around the country in new york seeking to discuss policing and racial tensions that have been exposed by recent killings john wagner and abby phillip it s obvious that recent events from dallas and baton rouge to milwaukee and across the country underscore how difficult and important the work is ahead of us to repair the bonds of trust and respect between our police officers and our communities clinton said before dismissing reporters we have to be clear eyed about the challenges we face we can t ignore them and certainly we must not inflame them clinton has sought to toe a somewhat narrow line expressing support for officers while sympathizing with the concerns of black lives matter activists and others outraged by discriminatory conduct trump meanwhile has cast himself as the law and order candidate blasting clinton in rallies as someone who is against the police i m on your side a thousand percent trump said during the meeting with a fraternal order of police chapter this week awkward trump and clinton have set up white
