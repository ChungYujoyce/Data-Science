nation the grim march to reopen the country continues as unemployment soars to levels unseen since the great depression the jobs numbers for april are abysmal twenty and a half million people lost their jobs last month thirty three million have filed for unemployment in just the last six weeks one in seven working americans are out of a job will the president push for more federal aid to help those who are struggling president donald trump well we re in no rush we re in no rush margaret brennan the covid 19 numbers are staggering too there are now four million confirmed cases worldwide more than 1 3 million just in the u s where the death toll is seventy eight thousand and rising dr tom frieden as bad as this has been it s just the beginning margaret brennan despite the dire warnings from medical experts the do what i say not what i do mindset at the white house continues as two staffers with close proximity to the president and vice president test positive for the virus and three top coronavirus task force members quarantined the cdc recommends americans wear masks but that s not enforced at the white house president donald trump well i feel about vaccines like i feel about tests this is going to go away without a vaccine it s going to go away and it s we re not going to see it again hopefully after a period of time margaret brennan that type of wishful thinking drew a rare rebuke from the president s predecessor in a recording obtained by yahoo news former president obama called the response anemic and spotty president barack obama it has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset of what s in it for me and to heck with anybody else when that mindset is operationalized in our government margaret brennan we ll talk with white house economic adviser kevin hassett as well as former google ceo eric schmidt he s now leading a project to reimagine parts of the economy doctor christopher murray director of the institute for health metrics and evaluation will share brand new covid 19 projections with us and we ll hear from former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb finally with college graduations canceled or going virtual this year we ll ask the president of the university of virginia jim ryan what challenges school officials are facing as they plan for the fall it s all just ahead on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation we begin today with the financial fallout from the covid 19 pandemic the numbers are brutal the official unemployment rate jumped more than 10 points from 4 4 percent for march to april s 14 7 percent cbs news national correspondent mark strassmann is in atlanta mark mark strassmann cbs news national correspondent good morning margaret if you think about it one month is all it took one month for the best jobs economy in the last fifty years to plummet into worries about a second great depression begin vt mark strassmann hunger is motivating by 5 00 am in connecticut this grocery giveaway had a line of cars waiting man we need food my son was laid off my daughter in law was laid off and i m handicapped mark strassmann nearly one in five mothers with children under twelve now report their families don t have enough to eat today s food lines recall soup lines during the great depression jill schlesinger cbs news business analyst jillonmoney there is a broader unemployment rate a rate that encompasses people who may be sidelined because they are not actually looking for work actively and that rate is nearly twenty three percent unemployment mark strassmann that is a depression era number like hunger marchers in 1932 protesters in 2020 pushed to reclaim their piece of america crowd in unison you work for us mark strassmann and its economy in deep freeze on this mother s day weekend this protest in olympia washington drew more than one thousand people they demanded the governor speed up his reopening plan tesla is fed up with california let its factory reopen or the carmaker says it will move to texas or nevada and florida is reopening salons and barber shops tomorrow ron desantis there was a lot of doomsday predictions for florida those have not borne out mark strassmann maybe not but last week was florida s deadliest since its covid outbreak began so much about america s economy now rides on the unknown containing covid 19 whether the virus resurges later this year and when people feel safe again polls show most americans expect a full recovery to take at least a year some financial analysts argue count on a decade jill schlesinger any hope of what we would like to call a v shaped recovery one where you go down sharply and recover sharply i think that s thrown out the window end vt mark strassmann georgia led the country with its limited reopening consumer response has been mixed and many eligible stores have stayed closed and in the roughly two weeks since the state eased its restrictions new covid cases have gone up more than twenty percent margaret margaret brennan mark strassmann thanks cbs news senior foreign correspondent elizabeth palmer has our report about what s going on in the rest of the world elizabeth palmer cbs news senior foreign correspondent elizapalmer margaret despite passing that grim milestone of four million cases the overall number of deaths every day is dropping thanks in part to controlled measures in new york and of course in europe but many countries are in the real thick of the crisis begin vt elizabeth palmer like russia yesterday was the anniversary of the end of world war ii but there was little to celebrate in spite of moscow s ultra strict lockdown russia reported ten thousand new covid cases every day last week in neighboring belarussia in spite of a serious outbreak president lukashenko remains in covid denial alexander lukashenko speaking foreign language elizabeth palmer he s called it a psychosis and welcomed huge crowds to his country s victory day ceremony on saturday there were crowds in brasilia too demonstrating in support of the world s other great covid denier president jair bolsonaro who still refuses to social distance though rio s famous christ the redeemer statute wearing a mask shows he is out of step with local officials fighting to control the outbreak south korea has opened its baseball season with masked cheerleaders performing in empty stadiums strict measures early on here have almost eliminated covid but president moon jae in warned today moon jae in speaking foreign language elizabeth palmer it isn t over until it s over after nightclubs in seoul had to close abruptly when there was a fresh outbreak now it s the developing world that s being closely watched by public health experts in africa and southeast asia the virus appears to be spreading more slowly maybe because the population tends on average to be young but no one is sure and it might well be that the worst is yet to come end vt elizabeth palmer here in britain prime minister boris johnson is due to go on television tonight to explain how we get out of our lockdown and there is some speculation that the roadmap will include a two week quarantine period margaret for anyone arriving on these shores end vt margaret brennan elizabeth palmer thank you kevin hassett is a white house economic adviser and he joins us this morning good morning to you kevin kevin hassett white house economic adviser good morning margaret brennan you called this one of the worst jobs reports ever we know that this has hit hispanic and african american population exceptionally hard and that these numbers we re seeing likely don t reflect the real pain out there where is the bottom to this kevin hassett well you know you are exactly right to emphasize that that the african american community and the hispanic american community have been hit especially hard by this jobs report with both of those communities which were really experiencing record low unemployment rates even in january seeing massive massive increases in unemployment you know right now looking across the u s there are more than thirty million people that are getting initial claims for unemployment insurance and that s the biggest negative shock to the jobs market that we ve seen since world war ii to get unemployment rates like the ones that we re about to see to get back to your question which i think will climb up towards twenty percent by next month you have to really go back to the great depression to see that now there are a lot of economic differences between right now and the great depression here we understand why the economy is slowing down and we expect that we can reverse it whereas in the depression there were a lot of other things a lot of policy errors and so on that made the whole thing drag out and so i think if you look at the congressional budget office they currently forecast that the second half of the year will be one of recovery you know god willing that s what s going to happen and i think that that s the view that s pretty much shared by the white house and so i think you could expect to see jobs probably trough you know in may or june margaret brennan may or june would be the low point for unemployment at what what rate kevin hassett that that that s about what we expect yeah you know i m looking for rates north of twenty sadly margaret brennan north of twenty kevin hassett in part part of the part of this is not really as science as much as just arithmetic margaret brennan right after the financial crisis it got it took a decade to get back to employment levels prior to that you said on friday that when it comes to this crisis there s kind of a silver lining in the jobs report that you saw because you said almost everybody accounted for the increase in unemployment said they expect to go back to work within six months i m sure they hope to but isn t that just wishful thinking at this point you don t know that kevin hassett right yeah nobody knows it and you know and it s very unsatisfying just like none of us really you know when the the virus is going to be either treatable or there ll be a vaccine or you know it ll be gone in which case we could really just go back to our to our lives but the fact is that if you think about the things that would happen that would make it hard to turn on the economy that s like bankruptcies and business failures and so on we ve built a bridge to the other side by having these business small business loans called the ppp loans margaret brennan mm hm kevin hassett by having a main street lending facility so that the fed is making cash available to big businesses too and the idea is to try to keep firms up and running or maybe not running but up and connected with their workers so that when we turn the switch back on they can get going right away now again nobody knows for sure whether it s going to work margaret brennan right kevin hassett exactly that way but the congressional budget office that s their median expectation right now margaret brennan if you look at the reality for the people who are getting hit the hardest right now brookings says one in every five u s children are going hungry what responsibility does the white house have to respond to that don t you need to look at doing things like increasing the amount of money available for food stamps kevin hassett right we we need to look at everything you know we ve mailed very large checks to like more than a hundred and eighty million families to help them with those costs margaret brennan are you going to have to do that again kevin hassett and you re right to emphasize the schools so so many children get two meals a day at school you know we ve got schools within a few miles of my house here in dc where we re really without the school meals a lot of the kids that go to those schools the principal tells me would go hungry and right now our schools are closed and and those kids who aren t going to school by the way many of them don t have internet so they re not connected to society it s a terrible tragedy and we re looking at everything we can do to help with that and so the white house has an opportunity council that s putting together a major proposal that we expect is going to be part of whatever happens in the phase four deal to fill in the gaps that we re noticing as we watch the data but absolutely there s a lot that needs to be done especially for the most disadvantaged margaret brennan so you just referenced a phase four deal larry kudlow one of the white house advisers said this week that you re putting off any talks about more emergency rescue packages until maybe even june kevin hassett mm hm margaret brennan why do you think you can wait that long kevin hassett right well well here s what we are doing okay we ve done this you know maybe in counting the fed numbers up to about nine trillion worth of actions and now what we re doing is and the states around the country you know are starting to turn their economies back on and so what we re doing is we re watching very closely what happens to those states get their economies up relatively quickly does the opening of the state lead to a new outbreak of the disease we ve built a bridge that pretty much you know lasts margaret brennan right kevin hassett for for quite a bit of time right now with that nine trillion dollars and then the question really becomes is phase four really going to be extending the bridge because we re not there yet or is it going to be focused on growth and making sure that now that we re on the other side that we have a healthy economy again and so right now what we re doing margaret brennan mm hm kevin hassett is basically building a plan for either scenario and we re going to be ready to act as soon as we need to but but i think that right now we have bought some time with all the money that we ve thrown at the economy and we ve been using the time to do things like develop treatments improve our treatments learn more about social distancing and so on margaret brennan yeah but companies and employers need to know what to do to safely re open the white house is testing staff regularly is that what you re advising america s businesses to do when will the cdc release specific guidance kevin hassett you know i i m not a doctor i m just an economist and i i could tell you margaret brennan well neither are these ceos kevin hassett that as as we learned this margaret brennan that s why they re asking for the cdc to provide guidance kevin hassett yeah no that s right that s but i m going to say that of course we need to ramp up testing that s something that the president has heavily emphasized and just last week we had one day where there were three hundred thousand tests and then there is a new test approved that will hopefully increase that by an order of magnitude but you re absolutely right that testing is a key component of it but even testing doesn t remove all risk and so the interesting sad thing about my my dear colleague who was stricken with the coronavirus this week is that we were getting tested because we re close to the president every day and even with that you know she tested negative one day and then positive the next day and she s going to work at a community where people are being tested and so this is a very very scary virus you know that that people are going to go back to work and they re going to be worried about things and it s going to take a while for things to get back to normal absolutely margaret brennan yeah so kevin hassett but what we can do is we maximize the chance that that happens quickly by making lots of testing available and that s why we ve focused so much energy on that margaret brennan i didn t hear a date on when that cdc guidance is going to be released but when it comes to your work environment you just described kevin hassett yeah margaret brennan do you wear a mask are you going to continue to show up for work at the white house kevin hassett you know i i ve got a mask right here and the fact is that that i practice aggressive social distancing i ll wear a mask when i feel it s necessary it is scary to go to work you know i i was not part of the white house in march i think that i d be a lot safer if i was sitting at home than i would be going to the west wing but you know it s the time when people have to step up and serve their country and if i think about the amazing accomplishments of the team that we put together that s been down in the basement of the white house getting data from all over the government to help us decide how to solve the ventilator problem and the ppe problem and everything but i think everybody knows that they go into work you ve been in the west wing you know it s a it s a small crowded place it s you know it s a little bit risky but but you have to do it because you have to serve your country and there are a lot of things that you can t do except there like if you re going to have secure communications you need to be in the situation room margaret brennan right kevin hassett thank you for your time we ll be back in one minute with some new coronavirus projections announcements margaret brennan one of the national death toll models that the white house is watching closely is from the university of washington s institute for health metrics and evaluation you ve often heard it referred to as ihme and they have some brand new projections out this morning institute director doctor christopher murray is in seattle and he joins us good morning christopher murray m d director institute for health metrics and evaluation university of washington good morning margaret brennan what is your model showing you today christopher murray m d so our projections through till august 4th are up we re up to a hundred and thirty seven thousand deaths that we expect to see and that s the effect of two things going in opposite directions some good ish news coming out of new york and new jersey and michigan where the death cases and death numbers are are coming down faster than expected some other states where cases and deaths are going up more than we expected illinois and then arizona florida california as examples of that and so it s the balancing of those that is driving our numbers and then of course we re seeing just explosive increases in mobility in a number of states that we expect will translate into more cases and deaths you know in ten days from now margaret brennan this is today the second time in about a week that you ve raised these projections what s driving the change christopher murray m d well what s driving the change is simply put the rise in mobility and and that s the key driver we re seeing in some states you know a twenty percentage point increase in just ten days in mobility and that will translate into more human contact more transmission and then the other thing that we re we re seeing in some states is which is why we like to to revise the forecast on a very regular basis is that we re just seeing more cases and deaths than expected in certain places but it s mostly mobility that s driving up the numbers margaret brennan and you are looking at mobility through tracking cell phone data is this mobility because of loosened restrictions or is it just quarantine fatigue and people are going out and about more than they should christopher murray m d you know i think it is a bit of both we re seeing increases in mobility even in anticipation of the relaxation of social distancing but there s definitely a correlation the places that are taking off the social distancing mandate the bump in mobility appears to be larger so somewhere like georgia which was one of the first we re seeing is in that category of of a pretty big increase so it s definitely a mixture of both we believe margaret brennan you know we spoke just before you with one of the white house economic advisers who said one of the reasons they re waiting on more emergency financial aid is because they want to see what happens in the states as they pull back restrictions and whether that leads to a new outbreak of the disease as kevin hassett put it do you have any indication that that is happening christopher murray m d well i think that the big challenge here is that when we model the relationship between mobility and transmission most of the data that s informing that is coming from when people reduce their mobility and we saw a reduction in transmission you know namely social distancing works now that we re coming out the big question mark is will people s own behavior acting responsibly wearing a mask avoiding physical coming into physical close contact will that be enough to counteract the effects of rising mobility and so we really are going to have to wait and see our suspicion is that there will be about ten days from now in these places that have had these big increases in mobility we are expecting to see a jump in cases margaret brennan and what what places what are the potential hotspots in the next ten days christopher murray m d well as i mentioned a moment ago the big increases in mobility there s five states at the top some of those have had modest epidemic so far so they may not be huge numbers but you know the top five in terms of increasing mobility are montana north dakota south dakota minnesota and georgia but there s another ten states or more where there s been a ten to fifteen percentage point increase of mobility so pretty pretty diverse so we may see quite a lot of states tipping towards increasing cases in the next two weeks margaret brennan would you advise americans to travel the treasury secretary was on another network this week and he said it is a great time for people to explore america would you advise them to do that christopher murray m d you know i would give people advice you know i tend to practice what i preach and so we re not traveling my family and i and have no intention of traveling and i think it s all part of trying to think about a route back to work and school and that entails you know trying to minimize exposure and you know close physical contact hard to do if you re traveling so personal advice would be you know protect yourselves wear a mask and and try to minimize interactions with with others margaret brennan what does the data tell you about how effective wearing a mask actually is christopher murray m d you know that s one of the big question marks we know that the medical masks are highly effective and also very not available nor is it likely that people are going to feel comfortable wearing medical masks and so the big question is the effectiveness of cloth masks we believe they are effective just how effective is the subject of a lot of research and discussion and i think you know we just don t have an exact number on it it s one of these factors that we re going to have to wait and watch and see what happens the good news is that there are there s more and more data coming in on who s wearing a face mask and we may be able to figure out from what s happening community by community across the u s margaret brennan mm hm christopher murray m d whether those places that are wearing masks more are seeing less transmission and so again margaret brennan okay christopher murray m d more data will teach us more margaret brennan we will be watching for that thank you doctor murray for that we ll be back in a moment with a lot more face the nation announcements margaret brennan the justice department dropped charges thursday against president trump s former national security adviser michael flynn who twice pled guilty to lying to the fbi about conversations he had with the russian ambassador to the u s attorney general william barr said the fbi did not have a basis for the investigation announcements margaret brennan we ll be right back with former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb former chairman and ceo of google eric schmidt and university of virginia president jim ryan announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we go now to westport connecticut and former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb good to have you back with us scott gottlieb m d former fda commissioner scottgottliebmd thank you margaret brennan we heard from the fda that they have given emergency use authorization for the first antigen test to discover covid 19 so that s any substance that causes your immune system to produce antibodies against it how significant is this authorization how will this work scott gottlieb m d well i think this kind of technology is a real game changer and this test was authorized by the fda under the leadership of jeff shuren who runs that device center in twenty four hours from receiving the application what it is it s a very rapid test that could be used in a doctor s office doctors now have about forty thousand of these sofia machines already installed in their offices and you do a simple nasal swab and the test itself scans for the antigens that the virus produces the test is about eighty five percent sensitive so let s say a hundred people come into a doctor s office who have covid 19 eighty five of them are going to be able to be tested positive with this test very quickly it s a cheap test it ll probably be about five dollars a test and you can get a result within five minutes for the other fifteen the doctors are going to have to have an index of suspicion that the patient may have covid 19 and send off one of the pcr based tests which take about twenty four hours to get the result back but for those eighty five patients that you could screen out right away you re getting a very fast result and you can start to take action immediately the company itself said that they re going to be able to produce about two hundred thousand of these tests starting right away but in several weeks they ll be able to produce up to 1 5 million a week so this dramatically expands our testing capacity as long as doctors are able to run these tests in their offices margaret brennan as long as they can run them how different is this kind of testing from what we ve heard so much about where states are struggling to get capacity and they re looking for you know reagents and cotton swabs does this solve those challenges scott gottlieb well it helps solve the challenges i mean every test paradigm is a little bit different it has pros and cons the pcr based tests where the states have struggled to get the testing supplies those are more accurate but they also take more time and they cost more to perform the reimbursement is about a hundred dollars maybe if you do that at scale you can get the cost down to fifty dollars there is point of care based systems like the abbott machine that the white house is using or the genexpert which is very reliable those take a little longer to get a result their sensitivity isn t as good as the pcr based machines with the exception of the genexpert which is very accurate these antigen based tests aren t as reliable meaning they re not as sensitive so they re going to miss some patients who have covid but in the hands of a doctor who already has a high index of suspicion that the patient may have the disease and if they get a negative test and they still think the patient may be infected they ll send off a pcr based test they allow you to dramatically expand testing and they re very cheap they re very easy to perform and again most doctors have these machines already in their offices they re using them for strep throat and flu the challenge is going to be what the guidance is from the cdc and public health agencies about how doctors test in their offices if turning over a positive case in your medical office means that you have to do a deep cleaning and quarantine your nursing staff and close your office doctors aren t going to be testing and that would be unfortunate because there s a big installed base of these tests already in place so cdc has to come out with flexible guidelines on how doctors can protect their offices and protect their staff and also be testing in the community because if we can t do that then we re not going to have access to tests and the challenge won t be the platforms there ll be plenty of capacity to perform tests the challenge will become where can you go get the test margaret brennan you said this could be more accurate than the testing system the white house is currently using let me ask you about these aides who have been testing positive at the white house our top three medical officials in the u s government are now in self quarantine because of possible exposure they work in a white house that s a fortress but the virus has still made it inside i want to play for you what president trump said this week when he revealed one of vice president pence s aides tested positive begin vt president trump she tested positive out of the blue this is why the whole concept of tests aren t necessarily great the tests are perfect but something can happen between a test where it s good and then something happens and all of a sudden she was tested very recently and tested negative and then today i guess for some reason she tested positive end vt margaret brennan the president seems to be doubting the value of testing in the workplace what s your view scott gottlieb well look i think testing has value in a workplace especially when you re dealing with places where there s people who are at higher risk of getting infected so you think about people who work on a shop floor or in a grocery store the machine the antigen based tests that we re talking about here that was just approved is actually less sensitive than a machine that the white house is using they re using an abbott platform but that flat platform also has false negatives meaning that sometimes patients people are going to have the virus but the test is going to say they don t there s machines that are more accurate than that abbott machine like the genexpert they take a little longer to perform the test the reason why the white house prefers the abbott machine is it gives a result in five to fifteen minutes genexpert takes about forty five minutes and so i think that s why they prefer that platform but this is why we need to have testing out in the community this is why we need very accurate tests if we re going to be testing asymptomatic people in the setting of a doctor s office where someone is symptomatic margaret brennan mm hm scott gottlieb using a test that doesn t have very high sensitivity might be okay because the doctor s going to run a confirmatory test anyway but in the setting of where you re testing people who are asymptomatic as the white house is doing and you re trying to catch that those people who don t have any symptoms you want a very sensitive test for that kind of a purpose margaret brennan yeah scott gottlieb and that s what we should be using out in the employment setting as well margaret brennan we ve talked a lot about remdesivir we interviewed the ceo of the company that makes that drug last week he told us at that time the government would be deciding who the drug gets to and where the rollout this week was pretty chaotic yesterday hhs revealed its new plan for distribution what does this indicate to you about how things will work in the future with other drugs or potentially a vaccine scott gottlieb well look i think we need to get a better system in place if the government s going to take control of the supply of these kinds of therapeutics and they don t necessarily have to do that they chose to do that they need to have a good system in place for allocation here in this case gilead gave a half a million doses to the federal government they distributed initially about four thousand in new york city which is the city that i m familiar with i think they should ve been trying to push out as many doses as fast as possible because more supply is coming into the market there s no reason to hoard it or hold onto it and so hopefully when they start to contemplate the next therapeutic and there will be more therapeutics in the fall or a vaccine and how they allocate that they re going to have a better system in place based on clinical need margaret brennan all right thank you very much for your insight doctor gottlieb scott gottlieb thanks a lot margaret brennan we ll be right back with a look at how some businesses may be looking a little different in the near future announcements margaret brennan we want to go now to the former ceo of google eric schmidt he is leading a new york commission to reimagine sectors of the economy in light of the coronavirus pandemic he joins us from miami this morning good morning to you eric schmidt former ceo and chairman of google ericschmidt good morning margaret brennan we just heard from one of the white house economic advisers that the the worst is yet to come on the unemployment front what jobs in your view will continue to exist eric schmidt well a lot will but they ll operate in different ways we re going to have to reimagine how the workplace works we re going to have to figure out how to get people into buildings that they re fearful of my guess is we ll have more demand for office space not less because people will want social distancing we re going to have to think about hub and spoke systems where local people don t travel so far because they don t want to be in public transit for so long so we re going to have to really rethink how businesses operate they need their employees back margaret brennan after 9 11 in in manhattan you saw people establish homes outside the city you saw businesses move and have backup facilities outside of major cities is there something that we know is in the works this time around eric schmidt you can be sure that something like that will happen if you think of it as an employer you have a bunch of employees some of whom are dying to get back to the office and some people who are afraid that if they go to the office they will die they re very concerned about they re immunocompromised or what have you so they re going to have to come up with flexible arrangements so imagine that there are three or four people one will go to the office one will stay home someone some will go to some local or near their near their town working environment it will change the pattern we ve had this situation where people move to super cities in these incredibly concentrated ways that will change in the next few years you don t need to be in the super city in order to participate in the ex excitement of these super cities the commission by the way is intending to work not just on the city but also suburban and all the rural folks we have to be sensitive to the fact that everybody has problems everyone has concerns and they re very different situations margaret brennan you know corporations are being forced to try to do things in a different way right now but many of them may use this as an excuse or as an accelerant to make eric schmidt right margaret brennan some big strategic shifts what does the economy look like on the other side of it what does that mean eric schmidt one way to think about this is that this one month two months period has brought forth ten years of forward change so all of a sudden the internet is no longer optional it s fundamental to doing business to operate to live our lives all sorts of much higher expectations as a result for example we need much better broadband in the rural areas another example will be tele health eighty percent of the visits to doctors are right now in tele health people have been wanting this to happen for years now using remote monitoring we can actually measure everybody and do it remotely and then only if you have to you go in to see the doctor and by the way that s more convenient for you as a as a patient there are all sorts of examples another thing that we ll have to do is we ll have to have all sorts of interesting sort of social monitoring of one kind or another to look for these hotspots so systems will have to be developed to see oh my god there s an outbreak over there let s get to it right now before the spread begins margaret brennan but one of the things that this crisis has also made obvious is not just income disparity but but access to internet as you just said if someone doesn t have access to broadband or they don t have the computer how do you make up for that difference who pays for that eric schmidt well we have to we have to solve that problem and when the government does another one of these huge stimulus bills let s put some stimulus into broadband access especially for rural areas the cities are in pretty good shape and then let s figure out a way for people who don t otherwise have access to computers through libraries or or whatever find a way for them to get access many people can access through their mobile phones that s another solution you can t participate in this new economy without access to the internet it s how you re going to learn it s how you re going to deliver services it s how you re going to market it by the way it s how you re going to sell margaret brennan mm hm eric schmidt right so sales people won t be traveling as much they are going to be doing it with the equivalent of zoom and other services like that margaret brennan but it s not just you re talking about federal funding to build out infrastructure like wifi but what we ve learned because of some of these backlogs in unemployment claims with the states is that their basic infrastructure their computers are so outmoded they can t even process the amount of demand right now where does that come from i mean you re talking about re not just rebuilding but you know completely remaking how states function eric schmidt what you re learning through this is that the government at the federal and state level have just terrible infrastructure in the software department eric schmidt they re still using cobol systems which is a pro system i programmed in forty five years ago and those systems you know the programmers are no longer with us so we ve really got to upgrade these systems and there are much better technologies that are much more secure much quicker and so forth you can see them in the in the private sector the public sector has lagged for whatever set of reasons because of this this will accelerate all of that if you look forward to it what you ll do as a citizen is many of your services will be online your health will be online much of your education will be online and then there ll be other systems like we need to figure out a way to de densify public transportation people will say it s better if you get on the subway now because it s less crowded right because you don t want to be on a subway when it s full of everybody margaret brennan mm hm eric schmidt these kinds of changes are easy for computer systems to do if they re in place margaret brennan the wall street journal is reporting this morning that the trump administration s in talks with intel and some other companies to move facilities back to the united states to have manufacturing be here do you see that change in the global supply chain happening eric schmidt well we ve built in the last ten or twenty years this extraordinarily efficient global supply chain with many many steps we ve now learned that it s not resilient there has been for at least a decade a great concern about our over reliance on taiwan in particular about foreign chip manufacturing and there is an initiative within the government which is very important that we get domestic supply of foundries literally the the places where chips are made and companies like intel and samsung and tsmc tsmc is the largest foundry it s in taiwan at the seven nanometre level trying to get them into our country so we have better control it s important from a standpoint of of our own economics it s also important for national security we want to make sure that our critical infrastructure is owned and controlled by america right margaret brennan mm hm eric schmidt never bet against america we are the innovators in our world we should be able to do this well margaret brennan we ll leave it on that note never bet against america thank you eric schmidt eric schmidt thank you margaret brennan we will be back in a moment announcements margaret brennan it s graduation season as students finish high school and college in the next few weeks the big question that students and parents have is what will the fall and their future look like jim ryan is the president of the university of virginia my alma mater as well as the alma mater of our executive producer mary hager and former face the nation moderator john dickerson wahoowa james ryan president university of virginia presjimryan wahoowa margaret margaret brennan so you have not yet canceled all summer courses or the fall semester james ryan right margaret brennan how do you make this decision what are you telling parents right now james ryan so we are in the midst of trying to figure out how we can have as many students back on grounds in the fall and in classrooms and to do that safely and we re working night and day to figure out exactly how to do that and we ll make an announcement about the fall in mid june we re trying to push back as far as we can so we ll have the best information when we make the decision but we also realize that people need to be able to make plans margaret brennan they certainly do but what do you mean when you say you know you re taking into consideration health standards do you expect to have to james ryan yeah margaret brennan test every student before they come back to grounds james ryan so you know i think in order for us to be able to have students back on grounds and in classrooms there are a few basic things we re going to need one is testing capacity i think we would need to test students when they first arrive and faculty and staff before the students arrive we re going to need to have the ability to do contact tracing we re going to need the ability to be able to isolate and quarantine students who have been exposed and then we re also going to need to enact a bunch of social distancing protocols in terms of how far away students need to be from each other in the classroom or in dining halls as you can imagine it s a it s a complicated task college campuses are a difficult and challenging place for contagious viruses margaret brennan what you just described is what mayors and governors tell me they have to do it sounds like you re planning for for basically a city james ryan that s it yeah margaret brennan what is what what is the state telling you will all virginia state schools make the same decision at the same time and do the same thing james ryan so we are in contact with the department of education and i m also in close contact with my colleagues at virginia colleges and universities and we are all trying to work against the same challenge and my hope is that there will be a set of guidelines that we can all agree to and all follow but not all of us are in the same situation as well some of us are have smaller campuses than others some are more local than others so i think we re all following the same principles and all guided by concerns around public health but because circumstances differ from campus to campus some might be able to open sooner rather than others some may be able to have more students back than others margaret brennan uva has a relatively high percentage of out of state and international students james ryan yeah margaret brennan as you look at at applicants you know how are you taking into consideration not just where people are coming from but how many people to accept at the university james ryan yeah so international students are are a particular challenge a number of them are not likely to be able to be back in time so one thing that we know for sure is that we will have courses that are online in order to provide an education to students who can t come back to campus that may be true for students who are out of state or in state who are at high risk as well but our admission season this year was remarkably strong we had a higher yield than we did last year and we fully expect to have a fully enrolled class when fall when fall comes around margaret brennan higher yield do you mean more acceptances james ryan i mean more people have accepted our offers of admission a higher percentage accepted our offer of admission than last year which is a little surprising given the uncertainty margaret brennan right uva obviously has a strong athletic program on the basketball front certainly on the football front as well those are also revenue streams what do you know about the athletics season what is the plan james ryan yeah that s a great question we re taking it day by day obviously we need to have students back on grounds before football can begin but our athletic director carla williams and our head football coach bronco mendenhall are committed first and foremost to the safety and well being of their players our student athletes and they ll begin practice when the medical experts tell them that it s safe to do so our hope obviously is that there s a football season this fall i don t imagine it will look like normal football seasons just like i don t imagine even if we have all students back on grounds it will look like a normal semester it will not be a normal semester next fall regardless of which path we follow margaret brennan so you know the federal government passed this massive package called the cares act and private universities with very substantial endowments like harvard and princeton took a lot of public pressure for even applying for any kind of financial help uva has an endowment just short of about ten billion dollars and did take it how do you explain that james ryan well we accepted the funding because it is helping our students half of the funding that we receive goes directly to students in need we created a student hardship fund that we ve been using to provide grants for technology for online learning for transportation for living expenses and those needs are only going to continue throughout the summer and the fall so half of the funding we received is directly related to providing assistance to our students margaret brennan mm hm james ryan the other half reimburses us for costs that we incurred margaret brennan okay james ryan including rebating housing and dining costs so we re really passing on these savings to our students and i think that s a good thing to do margaret brennan all right president ryan good luck to you and to all james ryan thank you very much margaret brennan the upcoming graduates james ryan thanks so much margaret brennan we ll be right back with a tribute to mothers
