advertisement supported by by jonathan martin cedar rapids iowa senator bernie sanders of vermont edged closer on friday to directly attacking hillary rodham clinton pointedly asking whether the democratic presidential front runner would support measures to break up the country s largest financial institutions and reinstate a firewall between commercial and investment banking mr sanders whose campaign for the democratic presidential nomination has galvanized liberal activists driven by questions of economic fairness highlighted his efforts to cut down the so called too big to fail banks and restore glass steagall the depression era banking law repealed under president bill clinton you ll have to ask hillary clinton about her views on whether she thinks we should break up these large financial institutions i do mr sanders an independent said at a news conference here you will have to ask her views on whether we should re establish glass steagall he boasted that he had not received financial contributions from goldman sachs which he said sought undue influence in american politics but stopped short of calling on mrs clinton to reject the nearly 50 000 in donations she has received from employees of the wall street firm that s her decision mr sanders said after pausing for a moment to consider the question mr sanders spoke the afternoon before the iowa democratic party s annual fund raising dinner the first event this year at which all of the party s five presidential candidates appeared together mrs clinton addressed her supporters at an early evening rally before the banquet but trained her fire entirely on republicans making no mention direct or implied of mr sanders donald j trump officially accepted the republican party s nomination on july 22 hillary clinton was officially nominated on july 26 at the democratic convention the banquet illustrated the populist fervor coursing through the democratic base offering an explanation for mr sanders early success mrs clinton received ovations for her attacks on some of the republican presidential hopefuls and gender oriented appeals but mr sanders and martin o malley a former maryland governor found booming applause for their full throated attacks on wall street and free trade deals asked whether mrs clinton would seek to break up the country s largest banks or reinstate glass steagall an aide to mrs clinton said she would speak in more detail about both issues in the coming weeks alan blinder an economist who is advising mrs clinton said this week that she would not attempt to revive glass steagall while some leading iowa democrats believe that mr sanders s rise will ultimately help mrs clinton restrain expectations here where she was defeated by barack obama in the 2008 caucuses mr sanders s growing support in the polls vast base of small dollar contributors and sizable crowds have prompted some of mrs clinton s backers to make not so subtle comments about the importance of nominating a candidate who can capture the white house we ve got to nominate somebody that can win and hillary is a winner michael fitzgerald iowa s state treasurer said at the clinton rally i don t have a lot of time to mess around like i used to i want to win said dale todd a democratic activist from cedar rapids who also spoke before mrs clinton took the stage privately mrs clinton s backers are blunter dismissing the possibility that mr sanders a 73 year old self declared socialist would be a viable general election candidate yet the sheer size of his crowds in iowa and beyond is creating awkwardness for mrs clinton she added the rally to her schedule her campaign said to give local supporters who had not purchased a ticket for the dinner a chance to see the former secretary of state she has been doing more such large scale events in part because they are crucial to organizing to that end every attendee was asked to sign a caucus commitment card upon entering the basement hall one side of which was lined with a surefire crowd builder boxes of free pizza these gatherings also though represent an effort to show that mrs clinton is herself capable of luring big audiences but the rally served to highlight her inability for now to attract crowds on the same scale as mr sanders whose iowa events have drawn more people than any other presidential candidate has in either party mrs clinton drew a few hundred people to her event here her campaign pegged it at 500 while mr sanders was met by about 2 500 at an event in council bluffs this month the vermont senator did not seek to compete with a head to head rally but he joined a group of veterans friday afternoon upstairs in the same building where mrs clinton spoke standing beneath a giant grant wood designed stained glass window honoring three centuries of american soldiers mr sanders recounted his work as chairman of the senate veterans affairs committee solemnly recounting the cost of war but he turned notably more energetic when he took questions about his campaign i think that there is a growing frustration all over this country for establishment politics for establishment economics he said before inveighing against what he called a corrupt system advertisement
