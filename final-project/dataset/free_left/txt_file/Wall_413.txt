advertisement supported by a democratic house committee chairman said the investigation into arms sales might have been another reason for the firing of the inspector general steve a linick by edward wong and david e sanger washington the state department inspector general fired by president trump on friday was in the final stages of an investigation into whether the administration had unlawfully declared an emergency last year to allow the resumption of weapons sales to saudi arabia and the united arab emirates for their air war in yemen employees from the office of the inspector general steve a linick presented preliminary findings to senior state department officials in early march before the coronavirus forced lockdowns across the united states but it was not clear whether that investigation or others that mr linick had underway led to his dismissal mr trump speaking about the latest in his series of firings of inspectors general around the government said on monday of mr linick i don t know him never heard of him but i was asked by the state department by mike to terminate mr linick he apparently was referring to a recommendation he received from secretary of state mike pompeo i have the absolute right as president to terminate mr trump added i said who appointed him and they say president obama i said look i ll terminate him transcript so i don t know him never heard of him but they asked me to terminate him i have the absolute right as president to terminate i said who appointed him and they said president obama i said look i ll terminate him i don t know what s going on other than that but you d have to ask mike pompeo but they did ask me to do it and i did it i have the right to terminate the inspector generals now i don t know anything about the investigation but you re just telling me about walking a dog and what d you say doing dishes saudi arms deals sir sales to saudi arabia over certain arms of concern over their use in the yemeni crisis so the question is whether secretary pompeo tried to subvert the deal with actions that he may have taken i don t think so i mean i think that when somebody pays us a fortune for you know arms we should get the deal done i will tell you that i don t know what you re talking about the investigation into how mr pompeo moved to end a congressional hold on arms sales to the saudis was prompted in part by demands from the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee representative eliot l engel of new york who said on monday that the subsequent investigation might have been another reason for the firing of mr linick the white house announced the firing friday night under a provision that requires 30 days notice to congress before removing an inspector general democratic leaders in congress and several republican lawmakers said on monday that mr trump had not given sufficient justification for the firing and that they wanted answers during the 30 day review period mr linick s office which has hundreds of employees assigned to look into fraud and waste at the state department was also examining the potential misuse by mr pompeo of a political appointee to do personal errands for him and his wife susan pompeo the inspector general s office conducts multiple simultaneous investigations into the activities of the state department and its officials we don t have the full picture yet but it s troubling that secretary pompeo wanted mr linick pushed out before this work could be completed mr engel said of the arms sale inquiry the state department did not respond to a request for comment mr pompeo said in a telephone interview with the washington post that he had recommended to mr trump that mr linick be fired because mr linick was undermining the department s mission mr pompeo did not give details he also said his recommendation to fire mr linick could not have been an act of retaliation to end an investigation because he had not been briefed on any inquiries however top department officials had clearly received briefings from mr linick s office and been asked to comply with investigations mr linick is widely seen as competent though sometimes reluctant to wade into the most politically charged issues nonetheless he issued a harsh report in 2016 on the use of a private email server by hillary clinton who served as mr obama s secretary of state and played a minor role in the impeachment inquiry against mr trump last fall he issued two reports last year that criticized political appointees at the state department some of whom work closely with mr pompeo mr trump has appointed ambassador stephen j akard the director of the office of foreign missions for the role of acting inspector general mr akard an associate of vice president mike pence failed to get congressional support for a top state department job under mr pompeo s predecessor but was eventually confirmed for the lesser post at the foreign missions office the decision to resume lethal aid to the saudis and emiratis was a major initiative undertaken by mr pompeo and mr trump who often discussed the importance of the weapons sales with officers of raytheon the massachusetts based defense contractor that lobbied heavily to get a 2017 suspension of sales lifted congress had imposed the suspension because of a political rift among gulf arab nations driven by the saudis and because of discoveries that bomb fragments traced to raytheon by investigators were linked to a series of saudi bombings that killed civilians including children mr trump had pushed to resume the sales in 2018 justifying it as a jobs issue i want boeing and i want lockheed and i want raytheon to take those orders and to hire lots of people to make that incredible equipment he said but the effort to restart the sales was delayed by the killing of jamal khashoggi the saudi dissident washington post columnist and american resident his death and the suspected role of the saudi leadership in ordering the killing led to calls for a full end to military aid to saudi arabia and the united arab emirates mr pompeo broke the logjam a year ago declaring an emergency over iran s activities in the middle east that enabled him to sidestep the congressional ban and approve restarting the sales that started the resumption of more normal exchanges with the saudi government as the trump administration tried to move past mr khashoggi s killing saudi arabia and iran are archrivals in the region in june after congressional hearings with state department officials into the rationale for declaring an emergency over iran mr engel sent a letter to mr linick asking him to open an investigation mr engel s office then tracked the investigation sporadically once it had begun a democratic aide said the office learned by early spring that mr linick had conveyed preliminary findings to the state department this past weekend after mr trump notified congress of the firing of mr linick mr engel s office learned more details of the circumstances around the arms sale investigation leading mr engel to ask whether the inquiry might have contributed to the sudden move against mr linick by mr pompeo and mr trump the washington post first reported on mr engel s concerns on monday the separate inquiry into the possible misuse of a political appointee to run personal errands was still a potential factor and there might be other motivations for the firing that remain unknown an aide said aaron david miller a former american official on middle east policy who is now at the carnegie endowment for international peace said that a year ago there was no credible emergency nor any real urgency for invoking an iran emergency declaration for lethal arms sales to the saudis other than the administration s desire to please saudi arabia he added that american officials don t want anyone digging around in the triangular relationship between the administration raytheon and saudi because somebody crossed the line mr trump and mr pompeo were aware of the sensitivities around trying to bypass the congressional hold on the arms sales mr pompeo made the announcement of the emergency declaration over iran on the friday afternoon before memorial day weekend last year a common move by government officials to avoid immediate questions from congress and extensive news coverage the administration also announced it was sending 1 500 more troops to the middle east the move was aimed at allowing american companies to sell 8 1 billion worth of munitions in 22 pending transfers mainly to saudi arabia and the u a e at the time a person briefed on the decision said a part of the arrangement would involve a transfer of munitions from the u a e to jordan that had nothing to do with iran mr pompeo had pushed aggressively for the sales over the objections of career foreign service officers and lawmakers after the announcement of the emergency on may 24 lawmakers pointedly asked why if there was such a crisis mr pompeo and patrick shanahan then the acting defense secretary had not briefed them on the situation and on the need to push through arms sales in a closed door discussion on iran just three days earlier in june lawmakers called top state department officials to testify about the decision some of their questions focused on the roles played by charles faulkner a former raytheon lobbyist who worked in the state department s legislative affairs bureau and marik string a former deputy assistant secretary in the political military affairs bureau who became a top department legal adviser in late may in a contentious hearing on june 12 lawmakers pressed r clarke cooper the assistant secretary of state in the political military affairs bureau on the move mr cooper argued that a continued hold on the sales would cede commercial advantages to russia and china one lawmaker asked whether jared kushner mr trump s son in law and a middle east adviser with close ties to crown prince mohammed bin salman of saudi arabia had weighed in on the decision mr cooper demurred at first then said no michael laforgia contributed reporting
