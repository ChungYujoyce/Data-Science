advertisement supported by if he can win the battle for our screens he can benefit from the death of the traditional presidential campaign by lis smith ms smith advised campaigns by pete buttigieg andrew cuomo and barack obama if joe biden plays his cards right the death of the traditional presidential campaign will turn out to be a blessing in disguise the 77 year old mr biden whom the president derisively calls sleepy joe can become the hottest bad boy and disrupter in the media game it seems likely that social distancing will force the presidential campaign to be played out entirely on our screens that will free mr biden the presumptive democratic nominee of the burden of running a grueling expensive campaign involving incessant travel instead he can be digitally omnipresent at a small fraction of the cost and physical toll and create a new paradigm for how presidential campaigns communicate in the press for years to come mr biden s greatest asset as a campaigner is his palpable empathy politicians can learn a lot of tricks talking points debate and interview strategies but personal warmth is something that cannot be taught it also happens to be a trait that translates well on tv think about mr biden s 2017 appearance on the the view when he comforted a visibly emotional meghan mccain after her father senator john mccain learned he had terminal brain cancer it was a raw and remarkable moment of live tv and most seasoned politicians would have struggled mr biden thrived this human touch is especially important at a time when voters are looking as much for a healer in chief as they are a commander in chief it also sets up a stark contrast with president trump who in crisis after crisis has demonstrated a lack of empathy and inability to feel americans pain democrats should use the media to highlight mr biden s empathy and position him as the presidential warm blanket that a scarred america will need after four years of mr trump but they need to realize that in 2020 there is no silver bullet when it comes to persuasive public relations campaigns to win the pr war and the election they must focus on the coalition they need to put together to defeat mr trump understand how the groups in it consume news and commit to meeting these voters where they are it starts with a heavy focus on america s most trusted media source local news to get to 270 electoral college votes the biden campaign really needs to win three states pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin that hillary clinton lost in 2016 it won t be a whistle stop tour but mr biden can still generate the news coverage he will need to win there with his home tv studio he can beam into morning shows in milwaukee and madison with his telephone he can call into popular philadelphia and pittsburgh radio shows and be interviewed by reporters and columnists at the detroit news and the lansing state journal he can blanket the media in those states before he sits down for dinner and all from the comfort of his delaware home his campaign should analyze the primary media consumption habits of the voters they need to put together for a winning coalition for voters under the age of 40 it s on mobile screens and social media for black voters local tv news for latino voters spanish language tv and radio news outlets like univision telemundo and la mega along with english language local media in metro areas with large latino populations while mr biden is his own most effective messenger he alone cannot carry out a winning media strategy the campaign should lean on its vast network of supporters elected officials community leaders celebrities who are chomping at the bit to make their voice heard in this election he can deploy former democratic rivals like pete buttigieg elizabeth warren andrew yang and bernie sanders to blanket local national and partisan media with a message of how important it is for democrats of all stripes and candidate loyalties to turn out for mr biden in november he can lean on his celebrity supporters to share good news about his campaign on their platforms ariana grande an outspoken democrat has over 180 million followers on instagram making her one of the most followed persons in the world dwayne johnson therock on instagram another democrat also tops 180 million followers these figures appeal to very different fan bases celebrity supporters like them can bring the campaign s message to nontraditional and nonpolitical outlets that might otherwise be disinclined to get into the weeds of an election sports talk radio top 40 stations and gossip sites mr biden could also harness the newfound star power and credibility of the coronavirus governors like andrew cuomo gretchen whitmer and gavin newsom to highlight the life or death stakes of this election similarly we can rethink the way we approach traditionally marquee presidential campaign moments like the convention we ve been doing conventions wrong for years days and days of mediocre speeches from politicians unknown to the public programming that puts even political junkies to sleep they re prohibitively expensive time intensive and of limited value in reaching anyone but true believers and they are overrated in their ability to fundamentally shift the dynamics of a presidential race do you remember when the 2016 democratic convention in philadelphia helped swing pennsylvania for hillary clinton or the 2012 republican convention in tampa delivered florida for mitt romney democrats should rethink how best to use those prime time hours across three nights instead of rote speeches they could feature more dynamic content they can show mini documentaries on the state of america under mr trump farmers and workers affected by the administration s tariffs and other economic policies and residents of puerto rico abandoned after hurricane maria and video testimonies from americans whose lives have been touched by mr biden s leadership they can harness the creativity of hollywood and grass roots supporters alike to offer exclusive content like musical performances from in demand artists and episodes of hit tv shows mr biden is generally favored in national and swing state polls but it s important to put this lead in perspective at this point four years ago hillary clinton also enjoyed a polling advantage over mr trump the clinton campaign played it safe with a quintessential rose garden strategy limiting media access and skipping campaign stops in swing states like wisconsin with an unshakable faith that mr trump would eventually self destruct similarly in crisis management mr biden can also learn something from the failures of mrs clinton and another previous democratic nominee john kerry neither could squelch partisan narratives a secret email server and swift boat attacks by trying to starve them of oxygen last week in his appearance on morning joe to address sexual assault accusations by his former senate aide tara reade mr biden smartly followed best crisis management practice a no holds barred sit down he took on the allegations directly forcefully denied them and answered no fewer than 20 questions helping to put to rest any suspicions that he might be hiding something ultimately for mr biden to be victorious he s going to have to beat the heavyweight champion of generating media attention mr trump he should be willing to go everywhere as mr trump was in 2016 it is an indication of the president s weakness four years later that he sticks to the safety of fox news sean hannity s show and twitter mr trump s freewheeling moments in appearances that do reach a broader audience as in the daily coronavirus briefings have exposed him as unfit like his recent suggestion to treat covid 19 with disinfectant if the public continues to lose confidence in his management of the pandemic it s likely that he ll revert even more to predictable and small partisan corners by going everywhere mr biden will meet voters where they are on their terms being able to do so without leaving his makeshift home studio gives him a tremendous advantage it s only fitting that a return to normalcy would be achieved through the most abnormal circumstances in recent campaign history lis smith lis smith an adviser for campaigns by pete buttigieg andrew cuomo and barack obama is a
