advertisement supported by by eric lipton and jennifer steinhauer washington the petitions that started surfacing online over a year ago were as incendiary as they were urgent begging recipients to sign up to boot boehner dump mcconnell drop a truth bomb on kevin mccarthy and fire paul ryan the calls to oust republican leaders in congress did not come from democrats they came from conservative websites and bloggers who have helped stoke a grass roots rebellion to make congress more conservative a fevered continuation of the six year tea party movement but these politically charged appeals to conservatives around the country were often accompanied by a solicitation for money and the ultimate beneficiaries records suggest are the consultants who created the campaigns rather than the causes they are promoting it is a practice that has accelerated with the explosion of social media the latest example came on wednesday with a new attack on representative paul d ryan republican of wisconsin just a day after he said he was willing to serve as house speaker even some members of congress who might benefit from the petitions are highly critical of the approach a lot of people are wearing their hearts on their sleeves trying to help and only later may find out that this money is not going where they thought it was said representative david schweikert republican of arizona and a member of the freedom caucus the group of conservative lawmakers who helped force out representative john a boehner of ohio as speaker but sentiments like mr schweikert s are no match for the velocity and scope of the solicitations sent to a million people with a single click conservatives forced john boehner to resign kevin mccarthy to forsake his run for speaker and we have got to stop the establishment s latest pick paul ryan said the email sent out on wednesday to nearly one million conservatives around the nation by constitutional rights pac which is running the fire paul ryan campaign larry ward the founder of constitutional rights pac defended the move to derail the ascension of mr ryan calling it a worthy goal politics is supposed to be bloody it is supposed to be a battle of will mr ward said and the one who can get the american people siding with them is the one who wins but mr ward also has a financial stake in the fight he runs political media a washington based firm that will charge constitutional rights pac a fee for sending out the blast email with the dual purpose of asking conservatives to help dump mr ryan and to donate to mr ward s political action committee help us fund the fight by making an emergency donation of 30 50 or even 100 today the email said even though records show that mr ward s pac spends every dollar it gets on consultants mailings and fund raising making no donations to candidates mr ward defended his use of his own firm saying he gave his pac a discount on his company s regular service charges mr ward has plenty of competitors groups including the tea party leadership fund the madison project and the tea party patriots have in the past year turned the attack on the republican leadership into a fund raising tool records show a handful of conservative groups spent the last year sending emails and making calls to try to remove john a boehner as speaker of the house and replace him with what they call a true conservative critics call these groups scam pacs and accuse them of using almost all the money for their salaries and consultants here is a look at some of the campaigns the messages have resonated deeply throughout the conservative news media from fox news to breitbart com helping to force out mr boehner to undermine a potential replacement representative kevin mccarthy of california and to discredit mr ryan a process that is starting to cause a backlash among some republicans this is clearly an organized effort and an attempt by these groups to raise money for themselves said senator susan collins republican of maine who added that she was the target of a similar attack during the 2013 senate debate over gun safety legislation they hurt our party they hurt our congress and they hurt our country organizers of the petition efforts said such criticism was unfair and propagated mostly by entrenched politicians who have lost their way that is an absolute self serving lie fostered by people who are usually on the receiving end of political attacks of these organizations said dan backer whose virginia based consulting firm db capitol strategies is treasurer and legal adviser to several of the groups including the tea party leadership fund constitutional rights pac and the conservative action fund campaign finance documents examined by the new york times show that the pacs and other groups running many of these petition drives have a history of spending most of the money they raise on consulting firms as opposed to using it to support political candidates in stark contrast to how most pacs function the efforts employ similar tactics conservative outlets like breitbart or the washington examiner are given exclusive advance notice of a new effort like the remove john boehner campaign started early last year by the tea party leadership fund consultants hired by the tea party leadership fund using rented lists of known conservative voters then follow up with thousands of phone calls or emails urging voters to sign this one click petition by collecting one million petition signatures we will show john boehner the liberal media and every other congressional sellout that the tea party is serious about returning america to greatness said one anti boehner appeal from last year a tea party leadership fund electronic petition this year labeled boot boehner urged conservative voters to oust the sellout republican john boehner from his powerful position as speaker of the house but in both cases anyone filling out the petition with their name email address and zip code was redirected to a new web page notifying the voter that your signature has been recorded followed by a request for a donation your immediate contribution could be the most important financial investment you will make to help return america to greatness the tea party leadership fund website said although it gave no indication of how donations would be spent the answer can be found in campaign finance records which show that of the 6 7 million the tea party leadership fund has raised since 2013 only about 910 000 has been spent on conservative republican candidates it supports either in direct contributions or independent expenditures on the candidates behalf as an alternative to mr boehner and his supporters almost all of the rest of the money it has raised since 2013 has been spent on consulting firms involved in helping collect the donations one of them strategic fundraising of st paul has been paid 2 3 million by the tea party leadership fund since 2013 to follow up the appeals with phone calls soliciting contributions after being fined late last year by south carolina s secretary of state who accused it of deceptive fund raising tactics strategic fundraising went out of business this year the freedom caucus has a long list of things they would like from the next speaker of the house but they are difficult for normal people to understand here we translate them into plain english mr backer and his various businesses run out of his office in alexandria va are another major beneficiary his law firm provides legal and campaign advice to the tea party leadership fund he also has an ownership stake in a campaign fund raising company called scm enterprises that the tea party leadership fund relies on and he helped create a conservative website american action news where the tea party leadership fund routinely places advertisements collectively the corporate entities mr backer owns or has financial ties to have been paid at least 1 1 million in fees since 2013 by the tea party leadership fund and other pacs he helps run federal records show while some of mr backer s activities were reported in politico this year the intensity of the effort by his groups has surged with the turmoil in the house and mr boehner s surprising decision to resign as speaker the petition based campaigns have also sought to raise money by celebrating republicans like representative trey gowdy of south carolina the chairman of the house select committee on benghazi who has been promoted as a candidate for speaker by one of mr backer s groups the emails sent to voters make no mention of mr backer instead they are sent by high profile conservatives like katrina pierson a tea party activist from texas who ran for congress last year and who was paid 30 000 in the first six months of the year to serve as the group s spokeswoman records show grass roots conservatives across america are getting behind trey gowdy by the bus loads said one email sent out in ms pierson s name by the tea party leadership fund in early october the appeal urged voters to join the group s petition but it included only links to web pages where donations were solicited i need you to drop everything and help me send a loud and clear message the email said ms pierson defended her work saying the only reason this pac draws attention is that it is anti establishment yet even mr gowdy is upset with how his name is being used these outside groups use members names not just his without their knowledge and mislead people to think they support or are connected to a group when they are not amanda duvall a spokeswoman for mr gowdy said after being shown the draft trey gowdy emails sent by the tea party leadership fund under ms pierson s name similar petition styled fund raising efforts using mr boehner s name have been set up by groups like the tea party patriots which the conservative activist jenny beth martin of georgia helped found her group has set up a website targeting the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky add your name to the petition calling for mitch mcconnell to step down as the majority leader of the u s senate the website says above a large red button that says donate yet campaign finance records show that while the group raised 14 4 million in the 2014 election cycle only about 10 percent of that went to so called independent expenditures to support conservative republicans with most of the rest going to pay staff members and consultants including ms martin who records show was being paid 15 000 a month early last year in the last election cycle the organization spent four times as much on mailings postage and email marketing as it did on these elections the records show ms martin in a statement said her group intentionally spent the bulk of its money on grass roots organization which includes the emails and phone calls as well as rallies to motivate and educate its supporters instead of spending it directly on political campaigns we don t have the kind of donors who write million dollar checks and we don t spend our resources on tv and radio ads she said instead we concern ourselves with deploying our biggest asset our grass roots army and work to make sure they are identified recruited trained and mobilized but it is an explanation that at least some republicans on capitol hill said they found insufficient these groups stir people up on issues that don t exist or solutions that can t be achieved and hold members to impossible tests said representative greg walden of oregon the chairman of the national republican congressional committee which raises money for candidates there needs to be an investigation into these groups where does the money go
