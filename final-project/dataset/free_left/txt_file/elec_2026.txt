54pm bst 21 54 lauren aratani house speaker nancy pelosi just got asked at the time 100 summit in nyc for her latest thoughts on impeachment and she sure didn t sound like a fan of the idea i do believe impeachment is one of the most divisive paths that we could go down in our country pelosi said but if the path of fact finding takes us there we have no choice but we re not there yet lauren aratani is at the event for the guardian pelosi was interviewed by molly bell national political correspondent for time here are extracts from pelosi s replies on the mueller report while we haven t seen it all what we ve seen has omitted the grand jury s report which we expect to see what we did learn is that the russians had a systemic overall assault on electoral system so what we see is that the president of the united states engaged in behavior that was unethical unscrupulous and beneath the dignity of the office he holds what s surprising about that is that the republicans have an appetite for this behavior instead of being ashamed about what that report said they ve given their blessing once again to the president do you believe the president committed obstruction of justice that remains to be seen when we see the rest of the report we said no we re not taking any redaction back here by reading it in a room with the few of us and then preventing us from having any conversation with other people our people deserve the truth we want them to see what the report says it was really a sad day for our country to see that report come out with all the inconsistencies in it over the weekend i have read and studied it last night we had a conference call with our members a record number of 177 members were on the phone over a break holiday time for 87 minutes 70 minutes at least of that was listening to the comments of 20 members who called in over and above the report of our six distinguished chairpersons they made their presentation of the mueller report this is about being totally free from passion prejudice politics it s about presentation of the facts when we have the facts we ll have a better idea of how to go forward do you see the report as a impeachment referral there are many ways to hold the president of the united states accountable and the mueller report sort of led way to that by not making an indictment what matters is the truth the investigations that our committees will conduct will take us down a fact finding path everyone should welcome that what s interesting about that is that we see the administration s stonewalling of the facts getting to the american people they want to sue head of the oversight committee elijah cummings for making a request for testimony they want to obstruct any subpoenas for info this is a moment in our history it s not about politics it s about patriotism this is an existential threat to our democracy to our constitution i do believe that all of us in public office have a duty to the american people to keep us together i do believe impeachment is one of the most divisive paths that we could go down in our country but if the path of fact finding takes us there we have no choice but we re not there yet 9 22pm bst 21 22 twitter ceo jack dorsey has held will hold it was unclear whether the meeting had yet taken place a private half hour meeting with the president to discuss the health of the public conversation on twitter vice reports quoting what it says is an internal twitter email the email does not detail what the meeting will specifically be about but says the company anticipates it to be about the health of the public conversation on twitter according to the email written by vijaya gadde twitter s global lead for legal policy and trust and safety if only someone could think of a way to instantly improve the health of the public conversation on twitter will jack get stern with trump given the hate speech that twitter has in the past allowed to thrive on the sight that s

shares by the way are up here s a snap this morning from reuters new york reuters shares in twitter inc jumped 13 percent on tuesday after the social media company reported quarterly revenue above analyst estimates which executives said was the result of weeding out spam and abusive posts and targeting ads better updated at 9 32pm bst 8 48pm bst 20 48 the house oversight committee has moved to hold a former white house official in contempt of congress after he failed to appear at a hearing to investigate the handling of white house security clearances committee chairman elijah e cummings said he would schedule a contempt vote against personnel security director carl kline who was directed not to appear by a white house lawyer who said cummings subpoena unconstitutionally encroaches on fundamental executive branch interests a whistleblower previously told the committee that the mishandling of security clearances including a clearance for trump son in law jared kushner had created a national security vulnerability a statement issued by cummings said in part the white house and mr kline now stand in open defiance of a duly authorized congressional subpoena with no assertion of any privilege of any kind by president trump based on these actions it appears that the president believes that the constitution does not apply to his white house that he may order officials at will to violate their legal obligations and that he may obstruct attempts by congress to conduct oversight 7 55pm bst 19 55 lauren aratani following jared kushner onstage though not immediately onstage at the time 100 summit hillary clinton makes a point opposite to what kushner said the russian attack on the us election should not be treated as a threat that s behind us clinton said this is about what s going on today and the threats to our next election we were a subject of a foreign adversary s attack clinton said you can try to figure out everything that we need to get the full report unredacted version it s fair to say that this is not just about the reckoning with a recent past this is about what s going on today and the threats to our next election the report is long and it obviously takes time to wade through it but it s something that every american who cares about holding our adversaries accountable should take the time to go through i m really of the mind that the mueller report is part of the beginning it s not the end there s so much more that we should know and act upon and obviously that s what congress is trying to do what i want is for the country the congress and the press to come to grips with what happened and not to get diverted and distracted by an effort to move on or diminish the impact of this attack clinton said trump had committed acts worthy of indictment i think there s enough that any other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted she said but because of the rule in the justice department that you can t indict a sitting president the whole matter of obstruction was very directly sent to the congress clinton said she agreed with how nancy pelosi was handling the response to the mueller report i think what nancy pelosi means and i agree with what she means i that it shouldn t be a pre ordained conclusion it shouldn t be about what you do for partisan political purposes outsides it should be something you take based on serious evidence not on partisan advantage
