60s taylor said elections by christopher cadelago harris choice of frank ogawa plaza outside city hall as the site of her kickoff will bring supporters to the same location chosen by obama for his 2007 introduction to the bay area for harris the daughter of a jamaican father and an indian mother the setting is an opportunity to connect with african americans around the country she is launching from the black community base of the bay area it s to say i have my credentials as an african american taylor said i m not claiming washington d c i m claiming oakland yet equally important is the place oakland is not san francisco the city s politically wired neighbor across the bay where extreme wealth and poverty are in constant conflict and whose famously liberal streak makes it a target for ridicule and it s not los angeles the sprawling megalopolis to the south where apathy runs high and hollywood dreams are more often dashed than realized oakland like harris herself is not easily categorized high crime rates and rampant homelessness have for years vexed city officials the city s civic pride took successive hits with the departure of the oakland raiders for las vegas and the the golden state warriors moving to san francisco but in a deep blue state that exports technology and entertainment oakland s economic rise has come to represent a kind of american renaissance its progressivism gives harris a sharp contrast with donald trump in the trump era people are looking for models of opposition and symbols of opposition to this president and his policies and oakland has this long history of militant opposition and activity liam o donoghue a local historian who produces the regional podcast east bay yesterday said in an interview some people would consider it to be america s home of militant black activism because of the history of the black panthers which made the city its headquarters in the 1970s and whose leaders including bobby seale and elaine brown ran

which have compared its boho vibe to brooklyn s and the city has been featured in major movies like black panther blindspotting and sorry to bother you making harris choice a resonant location for millennials who may not recall the fiery panther days but with gentrification threatening longtime residents and shifting the city s demographics o donoghue said it feels like pride in oakland history is particularly strong right now because residents want to preserve the authenticity derived from its raucous past it s the city s penchant for activism that has some concerned about harris choice of venue don perata a democrat who represented oakland for years in the state senate called the decision risky and pointed to harris background as a prosecutor district attorney of san francisco and state attorney general as giving fodder to the far left to come in and make accusatory remarks about her record in law enforcement harris doesn t appear too worried at a washington fundraiser a couple
