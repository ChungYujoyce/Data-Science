advertisement supported by by patrick healy john wittneben simmered as he listened to hillary rodham clinton defend her ties to wall street during last weekend s democratic debate he lost 40 percent of his savings in individual retirement accounts during the great recession while mrs clinton has received millions of dollars from the kinds of executives he believes should be in jail people knew what they were doing back then because of greed and it caused me harm said mr wittneben the democratic chairman in emmet county iowa we were raised a certain way here fairness is a big deal the next day he endorsed senator bernie sanders in the presidential race mrs clinton s windfalls from wall street banks and other financial services firms 3 million in paid speeches and 17 million in campaign contributions over the years have become a major vulnerability in states with early nomination contests some party officials who remain undecided in the 2016 presidential race see her as overly cozy with big banks and other special interests at a time when liberals are ascendant in the party many democrats believe her merely having represented wall street as a senator from new york as mrs clinton reminded viewers in an october debate is bad enough it is an image problem that she cannot seem to shake though she criticizes the american economy as being rigged for the rich mrs clinton has lost some support recently from party members who think she would go easy on wall street excess if elected even as she promises greater regulation of hedge funds and private equity firms liberals deride her for refusing to support reinstatement of the glass steagall act a law that separated commercial and investment banks until its repeal under president bill clinton mr sanders favors its restoration and for many democrats her strong support from wealthy donors and a big money super pac undercuts her increasingly progressive rhetoric on free trade and other economic issues her advisers say most democrats like her economic policies and believe she would fight for middle class and low income americans most opinion polls put mrs clinton well ahead of mr sanders nationally and in iowa and they are running even in new hampshire but she fares worse than him on questions about taking on wall street and special interests and even if mrs clinton sews up the nomination quickly subdued enthusiasm among the party s liberal base could complicate efforts to energize democratic turnout for the general election in the primaries mrs clinton s advisers privately concede that she will lose some votes over her wall street connections they declined to share specific findings from internal polls but predicted the issue could resonate in democratic contests in iowa nevada ohio and michigan where many have lost homes and businesses to bank foreclosures mr sanders zeros in on wall street donations to mrs clinton in an aggressive new television commercial that started running in iowa and new hampshire on saturday the truth is you can t change a corrupt system by taking its money he warns one of mrs clinton s most prominent supporters in ohio former state senator nina turner defected to mr sanders this month in part she said because she felt he would be tougher on special interests and some democratic superdelegates whose backing is crucial said mrs clinton s ties to big banks and her invocation of 9 11 to defend her ties to wall street at the nov 14 debate only made them further question her independence from the financial industry my parents had a saying in spanish dime con qui n andas y te dir qui n eres which means tell me who you re hanging with and i ll tell you who you are said alma r gonzalez an uncommitted superdelegate from florida a lot of my democratic friends feel that way about hillary and wall street are the working people in this country going to be able to count on hard decisions being made by president hillary clinton with regard to her wall street chums ms gonzalez continued will she be another president clinton who appoints a treasury secretary from wall street these are major concerns indeed mr clinton s close relationships with wall street executives like robert e rubin of goldman sachs whom he named his treasury secretary and his support for undoing parts of glass steagall have contributed to misgivings about mrs clinton mrs clinton has proposed imposing risk fees on unwieldy big banks and empowering regulators to break them up if necessary though this is not the wholesale breakup that mr sanders favors under a return of glass steagall she also proposes to make sure fines for corporate wrongdoing hit executive bonuses and to pursue criminal prosecutions when justified history suggests that each party s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions as measured by endorsements fund raising and polling on saturday mrs clinton discussed her plans for regulating the financial industry at a democratic rally in north charleston s c where she spoke after mr sanders and another candidate former gov martin o malley of maryland i have the toughest most comprehensive proposals for dealing with wall street she began and a voter holding a bernie sign interrupted by taking their money mrs clinton continued saying her plan would address not just wall street banks but also insurance companies and the shadow banking industry of hedge funds and private equity firms i am willing to break up the big banks if they need to be broken up she added yet even though she has taken tough stands in the past such as chastising banks for widespread foreclosures in 2007 and 2008 some democrats are skeptical that she would ever crack down hard on the executives in her social circles in manhattan the hamptons and washington jake quinn an uncommitted superdelegate from north carolina said he was concerned about mrs clinton s willingness to clamp down on wall street malfeasance the financial sector s ongoing relative lack of accountability makes me suspicious of any candidate who sources it for significant support he said mrs clinton s advisers say that any political harm resulting from her wall street ties will be minimal because she never took action in exchange for donations and that her proposals discredit claims that she would protect banks as president the advisers also play down the possibility that mrs clinton will face problems with voter enthusiasm and turnout if she is nominated while mr sanders and mr o malley have argued that big donors inevitably had influence with her her campaign has pushed back against suggestions that the financial services industry has bankrolled her campaign her aides also said ads by a new group future 45 attacking mrs clinton would underscore her independence because the group s major donors include wall street magnates like paul singer when billionaire hedge fund managers are forming super pacs to run ads attacking her it s clear they fear she will take action as president to crack down on the industry s abuses said brian fallon a clinton campaign spokesman bashing wall street is not an automatic win for mr sanders however ms gonzalez the florida superdelegate and some other undecided democrats said they viewed mr sanders as too hostile to banks and corporations and too divisive in his remarks about american wealth but others said they were more concerned that mrs clinton had not broken with wall street in a clear way noting the lengths she went to at the debate to explain the relationship she was waving the bloody shirt of 9 11 to defend herself which we re accustomed to seeing with demagogues on the right and it just didn t feel quite right said kurt meyer a co chairman of the mitchell county democrats in iowa who has not endorsed a candidate she connected two things 9 11 and her ties to wall street that i didn t like her sewing together ms turner the former ohio lawmaker said the blocks of foreclosed homes in cleveland were a painful reminder that banks prioritize their own corporate interests mr sanders has been criticizing the corrupt economy symbolized by wall street greed for decades she said he shows righteous indignation and speaks for the common woman and man in saying they have a right to be outraged at wall street ms turner said he doesn t just talk the talk he walks the talk and mrs clinton her ties are her ties ms turner said advertisement
