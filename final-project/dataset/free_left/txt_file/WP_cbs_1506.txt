the following is a transcript of an interview with senator chris van hollen that aired sunday december 22 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan and we now turn to the other side of the table literally and figuratively a maryland democratic senator chris van hollen good to have you here senator chris van hollen it s good to be with you margaret margaret brennan so you just heard senator blunt lay out his position you are one of the first senators to publicly float at least this idea that the speaker hold on to those articles and not immediately transfer them can you explain the strategy what do you what is this leverage sen van hollen sure absolutely and first just to be clear the conduct we re talking about from president trump has no parallel in the conduct of anything that president obama or president bush did and his claim of absolute immunity is unprecedented no presidents ever claimed that so speaker pelosi is doing exactly the right thing she is focusing a spotlight on the need to have a fair trial in the united states senate and it s especially necessary when you have mitch mcconnell senator mcconnell who you quoted earlier saying publicly that he s not going to be an impartial juror even though that s what the oath will require that he s going to work in lockstep with the president who s the defendant in this case and that he s already said no to calling fact witnesses that have direct knowledge of what s at stake in this impeachment margaret brebnnan so you re trying to divide the republican caucus over these two weeks sen van hollen we re trying to engage first of all the public in a conversation because almost every american would agree that to have a fair trial you need to have witnesses i mean what s a trial without each side being able to call their witnesses and yes they re going to be a number of republican senators who are going to have to decide on whether or not to call these witnesses and after all as you indicated president trump says he wants witnesses now i don t know if he s trash talking or not but let s have some witnesses if it was such a perfect phone call then send on mick mulvaney down to talk about that perfect phone call send down john bolton what are they afraid of margaret brennan do you think democrats will get on board with what senator blunt laid out which is that the quote unquote clinton model of having debate then voting on witnesses sen van hollen i think democrats want assurances upfront that this is going to be a fair trial and that you re going to be able to call witnesses there were witnesses called in all the prior trials most recently the the clinton impeachment and margaret brennan and is speaker pelosi in lockstep with schumer on that one that the articles won t be transferred until there is a promise of witnesses sen van hollen look i think we have to take this day by day margaret brennan okay sen van hollen i think what speaker pelosi is doing is focusing attention on the need for a fair trial and a fair trial means you get to call your witnesses every american knows that that s what a trial is all about how can it be a fair trial if you can t put on the rest of your case there s over already over margaret brennan so you haven t decided how you will vote sen van hollen there s overwhelming margaret brennan as a juror yourself sen van hollen i will wait to hear all the evidence margaret brennan okay sen van hollen i think that the house has made a very strong case for impeachment but i will reserve final judgment until all the evidence is is in the president says he wants to put forward his case i don t know why you know others aren t saying okay mr president send down your witnesses that s what we want margaret brennan so for people at home though they they see and hear the math on this that it takes 67 votes to actually remove eject the president from office and it is incredibly unlikely that those votes will exist right at this point looking at the math as it stands so given all that what is the purpose of the standoff over how the trial is conducted if you know the outcome sen van hollen well the reason that republicans are so deathly afraid of sending down these fact witnesses is because after they testify under oath they ll have to raise their right hand just like all the witnesses in the house did and testify under penalty of perjury it s going to be much harder for republicans to hide behind this myth that this was a perfect phone call and it will make it harder for those senators to vote for a quit acquittal and that is why they re so afraid of having witnesses called i mean why else why why wouldn t you send your witnesses down to to tell the truth under penalty of perjury margaret brennan i want to also ask you about something you were working on that was tucked inside a a bill that the president just signed off on and this includes giving him more abilities to put different kinds of sanctions on north korea we know u s intelligence is watching and preparing for the possibility of an upcoming long range missile test by north korea do you believe the president will actually use the sanctions you gave him the authority or is this so i mean you have no way to force the hand here sen van hollen well we need to tighten the sanctions regime on north korea the united nations has documented the fact that it s kind of like swiss cheese there s a lot of leakage in this and so this legislation will require the president to put in secondary sanctions so if you re a company you re a bank in china you will now face u s sanctions if you keep doing business with north korea he s required to do that in 120 days now he can exercise a national security waiver we have said on a bipartisan basis it would be totally wrong to use those waivers and let north korea off the hook unless you can show us measurable progress toward reaching our goal of denuclearizing the korean peninsula the time for photo op summits is over it s time to be serious and let the north koreans know that we re gonna tighten these sanctions margaret brennan and what we know is to date the diplomacy has not resulted sen van hollen that s right margaret brennan in any of what you just laid out as a premise for suspending or not enacting these sanctions sen van hollen that s right margaret brennan you think basically it is inevitable that these new sanctions are going on north korea in the next few weeks sen van hollen yes i do i think within 120 days these will be imposed on north korea and we re margaret brennan because the question is if they carry out long range missile tests we don t know what the trump administration will do other than go to the united nations do you think that this time clock on diplomacy is ticking sen van hollen look the clock is clearly ticking right now it s been ticking for some time now you have north korea now engaged in their saber rattling once again as as has been the case from the beginning we need to engage china during this period where we ve had these summits with north korea the president has essentially allowed china to go ahead and allow trade to go back and forth between china and north korea and and chinese banks so this will put an end to that it will tighten the sanctions and i think that s necessary in order to really get a serious negotiation at the negotiating table if i could just margaret brennan okay sen van hollen really briefly say margaret brennan we have to sen van hollen with respect to the the trial margaret brennan we have to leave it there sen van hollen if it s not fair there s going to be no way that trump s margaret brennan well sen van hollen going to be able to go around and say he s exonerated margaret brennan and we ll have plenty of debate over what fair means in the rest of the show sen van hollen absolutely margaret brennan thanks to both of you senators sen van hollen thank you margaret brennan we ll be back in
