the coronavirus task force briefing fauci recalled the nature of the hypothetical question about earlier mitigation and reiterated that yes obviously mitigation helps and if mitigation works and you instigate it and initiate it earlier you probably would have saved more lives if you initiate it later you probably would have lost more lives that was taken as a way that maybe something was at fault
