 washington shortly before the house vote friday on the massive relief package in response to the coronavirus outbreak rep thomas massie r ky said he planned to try to force a recorded vote on the legislation arguing that house members should have to go on the record like the senate did massie s attempt to force a roll call vote however was likely to be denied because house leaders believe there will be a quorum present paving the way to pass the measure by voice vote he later acknowledged on twitter that his plan to force a vote would likely be blocked it s pretty clear now with enough members here to pass the bill that pelosi and mccarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of congress from accountability biggest spending bill in the history of mankind and no recorded vote swamp earlier friday massie tweeted that many people including manufacturing workers health care professionals pilots grocery clerks cooks delivery drivers and others still had to go to work in the midst of the outbreak is it too much to ask that the house do its job just like the senate did he tweeted referring to the senate s roll call vote on the legislation wednesday night massie said he was not delaying the bill which he railed against this stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing he wrote 11 11 2 trillion divided by 150 million workers is about 13 333 00 per person that s much more than the 1 200 per person check authorized by this bill democratic and republican leaders suspected massie would try to force a recorded vote they advised house members to come back to washington late thursday because they believed the 2 trillion economic relief package would not pass by the planned friday voice vote and could be delayed if a quorum of at least 216 members weren t in attendance members then raced to get back to washington in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic to make it for the possible roll call vote massie was in the chamber friday morning just after the house came into session at 9 a m et he was one of about 50 members who were present at the time and they were spaced out around the room shortly after the house began debate on the bill president donald trump slammed massie in a pair of tweets saying that he only wants publicity and that

might have one grandstander trump said at his news briefing thursday it will pass it will just take a little longer he has said he would sign the bill once it passes massie s office did not respond to a request for comment though he told wkrc radio thursday that he plans to vote against the package if it were just about helping people to get more unemployment benefits to get through this calamity that frankly the governors have wrought on the people then i could be for it massie said according to the courier journal massie said that he opposes a voice vote on the bill the report said i m having a really hard time with this because they re saying well it s hard to travel yadda yadda yadda massie said well last night 96 out of 100 senators voted all we would need is 218 out of 435 to vote members have been scattered across the country as flights have been canceled and millions of people have sheltered in their homes amid the pandemic public health officials have said in the last 48 hours that anyone traveling from new york should quarantine for 14 days which could affect many members of congress there are also two members who have tested positive for the virus and over a dozen more who are self quarantining after possible exposure members are encouraged to follow the guidance of their local and state health officials however if they are able and willing to be in washington d c by 10 00 a m tomorrow members are encouraged to do so with caution hoyer s notice to members said the notice also included guidance that if a vote does take place members will be called alphabetically in groups of 30 download the nbc news app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak massie who has threatened to vote no on the package told local and national media thursday that he was driving back to washington for the vote earlier thursday massie tweeted the section of the constitution that defines a quorum a rule he could use to derail the bill if enough of his colleagues aren t present and voting the house needs a quorum half its membership present to pass a bill if any single member demands one if no one asks for a quorum it is assumed a quorum exists that is what would allow the house to act without a recorded vote by voice or by unanimous consent there are five vacancies in the 435 member house so 216 votes constitutes a majority kasie hunt the
