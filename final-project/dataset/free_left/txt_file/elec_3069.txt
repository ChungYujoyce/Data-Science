advertisement supported by news analysis by matt flegenheimer and katie glueck one month after a wobbly debate performance that reinforced the perceived weaknesses of the ostensible front runner is he too old too nostalgically moderate too politically brittle to defend himself when challenged former vice president joseph r biden jr settled behind his center stage lectern on wednesday night and supplied some answers he is still old he is still nostalgic and he is still the front runner until someone can prove otherwise far from perfect and rarely exactly steady mr biden nonetheless achieved at least some of the goals that seemed to elude him last time he had promised before the debate that this time he would not be so polite about 30 minutes in after listening to liberal rivals lash his health care vision as insufficiently ambitious and dismiss concerns about cost as a republican talking point mr biden widened his eyes a bit he waved a hand slicing the air he had just the word this idea is a bunch of malarkey he said of the criticisms leaning on a trademark bidenism he accused his peers of underselling the trillions of dollars that a medicare for all style plan might cost turning toward two more progressive rivals senator kamala harris of california and mayor bill de blasio of new york to level the kind of zealous defense of center leftism that has often escaped him in this campaign i don t know what math you do in new york mr biden said i don t know what math you do in california but i tell ya that s a lot of money throughout the evening he plowed through a series of forceful defenses of his service alongside former president barack obama frequently eager to wrap himself in mr obama s legacy on issues from health care to climate and never missing a chance to remind audiences of his association with sunnier democratic times transcript it was perhaps the most dramatic moment of the first presidential primary debates senator kamala harris laced into vice president biden s record on civil rights we have to take it seriously we have this was a searing exchange on race that put biden on the defensive i m the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years and then this happened i agree that everybody once they in anyway my time s up i m sorry thank you vice president this was a significant exchange for substantive reasons but at a rhetorical level mr biden s response was also revealing anyway my time s up i m sorry thank you vice president katie glueck has been covering biden for a while i have listened to dozens and dozens of joe biden speeches and have read all of his books as well use of the term anyway is just one in a long list of what many folks refer to as bidenisms that is a reference to the distinctive way that vice president biden often speaks some bidenisms include the term anyway look folks here s the deal i m serious that s not hyperbole not a joke folks we need to recognize that words matter mr biden entered the 2020 presidential campaign as the early poll leader and his supporters love his folksy style for others however who are interested in a fresher face the way that mr biden speaks is another reminder that he came up in a different political generation i announce my candidacy for president of the united states and if you re a close observer of mr biden s speech patterns you can detect a couple of different themes and folks folks this election it s not hyperbole to suggest this is not hyperbole this election is literally bigger than politics and that is not hyperbole what he s saying is this is important this is not hyperbole it all may come down to pennsylvania not a joke no no not a joke not a joke and sometimes mr biden just says it straight out no and i m serious i m serious i m serious so vice president biden would be the first to admit that he is not someone who always sticks to the script he can be gaffe prone the next president of the united states barack amer but he does pride himself on straight talk when he uses phrases like here s the deal here s the deal daughters always are wonderful well here s the deal guys here s the deal what he s saying is this is sincere biden has a decadeslong record in government and with that comes years of stories that he likes telling the end result can sometimes be a little bit of meandering and i really mean that and i didn t plan on going into that and so if you listen closely but i didn t know that he often uses the term anyway to wrap it up or to get back on message and so anyway did i answer your question and certainly mr biden is not the only candidate to rely on a particular set of phrases millionaires and billionaires but for mr biden his speech patterns go deeper biden s phrases are not tied to a particular policy prescription or even a particular political slogan and perhaps they speak to his roots before he was vice president mr biden was for decades a senator from delaware which is a pretty small state and some of his speaking mannerisms can in fact be viewed as a little bit of a reflection of the place where he actually did have that personal connection with so many people quite frankly folks if you are watching a public appearance from joe biden you are virtually guaranteed to see him use at least one of these phrases singing certainly he did acknowledge some differences he said he would renegotiate the trans pacific partnership a major trade agreement he advocated as vice president even while his record was under attack mr biden 76 played the happy statesman or tried to occasionally slipping as he addressed far younger contenders go easy on me kid mr biden said to ms harris a united states senator and former attorney general of california who is 54 years old as they took the stage in an exchange with juli n castro the former federal housing secretary and san antonio mayor mr biden referred to him as juli n and then thought better of it excuse me the secretary discussing criminal justice reform with senator cory booker who has been sharply critical of mr biden s record on that matter he jokingly skipped ahead calling him the president and stopping himself as he lightheartedly grabbed mr booker s arm excuse me the future president and in an opening statement that seemed to reinforce the introductory theme of his campaign taking relentless aim at president trump mr biden nodded to the diversity of fellow democrats onstage appearing sensitive to the balance of running against them as a white male septuagenarian we are strong and great because of this diversity mr president not in spite of it he said pushing back against mr trump s latest grievance powered rhetoric so mr president let s get something straight we love it we are not leaving it we are here to stay and we re certainly not going to leave it to you transcript unfortunately vice president biden you re just simply inaccurate in what you re describing the cost of doing nothing is far too expensive i m going to go back to vice president biden you do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to american families kamala harris said she s not trying to restructure society she put over 1 500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana she had a police department when she was there that in fact was abusing people s rights you want to compare records and frankly i m shocked that you do it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn t mr vice president there s a saying in my community you re dipping into the kool aid and you don t even know the flavor mr vice president you didn t answer my question what did you mean when you said when a woman works outside the home it s resulting in the deterioration of family mr vice president you want to be president of the united states you need to be able to answer the tough questions i guarantee you if you re debating donald trump he s not going to let you off the hook i love your affection for me you spent a lot of time with me and i don t know what math you do in new york i don t know what math you do anywhere california but i tell you that s a lot of money this idea is a bunch of malarkey what we re talking about here that puts working people first protester fire pantaleo thank you mayor de blasio the fire pantaleo fire pantaleo protester three million deportations please be respectful please be respectful in the crowd i think that folks are making a mistake by not pursuing impeachment i just want to make sure whatever we do doesn t end up with an acquittal by mitch mcconnell in the senate which it surely would and then president trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the united states congress when we look back in history at what happened when a president of the united states started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world the question is what will we have done and i believe the congress should do its job we have a predator living in the white house we can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the white house the first thing that i m going to do when i m president is i m going to clorox the oval office adios to donald trump read our full recap of night 2 of the democratic debates mr biden s standing atop the field is far from assured and some rival campaigns still consider him a paper tiger favorite doomed to crumble eventually under the weight of his lengthy record and indiscipline on the stump he has still struggled to communicate a detailed affirmative blueprint of what his presidency might look like and has yet to face senator elizabeth warren who has fashioned herself as the candidate with a policy plan for every occasion on a debate stage and his first debate performance was so rocky and so alarmed even close allies and advisers that he did not have a high bar to clear wednesday night but the forum provided a chance to articulate at least in broad strokes a compelling argument for the kind of deliberately paced change he is espousing one night after ms warren and senator bernie sanders outlined their shared promise of far more extensive social and economic upheaval it was also an opportunity to move beyond his disquieting showing five weeks ago when an evening of wandering and defensive answers seemed to threaten a bedrock claim of mr biden s candidacy that no other democrat has the presence and moxie to stare down mr trump that night in miami it was ms harris who initiated the conflict drawing on her personal experience with busing as a young black girl in california to castigate the former vice president for his warm remembrances of working with segregationist senators mr biden appeared flat footed defiant but sputtering at one point stopping himself abruptly with an unfortunate phrase anyway my time is up entering wednesday mr biden seemed determined to abandon such deference as even admirers acknowledge that he can no longer float above the fray with the fray savaging his long and often less than liberal record at every opportunity mr biden has in recent weeks demonstrated an increased willingness to engage responding in kind to ms harris and senator cory booker who has called mr biden an architect of mass incarceration some of mr biden s allies had described the first debate as a wake up call for him a reminder that regardless of his previous relationships with these democratic candidates he could no longer expect the decorous treatment he enjoyed as vice president his supporters urged him to focus on the future rather than rehashing the more controversial elements of his past to the extent he spends his time getting wrapped up in relitigating statements or comments or votes from 30 or 40 years ago i think we lose all of us collectively said senator chris coons a delaware democrat and close ally of mr biden s what is constructive is when our candidates put their best foot forward on the debate stage and show how they would be the best answer to the question that middle america is asking if we give you back the keys democrats where will you take us at times on wednesday mr biden appeared particularly keen to embrace the middle part he made clear that he was familiar with his opponents records on sensitive matters like criminal justice and policing issuing criticisms of those records that could have come from another candidate further to the left but on immigration mr biden proudly adopted a more centrist mantle at a time when many democratic strategists fear some in the presidential field are veering too far with calls to decriminalize unauthorized border crossings the fact of the matter is you should be able to if you cross the border illegally you should be able to be sent back mr biden said it s a crime when pressed on the number of deportations that took place while mr obama was in the white house amid the shouts of some protesters mr biden staunchly defended the administration s broader approach but as mr de blasio needled mr biden over whether he had personally spoken up mr biden showed a flash of exasperation i was vice president he said i am not the president i keep my recommendation in private unlike you i expect you would go ahead and say whatever was said privately with him that is not what i do what i do say to you is he moved to fundamentally change the system while mr biden was crisper and more energetic on wednesday than he was in the first debate his verbal tics and signature self interruptions were hardly eradicated he still cut himself off at times with a well worn trail off anyway follow along as our reporters analyze tonight s debate in real time mr biden s advisers said ahead of the debate that they anticipated that he would be the main target of the other candidates onstage and candidates from mr de blasio to ms harris to mr booker aimed to deliver but throughout the debate ms harris was also the subject of repeated criticism across the stage from senator michael bennet on health care to representative tulsi gabbard on criminal justice in one early exchange on health care mr biden signaled quickly that he would gladly join the effort you can t beat president trump with double talk he said accusing ms harris of vacillating and equivocating in her health care plans ms harris landed some of her own zingers they re probably confused because they ve not read it she said of the biden campaign s critique of her proposal but often found herself on the defensive occasionally demoting the former vice president to senator biden as she collected herself for a response ms harris and mr booker are particularly eager to chip away at mr biden s expansive backing among black voters who still recall him fondly from his eight years as mr obama s sidekick yet one lesson of mr biden s first debate is how durable much of his support seems to be so far while mr biden initially saw his standing fall a bit in polls with ms harris especially rising he appears to have reestablished a comfortable lead in recent surveys sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race a quinnipiac university national poll released monday showed mr biden well ahead of his competitors he was the choice of 34 percent of democratic voters and democratic leaning voters the survey found while ms harris came in at 12 percent among black voters the numbers were starker mr biden had the support of 53 percent of black democratic voters ms harris claimed only 7 percent perhaps channeling some confidence from those poll numbers mr biden vigorously defended his own record throughout the debate appearing more comfortable than he had in june not every flourish worked in his closing statement mr biden seemed to show his age a little while trying to promote a way to join his campaign go to joe 30330 he said apparently conflating a website with a text message destination the result instead was malarkey updated may 25 2020 advertisement
