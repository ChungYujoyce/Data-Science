cbs news chief medical correspondent dr jonathan lapook talks with medical staff at the johns hopkins hospital about how they re preparing for coronavirus and leading disease and epidemic experts weigh in on the u s response three months ago most americans had never heard of a coronavirus let alone the one causing the respiratory disease covid 19 what began as an outbreak in china has become a worldwide epidemic with more than 100 000 cases in more than 90 countries there is no vaccine or specific drug to treat it instead there is hygiene and quarantine here in the united states there s been panic buying of sanitizers and panic selling of stocks hundreds have been diagnosed with the virus yet a lack of tests has made it impossible to determine just how many people are infected at least 20 are dead at the johns hopkins hospital in baltimore maryland doctors have been preparing for weeks for what they believe will be a surge of sick patients infected with the coronavirus when cbs news chief medical correspondent dr jonathan lapook visited the hospital this past week dr lisa maragakis an expert in infectious disease was overseeing a team of 40 doctors nurses engineers and epidemiologists i see telemedicine and information technology over there infection control incident command and all these things up on bulletin boards and people behind computers lapook said there s a map in the incident response center that reports in real time the number of covid 19 cases around the world reminding the team of the worsening crisis this past wednesday the map showed 95 000 were infected four days later that number climbed past 109 000 when you saw it spreading more rapidly than you d like in china lapook said to maragakis what did that mean for your efforts here it absolutely kicked us into a different gear because that human to human transmission piece is the key to understanding that this is likely to spread maragakis said and so the level of concern increased and we started in earnest taking our pandemic respiratory virus plans and pulling them out maragakis elaborated on what those plans consist of where would we place patients who have a respiratory virus in a pandemic how are we going to staff those areas what measures might we we take to prevent those patients who are infected with the pandemic virus from transmitting it to our other patients and also to our personnel maragakis said the first infected patients will be sent to the biocontainment unit where staff is constantly practicing how to care for others while keeping themselves safe it s one of 10 like this in the country funded by the federal government in the wake of the 2014 ebola crisis the unit is equipped with rooms where exhaust fans create negative air pressure so pathogens like the coronavirus stay contained and downstairs in the emergency department triage nurse sophia henry is now routinely screening every patient she s on the lookout for cases of possible covid 19 symptoms include fever a cough and shortness of breath most cases about 80 are mild but more serious cases can lead to extensive lung damage and death reports so far suggest that children appear to be relatively spared from severe infection we know that patients are understandably concerned about this lapook said to henry what are you seeing in terms of the doctors nurses and other personnel here so people are concerned we re human we have children at home we have family members some of us are taking care of ill relatives henry said we are not martyrs we are not here to sacrifice ourselves we wanna be safe too but we have to take care of the patients this is what we do and what do you think you would feel if it turned out that somebody was positive lapook asked i would question sophia did you wear a mask did you follow the protocol did you do everything that you were supposed to do for yourself and for the patient and if my answer is yes then i m fine henry said dr tom inglesby is director of the johns hopkins center for health security he is an internationally recognized authority on how to prepare for an epidemic i think this disease meets the definition of pandemic inglesby told lapook we have cases on all continents late last month president trump cited one of dr inglesby s reports on global pandemic preparedness the united states is now we re rated number one mr trump said we re rated number one for being prepared i was surprised to see that report inglesby said about the president citing him i didn t know it was coming and it is true that the u s when you when you measure capabilities up and down in public health health care surveillance the u s is better prepared than any other country but it s also true that the report says that no country is really prepared for a major pandemic and that every country has work to do four months ago to help expose weak spots in disaster preparedness dr inglesby gathered industry and government leaders from around the world for a simulation exercise attending were representatives who could be hard hit during a global pandemic industries like airlines and hotels and organizations like the world bank and the united nations officials from the centers for disease control were also there from both the u s and china remember this was just a few weeks before the outbreak began in wuhan china the group spent an intensive day simulating how they would handle a pandemic of a new strain of coronavirus one much deadlier than covid 19 the simulation utilized actors reporting on the fictional outbreak complete with fictional travel bans shortages of medical supplies and economic freefall i think it opened the eyes of leaders in various places inglesby said the cdc director from china was one of the participants and he has commented since then how eerie the similarities are between the exercise and real life this past week airlines canceled thousands of flights and a travel industry trade group predicted virus fears could cost more than 100 billion in lost revenue the major disruptions in travel and trade that start pretty early in a pandemic we re seeing inglesby said beginning to see difficulties in supply chains around medical supplies ingredients for antibiotics how was the simulation able to predict these situations so accurately we ve seen a number of problems that haven t been solved with ebola and with 2009 h1n1 influenza inglesby said so we kind of gather up the lessons of those various outbreaks and how governments have responded they kind of worked together and tell a story the biggest setback in the government s response to the coronavirus outbreak has been its inability to deliver diagnostic tests to hospitals and labs across the country making it impossible for doctors to definitively diagnose the infection and hampering efforts to stop its spread i ve said from the very beginning we need millions and millions and millions of tests out there dr anthony fauci said if we have a million and a half or two million next week great if we don t too bad we should ve had it let s try for the next week no one in the u s has more experience fighting infectious disease outbreaks than fauci as director of the national institutes of allergy and infectious diseases since 1984 fauci has served as scientific adviser for every president since ronald reagan he s now a prominent voice on president trump s coronavirus task force did the shortage of testing kits allow this virus to spread more widely than it might have lapook asked fauci obviously you would like to have had tests available to do more widespread testing fauci said but i don t think you could make a direct line to say that if we had more tests this would ve been substantially different you can t guarantee that but you may have been able to identify somebody with minimal symptoms lapook said and oh let s isolate them let s figure out who their contacts are why don t we say it in a more i think realistic way it always would ve been better to have tests earlier fauci said we are now seeing community spread in the united states like what happened in king county in washington state a nursing home resident with no clear source of infection contracted the disease and it spread to others sixteen deaths have been linked to the nursing home is there any reason to think it s not gonna spread widely throughout the entire united states lapook asked it depends on the ability to do the kinds of public health measures that could have an impact on the degree to which it spreads fauci said the decision to do the travel restriction from china retrospectively now was a very wise decision no doubt because we would ve had many many more cases coming in particularly from wuhan which would ve seeded the country in china millions are quarantined lapook said is that where we re headed here in the united states i don t imagine that the degree of the draconian nature of what the chinese did would ever be either feasible applicable doable or whatever you wanna call it in the united states fauci said i don t think you could do that but the idea of social distancing i mean obviously that s something that will be seriously considered depending upon where we are in a particular region of the country social distancing is already happening in the u s people are staying away from each other tens of thousands of students are out of school many athletic competitions are either canceled or played without fans officials are urging people at high risk like the elderly and those with serious underlying health conditions to stay home as much as possible we don t try to stop the flu through quarantine lapook said to fauci we don t try to stop the common cold through quarantine yeah and the reason is because you know each season with some degree of variability that come march and april it s gonna go down fauci said there s no guarantee dr fauci told 60 minutes that the coronavirus will die down in warmer weather also we have a vaccine and medicines for the flu right now for the coronavirus there are no proven treatments dr fauci s lab at the national institutes of health has created a prototype for a vaccine but he estimates it will be at least a year before it is approved for widespread use after a week of mixed messages government officials promised there will soon be at least a million more tests available but today there are nowhere near enough early on the administration was criticized for downplaying the outbreak lapook said to fauci what s the danger of minimizing the risk of an infectious disease outbreak well i mean the danger of minimization on on in any arena of of infectious disease and outbreak is that you might get people to be complacent number one fauci said number two when bad things happen your credibility is lost because you ve downplayed something i think a lotta people are very interested in the relationship between the scientists and the administration lapook said and specifically if president trump says something at the beginning of february like we think we have it under control you re in the room were you able to talk to i pushed back of course fauci said some people have been worried that you ve been muzzled lapook said i m not muzzled because i m talking to you fauci said this past week dr tom inglesby told congress and 60 minutes one of the duties of public officials is to be candid it s a natural instinct of a health official or a government official to wanna reassure people lapook said to inglesby public health agencies aren t departments of reassurance they re departments of public health inglesby said they need to tell people what kind of interventions will be most useful for their families for their for their communities what individuals can do to try and decrease their own risks the very act of being honest and putting it in perspective is reassuring lapook said even if the information itself is worrisome yes yes it s true inglesby said i think there are gonna be challenges and there are are gonna be a lotta sick people but i think we ve got a very very strong health care system and a lot of talent in our public health agencies an incredible scientific base in this country and very very strong industry in the right places so i think we re we re gonna get through it i think it s just gonna pose a lotta challenges along the way produced by denise schrier cetta and howard l rosenberg associate producers katie brennan julie holstein and jennifer dozor
