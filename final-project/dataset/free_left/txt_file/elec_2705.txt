 by the new york times maggie haberman nicholas confessore and alan rappeport october 13 2015 october 13 2015 we chatted about and analyzed the first democratic presidential debate featuring hillary rodham clinton bernie sanders martin o malley jim webb and lincoln chafee full coverage news analysis key moments watch highlights from the first democratic presidential debate in las vegas on tuesday there was a lot to parse on the discussion of climate change at the debate martin o malley declared that he is the only candidate who would move to a clean electric grid by 2050 meaning an electricity system generated entirely by zero carbon sources of power such as wind and solar this is true but he declared that he would achieve this by making it his first order in office given that today less than 10 percent of the nation s electricity comes from such sources it would take a lot more than an executive order to spur such a transition it would take an aggressive policy pushed through congress and would almost certainly require a carbon tax economists say bernie sanders said as much that a carbon tax is essential for aggressively lowering emissions in the united states but he also correctly noted that it would most likely be impossible to enact such a tax without campaign finance reform because many of the donors funding the super pacs that back political campaigns oppose a carbon tax which is essentially a tax on fossil fuel consumption hillary rodham clinton chose to avoid the issue of what precisely she would do on climate change environmental advocates have pushed her to support a carbon tax but doing so could set her up for a super pac financed attack accusing her of supporting an energy tax instead of laying out a plan she repeated the anecdote of how she and president obama burst in unexpectedly on the chinese climate negotiators and forced them to strike a deal in 2009 hillary rodham clinton had the most speaking time of the debate with more than three times that of lincoln chafee who had the least on the issue of immigration bernie sanders has been forced to explain some history namely why he opposed the attempt at immigration reform in 2007 at the debate mr sanders said he rejected president george w bush s immigration overhaul that year because of its provisions regarding guest workers he explained that guest workers are working under terrible conditions but if they stand up for their rights they re thrown out of the country mr sanders has long voiced concerns about guest worker programs and he made no secret about his opposition to the immigration effort in 2007 the a f l c i o for instance praised him for his stance if poverty is increasing and if wages are going down mr sanders said that year i don t know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guest workers who will work for lower wages than american workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now if democratic voters are looking for someone who is not part of the same establishment that has been part of gridlock in washington hillary rodham clinton s long r sum might be a liability and martin o malley went straight at that issue asked whether mrs clinton is the change that people are looking for mr o malley who was standing right next to her said that he doubted that a resort to old names is what the voters are going to choose our country needs new leadership to move forward mr o malley said it was a stark accusation and mrs clinton appeared to be ready for it she said that she would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name and insisted that she is running on a lifetime of experience i certainly am not campaigning to become president because my last name is clinton she said bernie sanders declined to be as direct when he was asked the question about mrs clinton mr sanders said only i think there is profound frustration all over this country with establishment politics but look for more of that theme on the campaign trail it is not going away hillary rodham clinton and bernie sanders clashed over their plans to reform wall street a debate that exposes fault lines within the democratic party my plan is more comprehensive and frankly it s tougher said mrs clinton a notion mr sanders strongly resisted well it s not true he said later their differences are largely a matter of opinion but here are the policy issues at the root of the disagreement mrs clinton introduced a financial reform proposal last week that does include meaningful policy changes to build on the dodd frank financial reform law and that would make life more difficult with mega banks it includes a new fee for large risky banks new authority for regulators to potentially break them up and a new focus on overseeing the unregulated shadow banking markets that were an often overlooked cause of the last crisis mr sanders has instead emphasized reinstating the glass steagall act a depression era law to separate commercial from investment banking which was repealed under the clinton administration the two candidates largely agree in the direction of financial reform favoring policies to try to reduce risk even if it means less profitable banks but mrs clinton is more focused on specific reforms to address the causes of the last crisis and potential sources of the next mr sanders is more focused on reducing the size and political influence of the biggest banks lincoln chafee had a gimme a break moment when he was asked about his 1999 vote to repeal the glass steagall act which struck down the wall between commercial and investment banks mr chafee seemed to find the question to be unfair deflecting that he had just taken office and that he was dealing with the aftermath of his father s death mr chafee s response would lead some to believe that he was vastly unprepared for that important vote but here is a look at the timeline the final vote came on nov 4 1999 the same day mr chafee was sworn in as rhode island s senator he filled the seat vacated by the death of his father john chafee on oct 24 1999 in a democratic debate that offers many contrasts with republicans perhaps no difference was as stark as the conversation about immigration on the stage in las vegas the candidates went out of their way to demonstrate their support for immigrants with most of them saying they support allowing illegal immigrants some access to obamacare and receiving in state tuition for attending college hillary rodham clinton and martin o malley both said they would go further than president clinton did when he took executive action to allow millions of illegal immigrants to live and work in the united states without fear of deportation asked whether illegal immigrants should have access to subsidies under the affordable care act jim webb said i wouldn t have a problem with that all of which could not be more different from the republican debates where most of the candidates repeatedly declared their desire to rid the country of all 11 million undocumented immigrants mrs clinton sought to highlight those differences at one point noting that the democratic candidates were offering a different message than republicans who she said have demonized hardworking immigrants and who have insulted them up to the last break hillary rodham clinton and senator bernie sanders had nearly double the speaking time of each of the other candidates one issue that senator bernie sanders cannot afford to cede to his rivals is a commitment to taking on the big banks on behalf of regular people but in a series of rapid fire exchanges the other candidates onstage claimed the issue as their own too hillary rodham clinton acknowledged that she respected the passion of mr sanders on the issue but she insisted that her plan for the banks is more comprehensive a charge that mr sanders said was not true martin o malley for his part criticized mrs clinton accusing her of not being for putting a firewall between the banks and other more risky investments that could lead to another economic collapse the intensity of the exchanges underscored the importance of the issue in the democratic primary where all of the candidates know that progressive voters are looking for a president who will be tough on the rich well i think that s pretty obvious i think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we ve had up until this point hillary rodham clinton on how her presidency would be different from a third president obama term whistle blowers do not run to russia and try to get protection from putin martin o malley it did not take long for hillary rodham clinton s opponents to grab on to her vote in favor of the resolution authorizing the use of force in iraq a subject that dominated in her debates with barack obama in the 2008 race but in bernie sanders she faces an opponent who opposes the use of almost any force in the current conflicts in the middle east and he cited only one case in which he had supported it in kosovo what was interesting is that only mrs clinton supported a no fly zone in syria an action that usually appeals to the human rights instincts among democrats mrs clinton was the only one to come back with a plan of how to use the creation of the no fly zone for diplomatic leverage in dealing with russia hillary rodham clinton said that when she was secretary of state it was allowed by the state department for her to rely on a personal email account instead of having a government one at the time mrs clinton took office in february 2009 there was no explicit prohibition on the exclusive use of a private email server the state department s general policy was that email generally be conducted on an authorized computer with adequate security measures the exclusive use of a personal email account does not appear to be an option anyone considered eight months after mrs clinton became secretary of state federal record keeping regulations were enhanced to say that if employees use nongovernment email it must be preserved in the appropriate agency record keeping system mrs clinton did not hand over all of her emails so they could be preserved on a record keeping system until a year and a half after she left the state department call it an evolution or a flip flop in 2010 as secretary of state hillary rodham clinton said she was inclined to approve a permit for the keystone xl pipeline as a candidate for president she refused to give a concrete position on the issue until she said last month that she opposed the project after a number of liberal donors made clear that they saw opposition to it as a litmus test issue when asked about the greatest security threat facing the united states bernie sanders cited climate change and nothing else martin o malley cited climate change as a threat multiplier that could exacerbate violence in the middle east republicans have attacked both candidates for drawing links between climate change and violence and the rise of the islamic state also known as isis or isil in syria but while the connection might seem surprising it is grounded in scientific research a study published in march in the proceedings of the national academies of science was the latest in a series of reports highlighting the connection that study concluded that extreme drought in syria between 2006 and 2009 was most likely because of climate change and that the drought was a factor in the violent uprising that began there in 2011 the link between climate change and conflict has been debated for years a working group of the intergovernmental panel on climate change wrote in 2014 that there was justifiable common concern that climate change increased the risk of armed conflict in certain circumstances but said it was unclear how strong the effect was the united states military has described climate change as a threat multiplier that may lead to greater instability in parts of the world hillary rodham clinton once again sought to get past the email scandal that has plagued her campaign for months but this time she had a nationwide audience to make her case that the issue has become nothing more than a partisan attack she called the house committee investigating her email a partisan vehicle that is nothing more than an arm of the republican national committee but she said efforts to lower her poll ratings have not worked i am still standing she said i am happy to be part of this debate and i intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the american people in that she got some blunt unlikely support from her main rival bernie sanders i think the secretary is right mr sanders said that is that the american people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails that might have been a clever move for mr sanders making him look kind to his rival even as he seeks to push the campaign back to the issues but it also helped mrs clinton dodge what might have been one of the toughest issues of her first debate four of the five candidates all but former senator jim webb of virginia explicitly mentioned climate change in their introductory remarks senator bernie sanders gave the most impassioned plea for action citing a moral obligation to act on climate change hillary rodham clinton said she endorsed taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy an echo of her pledge in the january 2008 democratic debate with senators barack obama and john edwards during which she said i want to put money into clean energy jobs green collar jobs after his election president obama went on to embrace the idea of green jobs as a strategy for economic growth his administration s bureau of labor statistics conducted a study on green goods and services to measure job growth related to environmental activities in 2011 that bureau concluded that there were 3 4 million jobs related to environmental and clean energy industries but economists criticized that accounting saying that while the mitigation of the effects of severe climate change including drought and flooding could prevent economic harm it was disingenuous to suggest that clean energy jobs could be a major economic driver in 2013 the bureau of labor statistics green goods and services department was shut down the true value of g g s is found in their impact on the environment and not in the number of people they employ keith hall the former bureau of labor statistics commissioner wrote in forbes the goal should be to secure the largest possible environmental benefit at the lowest economic cost counting green jobs equates to counting part of the economic cost of achieving this environmental impact we want this to be small not large the american people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails bernie sanders to hillary rodham clinton before the first break senator bernie sanders had slightly more speaking time than hillary rodham clinton and nearly three times as much as lincoln chafee hillary rodham clinton took a moment to point out that martin o malley once was one of her important supporters having endorsed her 2008 presidential campaign indeed mrs clinton noted her appreciation of the endorsement at the time issuing a glowing news release announcing mr o malley s endorsement and his appointment as chairman of her maryland campaign martin is a terrific leader whose innovative initiatives have been emulated around the country mrs clinton said in the release in may 2007 i m honored that he will lead our efforts in maryland urbandale iowa urbandale is a republican stronghold west of des moines but about 40 local democrats are gathered to watch the debate in a mexican restaurant a few doors down from the abandoned former state headquarters of gov scott walker of wisconsin representative john forbes a democrat who represents the city in the state legislature said he was undecided but nonetheless offered strong opinions about the leading candidates my big question tonight is trust and honesty he said adding that hillary rodham clinton has to overcome questions about her use of a private email server it s a character issue he said if she s not telling the truth on this i have concerns about what will happen in the future as for senator bernie sanders who has surged in iowa polls mr forbes said it may be difficult for him to win the general election because he s too far to the left in his goldilocks formulation martin o malley is the candidate who may be just right if i have to predict who will do well i think martin o malley could break out tonight said mr forbes who has met with the former maryland governor but is not ready to endorse him people need to take a closer look at him as he defends his record on gun control bernie sanders is backing away from his 2005 vote for a law that protects gunmakers and dealers from liability lawsuits asked in the debate if he wants to shield gun companies from lawsuits he replied of course not he called the 2005 measure a large and complicated bill and suggested that his intent was to protect gun shop owners not gunmakers but in an interview on cnn in july mr sanders defended the protection of gunmakers if somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and that murderer kills somebody with the gun do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible he asked not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer that is not what a lawsuit should be about if senator bernie sanders thought there was any chance that he could slip past criticism for his opposition to gun control he was mistaken both hillary rodham clinton and martin o malley jumped as soon as they had the chance after mr sanders explained away his support for giving gun manufacturers immunity from prosecution for shootings by saying it was complicated mrs clinton said flatly that he was wrong it wasn t that complicated to me he was going to give immunity to the only industry in america she said everybody else has to be accountable mr o malley was even tougher describing his efforts on behalf of gun control in maryland when he was governor mr sanders responded to both the same way by suggesting that those fighting for gun control are shouting about the issue all the shouting in the world is not going to do what i hope all of us want he said adding that he supports closing the gun show loophole hillary rodham clinton confronted with her 2012 speech in australia where she called the trans pacific partnership the gold standard in trade agreements said she had hoped it would be the gold standard but she claimed that when it was concluded recently it fell short it is true that when she gave that speech in 2012 the pacific accord which ropes in 40 percent of the world s economy was far from complete but during the last two rounds of negotiations in maui and atlanta the trade deal shifted to the left not the right negotiators agreed to give pharmaceutical giants fewer years of intellectual property protection before allowing competition from generic drug makers they added teeth to the antiwildlife trafficking provisions they blocked tobacco companies from using the trade accord s tribunal system to challenge member states antismoking laws and they added new rules for labor in malaysia and vietnam yet crucial democratic constituencies labor unions liberal activists and many environmental groups have remained implacably opposed to the trade deal and mrs clinton turned against it that strikes many as not a tarnished gold standard but a politically expedient decision in his opening statement bernie sanders described joblessness among young minorities using numbers that while not inaccurate exaggerate those problems relative to more standard measurements today in america we have more people in jail than any other country on earth mr sanders said african american youth unemployment is 51 percent hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent it seems to me that instead of building more jails providing more incarceration maybe just maybe we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids those numbers are much higher than the standard minority youth unemployment numbers published by the bureau of labor statistics in those numbers the unemployment rate among 16 to 19 year old african americans was 31 5 percent and the rate was 18 6 percent among 16 to 19 year old hispanics mr sanders s campaign has said previously that he is using research from the economic policy institute that uses a different broader definition of unemployment that includes people with a part time job who want full time work and people who are not actively looking for a job because they think there are few opportunities the e p i data also uses a slightly different age bracket to calculate youth unemployment from age 17 to 20 and the data is limited to high school graduates lincoln chafee opened the debate on tuesday night with a bold claim that he has managed to steer clear of scandal over three decades in politics mr chafee crafted his claim as a not so subtle early jab at hillary rodham clinton echoing a line he has repeated about his own clean record but how does his assertion hold up pretty well all in all one of the former rhode island governor s more notable controversies stemmed from his use of the term holiday tree instead of christmas tree as a nod to separation of church and state when other politicians from his state backed an ill fated 75 million bond issue to video game maker 38 studios which later went bankrupt mr chafee as a candidate for governor opposed the deal still as governor some suggested he might have done more to monitor the state s investment in the company no not at all hillary rodham clinton responding to a question on whether bernie sanders is tough enough on gun control i m very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service i have had no scandals i ve always been honest i have the courage to take the long term view and i have shown good judgment i have high ethical standards lincoln chafee in his opening statement by wilson andrews thomas kaplan and alicia parlapiano the three leading democratic presidential candidates overlap significantly in their positions on key issues each pushing a liberal agenda by different degrees hillary rodham clinton has a busy post debate schedule as she tries to rally democrats while collecting another endorsement from a sitting cabinet member before testifying next week in front of the house select committee investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in benghazi her schedule of events includes a trip to texas where she will collect an endorsement from a hispanic rising star within the democratic party julian castro to virginia where she will appear with an old friend gov terry mcauliffe and to iowa where she will appear with the singer katy perry the trips signal a new level of focus as she tries to move beyond both the first debate and her testimony two moments that her advisers see as pivotal toward regaining her footing after a rocky summer mrs clinton will appear at a question and answer session with the hispanic chamber of commerce on wednesday the day after the debate she will also collect an endorsement from mr castro the housing and urban development secretary who is seen as among the democratic party s brightest lights mr castro will become the second sitting cabinet member to endorse mrs clinton and the endorsement comes as vice president joseph r biden jr is considering whether to run for president next week mrs clinton will testify before the congressional committee the next day a friday she will hold a rally with mr mcauliffe who was the chairman of her 2008 presidential campaign in virginia a pivotal general election battleground and a state whose voters are often said to most closely resemble the broader electorate after that mrs clinton will be joined by ms perry at a rally in iowa ahead of the jefferson jackson democratic party dinner where the presidential primary candidates are set to appear big rallies have not been a central part of mrs clinton s campaign although she has begun to hold them in recent weeks las vegas the mass of bernie sanders supporters in red gathered in the south before slowly inching toward the wynn hotel across the sky bridges of the las vegas strip equal rights job that s pay bernie s right for the u s a spying their encroachment a sea of blue ran to meet them and slow their advancement high above south las vegas boulevard armed with a hill a ry 20 16 chant at the ready and so the debate day clash between hillary rodham clinton and mr sanders first manifested itself hours before the candidates were to meet as members of the national nurses united union and the opposing hillary for nevada group traded chants outside the wynn both groups were as peaceful and respectful as full throated screaming supporters can be making sure to give equal space to the opposing side as they waved signs and tried to outchant the others as they met on a bridge and an escalator at one point when the nurses union moved closer to the hotel a clinton supporter shouted we got those redshirts off the bridge the nurses union wearing red bernie ballot shirts featuring an outline of the senator s unkempt hair and wire frame glasses had planned its march more than a week ago beginning at the nearby treasure island hotel the group had numerous chants including a looping we are nurses two a little bit louder three we need bernie for the people one and varied placards and cutouts of mr sanders s face the nurses they just see the fallout of all social injustices in their hospitals said roseann demoro executive director of the union bernie is about what the nurses are about caring compassion community the clinton supporters had been camped outside the wynn since midnight patrolling the sky bridges and sidewalks with bright blue hillary signs and they eventually began moving with a madam president call and cheers i think what hillary brings to the table is a real knowledgeable understanding of the issues that are important to all nevadans said emmy ruiz the nevada state director for mrs clinton s campaign not only that she s been a fighter for us for so many years already eventually their numbers swelled to a point where the bridge was slightly shaking and tourists trying to navigate the strip were unable to cross so local police officers and casino security guards had the groups go their separate ways which they did peacefully yet also quite loudly cnn can put away the extra lectern vice president joseph r biden jr isn t coming mr biden s office said he would watch the democratic presidential debate from his official residence at the naval observatory in washington vice president biden will host a high school reunion following which he will watch the democratic debate at the naval observatory an obama administration official said the high school classmates a group fewer than 50 will not be staying for the debate the official said but it was not known who else if anyone the vice president might be watching with even though he has not declared whether he will be a candidate cnn had said he could come at the last minute and it even put aside a sixth lectern in case he made a surprise appearance but maybe mr biden will share his assessment of the debate or even his latest thinking about his own future with president obama they are scheduled to have lunch at the white house on wednesday late night comedians such as stephen colbert had a laugh at the expense of cnn poking fun at its stoking of the possibility that vice president joseph r biden jr could join the democratic presidential debate tonight the ribbing continued during a news media walk through before the debate sam feist cnn s washington bureau chief had just finished leading a walk through of the debate hall for cameramen and reporters after a few technical questions on matters like light sprays one reporter asked what the cutoff time was for mr biden to be invited to the debate prompting chuckles mr feist with a hint of humor responded that the criteria were announced awhile ago there s no indication that vice president biden is on his way mr feist said he would have to announce his intent to run for president beforehand and i don t think that s happened yet another reporter followed up asking what preparations had been made just in case mr biden showed up at the time we announced our criteria we didn t know how many candidates were going to meet those criteria mr feist said sounding slightly more exasperated with the biden questions as we do for every debate we have an extra podium we just came from california where we had 11 podiums so there was no shortage of podiums so we did have a podium but we have not received any indication that he would be here las vegas the spotlight on tuesday will be on the las vegas strip for the democratic presidential debate but the nevada democratic party spent the day before seeking to turn that energy into some actionable causes like running the actual state caucuses in february so with 36 hours to go before the debate a couple of dozen party supporters and volunteers gathered at the local democratic headquarters a few miles from the shadows of the casinos to snack on 30 inch pizzas from napoli s and run through caucus training i know y all have been on the phones and in the neighborhoods for a while now but this really kicks off the campaign season representative dina titus of nevada said before the training began look around this room this is the face of america she said then added with a laugh that las vegas nevada represents the country much better than iowa or new hampshire and with that hillary barrett the deputy training organizer of the presidential caucuses took to the front of the room and began to go through the somewhat complicated ins and outs of exactly how nevada democrats run their caucuses first up was viability in which the precinct leader determines the minimum number of people that must be in a candidate s corner to be rewarded a delegate then the attendees all spread to the four corners of the room to caucus with their chosen candidates in this case miss piggy kermit the frog fozzie bear and the uncommitted those who don t like any candidate and would rather vote later in the process for the training fozzie unfortunately was able to amass only four supporters below the required amount to be considered viable so his four supporters were then wooed by each of the three viable candidates piggy has been a strong female voice within the democratic party for as long as i can remember said a member of miss piggy s caucus we ve all probably heard the song it ain t easy being green and kermit is the one who comes back stronger than ever every time countered the kermit caucus following their pitches the fozzie supporters split up and when all was said and done miss piggy had amassed the largest caucus group capturing 17 of the 35 people and ms barrett explained the final delegate math and the allocation and election process all the way to the democratic national convention when she finished there were barely any questions i know most of the people in this room and they are well trained ms titus said but a little refresher course never hurts senator bernie sanders has been working over the last few weeks on what some democrats see as a vulnerability for him in tonight s debate his relationship with hispanics and his language on immigration in an effort to show that he is sensitive to the issues concerning hispanic voters mr sanders appeared at a forum hosted by the congressional hispanic caucus institute in washington last week where he took aim at donald j trump for making unacceptable comments about mexican immigrants he talked about his immigrant father and he held a rally in tucson on friday in a city and state arizona with a thriving immigrant population with the debate tonight taking place in nevada a state with a growing hispanic electorate a key part of the modern democratic base overhauling immigration is certain to be raised and mr sanders has faced struggles throughout his candidacy explaining some of his views he has repeatedly discussed the notion that immigration has helped keep working class wages down and he has offered at times contradictory statements about why he voted against a 2007 immigration overhaul bill and why he opposed portions of a similar 2013 effort at a hispanic chamber of commerce event over the summer he was confronted with questions about why he opposed the 2007 effort my concern about the bill that i voted against was that there was too much emphasis on bringing low wage workers into this country he said what i want to see and what is better about the recent bill is a pathway toward citizenship which is absolutely essential he has been deeply critical of the guest worker visa programs that have been part of immigration overhaul efforts particularly in the 2007 bill an aide to mr sanders insisted recently that the senator s problem with worker visas was that he did not want to see a massive and permanent expansion of temporary guest workers whose visas are tied to their employers instead the aide said mr sanders would prefer to see guest workers have meaningful rights but mr sanders has also made clear he believes that there are a fixed number of jobs available in the united states and that undocumented workers compete for those jobs with under educated citizens todd schulte the president of fwd us the mark zuckerberg backed group that supports comprehensive immigration overhaul praised mr sanders for supporting a pathway to citizenship that said the debate is a great opportunity for him to stop repeating debunked myths that immigrants take jobs from native born americans and instead say that immigrants and immigration reform create jobs and help build a strong middle class mr schulte said subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race the
