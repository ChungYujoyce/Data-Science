advertisement supported by the president notified lawmakers late on friday saying he had lost confidence in the inspector general for the intelligence community by maggie haberman charlie savage and nicholas fandos president trump is firing the intelligence community inspector general whose insistence on telling lawmakers about a whistle blower complaint about his dealings with ukraine triggered impeachment proceedings last fall the president told lawmakers in a letter late friday the move came as mr trump announced his intent to name a white house aide as the independent watchdog for 500 billion in corporate pandemic aid and notified congress of other nominees to inspector general positions including one that would effectively oust the newly named chairman of a panel to oversee how the government spends 2 trillion in coronavirus relief the slew of late night announcements coming as the world s attention is gripped by the coronavirus pandemic raised the specter of a white house power play over the community of inspectors general independent officials whose mission is to root out waste fraud and abuse within the government mr trump is ousting the intelligence community inspector general michael k atkinson because he lost confidence in him the president wrote in a letter to leaders of the two congressional intelligence committees he gave no further explanation as is the case with regard to other positions where i as president have the power of appointment by and with the advice and consent of the senate it is vital that i have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general mr trump wrote that is no longer the case with regard to this inspector general the president has long discussed his desire to fire several inspectors general and he has been talking to aides about his desire to oust mr atkinson since last fall tarring the inspector general as disloyal because he sought to share information with congress about the president s efforts to pressure ukraine into delivering him personal political benefits mr atkinson s fate was sealed after the trial on impeachment charges ended said one trump administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a delicate matter under the law that created the position of the inspector general for the intelligence community the president can only remove that person a month after notifying the intelligence communities of his intentions and rationale but rather than being permitted to serve for another month the white house told mr atkinson late friday that he was being placed on administrative leave according to multiple people familiar with the matter the move effectively circumvents the 30 day safeguard by sidelining him immediately the administration official described the move as part of a broader shake up of the intelligence community that mr trump has set in motion in the past several weeks he recently installed richard grenell the ambassador to germany known for his combative conservatism as the acting director of national intelligence a position where presidents typically look to install career officials or apolitical appointees and mr trump has nominated one of his top allies in congress representative john ratcliffe of texas to take over the post permanently the ouster of mr atkinson came as the white house announced five nominees for inspector general positions they included brian d miller an aide to mr trump in the white house counsel s office who was tapped to be the newly created special inspector general for pandemic recovery mr miller has served as an inspector general for the general services administration but in more recent years he has performed a more political role among other things he helped respond to oversight requests for white house documents during mr trump s impeachment trial his nomination requires senate confirmation mr trump also nominated a senior customs and border protection policy official jason abend to be the defense department inspector general that position is vacant and is held on an acting basis by glenn a fine the deputy inspector general at the pentagon and a longtime justice department inspector general with a reputation for independence this week a group of fellow inspectors general named mr fine to be the chairman of the new pandemic response accountability committee with control of an 80 million budget to police how the government carries out the 2 trillion coronavirus relief bill if mr abend is confirmed mr fine would lose his acting role and could no longer lead the committee mr trump also nominated three current and former justice department officials to be the new inspectors general at the c i a the education department and the tennessee valley authority the president has been focused for weeks on rooting out administration officials perceived as disloyal in february after the republican controlled senate acquitted mr trump of charges that he abused his power and obstructed congress the president ousted other administration officials who cooperated in the impeachment inquiry by providing testimony including gordon d sondland the ambassador to the european union and lt col alexander s vindman a national security council aide the white house marched colonel vindman out with security guards along with lt col yevgeny vindman an army officer who also worked on the national security council staff but had played no role in the impeachment inquiry but he happens to be colonel vindman s brother before his role in bringing to light mr trump s actions toward ukraine that led to his impeachment mr atkinson had been nominated to the position by mr trump and confirmed unanimously by the senate the two top democrats on the intelligence oversight panels expressed vehement objections on friday portraying mr trump s move as political and retribution representative adam b schiff democrat of california and the chairman of the house intelligence committee who was the lead impeachment manager called the dead of night firing in the middle of a national emergency yet another blatant attempt by the president to gut the independence of the intelligence community and retaliate against those who dare to expose presidential wrongdoing and senator mark warner of virginia the ranking democrat on the senate intelligence committee said the work of the intelligence community has never been about loyalty to a single individual it s about keeping us all safe from those who wish to do our country harm we should all be deeply disturbed by ongoing attempts to politicize the nation s intelligence agencies the two top republicans on both committees including senator richard m burr of north carolina the chairman of the senate panel did not immediately comment on mr atkinson s dismissal on aug 12 mr atkinson received a whistle blower complaint from an intelligence community official alleging that mr trump was abusing his powers over foreign policy to pressure ukraine to announce investigations that could deliver him personal political benefits including by withholding a white house meeting and military aid that congress had appropriated to kyiv under a federal whistle blower law if the intelligence community inspector general determines that such a complaint presents an urgent concern the office of the director of national intelligence shall disclose it to congress in a letter on aug 26 to the acting director at the time joseph maguire mr atkinson declared that the complaint appears credible and met that standard the trump administration nevertheless refused to send the information to lawmakers but it later reversed course under political pressure the initial attempt to cover up what mr atkinson was trying to tell lawmakers drastically heightened attention toward mr trump s behavior toward ukraine touching off the impeachment proceedings mr atkinson also protected the identity of the whistle blower saying in a missive to mr maguire that the intelligence official s name was known to him but he was not disclosing it some of the president s allies repeatedly tried to disclose the name of the whistle blower publicly as the impeachment inquiry proceeded during the inquiry mr atkinson testified before the house intelligence committee in a closed door session about what he knew even as other administration officials refused to cooperate mr trump told lawmakers in his letter on friday that he would later submit a nominee to replace mr atkinson who has my full confidence and who meets the appropriate qualifications an intelligence official said thomas a monheim the general counsel of the national geospatial intelligence agency would serve as acting inspector general on twitter andrew p bakaj a lawyer who represented the whistle blower quickly labeled the dismissal retaliation but the high pressure role of an inspector general carries the risk of aggravating presidents or senior officials in any administration mr atkinson s predecessor i charles mccullough iii said he kept few personal items in his office because he feared he could be fired at any point the job is not for the faint of heart it s a job hazard for anyone in an i g position mr mccullough said mr atkinson mr mccullough said messed with the bull and got the horns michael s schmidt contributed reporting
