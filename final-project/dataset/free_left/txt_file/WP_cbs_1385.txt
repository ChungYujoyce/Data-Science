watch cbsn live by megan cerullo july 17 2019 4 01 pm moneywatch joaquin el chapo guzman was sentenced to life plus thirty years in prison wednesday for running an operation that trafficked an estimated 12 6 billion worth of heroin cocaine marijuana and synthetic fentanyl into the united states over nearly three decades the government has also ordered him to repay that sum he s believed to have earned through his illegal business while it s difficult to parse individual responsibility and determine exactly how much guzman has cost the united states in law enforcement incarceration healthcare and other expenses the effort to bring him to justice and the ripple effects of his illegal activity have been costly the u s government spends roughly 50 billion per year on drug prohibition enforcement efforts about 20 billion to 30 billion of which is used to enforce cocaine and heroin prohibition according to jeffery miron director of the department of economics at harvard university and the author of the report entitled the budgetary implications of drug prohibition you obviously can t attribute that all to el chapo or even the mexican drug cartels because some of it comes from china miron said the drug kingpin has also denied being responsible for all illicit activity ascribed to the cartel which experts say has a hub and spoke business model rather than a hierarchical structure and so calculating the united states expenditure on el chapo is not an exact science and even experts estimates are at best speculative we can count up how much we spend but it s messy and attributing it to any one drug or any cartel is really speculative and doesn t answer the most policy relevant question which is about who created the policies and what would happen if they changed miron told cbs moneywatch at his peak in 2013 guzman as leader of the sinaloa cartel the largest in the world claimed about one quarter of the drug trade in the u s according to david shirk professor at the university of san diego and an expert in u s mexico relations i think its fair to say it s been a very costly effort on the part of the u s to go after this particular individual and his operations shirk told cbs moneywatch the trial alone has consumed significant government resources shirk pointed out the costs add up quickly if you have 10 government attorneys working almost full time on this and making about 125 000 a year you quickly get to 1 million he said then there are the costs associated with holding guzman in a high security facility and transporting him to and from the trial you are talking about millions of dollars just for his trial shirk said i would think that in the 20 to 30 years in which he has been a major player you have to be talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that have been dedicated in man hours and equipment just to go after chapo guzman and his organization while guzman was finally brought to justice on wednesday after he was convicted in february of murder conspiracy and drug charges the sinaloa cartel continues to thrive experts say and the convicted kingpin s capture is unlikely to have any kind of significant positive effect on curbing the drug trade it does merit come questioning as to whether it s the most efficient use of law enforcement resources to go after major drug traffickers instead of trying to find ways to get people away from using drugs or into rehab or keeping younger at risk youth from getting involved in criminal activities in mexico that might have very well been a better use of resources shirk said miron an advocate for the legalization of all drugs contends that chasing the kingpin is in a sense like a playing a game of whac a mole at a certain level his arrest or disappearance doesn t matter because he was just replaced by someone else who did more or less the same thing so there was no actual effect miron said if there is any cost we incurred it s relative to an alternative policy like legalization it s the u s spending because we are choosing to throw away money to stop something we are never going to stop if the demand for drugs persists suppliers will continue to thrive no matter if guzman is imprisoned it doesn t matter if you lock up a particular supplier miron said substance abuse and addiction fueled in part by the sinaloa cartel is linked to nearly one third of all hospital costs according to the center on addiction a non profit organization the organization s most recent report published a decade ago estimates that substance use and addiction cost federal state and local governments at least 467 7 billion in 2005 the largest amount of government spending 207 billion at the time was for health care and the second largest amount 47 billion back then was spent on the justice system including incarceration probation parole and criminal juvenile and family courts according to the center the national institute on drug abuse estimates that the illicit drugs annual costs in crime lost work productivity and health care equaled 193 billion in 2007 we are talking about millions of people negatively affected in the u s by the availability of addictive drugs in often fatal doses and guzman helped fuel the opioid crisis which has led to tens of thousands of americans killing themselves said mexican drug cartel expert bruce bagley he s not the only drug lord and the costs to the united states and its healthcare system are virtually incalculable but they add up to tens of billions of dollars of debt bagley said miron blames u s policy not el chapo for what he considers to be a waste of money we are choosing to throw money away to stop something we are never going to stop so all the bragging and boasting about locking up el chapo is meaningless miron said as for the 12 6 billion the u s is demanding as part of the drug lord s sentence experts say the money has long been hidden by guzman s extensive network of family members and co conspirators they are not going to get a single cent of that because it was hidden by his kids and former wives long ago before he was arrested bagley said they ll
