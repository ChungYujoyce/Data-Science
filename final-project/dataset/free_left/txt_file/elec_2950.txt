advertisement supported by by julian e barnes and matthew rosenberg washington in 2016 american intelligence agencies delivered urgent and explicit warnings about russia s intentions to try to tip the american presidential election and a detailed assessment of the operation afterward thanks in large part to informants close to president vladimir v putin and in the kremlin who provided crucial details but two years later the vital kremlin informants have largely gone silent leaving the c i a and other spy agencies in the dark about precisely what mr putin s intentions are for november s midterm elections according to american officials familiar with the intelligence the officials do not believe the sources have been compromised or killed instead they have concluded they have gone to ground amid more aggressive counterintelligence by moscow including efforts to kill spies like the poisoning in march in britain of a former russian intelligence officer that utilized a rare russian made nerve agent current and former officials also said the expulsion of american intelligence officers from moscow has hurt collection efforts and officials also raised the possibility that the outing of an f b i informant under scrutiny by the house intelligence committee an examination encouraged by president trump has had a chilling effect on intelligence collection technology companies and political campaigns in recent weeks have detected a plethora of political interference efforts originating overseas including hacks of republican think tanks and fake liberal grass roots organizations created on facebook senior intelligence officials including dan coats the director of national intelligence have warned that russians are intent on subverting american democratic institutions but american intelligence agencies have not been able to say precisely what are mr putin s intentions he could be trying to tilt the midterm elections simply sow chaos or generally undermine trust in the democratic process the officials seeking to protect methods of collection from russia would not provide details about lost sources but acknowledged the degradation in the information collected from russia they spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal classified information a spokesman for the c i a declined to comment to determine what the russian government is up to the united states employs multiple forms of intelligence including intercepted communications and penetrated computer networks the united states continues to intercept russian communication and the flow of that intelligence remains strong said current and former officials and russian informants could still meet their c i a handlers outside russia further from moscow s counterintelligence apparatus but people inside or close to the kremlin remain critical to divining whether there is a strategy behind seemingly scattershot efforts to undermine american institutions spies and informants overseas also give american intelligence agencies early warning about influence campaigns interference operations or other attempts to compromise the united states that information in turn can improve the ability of domestic agencies like the department of homeland security and the f b i to quickly identify and attempt to stop those efforts because clandestine meetings can take months to set up and complete a lengthy lag can pass before the c i a realizes a key source has gone silent according to former officials it is rare for the agency to discover immediately that informants have eroded or are running scared only after several missed meetings might c i a officers and analysts conclude that a source has decided it is too dangerous to pass information in 2016 american intelligence officials began to realize the scope of russia s efforts when they gathered intelligence suggesting that moscow wanted to use trump campaign officials wittingly or not to help sow chaos john o brennan the former director of the c i a testified before the house intelligence committee in may 2017 about a tense period a year earlier when he came to believe that mr putin was trying to steer the outcome toward a victory for mr trump mr brennan described the broad outlines of the intelligence in his congressional testimony and his disclosures backed up the accounts of the information provided by the current and former officials i was convinced in the summer that the russians were trying to interfere in the election and they were very aggressive mr brennan told lawmakers this year mr coats issued a series of warnings saying the russian government and mr putin in particular is intent on undermining american democratic systems at an appearance this month at the white house mr coats said intelligence agencies continue to see a pervasive messaging campaign by russia to try and weaken and divide the united states he added that those efforts cover issues relevant to the elections transcript these cyber actors are using social media platforms to spread disinformation and set americans against each other targeting both sides of a country s most divisive issues you re watching a recent senate intelligence committee hearing about how foreign internet trolls are using social media to influence american politics in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election russian trolls used disinformation campaigns to sow discord experts are now seeing similar activity heading into the 2018 midterms the trolls are trying to improve their tactics they re trying to get better at hiding their traces so it s going to be a game of cat and mouse ben nimmo is a senior fellow at the atlantic council s digital forensic research lab he works to identify and analyze online disinformation the way these accounts work has always been a combination of infiltration and radicalization he walked us through some of the imagery and strategies used by notorious online trolls from russia and perhaps elsewhere first they pick a hot button issue there are certain very high profile problems that american society has which are well known abroad and it tended to be those ones which are targeted so the original troll factory accounts were very heavily engaged in the debate on gun control and the second amendment on women s rights and abortion rights they were heavily engaged on black lives matter a slew of inauthentic accounts that facebook recently deleted took the same approach updated to fit the latest top news they use identity politics and emotion to appeal to followers next step tap into a community so you start off by making positive comments about the target group let s say you want to masquerade as a black lives matter supporter you start by making lots of positive comments about the african american community you talk about how beautiful the girls are you talk about their glorious cultural history and you try and engage with real activists who are busy on this subject now it s time to ramp it up once you ve established your credentials you start slipping more and more toxic content into the mix so rather than saying positive things about your community you start saying negative things about other communities the war against colonialism is a theme that comes up on this page time and again it s a hint at violence and last they try to move from the online world into real life and then maybe you slip into the mix a suggestion let s have a protest let s get real people out on the streets and then because you re operating probably from some time zones away you need to think well how do we get this to happen and you start trying to reach out to genuine local organizations maybe you say well we can t turn up on that day because we ve got something else going on why don t you organize this for us in 2016 russian trolls organized political events for and against both presidential candidates at an islamic center in houston they organized a protest and the corresponding counterprotest down with the racists down with the nazis so why go to such lengths these bad actors are trying to polarize the american public by exploiting existing tensions in our society the goal make americans see each other as enemies especially during high stakes events such as elections if people feel they can t trust their neighbors or their government democracy falters there is a massive sophisticated persistent campaign on multiple fronts to misinform divide and ultimately manipulate the american people is that accurate yes but officials said there has been no concrete intelligence pointing to mr putin ordering his own intelligence units to wade into the election to push for a certain outcome beyond a broad chaos campaign to undermine faith in american democracy intelligence agencies do not believe mr putin has changed his strategy instead officials believe they simply do not have the same level of access to information from the kremlin s inner circle intelligence collection appears to have suffered after russia expelled officials from american diplomatic outposts there in retaliation for the united states removing 60 russian officials this year said john sipher a 28 year veteran of the c i a who served in moscow in the 1990s and later ran the agency s russia program the c i a s moscow presence according to former officers was always small at least in light of the importance of the target the difficulty of spycraft and the amount of counterintelligence the russians dedicated to thwarting american spies the russians kicked out a whole bunch of our people mr sipher said our station in moscow is probably really small now and they are under incredible surveillance former c i a officials said mr putin has made plain to his counterintelligence forces his antipathy and desire to eliminate to so called traitors who provide information to the west in public comments in 2010 mr putin made menacing comments about former agents who worked for western intelligence although he publicly disavowed assassination the russians are very focused and upset mr sipher said they have shown they are willing to kill sources informants close to putin are very rare according to current and former officials the united states in recent years has had only a few and at times been reliant on only one or two for the most important insights on mr putin according to former officials if those people go silent for their own protection it can make it very hard for the agency to look inside moscow the united states still should have a clear view of mr putin s strategies and intention to interfere in the elections said michael carpenter a russia expert and former obama administration official he pointed to fake social media accounts created as part of russian intelligence operations that have drummed up support for white nationalists and the black lives matter movement and have supported far right far left and pro russian candidates in the united states and in europe clearly russia is playing both sides of controversial issues precisely to sow chaos but that said it is not just chaos there are certain candidates russia prefers to see in office said mr carpenter now at the penn biden center for diplomacy and global engagement the russians are trying to support anti establishment and pro russian candidates not just in the u s but everywhere still there is little doubt about the crucial nature of informants said seth g jones who leads the transnational threats project at the center for strategic and international studies a policy research organization it is essential to have sources coming from inside the government it was during the cold war and it is today mr jones said there are multiple ways to collect intelligence against your adversary in this case the russian government but sources can provide you things you might not otherwise get like documents intelligence assessments sources can provide photographs of russian documents and intelligence that are hard to intercept electronically and that can help the united states figure out what russia is targeting not just with its election meddling but with its attempts to infiltrate financial systems the power grid and other critical infrastructure mr jones said the full reasons the sources have gone silent are not known but current and former officials also said the exposure of sources inside the united states has also complicated matters this year the identity of an f b i informant stefan halper became public after house lawmakers sought information on him and the white house allowed the information to be shared mr halper an american academic based in britain had been sent to talk to trump campaign advisers who were under f b i scrutiny for their ties to russia current american officials said there is no direct evidence that the exposure of mr halper has been cited by overseas informants as a source of concern but the officials said that some allies have cited the exposure of the informant and other intelligence leaks in curbing some of the intelligence they share and former spies believe that long term the exposure will hurt overseas collection publicizing sources is really bad for the business mr sipher said the only thing we can offer people is that we will do anything in our power to protect them and anything that wears away at that trust hurts advertisement
