renewal of mass anti government protests and sanctions and other u s efforts to force him to leave office guaid slipped out of venezuela at a time when he had few options left and was struggling to

hasten maduro s departure from office but he has remained democratic senator chris murphy of connecticut criticized mr trump s approach saying on twitter that mr trump s view that maduro would back down after the u s recognized guaid as the country s leader was an idea not a strategy and it had no hope of working russia has a political military and economic alliance with venezuela that was forged under maduro s predecessor hugo chavez venezuela is struggling to pay back billions of dollars in loans from russia about half owed to russia s state owned oil company rosneft o brien said the
