for a medical incident after being removed from the ice wing all three are expected to be fine according to the sheriff s office sheriff hodgson an ardent supporter of mr trump and controversial figure in massachusetts politics said the disturbance was sparked after detainees refused to allow a medical team to conduct coronavirus tests our medical team alerted me and i advised the detainees that for their health and the health of their fellow detainees and our staff they needed to be tested at the medical unit the detainees refused to comply became combatant and ultimately put the lives of themselves and many bristol county officers at risk with their reckless actions hodgson said in a statement the sheriff s office which confirmed to cbs news that pepper spray was used on friday said the disturbance caused 25 000 worth of damage detainees have been moved to single cells in the special housing unit pending disciplinary action covid 19 testing and criminal charges the office
