politics is not only about competing views on issues it is also and often most importantly about which problems come to the forefront in the public conversation and in the minds of citizens and voters the battle over what matters most could determine the outcome of the 2016 election one set of concerns related to race immigration and attitudes toward islam divides the country deeply another group of issues involving economic inequities and the difficulties many americans are having getting ahead has broad reach across party lines republicans want the first agenda to be paramount this reflects both the attitudes of their supporters and a rational if debatable assessment of how they might win it also explains the eagerness of republican politicians to make blocking syrian refugees from our shores the centerpiece of their initial response to the terrorist attacks in paris casting democrats as insufficiently mindful of the nation s security and charging them with being too responsive to the rights of religious and racial minorities are among the oldest calls in the gop political playbook democrats by contrast have every interest in an election organized around core economic concerns economic growth has not been fairly shared and middle class and less affluent families alike need relief on matters ranging from wages to college access to work family balance it is no accident that hillary clinton and bernie sanders have largely structured their campaigns around these themes the importance of who gets to set the agenda was brought home by a poll released tuesday by the public religion research institute prri the survey for which i played an advisory role was conducted in cooperation with the brookings institution before the attacks in paris on the one hand certain issues divided the country starkly across party lines by a 66percent to 26 percent margin republicans said that immigrants burdened the country more than they strengthened it among supporters of donald trump 80percent said they were a burden democrats on the other hand said immigrants strengthened the country by a nearly opposite margin 63percent to 32percent among republicans 76percent said the values of islam were at odds with american values and way of life 43percent of democrats said this especially sharp divisions emerged on controversies involving race and police practices 64percent of republicans but only 28percent of democrats agreed with the statement that discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities among republicans 82percent said the recent killings of african americans by police were isolated incidents rather than part of a broader pattern only 32percent of democrats said they were isolated incidents these figures underscore two facts republicans are largely united in their views on these questions and they are potentially disruptive subjects that could give the gop a chance to pull a minority of democrats away from their usual party loyalties the classic definition of wedge issues on economic questions by contrast rank and file republicans take many positions that are usually associated with democrats these are the bridge issues requiring companies to provide sick leave to their employees draws support from 96percent of democrats and 69percent of republicans requiring leave time for new parents is even more unifying 89percent of democrats endorse it as do 75percent of republicans and on a series of questions many republicans identified with criticisms of the economic system that have been a hallmark of sanders s campaign offered the statement business corporations do not share enough of their success with their employees 92percent of democrats agreed or mostly agreed and so did 76percent of republicans democrats agreed more strongly but the fact that so many republicans could identify with this view and with similar criticisms of the exporting of good jobs the power of big money in elections and the advantages enjoyed by the wealthy speaks to the potential political power of calls for greater economic justice perhaps it goes too far to say that there is a social democratic america waiting to be born still democratic politicians have every interest in making a desire for a more equitable economy the driving force in the election there are equally good reasons for republican politicians to encourage voters to think about their fears of terrorism their worries about immigrants and their feelings toward islam for the moment dreadful
