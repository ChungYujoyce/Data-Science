back in march some of the financial sector s leading analysts bumped the chances of a global economic recession from 20 percent to 30 percent the chances are still minuscule but the danger always looms and given the tragic consequences of the great recession any new indicators leading to another potential recession ought to be met with at the very least a tone of seriousness today with the brexit referendum passing in favor of leaving the european union and the subsequent decline in the british pound and specifically worsening indicators leading toward a british recession there s renewed fears of the brexit shockfront crushing neighboring economies as well in the united states meanwhile the republican position on brexit seems to be based upon everything except the economic repercussions instead the gop s posture appears to be simply blurting the opposite of whatever president obama and the democrats have to say about it indeed the standard for any gop argument since 2008 has been simply put opposite day if obama s for it they re against it even if obama s position was once a gop position the individual mandate nsa metadata collection predator drones immigration reform cap and trade and the list goes on while the gop never really supported brexit they should have especially knowing that the e u was one of the u s s signature achievements after world war ii further assuring there aren t continued world wars as the atomic age began beyond that the possibility of a brexit induced recession should ve frightened them away however we re assuming the gop is driven by rational policy choices in 2016 it s not donald trump for his part isn t interested in the justifications for or the post war history of europe he s only really interested in taking a position because as with his party it s the opposite of obama s and hillary s had he been less driven to blurt a reaction to a potentially cataclysmic event an event that he was totally unfamiliar with just a month ago and if he had thought through a strategy that was a slightly more detailed than the 140 character limit on twitter he would ve picked up on a golden opportunity to link hillary and the obama administration to a forthcoming recession regardless of whether it was precipitated by brexit this week while appearing on stage with elizabeth warren for the first time hillary clinton accurately observed that the wall street fallout from brexit cost americans around 100 billion all of which vanished when the markets reacted to the trump supported brexit vote and on friday when britain voted to leave the european union he crowed from his golf course about how the disruption could end up creating higher profits for that golf course even though within 24 hours americans lost 100 billion from our 401 k s he tried to turn a global economic challenge into an infomercial average americans weren t the only people impacted by trump s beloved brexit vote around 400 of his fellow billionaires if you believe what he says about his net worth worldwide lost 196 2 billion due to the leave vote this is what trump supports weird at the very least experts at goldman sachs are foreseeing a decline in the u s economy from around 2 25 percent growth to two percent straight up britain itself appears to be poised for a recession late this year or in early 2017 nevertheless trump missed a fantastic opportunity to sidestep the brexit vote and therefore to fully blame a would be recession on hillary clinton and her allies in the obama administration instead if brexit continues to disrupt the world economy he ll absolutely remain on record as having supported the spark that touched off the decline simultaneously and moving forward hillary can easily marry trump to brexit and brand the downturn as the trump recession conversely had trump kept his self defeating mouth shut and perhaps continued to mock disabled people you know because he has the best words he could ve solely linked hillary and obama to the recession without even mentioning brexit as an inciting incident but once again trump stepped into the pitch and for no real political gain took a fastball to the side of his clown wigged noggin sure trump is politically astute enough to realize that playing opposite day politics plays well with his brainwashed cult like base they re with him no matter what so in the near term it shouldn t matter after all another feature of modern gop strategy is political expedience over long term gains trump s got a lock on around 30 percent of american voters but he s clearly underestimating the number of republicans like george will glenn beck or sen mark kirk r ill who are easily capable of sidestepping a vote for trump and supporting someone anyone else not to mention the scores of moderate undecided voters the question moving forward is whether trump is capable of making any winnable political choices given how he s vowed to have so much winning you may get tired of winning instead of positioning himself to immediately link hillary to a sputtering economy he s linked himself to it he s in effect dropped the ball on two issue areas that are normally owned by the gop the economy and national security according to the new abc news washington post poll obama s approval on the economy is hovering around 55 percent while hillary has been seen more favorably than trump on her reaction to orlando if trump can t win on these issues he might as well give up and i m not sure he hasn t bob cesca is a regular contributor to salon he s
