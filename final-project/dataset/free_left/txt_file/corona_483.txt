the military can certainly help but it won t solve everything with civilian hospitals increasingly overwhelmed and the coronavirus outbreak in america deepening a question is coming up of whether there s a bigger role the us military to play in responding president donald trump isn t so sure yet we re starting the process and it s a process we hope it s not going to be necessary but it could be necessary he said during the white house briefing on tuesday morning hours later defense secretary mark esper said the pentagon would at least offer some support he told reporters that his department would be willing to offer up to 2 000 ventilators and 5 million respirators if asked as well as offer labs to test civilians for the disease but esper made sure to say he believes calling up military to help in the coronavirus response should be a last resort that s not all the us military will also be sending the us army corps of engineers to new york state to assess how to build more medical centers and it will deploy the usns comfort a large medical ship with room for 1 000 patients off the coast of new york experts tell me the pentagon s actions are a good start but that defense officials could still do much much more for over a century america s armed forces have dealt with medical crises across the globe many service members today have the expertise to assist with medical care build mash hospitals provide shelter or transport food medical equipment and people to meet the needs of the public that s already happening in georgia and florida and new york for example where those states national guards were called to help combat covid 19 the disease caused by the coronavirus the department of defense provides the ability to scale up like no other part of the us government can andrew weber the pentagon s top biological defense official from 2011 to 2014 told me whatever is needed to mount an appropriate response the military can do it at scale it s important to note that america s troops wouldn t be leading efforts to combat covid 19 they d be supporting civilian leaders from the federal emergency management agency fema or the department of health and human services hhs with extra people expertise and technology that s likely why during the democratic presidential debate on sunday night former vice president joe biden called for the military to be deployed across america it s a national emergency and i would call out the military he said we re at war with the virus but the military s involvement isn t a panacea and it has strict limitations on what it can do laws prohibit most troops from performing law enforcement functions for example and its actions are curtailed to helping states with things like emergency medical treatment and evacuations what s more the military only has a few small hospitals in the united states that are set up to treat military medical problems like bodily trauma top pentagon officials told reporters on monday those facilities aren t particularly ready to deal with the coronavirus outbreak or provide what civilian hospitals might need in other words the military can help but it can t solve the government s response problems it also doesn t help that the army alone for instance is short 1 billion to respond to the outbreak we re trying to be very careful about not overpromising air force brig gen paul friedrichs the joint staff surgeon told reporters on monday however experts and some at the pentagon believe the military can come up with the money to help if it wanted to as of now there s no real indication trump wants to deploy the military most jarring is that he doesn t have a senior pentagon official on his coronavirus task force it s possible the military doesn t want to be involved more on that later it s therefore not as easy a call for trump to make as some might think but the dozen current and former defense officials and medical experts i spoke with say he should still use his authority to put the military to work now there s just so much capacity in the defense department that s completely untapped at the moment and that s a mistake kelly magsamen a former top pentagon official in the obama administration told me before going into what the military could do to help with the coronavirus it s first important to know what it s allowed to do at the president s request the us military is barred from using its capabilities directly to enforce us domestic laws unless congress specifically authorizes it to do so this stipulation known as posse comitatus is why us troops can only support civilian agencies like fema but not take direct action themselves per fema s own website the military is prohibited from interdicting vehicles conducting searches and seizures making arrests or apprehensions surveillance investigation or undercover work there s no indication that long standing statute is going to change anytime soon however this rule doesn t apply to the national guard and the coast guard which means both services could perform law enforcement functions if asked by a state s governor that means they could conceivably block roads or keep people from visiting family and friends though that would be a severe response and it s unclear any governor wants to authorize that yet the president or at least his lawyers knows all this on friday trump issued two declarations to deal with the outbreak one reliant on the stafford act and one based on the national emergencies act as my colleague ian millhiser wrote title iv of the stafford act permits the president to declare that a particular crisis is a major disaster and such a declaration does provide the president with new powers that he may use to combat such a disaster additionally the statute says all requests for a declaration by the president that a major disaster exists shall be made by the governor of the affected state so as millhiser notes trump cannot simply issue a declaration and seize broad new powers there s still plenty the us government can do under this act including coordinating relief efforts helping state governments and handing out food and medicine as needed if the military can be helpful in any of those endeavors hhs another agency or a state s governor can ask the pentagon for assistance with them as for the national emergencies act it gives the president more sweeping authorities elizabeth goiten the co director of the liberty and national security program at the brennan center wrote for the atlantic on monday for trump to use those authorities though he must specify which powers he intends to invoke and he must issue updates if he adds new powers to the list she explained it s therefore possible that under this statute trump could order the military to do more than a state s governor wants but he d have to notify everyone of those intentions what s most likely to happen though is that the military will abide by its long standing process and doctrine of defense support for civilian authorities or dsca for emergencies in the homeland like the coronavirus outbreak the military sees its role as providing support to prepare prevent protect respond and recover from domestic incidents such support is provided in response to requests from civil authorities and upon approval from appropriate authorities us troops then won t start deploying to parts of the country without hhs or other government agencies asking them to and even then the military will act strictly in support of what that agency wants in essence trump couldn t use the military as his own personal coronavirus response force and law enforcement agency it ll be subordinate to the government agencies that request its assistance how a national guard unit acts though is highly dependent on a state s governor hhs has already asked the pentagon for help with quarantining americans coming back from wuhan china where the outbreak started as well as infected passengers aboard the diamond princess cruise liner military officials are also at the 11 feeder airports that passengers from abroad must go through for medical screenings before entering the us but so far that s it we ve not received any other requests at this time jonathan hoffman a top pentagon spokesperson told reporters on monday yet experts tell me that if states and agencies would just request it the pentagon could be even more helpful there are four main ways the us military could assist in the country s pandemic response 1 provide care 2 assist with logistics 3 develop a vaccine or other treatment and 4 control crowds and provide other calming effects even as americans aim to flatten the curve to keep coronavirus cases in the country low hospitals find that they re struggling to keep up with the number of patients that need medical care a dearth of hospital beds ventilators and rested physicians means a spike in people requiring hospitalization could greatly overwhelm the civilian health system should those resources run low the defense department could use authorities under the defense production act to rapidly acquire a range of equipment such as n 95 respirators gloves for medical personnel and ventilators james miller the top pentagon policy official from 2012 to 2014 told me the military also has thousands of physicians who could help treat patients dr angela rasmussen an infectious disease expert at columbia university told me the military could create new hospitals if needed as new york gov andrew cuomo called on the army corps of engineers to do or repurpose current ones for example by converting parts of hospitals into intensive care units but it should be noted that the military isn t completely stocked up to help on all of this as mentioned before the pentagon has fewer than 40 military hospitals each of them small and geared toward healing troops in specific communities our fixed facilities are designed to the force that we have there not 1 000 bed medical centers all over the united states friedrichs the joint staff surgeon told reporters on monday by contrast there are around 6 000 civilian hospitals in the country up and running today and while the military also has 424 medical clinics including the usns comfort they re not built to quarantine patients that have the disease still if there are many patients who require care at one time the military would surely look to house them on their military bases as a kind of overflow facility the department of veterans affairs va could also lend its doctors and facilities for the response if the va secretary authorizes their use the va system was explicitly designed with the idea of not only treating veterans but providing redundancy for the civilian system said sasha baker a top aide to former defense secretary ash carter and the va says it s ready to help if called upon va stands ready to surge capabilities into civilian health care systems in the event those systems encounter capacity issues but at this time they are not encountering such issues christina mandreucci the va s press secretary told me requests for such support would flow through the hhs which is leading the federal government s covid 19 response efforts but should the national disaster medical system ndms a government program consisting of about 5 000 medical professionals be called into action by a state or the federal government the va would play a huge role in making it work the va is the backbone for the ndms said anthony principi the va secretary from 2001 to 2005 when i asked a current marine officer how the military could best help if called upon the officer s response was short and to the point we are good at logistics we ve got trucks warehouses and people the officer continued plus a few cargo planes and helicopters in other words the military is full of highly trained professionals with top of the line equipment that could be incredibly useful for transporting civilian officials and materials around the country that last part is key as doctors may need additional medical tools quickly to treat patients or those in affected areas might require food and water to survive indeed if so many people are sick that even grocery stores close down they ll need all the sustenance they can get only the military really has the trucks helicopters and planes necessary to deliver everything in an efficient manner they d also prove useful should someone require a medical evacuation armed forces could coordinate all this in command and control centers barry mccaffrey a retired army general told me that would help streamline all these efforts so the response isn t so haphazard experts also noted that the armed forces have communications equipment allowing better coordination among several parts of the government for example if there needs to be a teleconference meeting the military has the technology to set up such a meeting for personnel stationed in remote places and troops can offer generators to provide electricity around the clock if needed generators are especially useful for field hospitals or if electrical workers in a particularly badly affected area have to stay home but here again there s still a problem the military is failing to come up with money for its own coronavirus response part of that comes from trump administration efforts to cut the amount of military medical personnel the us can have by 18 000 or 20 percent of the force the army leads the us military s medical research primarily at fort detrick in maryland gen james mcconville the army s chief told breaking defense earlier this month that there are already researchers working on finding a vaccine for the novel coronavirus they ve been dealing with ebola they ve been dealing with zika they ve been dealing with mers and now they re dealing with coronavirus mcconville said weber now at the council on strategic risks told me that the only viable vaccine candidates and experimental drugs created during the 2014 ebola crisis came from the pentagon in partnership with the canadian ministry of defense once it looked like that vaccine could work the national institutes of health took it the last 10 yards said weber but that s not all columbia s rasmussen told me that other pentagon agencies such as the defense threats reduction agency and the defense advanced research projects agency darpa are working on tools that could potentially help fight the virus in darpa s case it has a program called the pandemic prevention platform that will temporarily protect someone from contracting the virus before a vaccine is ready amy jenkins the program s director told npr in february basically it s a treatment that protects someone from the virus for about six months it serves as a temporary fix while waiting for a vaccine that can take several weeks to kick in and it consists of antibodies from people who ve had covid 19 and recovered this technology could be used in this current coronavirus she said but this is still a very early technology at the time of the interview jenkins noted that the technology might be available within 90 days the military s manpower could be helpful in managing large crowds experts say they could direct traffic at drive through testing centers for example or control the flow of entries at medical facilities this would mostly be a job for the national guard the marine officer told me as people tend to freak out if they see other services trying to keep people calm within the us and as mentioned above there are legal reasons why the national guard would have to be the service doing the crowd control work and not the federal military so far there are about 670 national guard members activated in 15 states the public s trust in the military might help calm nerves that the us government has the situation under control it would give the american public confidence weber told me experts told me it s therefore surprising that esper and army gen mark milley the joint chiefs chair haven t been more visible so far in reassuring the nation that all will be well while everyone i spoke with said the military had some role to play many noted that deploying the armed forces also comes with very real risks one air force officer i talked to worried about exposing troops to sick people which could increase the number of cases in the ranks having a large number of mostly young service members around crowds could also cause the virus to spread since younger people may be infected without showing any symptoms that hurts our ability to respond without endangering the very people we intend to protect the officer said plus the military is already reluctant to help with pandemic response during the 2014 ebola crisis former defense officials told me top military officials didn t want 4 000 us troops going to west africa to help the feeling among some us uniformed leaders was that america s service members should be focused on fighting wars not curing diseases under immense white house pressure though the military did deploy and by most accounts proved instrumental in quelling the crisis today s military brass seems to hold similar views as the defense department is still mainly focused on the health of the force from march 16 to may 11 for example troops aren t allowed to travel domestically it s unclear that pentagon leadership has turned its attention to a national response yet experts tell me the air force officer has one theory as to why that may be surging military physicians to treat civilians means there s a risk of no treatment for your defense force in an era where soldiers are still getting rocket attacked downrange and north korea is firing missiles into the east sea the officer said there s still an argument for readiness meaning the military s ability to respond to any contingency and our physicians and medical professionals help us maintain that posture other experts also noted that the trump administration wants the armed forces focused on great power competition preparing for fighting major wars in the future with the likes of china and russia if troops start spending months on the coronavirus crisis they might be less prepared to engage in those conflicts despite those concerns though most i spoke with believe trump will turn to the military sooner rather than later though they wish he d done so earlier he downplayed the virus and appeared not to understand what was happening let alone what was coming miller told me the price will be paid in american lives
