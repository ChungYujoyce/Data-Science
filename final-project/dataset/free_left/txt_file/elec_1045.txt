efforts to spurn donald trump in the electoral college may have unsavoury consequences by s m new york the last ditch effort by some democrats to thwart a donald trump presidency ended in a fizzle on december 19th the 538 members of the electoral college the body that officially elects america s chief executive as ordained by article ii of the constitution handed the real estate magnate 304 votes two shy of the total he was projected to win after the people voted on november 8th but a comfortable 34 votes more than the 270 he needed to win a majority mr trump is set to be inaugurated as america s 45th president on january 20th the ill fated hail mary was lobbed by a number of liberal intellectuals including lawrence lessig a harvard law professor and short lived 2016 presidential candidate in an opinion piece for the washington post last month mr lessig observed that hillary clinton handily won the national popular vote since electoral college electors are citizens exercising judgment not cogs turning a wheel they should feel free to ignore the popular vote totals in their home states electors should then stand up for the principle of one person one vote mr lessig suggested and switch their allegiance to hillary clinton other advocates called on trump electors to use their independent judgment to vote for another more savoury republican if 38 electors would opt for the likes of john kasich or mitt romney mr trump would fall short of 270 and the house of representatives would get to pick the president from among the top three vote getters the house would then be free to send a republican other than mr trump to the white house the pitch was always a long shot but mr lessig claimed days before the vote that there were as many as 30 and at least 20 electors who were willing to abandon mr trump and vote for somebody else though he added that if it looked as if the total would fall short of 37 only a few would actually vote that way sure enough in the end only two republican electors turned coat one toward mr kasich and one for ron paul as it happens four times as many democrats moved to cast a vote against hillary clinton but three of the eight were replaced before they could violate their pledges of the five successfully disloyal democrats three voted for colin powell george w bush s republican secretary of state one picked bernie sanders and one opted for faith spotted eagle a native american who has taken a leading role in the fight against the dakota access pipeline the vote seemed to throw cold water on a strategy that had drawn public attention to hitherto obscure passages in america s founding documents the staple excerpts trumpted by the hamilton electors as they called themselves came from federalist 68 an essay in which alexander hamilton pitches the electoral college as an institution promising a moral certainty that the office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications if the electors refused to exercise independent judgment to keep a fact averse political novice with intractable conflicts of interests and fascistic tendencies out of the white house when would they no realistic observer expected 37 republican loyalists more than 10 of the total to send mr trump packing in many cases violating state laws and exposing themselves to financial penalties but it is remarkable that 7 of the 538 electors felt free to switch their votes by far the most in recent memory this election was the first since 1872 with more than one faithless elector in that election horace greeley a democrat died after losing to ulysses s grant all but three of his 66 electors parcelled their votes out to other candidates the failure of the rebellion will not be more than a footnote to the 2016 presidential election yet it may leave an enduring legacy the campaign waged by mr lessig and others encouraged electors to think for themselves rather than feel bound to represent the winning candidate in their states thousands of e mails and hundreds of letters to electors urged them to pick someone anyone other than mr trump you are not cogs mr lessig beseeched electors the duty to uphold the elector pledge he said is not your only moral obligation you also have an obligation to the constitution and to your fellow citizens and to your god and to yourself it is fine to be a rubber stamp in typical election years mr lessig wrote in 56 presidential elections we haven t needed electors to exercise judgment but he implored we do now here we find a mantra among instigators of the failed electoral coup this election is different mr trump represents a unique threat to the american republic the electoral college should thumb its nose at democratic laws and norms as an emergency measure to save the union this time only when a trumpian figure is not on the ballot there will be no need for the electors to take such radical measures to prevent america from sliding into the abyss this point contains a deep fallacy once the electoral college is untethered from its traditional role as rubber stamp of the state results there is no way to pin back its power mr lessig and his political allies may not view elections to come as appropriate times for electors to rebel and they may have excellent reasons for electors to stay even tempered and dutiful in those contests but other voices may drown out the law professors carefully reasoned appeals and once the principle is established that electors are self justifying sources of their own political scruples the question of when to revolt no longer lies in commentators hands whether to ratify or to rebel becomes the province of the individual elector and while it will remain highly unlikely for various reasons that dozens of electors will flip their votes in any particular election the 2016 experience shows that a half dozen or so is a live possibility and a concerted effort could easily attract more that tantalising fact makes it much more likely that future close elections will be an exercise in elector courting with a budding electoral vote split of 273 265 for example just four electors would need to be persuaded to abandon the winning candidate to throw the election to the loser or at least to the whims of the house of representatives imagine a scenario in which donald trump is about to lose to say elizabeth warren by such a gap in 2020 would he quietly back down accepting his fate as a one term president or would he send his negotiators on a tour of america focusing on states that do not punish electors for straying and find three malleable souls willing to reconsider and give him another chance the corruption of the electoral college need not be that tawdry or thorough to inspire worries about the future legitimacy of america s presidential contests if electors feel empowered to indulge their own political preferences and enabled to make a personal mark on history the result may be a handful of unelected people overturning a verdict delivered by 135m or more voters that is precisely the precedent that the failed 2016 electoral coup has unwittingly set this post has been changed to take account of the context in which lawrence lessig identified the total of 20 30 electors willing to vote for donald
