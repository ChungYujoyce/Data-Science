unsure of or had never heard of harris in the book she casts herself as a perfect fit for this political moment she has a compelling biography that often draws comparisons to barack obama mixed with a

chamber republicans welcomed harris to the race on monday by calling her unqualified and out of touch kamala harris is arguably the least vetted democrat running for president the republican national committee spokesman michael ahrens said in a statement adding all she has to show for her brief time in the senate is a radically liberal voting record since arriving in the senate in 2016 harris has built a reputation for bringing a prosecutorial style of questioning to hearings with trump nominees in a combative exchange with the former attorney general jeff sessions he said her rushed questions were making him nervous while the skills she honed in the courtroom have served her well in the senate and helped to elevate her to the forefront of the anti trump resistance movement progressives have lingering and serious questions about her career as california s top cop a recent op ed published in the new york times by the university of san francisco law professor lara bazelon accuses the senator of having been often on the wrong side of history when she served as the state s attorney general she pointed to her support of an initiative that threatened the parents of habitually truant elementary school children with jail time she also defended a prosecutor who falsified testimony only relenting after the case attracted national attention harris has highlighted other aspects of her record she touts back on track a program instituted while she was the da in san francisco which allowed first time non violent drug offenders a chance to have their charges dismissed if they completed vocational training and in her book she recounts a shouting match she had over the phone with the jpmorgan chase boss jamie dimon during the foreclosure crisis i took off my earrings the oakland in me and picked up the receiver it s an anecdote certain to draw wild applause from anti wall street liberals on the stump during the 2018 midterm elections harris campaigned on behalf of several women and minority candidates she is aligned with many of her colleagues and the other contenders on policy including her support for medicare for all style healthcare and like several of the early entrants harris has vowed not to accept donations from corporate political action committees a pledge that is gaining traction among democratic voters with relatively minor policy differences among the potential democratic contenders the party s months long primary is likely to revolve around questions of identity electoral strategy and style as as much as ideology voters will choose who they believe is best suited to take on trump and who can appeal to the party s many constituencies which include white rural voters young people college educated women and people of color
