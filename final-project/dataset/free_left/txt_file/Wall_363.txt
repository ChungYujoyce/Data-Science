advertisement supported by he is forcing workers to choose between a paycheck and their health by richard trumka mr trumka is the president of the a f l c i o the united states now has more than a million reported coronavirus cases by far the most of any country in the world the health of our nation physically and economically depends on the safety of our workers that has always been true but perhaps never more so than in the face of today s crisis and it s why we need clear and decisive action from the white house president trump has given us more confusion than solutions failing to use his executive authority to protect working people in times of crisis the defense production act is an important tool for mobilizing resources and producing emergency supplies president trump hemmed and hawed on using it he said he would use it only if we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario if this isn t a worst case scenario nothing is take critical ventilators not until after gm and ventec revealed that they had secured suppliers for 700 parts made a deal with the u a w to staff the kokomo ind plant and started setting up the plant did the president issue an order telling gm to do what it was already doing on april 28 president trump signed an executive order using the defense production act to keep meat processing plants open by doing so he overrode states and some of those plants themselves that know it s not safe yet we all want to keep the food supply chain intact but we have to balance that against the very real risks caused by impatience and imprudence the united food and commercial workers the largest packinghouse union in america knows of at least 20 meatpacking workers who have died from covid 19 five thousand more workers have tested positive for the coronavirus are awaiting test results have been hospitalized or have been exposed to the virus thousands more may be affected the president s decision to reopen these plants without proper safety protections on workers memorial day of all days was dangerous and disgraceful what s worse president trump said he would also shield meatpacking companies from legal liability as long as they follow guidelines from the centers for disease control and prevention and occupational safety and health administration for the facilities which have proved to be wholly inadequate once again this administration is favoring executives over working people and the stock market over human lives he is forcing workers to choose between a paycheck and their health this isn t a choice workers should have to make but president trump is essentially forcing their hand ignoring the warning signs and using the defense production act to keep open what should be closed until it is safe we need workplace safety standards based on safety and sound science and we need the president to use his authority to make and distribute personal protective equipment to essential workers there is no time to waste like health care workers front line workers in meatpacking plants are facing similar p p e shortages and many plants have become coronavirus hot spots no one knows whether it is safe to go to work because the administration has utterly failed to plan for the tens of millions of tests we need to prevent exposure when workers are left unprotected we get sick and cannot work we can transmit the virus to our families and communities if all workers are not protected from the virus our economy will collapse forcing meat processing plants to remain open might temporarily satisfy president trump but it doesn t help contain the spread of the virus it is a harmful and misguided use of what can be a valuable tool when properly applied the defense production act can replicate successes of the past before america joined world war ii the labor movement led the way in calling for defense production henry ford s assembly line workers produced a b 24 bomber every hour and california shipbuilders could make cargo vessels about every five days companies remained profitable and ensured workers on the front lines were properly equipped and compensated this contagion is fast moving and the crisis it has wrought is rapidly evolving we need to be faster in our response we do not have a vaccine for this virus yet but we have an answer to the lack of lifesaving equipment america s workers president trump needs to use the defense production act for the right reasons effectively and swiftly richard trumka richardtrumka is the president of the american federation of labor and congress of industrial organizations the times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor we d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles here are some tips and here s our email letters nytimes com follow the new york times opinion section on facebook twitter nytopinion and instagram advertisement
