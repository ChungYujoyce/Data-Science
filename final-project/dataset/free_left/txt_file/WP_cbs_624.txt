watch cbsn live july 3 2019 9 01 am ap minneapolis when president donald trump s administration announced a 12 billion aid package for farmers struggling under the financial strain of his trade dispute with china the payments were capped but many large farming operations had no trouble finding legal ways around them records provided to the associated press under the freedom of information act show the government paid nearly 2 8 million to a missouri soybean operation registered as three entities at the same address more than 900 000 went to five other farm businesses in indiana illinois tennessee and two in texas three other farming operations collected more than 800 000 and 16 others collected over 700 000 here s how the u s department of agriculture s market facilitation program works farmers didn t have to prove their losses on their 2019 crops and livestock just their production the program sets a 125 000 cap in each of three categories of commodities one for soybeans and other row crops one for pork and dairy and one for cherries and almonds but there are legal ways around those caps for example farmers can claim payments in more than one category individual farmers who produce both soybeans and hogs could collect up to 250 000 if their production of each was high enough older bigger farm subsidy programs also contain 125 000 caps with similar ways to get around them large scale farming operations do that by structuring themselves as partnerships in which each family member or legal entity who is actively engaged in farming gets their own cap many relatives are exempt from the actively engaged requirement including parents spouses siblings and children who can each qualify for their own 125 000 cap first cousins nieces and nephews were added to the list in the 2018 farm bill recipients defended the payouts saying they didn t cover their losses from the trade war and they were legally entitled to them department of agriculture rules let farms file claims for multiple family members or other partners who meet the department s definition of being actively engaged in farming but u s sen charles grassley an iowa republican who has long fought for subsidy limits and other critics said it s the latest example of how loopholes let large farms collect far more than the supposed caps grassley said in a statement to ap that some of the nation s largest farms are receiving huge subsidies through underhanded legal tricks they re getting richer off the backs of taxpayers while young and beginning farmers are priced out of the profession this needs to end the department of agriculture needs to re evaluate its rules for awarding federal funds and conduct more thorough oversight of where it s funneling taxpayer dollars usda officials said they believe its rules are being followed and that procedures are in place to audit recipients about 83 percent of the aid 7 billion under the market facilitation program has gone to soybean farmers because they ve suffered most under china s retaliatory tariffs the second most subsidized commodity under the program was cotton nearly 6 of the total at 480 million usda data provided to ap through may 31 show that nearly 578 000 market facilitation program applicants had received aid payments five states all top soybean producers accounted for nearly half the total payments illinois iowa minnesota nebraska and indiana the data also show that 91 of the payments or 7 7 billion went to counties that mr trump carried in the 2016 election not surprising since he fared much better in rural america than in urban areas usda data show the biggest beneficiary has been deline farms partnership and two similarly named partnerships registered at the same address in charleston missouri that collected nearly 2 8 million they re led by donald deline and his wife lisa deline their attorney robert serio said the partnerships qualified legally and probably could have qualified for more if not for the caps he said each partnership farms around 27 000 acres and is made up of eight or nine partners who all meet the actively engaged requirement usda spokesman dave warner said the department couldn t comment on the specifics of the delines operations but that such a large claim was likely audited to ensure eligibility at peterson farms in loretto kentucky eight members of the family partnership collected a total 863 560 for crops grown on over 15 000 acres including wheat and corn used at the nearby maker s mark bourbon distillery co owner bernard peterson said it didn t make up for all their losses at a time when it was already hard to be profitable the 1 65 per bushel aid payments for soybeans fell well short of losses he estimated at 2 to 2 50 per bushel it s a big number but there are a big number of people directly depending on the success of our operation in the community he said the numerous ways around the caps mean millions of subsidy dollars flow to city slickers who are stretching the limits of the law said scott faber senior vice president of government affairs at the environmental working group which has criticized federal farm subsidy programs as biased toward big producers and promoting environmentally damaging farming practices urban dwellers might play only a small role in an operation without ever setting foot on the farm because of the loose definitions for who qualifies he said matt keller a pork producer in kenyon minnesota said he appreciated the 143 820 he got it didn t cover all his losses but helped with cash flow he said he reached the 125 000 cap on his hogs and the remaining money was for his soybeans and corn keller said his wife and other family members are all involved in his operation which produces about 29 000 pigs per year he doesn t blame the trade wars for depressed hog prices but he said the tariffs on top of oversupply have made things even tougher said keller it was kind of a relief i guess that we had a little support from the president and the country first published on july 3 2019 9 01 am 2019 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published
