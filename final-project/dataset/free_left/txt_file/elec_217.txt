donald j trump and hillary clinton who have had the most success in the early nominating contests look to extend their delegate leads over their nearest rivals here are some of the things we will be watching know what you usually call a presidential candidate who wins a swath of states ranging from liberal vermont and massachusetts to conservative oklahoma and alabama including a centrist bellwether like virginia the nominee super tuesday offers mr trump an opportunity to send a resounding message about the depth and breadth of his support his string of recent victories in new hampshire south carolina and nevada suggests his anti establishment message has wide appeal and while he might not be able to overtake senator ted cruz in his home state texas were mr trump to sweep the remaining 10 states winning in nearly every region of the country on a single day there would be little doubt he is positioned to become the republican standard bearer mr trump has begun to render obsolete the defining divisions of region religion and ideology that have characterized recent republican presidential primaries if he can do so on a wider map winning evangelical conservatives in the rural south and secular moderates in the urban northeast he will demonstrate that he is leading a realignment and creating something new a trump coalition mrs clinton is poised to sweep the south but her margin of victory depends on how well she does among black voters mrs clinton won 87 percent of the black vote in south carolina a larger share than president obama won in the 2008 primary helping her win the state in a landslide 73 percent to 26 percent for senator bernie sanders if mrs clinton were to repeat that performance on tuesday she could post similar victories in states like georgia and alabama she could top 60 percent of the vote in other southern states with large black populations like virginia texas tennessee and arkansas the margin matters and for more than just appearances democrats allocate all delegates proportionally so mrs clinton will be rewarded if she maximizes her support among black voters mr trump is favored on tuesday in every state except texas but the battle between mr cruz and senator marco rubio for second place is an important one if one of the freshman senators were to emerge as a decisive runner up he could make the case that the other should exit the race to give the party a better chance at stopping mr trump but the results might not lend themselves to such a clean outcome mr cruz and mr rubio could trade second place finishes across the map and even if mr rubio were to capture second place in all 11 states mr cruz could still win texas outright and hold that victory up to argue that as the only other candidate to beat mr trump and win a state he has every justification to go forward but after emphasizing the importance of march 1 to his campaign and investing so much in winning support from evangelicals mr cruz would be in a rough spot if he were to finish behind mr rubio in such bible belt states as alabama oklahoma and tennessee there is also pressure on mr rubio to find a state he can win tuesday and minnesota may represent his best opportunity with 155 delegates the lone star state is the big enchilada or keeping with current texas trends the big breakfast taco of super tuesday but even more important it is a crucial test for mr cruz who would face intense pressure to withdraw from the race if he were to lose and the texas prize for mr trump is found as much in its symbolism as in its delegate distribution not only is the deep red state a citadel of the national republican party but it is also home to george w bush rick perry and mr cruz they may be the three most influential texas republicans of recent vintage and mr trump has viciously attacked each of them if he can do that and still win there there will be little doubt about whose republican party this is now in texas and beyond an interactive delegate calculator simulates how the g o p nomination race might unfold even a trump sweep would not necessarily allow him to amass a majority of all the delegates in play since party rules prevent states from apportioning their delegates on a winner take all basis but there is one number that could let mr trump run up the score 20 percent candidates must reach that percentage of the vote in alabama georgia tennessee texas and vermont to be allocated any delegates in those states the delegates they forfeit by not clearing the threshold will go to the candidates who do that poses a real danger for both mr cruz and mr rubio polls in all five of those states show at least one of them in danger of missing the delegate threshold if both mr cruz and mr rubio can breach the threshold in every state they will almost certainly prevent mr trump from earning a majority of delegates but if they fall short mr trump could extend his lead to more than 165 the number of delegates at stake in the winner take all contests of ohio and florida which hold primaries on march 15 mrs clinton s strength in the south particularly among black voters places a big burden on mr sanders who needs more than a few narrow feel good wins to make up for getting crushed in the nation s most populous region based on the makeup of the democratic electorate mr sanders needs to outperform mrs clinton among nonblack voters by a significant margin to counter her success in attracting black voters so far mr sanders hasn t been able to do that anywhere outside western new hampshire a liberal overwhelmingly white region that borders his home state vermont mr sanders has a few good options on tuesday massachusetts colorado and minnesota are three states with few black voters and large numbers of white liberals and colorado and minnesota hold caucuses which tend to attract disproportionally liberal electorates if he can t win these states in landslide fashion it will be hard to chart a plausible way for mr sanders to overcome his weakness in the south and earn a majority of delegates which states are voting and how many delegates are at stake advertisement
