advertisement supported by as officials warned people to brace for a surge in cases and deaths governors pleaded for a consistent strategy and more help from washington by rick rojas and vanessa swales as the surgeon general told the nation to brace for our pearl harbor moment of cascading coronavirus deaths this week several governors said on sunday that their states were in urgent need of federal help and complained that they had been left to compete for critical equipment in the absence of a consistent strategy and coordination from the trump administration some clearly walked a delicate path criticizing what they saw as an erratic inadequate federal response while also trying to avoid alienating the white house as states vie with one another for resources both from washington and on the market that can mean the difference between life and death i m grateful for the help that we ve gotten gov gretchen whitmer of michigan a democrat said in an appearance on fox news sunday but she also expressed her alarm over what she described as not having a national strategy where there is one policy for the country as opposed to a patchwork based on who the governor is the result she added is creating a more porous situation where covid 19 will go longer and more people will get sick gov jay inslee of washington also a democrat was more blunt in his depiction of a chaotic federal response this is ludicrous that we do not have a national effort in this mr inslee said in an interview on meet the press on nbc to say we re a backup i mean the surgeon general alluded to pearl harbor can you imagine if franklin delano roosevelt said i ll be right behind you connecticut good luck building those battleships president trump at a news conference on sunday tried to balance the grim short term prognosis with a more optimistic view of the fight against the pandemic he said he saw light at the end of the tunnel as his administration marshaled the full power of the american government and american enterprise and he dismissed criticism from some governors as mere politics instead mr trump said he had worked in close concert with governors as the federal government has sent out ventilators masks gloves and gowns across the country we have the best doctors the best military leaders and the best logistics professionals anywhere in the world and we re orchestrating a massive federal response unlike anything our country has ever seen or done mr trump said the back and forth came as federal officials have projected a particularly bad week ahead as many americans prepared to observe passover and easter without traditional services or family gatherings three major metropolitan areas new york detroit and new orleans have seen death rates rise rapidly and other states are anticipating a peak in cases later this month in new york where the death toll has climbed to over 4 000 people with more than 122 000 confirmed cases gov andrew m cuomo said on sunday that there were indications of slight plateauing but he noted that it was too soon to say whether the changes in the numbers were indicative of a trend in louisiana gov john bel edwards said his state could run out of ventilators as soon as thursday and mr cuomo described the logistical struggle in new york to get hospitals the equipment they need i can t say to a hospital i will send you all the supplies you need i will send you all the ventilators you need he said in a briefing on sunday we don t have them it s not an exercise it s not a drill it s just a statement of reality you re going to have to shift and deploy resources to different locations based on the need of that location the increasingly dire need for ventilators and protective equipment has touched off a race between states cities and hospitals to buy up the equipment in a conference call with the nation s governors last month mr trump told the states that the federal government would be backing them but that they should try to procure their medical supplies themselves we ve been outbid by another state after we had the order confirmed so yes that has been challenging for us gov asa hutchinson of arkansas a republican said on meet the press but we recognize that the federal government has said we re your backstop you ve got to get out there and compete and it literally is a global jungle that we re competing in now governors have aired their frustration as they called on the trump administration to do more like using the federal defense production act more aggressively to ramp up manufacturing of the necessary equipment or putting in effect a national stay at home order many governors have been tempered in their criticisms acknowledging the need for a solid working relationship with the president as the crisis continued to grow but in interviews on the sunday morning talk shows some ventured further as they pushed for the administration to take stronger action gov j b pritzker of illinois who is also a democrat accused the trump administration of not reacting quickly enough to the warnings of the seriousness of the virus released by intelligence agencies in january and february if they had started in february building ventilators getting ready for this pandemic mr pritzker said on cnn s state of the union we would not have the problems we are having today and frankly very many fewer people would die officials at virtually every level redoubled their efforts on sunday to prepare the nation for a surge in illnesses and deaths warning of an emergency that will most likely be among the most calamitous that americans have faced already more than 9 000 people have died because of the virus in the united states a number that some experts said understates the deaths so far federal officials said projections showed the toll could climb to at least 100 000 people the next week is going to be our pearl harbor moment dr jerome m adams the united states surgeon general said in an interview on meet the press it s going to be our 9 11 moment it s going to be the hardest moment for many americans in their entire lives and we really need to understand that if we want to flatten that curve and get through to the other side everyone needs to do their part his dire warnings were echoed by dr anthony s fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases this is going to be a bad week he said on the news show face the nation he added it is going to be shocking to some it certainly is really disturbing to see that but that s what s going to happen before it turns around while dr fauci said the mitigation strategies around the country appeared to be having an effect he pushed back against a suggestion that the outbreak is under control i m not saying we have it under control he said that would be a false statement we are struggling to get it under control as needs have shifted washington state has decided to return more than 400 ventilators to the strategic national stockpile and oregon announced that it would send 140 ventilators directly to new york the chinese government facilitated the donation of 1 000 more ventilators to new york simon johnson a professor at the mit sloan school of management who has started an alliance to develop policy proposals to combat the coronavirus said that countries like israel and italy were rapidly buying up china s extra production capacity and that the united states was at risk of losing out what s going to happen is if the states all go after the p p e individually it will not get deployed nationally in a way that makes sense professor johnson said referring to personal protective equipment it s every man or woman for themselves mr pritzker was among the most vocal in arguing that the federal government is falling short in its role of making sure states are getting what they need he has requested 4 000 ventilators from the federal government and noted that states do not have the same power as the federal government especially when it comes to use of the defense production act illinois has so far received about 450 ventilators there s no way that we can stockpile in anticipation of a pandemic that no one anticipated and yet the federal government is responsible for doing precisely that mr pritzker said who added that illinois s peak was expected toward the end of april as of sunday illinois had reported over 11 000 infections and 274 deaths and has begun setting up makeshift hospitals mr trump has bristled at criticism from governors saying that he has at different points directed vice president mike pence to stop calling ms whitmer and mr inslee i want them to be appreciative he said the president specifically called out mr pritzker at his news conference on sunday saying there s a governor i hear complaining all the time mr trump added he has not performed well the trump administration said that its handling of the pandemic was about saving lives rising above politics and acting forcefully in trying to curb the virus s spread every level of government needs to deliver solutions and that is what we are doing in partnership judd deere a white house spokesman said in a statement on sunday during these difficult times americans are receiving comfort hope and resources from their president as well as their local officials because this is an all of america effort ray mabus the democratic governor of mississippi from 1988 to 1992 said that it was a moral imperative for state officials to speak up about getting the supplies and support needed if you don t speak out if you are afraid of somehow incurring the wrath of this guy then i think you re failing in your duty to the people who elected you still emergencies have long created tensions between federal state and local officials politicians and analysts said there were added challenges now given the scope of the pandemic and the depths of the nation s political divides i d say there s always a dance between any governor and sitting administration in knowing that you have to draw between the lines and look for ways of working constructively with that administration regardless of your party said mark sanford the former south carolina governor and republican congressman who lost his seat in congress after mr trump endorsed his primary opponent that said he added this president s a bit of an outlier as it relates to a perceived slight or the perception of loyalty and who seems to think things in remarkably personal terms whether slight was meant or regardless of intent for now facing the prospect of a brutal few weeks many governors are arguing for a more aggressive national approach and doing what they can in their own states ms whitmer the michigan governor contended that a more stringent response now could help contain the pandemic even if it means sharper immediate economic pain the shorter we make it she said the better for our health and the better for our economy mike baker michael crowley ana swanson and katie thomas contributed reporting advertisement
