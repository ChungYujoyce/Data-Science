there s a split among democrats on metoo and more biden might have picked the losing side joe biden is betting on the past the former vice president who formally announced his candidacy on thursday but has been a frontrunner in the polls for months recently called himself an obama biden democrat evoking a repeat of 2008 his supporters have long held that he can connect with the white working class voters who switched from barack obama to donald trump in 2016 and when he responded earlier this month to allegations that he touched women inappropriately he cast himself as a man innocently following the mores of an earlier era social norms have begun to change they ve shifted he said the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset to some statements like that along with his lack of an actual apology signal a man out of touch with the metoo movement and america today but biden is betting that there s another bigger group out there a group that thinks metoo goes a little too far and maybe norms have changed a little too fast where he once strived to embrace positions taken by his more progressive rivals biden now seems to be playing to divisions in the democratic party over metoo and other social issues those divisions are real as of 2017 a significant percentage of democrats were closer to republicans on issues like racial discrimination lgbtq rights and sexism but in 2020 playing to those democrats may not be a winning strategy recent polling shows that democrats are becoming more supportive of metoo not less and a growing number of voters want to see more women and people of color running for office it s not a good time for an older white establishment man to be running especially one for whom metoo boundaries may be unclear said tresa undem a cofounder of the research firm perryundem which has conducted recent polling on elections and metoo put another way there may be a culture war going on within the democratic party but biden may not have chosen the winning side to some degree joe biden s political career has been about evolution he went from an opponent of school integration in the 1970s to a critic of systemic racism in 2019 as vox s matt yglesias pointed out in 1982 he voted for a constitutional amendment to let states overturn roe v wade but his spokesperson now casts him as a defender of the landmark abortion decision during the 2008 primary contest he sparked criticism when he called barack obama the first sort of mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy he later apologized and became obama s running mate biden also presided over the 1991 hearings at which anita hill testified that then supreme court nominee clarence thomas had sexually harassed her but he has tried to distance himself from the outcome of those hearings most recently saying i wish i could have done something to give hill the hearing she deserved it can seem like biden is forever playing catch up eventually arriving at positions more socially progressive politicians staked out long before him but in recent comments there s been another dynamic at work i m an obama biden democrat man and i m proud of it he told reporters earlier this month he argued that democrats don t need to be socialists to be progressive and seemed to voice skepticism about candidates to the left of him show me the really left left left winger who beat a republican in 2018 he said also in early april he tweeted a video statement in response to allegations that he had touched multiple women in ways that made them uncomfortable social norms are changing i understand that and i ve heard what these women are saying politics to me has always been about making connections but i will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future that s my responsibility and i will meet it pic twitter com ya2mf5odts it was structured like an apology but biden didn t actually apologize instead he described himself as an old school hugger in a new post metoo world i shake hands i hug people i grab men and women by the shoulders and say you can do this whether they are women men young old it s the way i ve always been he said biden said he would change becoming more mindful of people s personal space but he also promised not to change too much i ll always believe governing quite frankly life for that matter is about connecting with people he said the statement and his obama biden democrat comments felt pitched at voters who were nostalgic for an earlier time before trump yes but also before metoo and the rise of socialism a time when things felt to some people at least less complicated buzzfeed editor in chief ben smith recently called biden the stand in for a generation of americans disoriented by changing mores and it feels like as good an encapsulation as any of biden s recent non campaign campaign biden seems to be betting that there are people who will vote for him not in spite of the fact that he seems like a candidate from an earlier time but because of it he might be right in a 2018 paper vanderbilt university political scientist larry bartels analyzed how americans stacked up on a scale of cultural conservatism as measured by agreement with statements like discrimination against whites is as big a problem today as discrimination against blacks and other minorities and women who complain about harassment often cause more problems than they solve beliefs like this are more often associated with republicans but bartels found that many democrats agreed with them too in fact he wrote more than a quarter of democrats were closer to the average republican on cultural issues than to the average member of their own party it s possible to imagine biden s recent statements appealing to those democrats who subscribe to culturally conservative beliefs about harassment in particular but still want an alternative to the republican party and trump however it s not entirely clear that biden has those voters locked down culturally conservative democrats actually favored bernie sanders over biden slightly more than their more culturally liberal counterparts according to bartels moreover bartels s analysis is based on data collected in november 2017 after the metoo movement entered its most public phase but before the confirmation hearings of supreme court justice brett kavanaugh made the movement part of national politics in a new way things may have changed since then bartels told vox he would speculate that the continued metoo movement would cause democrats to move away from the idea that women who complain about harassment cause problems and that the allegations against biden might come to hurt him there is evidence that the kavanaugh hearings have changed democrats attitudes on gender issues the hearings made people think about power in america according to an analysis by perryundem who has it who doesn t and what effects those power disparities have in the firm s polling 78 percent of registered democrats said the hearings made them think about men having more power than women in government four in 10 democratic men said they felt less tolerant of sexism in their own lives as a result of the hearings democratic men and women were more likely in 2018 than in 2016 to say that women make better political leaders than men and in 2018 83 percent of democrats said the country would be better off with more women in office the poll did not ask about specific 2020 candidates but it may have implications for them although biden has the name recognition and leads in polls i think he faces an uphill battle tresa undem the perryundem co founder said there s also a question of who biden s candidacy is supposed to appeal to he s long been seen as someone who can win back the white working class americans who voted for trump in 2016 but the notion that trump won on the strength of white working class voters and that clinton lost by ignoring them has been called into question since 2016 in large part because many polls show most trump voters were affluent not working class the 2018 midterm elections meanwhile drove home the electoral power of women voters of color ninety two percent of black women voted for democrats nationwide compared with only 49 percent of white women black women in particular helped make the difference for clinton in the 2016 primary as well as more recent congressional races as vox s li zhou notes and women and voters of color in general have been increasing their share of democratic primary participation since 2008 biden s poll numbers among women of color are mixed he leads the field among black and native american women according to recent morning consult polling data provided to vox but comes in second behind bernie sanders among asian american women and women who identified their race as other and according to marcela howell president and ceo of in our own voice national black women s reproductive justice agenda biden has built some credibility with female voters of color with his time as vice president and his role as the architect of the violence against women act he walks into this race with at least the benefit of the doubt from women of color howell told vox howell does not see the allegations of inappropriate touching as an insurmountable problem for biden hugging is not sexual assault she said nor does she see biden s handling of the thomas confirmation hearings as a major issue for black female voters at least so far but howell cautioned the democratic field is still wide open and in a recent poll conducted by intersections of our lives a collaborative of reproductive justice groups including in our own voice 88 percent of female voters of color said they wanted to see more women candidates running for office and 85 percent said they wanted more candidates of color the poll did not ask about specific 2020 candidates the media seems to act as if this race is between all the white men howell said i think they re going to be in for a shock by the time you get to south carolina and super tuesday seventy eight percent of women of color in the intersections of our lives poll said that politicians fail to acknowledge the issues that matter most to them many of the women of color in the poll said their elected officials don t really understand them said choimorrow of the national asian pacific american women s forum which was also part of intersections of our lives the allegations against biden coupled with his comment that obama was articulate might make female voters of color feel he doesn t understand their concerns choimorrow said those are the kinds of things that get people to say my elected person doesn t really know me choimorrow said as a person of color having a white person say to you you re so articulate we know what that means and as a voter i m looking for someone who is authentic and really understands that our country is not what it was even 10 15 20 years ago choimorrow said joe biden has always changed with the times and perhaps his 2020 candidacy will see him evolve again but to do it successfully he may need to look forward not back get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
