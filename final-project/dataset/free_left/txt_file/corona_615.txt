in one of the oddest developments of the coronavirus crisis there s been a run on a pair of antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine andchloroquine which are used primarily in the u s to treat arthritis and to prevent organ damage from lupus the drugs are being sucked out of pharmacies at an alarming rate thanks to americans who have convinced themselvesthese drugs will savethem if the develop covid 19 and thereby leaving patients who actually need these medicationsin danger this is happening in the face of only thinevidence that these drugs work againstthe novel coronavirus andplenty of evidence that they don t work atone paris hospital that used the drug heavily onthe recommendation of didier raoult a climate change denyingfrench doctor with a shady reputation the results suggest these drugs are not effective at all chinese doctorsalso concluded they were useless these drugs are known to have some scary side effects includingsudden cardiac death in some patients they arealso notorious for psychological side effects such as paranoia and nightmares at least one person in the u s has died from swallowing aquariumcleaner that contains a similar chemical compound so why are so many people so eager to get their hands on drugs that are clearly dangerous and may do no good the most immediate reason is simple the people rushing the pharmacies are republicans and both donald trump and numerous fox news personalities have told them these drugs are a game changer that can save them from the coronavirus but there s a reasonthese false or unproven claims are resonating with the ordinary citizens of trumpistan the hope that there s ahard to get miracle cure that will save them speaks directly to the poisonous social darwinismthat guides modern conservatism it reflectsdeephostility to the very concept of a shared public good and a fierce attachment to aracialized ideology of individualismthat treats public goods such as health care as things to be hoarded by those with the privilege money and status to do so conservative ideology simply doesn t allow for the possibility that anything including pandemic management is best managed with a we re all in this together mentality insteadthey re drawn to this fantasy that there s a platinum member covid 19 status that can be purchased which willallowthem to opt out of the suffering of the plebeian class that has to quarantine or risk sickness and death there s no question thattrump and other right wing figures are pushing thishydroxychloroquine angle hard trump hastalked about these drugs several times duringhis daily propaganda dump press briefings as well as on twitter laura ingraham of fox news has been hyping this stuffheavily hosting a doctor who misleadingly argued that this is the beginning of the end of the pandemic wednesday night she s also had tweets removed by twitter for promoting medical disinformation sean hannity of fox news has been urging his millions of viewersto grab this stuff up as well saying i love the idea of off label use and arguing that even if it doesn t work people have right to try completely ignoring that thesedrugs are dangerous there are many otherexamples carefully collected here by media matters this kind of repetition works and goes a long way towards explaining how enthusiastically right wing audiences have latched onto these drugs as a possiblemiracle cure buthydroxychloroquine mania also flows from therigidly hierarchical view conservatives holdof society one where even basic necessities like health careshould be differentiated along class and race lines public health measures like quarantine and vaccine are viewed suspiciously precisely because they involve everyone on an approximately equal basis they long for a special kind of medical care one that s just for the people they see as better than everyone else this attitude has manifested in many ways before this crisis most notably around the debate over health care policy for progressives the conservative resistance to a single payer health care system is baffling even viewed from the perspective of pure self interest private insurance is expensive and unreliable and since your plan is constantly changing it can makes basic things like keeping a steady relationship with a doctor nearly impossible a single plan for all americans that covers us all in the same way would be cheaper and more efficient and take a lot of pain out of seeking medical care when you need it that seems obvious but that s just what conservatives don t like about it they don t wanta single plan for all americans the very idea of having the exact same health care plan as people they see as beneath them especially lower income people of color causes an angry reaction that s what all the right wing hysteria over rationing in response to both obamacare and the possibility of medicare for all isultimately about it s not that you might have to wait in line for something likeknee surgery because that s already happening under our patchwork private insurance system it s that people you deemunworthy due to skin color or class status also get to wait in line and heaven forbid might be ahead of you this attitude also explains the longstanding right wing desire topolicethe food purchases of people on food stamps to make sure they are sticking with their food and not buying conservatives feel are reserved for true and upstanding americans it also explains the often hysterical levels of right wing hostility to public transportation which can be traced back to the end of the practice of sending black people to the back of the bus in this worldview certain kinds of health care are for grubby commoners while thewell off white homeowner classshould have its own elite status this is alsopart of the reason that the anti vaccination movement has taken off in this country vaccinations after all are an unpleasant reminder that disease has norespect class or race but sees all humans as basically equal which very much does not fit withconservative ideology unsurprisingly then anti vaxxerattitudes have taken hold on the right especially in the religious right which has longbeen tightly intertwined with a hostility to the government defining and controlling public goods and has favored widespread privatization ofeverything from education to welfare a lot of people believethat anti vaccination attitudes are most common among new age style leftists but in reality republicans are more likely to oppose mandatory vaccinations than democrats it s largely republican elected officials who are trying to roll back laws requiring vaccinations and the religious right hasincreasingly promotedthe idea that it s better for kids to simply get diseases like the chicken pox than to vaccinate them it s true that anti vaccination ideology started off in lefty circles but that happened largely among well off white people who may vote democraticbut tend to live in highly segregated communities and tend to embrace reactionary ideologies like attachment parenting that prevent women from having employment outside of the home ultimately the logic of anti vaccination comes down to a belief that an elite lifestyle of organic foods and helicopter mothering precludes the need for sharing the samehealth care common people use including universal vaccination that this mentality would leap to republicans who would lean into it even harder isn t really a surprise the irony of the anti vaccination movement is that the elite form of health care organic food a mother s unwavering attention chicken pox parties is less effective than the universal policythat s under disdain which is vaccination but that kind of logic where reactionaries turn up their noses at the common good since it also benefits theproletariat is hardly limited tohealth care it s also evident in everything from rejecting the local taco stand to thinking that hip hop isn t real music that tormented way of thinking is what s driving theconservative enthusiasm forhydroxychloroquine the drug probably doesn t work and the side effects are scary but getting a prescription for it helps set one apart from ordinary working people who are doing the stuff public health officials prescribe such as washing their hands a lot and staying home even though for many it s meant the loss ofjobs and steady income even if a coronavirus vaccine is developed relatively quickly don t be surprised if many conservatives prefer the fantasy ofhydroxychloroquine over having to submit themselves to the same jab that janitors and hamburger flippers willlineup for most working class people can t afford to turn their backs oneffective preventative health care when they can get it
