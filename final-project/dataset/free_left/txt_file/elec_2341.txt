there are myriad reasons for donald trump s bewildering success in the polls in the run up to the republican primary but a lot of what it comes down to is confidence trump s narcissism the sort of thing that should be off putting has had the opposite effect for the past half year clearly convincing a huge number of conservatives that someone that confident must have some reason for it besides a diagnosable personality disorder but this past week trump s seemingly implacable sense of self confidence seems to be well shaken more than that even lately the manseems downright thirsty in a very short order his campaign strategy has changed from a man who enters the room and tells you how it s going to be to that of a man who is begging and pleading for you to like him the stench of desperation has started to cling to him and now every move he makes seems even more like pathetic pandering the once unbreakable donald trump now is starting to look like the guy who uses a shirtless picture for his tinder profile the biggest sign of this newfound thirst is in the opening of the pocketbook trump s ability to grab media and voter attention without spending much money has been aunique aspect of his campaign so far even though he does take donations trump likes to front like he s not beholden to any backers which contributes to the voters sense that he s not like those other bought and sold politicians but now the politician who was acting like he could win just by saying stuff on twitter has caved and is making a huge ad buy in iowa and new hampshire oh he s trying to spin it as another sign of his winning spirit announcing the ad buy with huge fanfare and getting a level of free media coverage that other candidates don t get for mundane things like buying tv ads but none of that can distract from the fact that the almighty trump is now acting like every other candidate in the race going on tv with his hat out and asking for your vote this is not the you re fired trump this is a guy begging for a job on its own caving in and acting like every other candidate wouldn t be that big a deal but the ad buy comes during a week when every move trump makes in public is looking grabby the long standing predictions that trump s poll lead would vanish once the primaries begin isn t looking quite as much like establishment wishful thinkinganymore his lead in new hampshire is shrinkingand ted cruz is up in iowa if he loses both of those he knows we ll see a reemergence of thenarrative that he was just a passing fancy for voters before they start to get serious at the polls and his behavior is starting to smell a bit desperate going after bill clinton for past infidelities for instance is the choice of a desperate man panty sniffing the clintons has a long history of backfiring with the voters and it opens trump up to charges of hypocrisy since he blew up his first marriage in order to marry his mistress but trump has gone even further than simply bringing up monica lewinsky he s also been hinting that bill clinton has committed sexual assault it s an attempt at a feminist gotcha but going there means that trump is aligning himself with the same peoplewho accuse the clintons of murderingpeople having secret love children and practicing witchcraft it s an interesting move because trump has spent the past monthactually moving away from his past as a right wing conspiracy theorist by refusing for instance to talk about his questions about barack obama s birth certificate to dive back into the fever swamps means risking general election credibility to pander to the hard right again a move he d only undertake if he werereally worried about losing in the primaries his attacks on the clintons aren t the only effort at baiting the base that runs a high risk of backfiring either one of the stranger moves that trump has taken this week has been race baiting his opponent ted cruz in all fairness to the best of my knowledge not too many evangelicals come out of cuba ok trump said at a campaign rally in iowa when you re casting your ballot remember cruz s polling success in iowa is assumed to come from the evangelical base so this attempt to sow doubt that he s really evangelical is a clear cut case of thirstiness but this runs a high risk of backfiring trump isn t wrong to assume that the evangelical identity is tied closely in the conservative mind to whiteness but what he fails to understand is that this is why so many conservative christians like ted cruz as with ben carson the handful of non white evangelical figures on the scene offer proof that the white evangelical identity is so desirable that it draws converts cruz himself knows this which is why he highlights his background instead of minimizing it there s a similar trying too hard quality to the waytrump spokeswoman katrina piersonacts it s not just that she wore a bullet necklace on cnn but the way she defended herself when people made fun of her for it maybe i ll wear a fetus next time bring awareness to 50 million aborted people that will never get to be on twitter https t co utomoyyxlk katrina pierson katrinapierson december 30 2015 oh will they also be holding little confederateflags while singing proud to be an american the pretense of sincere concern for fetal life is all but abandoned here the fetus like the gun or the flag is reduced to a bit of jewelry a sad posturing to indicate alignment with the fetus fetishist tribe whose votes pierson s hustling desperately to get but perhaps the saddest grasping from trump comes from this ad that trump posted on instagram we are in a serious war the title reads before running a reel of coverage of the paris and san bernardino attacks but then it cuts to obama making a joke about star wars suggesting that his willingness to spend a couple of hours out of his busy week seeing a movie is what lies between us and bringing an end to the threat of islamic terrorism the whole thing is preposterous but it s hard to even get mad it s so pathetic for one thing we are not actually in a war and stating otherwise has a strong whiff of hoping you can make it true simply by saying it but there s something particularly pitifulabout wanting obama to make a pointless gesturein refusing to see star wars what s the argument here that if obama refuses to see star wars isis will be so impressed by his sacrifice that they ll lay down their arms that seeing a movie somehow removes his ability to make important military decisions that if he would just stand in an empty room yelling damn you isis for two hours instead of watching a movie we would defeat our enemies this insistence on empty gestures over meaningful action of course sums up the entire trump campaign this is a man whose foreign policy proposals amount to arguing that if he just puffs his chest out big enough all other world leaders will immediately do everything he wants but the utter silliness of this ad with its assumption that obama can meaningfully effect world change by not seeing a movie highlights the vapidity of the trump campaign poignantly vote for trump and he will miss entire blockbuster movies
