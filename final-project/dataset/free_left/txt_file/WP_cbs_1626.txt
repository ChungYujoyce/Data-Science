museums and theaters and canceled venice s carnival and roman catholic masses in the two regions where clusters have formed lombardy and veneto police and soldiers are enforcing quarantines around 10 towns in lombardy and the epicenter of the veneto cluster vo euganeo premier giuseppe conte shocked lombardy officials by taking to task the hospital in codogno southeast of milan where italy s first positive patient went on feb 18 with flu like symptoms the man was sent home only to return a short time later with worsening conditions at which point he was tested for the virus many of lombardy s 200 plus positive tests have a traceable connection to the codogno hospital including several doctors and nurses patients and relatives who visited them conte told reporters that the lombardy cluster grew because of the hospital management that wasn t completely proper according to the protocols that are recommended for these cases this surely contributed to the spread he said lombardy s chief health official giulio gallera expressed shock at conte s remarks and defended the region s handling of the crisis it s offensive it s unacceptable gallera said noting that the man presented none of the main risk factors for the virus travel to china or contact with an infected person when he first went to the emergency room the man was eventually tested after doctors ascertained from his wife that he had met with someone who had recently returned from china but officials have excluded that contact as the source of the outbreak since that person tested negative as officials worked to get ahead of the spread nationally the reality of a two week quarantine was setting in for residents of italy s red zones the cluster of 10 towns in lombardy and veneto s tiny vo euganeo where residents were barred from leaving by police and army checkpoints the concern is palpable people are worried partly because of what they hear on television information on social media said davide passerini the mayor of fombio one of the 10 lombardy towns under lockdown life is like it is in other isolated villages everything is shut people go out just to do their shopping and they wait to see if they develop symptoms italy initially tested anyone who came into contact with an infected person but with the numbers growing and some supply issues with test kits italy s national health system has revised its containment strategies people who live or have visited the quarantined areas or who who have been in contact with positive cases are advised to self quarantine for two weeks they are instructed to take their temperatures twice a day and stay in touch with their doctors or the national health service via an overwhelmed toll free number only if they develop symptoms are they tested most often by a team performing house calls to prevent hospitals and clinics being overwhelmed by possibly infected patients said elia delmiglio mayor of casalpusterlengo another of the 10 towns in lombardy s red zone that s why we are asking people to call only when they develop symptoms so we are not forced to test everyone he said the town with more than 15 000 inhabitants doesn t have a working emergency room but only a hospital mainly specialized in cancer patients who are particularly at risk for contracting the virus local health structures are doing their best but in some cases they were not ready to face such an emergency delmiglio said in another hotbed of the virus outbreak veneto s tiny town of vo euganeo which has 30 of veneto s 38 cases local authorities were still planning to test all 3 300 residents and 600 acting hospital staff i m being optimistic and i feel well said resident andrea casalis as he waited to be tested people continue to go out here and talk in the streets but we try to keep some security distance first published on february 25 2020 10 28 am 2020 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast
