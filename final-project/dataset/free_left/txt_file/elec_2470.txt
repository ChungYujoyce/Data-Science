the big idea the gop field could winnow tonight from four candidates to three or two it is not out of the question that donald trump could sweep all five states that vote on this second super tuesday florida missouri north carolina ohio and illinois but a split decision of some kind seems more likely john kasich is closing strong and considered the favorite to prevail in his home state it is a win or drop out situation for kasich and marco rubio but the stakes are also high for ted cruz who needs to prove that he would be a worthy street fighter in a head to head match up with trump cruz who has been boxed out of some news cycles by the media s focus on trump is looking to set low expectations then blow past them dave weigel reports from columbus he is looking to strong performances in illinois missouri and north carolina the lightly polled megastates lost in recent coverage to cut any delegate lead trump might build tuesday the first two states border the parts of iowa that gave cruz his first victory there are 367 republican delegates at stake by this time tomorrow more than half of the total delegates to the convention in cleveland will have been awarded the question for democrats how much of an aberration was michigan one of hillaryclinton s problems last tuesday was the complacency of her supporters this week polls in every state but illinois and missouri again show her with pretty sizable leads and the action is mostly on the republican side the risk again is that her people stay home or take gop ballots even if sanders does well how many delegates does he get multiple polls show sanders closing in on clinton in three states in the industrial midwest missouri illinois and ohio but polls also show clinton far ahead in florida and in north carolina setting up the possibility of an outcome parallel to last week s contests when sanders scored a narrow and surprising victory in michigan yet clinton came away with a widened lead in the delegate count because of her resounding victory in mississippi john wagner and jose a delreal report in other words clinton appears poised to continue her progress toward the democratic nomination but ever more bloodied by her battles with sanders florida is today s biggest prize for republicans offering 99 delegates in a winner take all primary though a surprise should not be ruled out trump must be recognized as the heavy favorite he s led every single poll there this year a bigtrump win here would be a bigloss for the anti trump efforts throwing into question the effectiveness of their attacks anti trump forces have now spent 15 7 million going after him in the sunshine state anu narayanswamy tabulates from fec filings will rubio drop out tonight unlike kasich the senator has not publicly said he will quit if he loses his home state his super pac which has spent about 10 million in florida has not put any money behind ads in the forthcoming primaries not exactly a show of confidence cnn the post s ed o keefe who is following rubio now after spending a year chasing jeb full time relays from miami that rubio is exhausted and a funeralmood has set in at his events similar to what cloaked the bush campaign in its waning days one data point on why you shouldn t count out rubio rubio allies are pointing to heavy early voting in miami dade to argue that their turnout operation is better than trump s nearly 2 million early and absentee ballots have been cast in florida including more than 1 1 million republicans those totals include more than 100 000 republican ballots cast in rubio s home county the wall street journal notes florida attorney general pam bondi who wants to run for governor in 2018 and could thus potentially face rubio in a gop primary endorsed trump she previously backed jeb bush who has stayed conspicuously neutral ahead of today s primary the former governor still blames rubio for ruining his presidential hopes and he likely does not believe that weighing in could save his one time prot g will trump make inroads with unlikely demographics the miami herald reports that he is faring surprisingly well with hispanic republicans cuban americans in south florida have the rare opportunity to vote for two of their own for the u s presidency yet some are making a different choice they re backing trump there is anecdotal evidence of support among miami dade s staunchly republican cuban american voters even as most back rubio the son of cuban immigrants whom many cuban american voters helped elect to the u s senate in 2010 the paper says cubans don t care as much about deportation and the border wall i don t think cuban i think american the worst problem the u s has is the economy said former hialeah mayor julio martinez who convinced his wife who once lived in the u s illegally to vote for trump does the recent violence scare away any trump voters early evidence suggests not a monmouth university poll published yesterday found that two thirds of likely florida gop primary voters say the events in chicago have no effect on their view of trump the same survey showed trump leading rubio by 17 points 44 27 compared to an 8 point lead last week 38 30 trump s rivals continued to seize on the drama at his events as they fanned out across the battlegrounds rubio framed the election as a choice between optimism and fear i don t think there s anyone in the history of american politics that compares to the vulgarity of a donald trump candidacy he told reporters in the history of american politics sean sullivan cruz responded gamely when he was heckled in peoria illinois see sir one difference between this and a donald trump rally is i m not asking anyone to punch you in the face he said this is the lit kasich is passing out as he makes closing argument to ohio pic twitter com rxr5byx9b2 trump said there s a double standard and even denied that there s been tension it s a love fest these are love fests trump said at one of his events sarah palin campaigning for trump in florida decried petty punk ass little thuggery she accused the protesters of endangering the first amendment rights of trump s supporters and accused the mainstream media of being on the thugs side meanwhile a north carolina sheriff s office said it will not charge trump with inciting a riot after his raucous rally there last week where a supporter punched an african american protestor saying the events do not meet the lawful requirements to support a conviction david a fahrenthold and sarah larimer ohio kasich s last stand the buckeye state has 66 delegates at stake in its winner take all primary a final monmouth poll shows kasich up 40 35 over trump with cruz at 15 and rubio at 5 how the final day is playing in the cleveland plain dealer kasich the state s popular two term governor takes the stage at a high school about a mile from his home there s mitt romney by his side who when he was the republican nominee in 2012 received little help or enthusiasm from kasich but the former massachusetts governor didn t join the campaign trail with kasich out of personal loyalty or because kasich was his favorite candidate romney was trying to save the soul of his party by dragging kasich across the finish line at this moment he is the gop establishment s last best hope and yet it s not the most confident pose for kasich he is fighting harder than he ever thought he would have to to win ohio across town trump spoke to a few hundred at an aircraft hangar in youngstown the rally was announced less than 24 hours earlier after the trump campaign changed its schedule to focus on ohio does romney have any juice mitt stopped short formally of endorsing kasich when they campaigned together yesterday at an airplane museum in north canton you re the ones who are going to decide if he becomes the next president of the united states romney said you look at this guy and unlike the other people running he has a real track record he has the kind of record that you want in washington that s why i m convinced that you re going to do the right thing tomorrow the columbus dispatch reports on a surge in ohio voters who are switching party affiliations through friday franklin county had about 39 000 requests for absentee ballots and roughly 17 000 came from voters changing their registration most of the tide represents unaffiliated voters requesting a partisan ballot about 5 700 of those so called independents wanted to vote in the republican primary while almost 10 000 asked for a democratic ballot how potent is the trade issue for sanders and trump it was a big factor in their wins in michigan last week the rust belt has been hit hard by outsourcing and the decline of manufacturing both populists emphasized their opponents support for bad trade deals yesterday while campaigning in ohio he signed nafta nafta destroyed ohio trump said of kasich in youngstown it destroyed ohio and now he wants to sign tpp that is going to be worse i have studied it so carefully it s going to be worse for ohio it s going to take all of your car business out your car business is going to be destroyed by tpp he wants it and nobody knows why he wants it including himself maybe one of his lobbyists is demanding it maybe one of the other countries that s going to benefit is demanding it who knows it is completely crazy kasich cannot make america great again trump added if you didn t hit oil and he didn t have anything to do with that this state would have been as bad as any of em oil has gone way down and yet our budget s gone up 35 percent more than any other state in the united states that means you re gonna have a big big problem you in ohio and in the midwest know about the disastrous trade policies sanders said in akron where a once thriving tire industry has experienced a major decline it took me about 13 seconds to figure out that nafta was written by corporate america that its goal was to shut down factories and plants in america to move abroad to find cheap labor and bring those products back into america it didn t take a phd to figure that out illinois is shaping up to be the marquee contest for democrats today it s a midwestern state good for sanders and racially diverse great for clinton fivethirtyeight which gave hillary a 99 percent chance of winning michigan complains that the polls are skewed which makes it harder to forecast a recent chicago tribune poll gave clinton a 42 point lead while last week s yougov poll put sanders at a 2 point advantage watch chicago sanders returned to the windy city for a late night election eve rally stumping there just a few hours after clinton and trying to score another in her home state did sanders make the primary a referendum on rahm emanuel the

times looks at the last minute efforts to stop bernie from catching up bill clinton hit two black churches in west suburban maywood and south shore to spur crucial african american voter turnout the clinton campaign sent a team of high profile surrogates to fan out across the chicago area after two new polls pointed to the potential of a sanders win in illinois turf long seen as solidly for clinton north carolina is looking very good for clinton if she wins in florida and north carolina hillary will have won every southern state the charlotte observer notes that three presidential candidates descended on the city monday sanders rallied supporters at pnc music pavilion near unc charlotte while clinton made a late night appearance at grady cole center just outside uptown though the latest polls put clinton way ahead of sanders 56 37 the vermont senator hopes to pull another michigan style upset by pressing his differences with clinton over trade she has racked up endorsements in the tar heel state clinton has the backing of 44 of the general assembly s 61 democratic lawmakers including all the democratic women and she s counting on heavy support from african americans who are likely to make up at least a third of the democratic primary electorate a record for a primary of 56 752 people cast early or absentee ballots in mecklenburg county the observer reports turnout could rival the county s recent high of 34 percent set in 2008 sanders campaigned yesterday in four of the five states that vote today florida is the only one he skipped and it s because the primary is closed which means independents won t be able to vote for him and there aretoo many retirees for him to be viable clinton has consistently won seniors missouri might be today s biggest wildcard it s hard to know exactly what s going on in the show me state which offers 71 democratic delegates and 52 republican delegates the state s lack of polling coupled with its hard to predict open primary system has kept pundits from making accurate predictions from the story in this morning s post dispatch the st louis area saw monday appearances by both former first daughter chelsea clinton addressing supporters at a clayton restaurant and sanders who had a large crowd in st charles his third big rally in the region in the past two weeks a post dispatch poll last week indicated that missouri voters in both parties slightly favor the front runners clinton and trump but their leads over sanders and cruz respectively were within the poll s margins for error making the races potential nail biters missouri is cruz s best shot at a win today cruz has done extremely well in the midwest think iowa and kansas and he has netted key endorsements from political figures in the state rubio s descent means cruz will get an even clearer shot at trump in the state but missouri s open primary could make it easier for trump to win independent voters break almost overwhelmingly in support of the populist candidates and a strong independent turnout would likely boost his campaign to success can cruz consolidate the stop trump movement trying to be conciliatory he said yesterday that kasich and rubio could both have spots in his cabinet from katie zezima in north carolina as cruz hopes to narrow the primary to a two man race he is increasingly trying to appeal to very different groups working class voters who may be drawn to trump and political establishment voters who want to stop him the fit is not a natural one for cruz who pillories the establishment but with rubio s candidacy sputtering and kasich far behind the establishment is warming to him it comes down to the reality of a trump nomination said a bush turned cruz supporter trump would be a disaster and an embarrassment for the nation ted is the best chance to defeat trump funny color cruz is bragging on the trail about finishing dead last in saturday s d c convention fewer than 3 000 voted rubio got 10 delegates to nine for kasich the washington lobbyists looked at this field and said goodness gracious give us anybody but cruz he says it always gets cheers while you
