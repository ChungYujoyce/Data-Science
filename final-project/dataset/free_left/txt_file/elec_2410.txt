 miami six weeks before he was set to open florida s first charter school jeb bush had yet to recruit a principal then he met katrina wilson davis a 32 year old social studies teacher with no management experience but a positive spirit that gave him hope we need someone who carries a knife in her teeth and can swing through the vines wilson davis recalls bush telling her on that summer day in 1996 recovering from an ego bruising election loss bush was looking for chances to soften his image as a callous republican who proclaimed he would do probably nothing as governor to help african americans as a private citizen likely to run for governor again in 1998 bush created the liberty city charter school as a way to educate black children from miami s poorest neighborhoods the school would give him a way to mend ties with the black community while testing a controversial conservative education theory that was drawing the ire of teachers unions my friends told me i was being used wilson davis remembered she figured it was worth a try i said so everyone s being used as he runs for president nearly two decades later bush points to his time working on the school as evidence of his early commitment to a reform agenda he has said the experience still shapes the way i see the deep seated challenges facing urban communities today he points to the school s opening as one of the happiest proudest moments of my life but for wilson davis and others who walked the halls of liberty city that happy moment has been obscured by the complicated years that have followed over time bush s tightknit relationship with the school and his handpicked principal fizzled after he won election as florida governor in part by touting the school bush stepped down from the board a move his aides say avoided any perceptions of favoritism he was unable to help the school overcome steep debt or help it resolve a dispute with the building s landlord by 2008 the year after bush left office local officials voted to close the school as bush campaigns in florida today to revive his struggling presidential campaign many in this beleaguered community wrestle with his legacy in their lives there are feelings of adoration and feelings of abandonment many here wonder why couldn t a man so well connected and powerful help raise money or strike a deal with a local landlord how could he step away from a cause that was so dear to him a project that intended to close the chasm between bush and the black community ended up broadening the distance between them bush s presidential campaign in which he has promised to broaden the republican party s appeal to minorities while on one occasion appearing to suggest that democrats win black votes by offering free stuff serves as a reminder of the two sides of the man they knew it s like i m reliving the sadness all over again wilson davis said she exhaled everyone wants me to bash jeb she added i can t just bash jeb he did so much for me he introduced me to so many good people white people who cared about our community bush in a recent interview said he could not have saved the school he had helped negotiate with the landlord early on but he said little could be done about the landlord s desire to kick the school out how common core could hurt jeb bush the problem is that they didn t own the school they tried to own the school bush said but you can t operate a school if you don t have the real estate the idea for a charter school in liberty city stemmed from a new kinship between bush and t willard fair a local black activist in fair head of the urban league of greater miami bush found his first full ally within miami s black community fair had been swayed by the probably nothing remark because he long believed black people needed to rely more on themselves not the government for their uplift it took only 90 minutes for them to agree to start the charter school which would be privately run but publicly funded bush attempted to get another prominent local black activist to serve as principal school board member frederica s wilson she rebuffed his efforts but recommended wilson davis who always dreamed of being a principal i knew i could educate those children wilson davis said i know these children i was one of them in an hour they agreed to work together bush knew he was asking wilson davis to take on a difficult task that would put her at the center of a intense political debate over the future of public schools but he had confidence in her she had a heart for these kids he said their meeting spawned a fruitful partnership the young black schoolteacher granddaughter of sharecroppers and daughter of a cafeteria worker and a truck driver gained a mentor and powerful friend who introduced her to the upper echelon of american politics and wealth the privileged white politician got a charismatic leader for his school who taught him to use bits of slang like off the chain he also got a useful anecdote for his next campaign and he doubled his share of the black vote soon wilson davis was going to fancy parties with the son of a president hillary rodham clinton first lady at the time invited her to the white house for a forum on education you re now swimming with big fish wilson davis recalled someone telling her at a fundraiser for the school after which she wondered what have i gotten into bush too was acclimating to a different kind of pond on saturdays he drove from tony coral gables to a neighborhood of scraggy lots barbed wire fences and malls scarred by riots from nearly two decades before at first fair recalled bush looked uncomfortable when he met young mothers in subsidized housing who were interested in his school it was an extraordinary experience bush said sixty students enrolled in the school when it opened in august 1996 when bush would visit he would pat students on the head and call them by name they would try to scare him with pictures of alligators they drew and he dressed up as santa claus at christmastime his mother barbara bush came to read goodnight moon tv cameras and reporters captured bush s big experiment educators and donors wanted tours the school was mocked by the teachers unions when it performed poorly on tests praised in the papers when it performed well the attention helped the school with its fundraising even as wilson davis tired of being a tour guide she was more focused on intensive reading and math instruction and weekly positive reinforcement assemblies when she heard students arguing about whether zebras were donkeys with painted stripes she arranged a trip to the zoo many children were being raised by their grandparents so wilson davis started a quilting night to connect the community don t let me call your mama became one of wilson davis s best known threats to the students about a dozen former students contacted by the washington post recalled how she offered jolly rancher candies when students visited her office and kept a small mattress there in case anyone needed a nap it was really this custom education that was developed for the kids at the school that made us able to succeed said maurice jackson now 22 jackson who interned this summer at the white house said his views on school turned around after wilson davis placed him in more advanced classes bush was in the background as much as the foreground he was a strict taskmaster who could not stomach seeing so much as a wad of paper on the ground trina he would say to wilson davis she recalled poor doesn t mean dirty the school received the same per pupil funding as traditional schools but additional expenses such as rent meant that teachers at first were paid less bush s fundraising prowess helped but he warned that it would not last forever he s a fiscally frugal guy so the goal was you have to learn how to operate with what the state gives you each year wilson davis recalled whenever she asked for money she said bush would lean in he would cross his legs look into her eyes and ask her why he taught me to trust myself wilson davis said he would say you can make mistakes but just not a lot of them because success was the only option as he walked through the school hall on the day after his successful 1998 election the cheerleading squad yelled give me a b give me a u give me an s give me an h i used to love seeing him and he was there so much said michelle turner now 25 who was captured by news photographers hugging bush on that day in 1998 but then turner and others recall something changed in later years i don t remember him being there at all turner said bush had left the board by 2000 two years after being elected governor but wilson davis continued to reach out to him often using e mail he would respond with brief words of encouragement i hope that you will find time to come by the school and see the children wilson davis wrote in july 2001 i will try to make it bush responded there was no indication whether he paid a visit in january 2002 wilson davis bragged to him that the school was operating entirely from its state allotment after many years of prudent and fiscal conservatism by 2006 though trouble was mounting the school incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt the growing importance of high stakes standardized tests pushed by bush led to the school spending more on new textbooks and a devastating hurricane season in 2005 left the school with a leaky roof that she said the landlord was slow to fix you know that i don t run to you for everything because i know that you have a whole state and the country to contend with wilson davis wrote to bush on oct 13 2006 i am in a position where i need some intervention and direction from you bush wrote back telling wilson davis that i will work on both issues he told her that as a public school you should receive the same benefits that all public schools receive bush attempted to connect her with fema according to e mails that have been released publicly but wilson davis said she worried the process was moving too slowly fearing for her students safety she used the school s money to fix the roof the landlord patrick beauregard sued the repairs violated the lease and he wanted the school out beauregard did not respond to several phone calls from the post fair and wilson davis wondered is it time to get bush more involved fair opposed the idea his reasoning beauregard was black as were fair and wilson davis some racial lines he felt could not be crossed there was nothing in the marrow of my bones that could allow me to ask some white man to bail me out for what a black man did fair said wilson davis reached out to bush anyway she recalled bush telling her that his hands were tied the 500 000 debt was too much for him to recoup the legal fees continued to mount and debt grew to 1million parents held walks and protests to generate attention but their efforts were futile they wondered what happened to their powerful founder after bush left office in 2007 he made a lucrative reentry into the private sector asked at the time about the school s difficulties bush told the miami herald i am not aware what this is about in 2008 the county school board shut the school down wilson davis was so distraught she said that she could not bring herself to find work for two years one day she got a phone call from a concerned wilson the former school board member who introduced her to bush wilson who was bush s most ardent opponent when she was in the state legislature and today is a congresswoman had a new recommendation grab your purse and start working again wilson davis eventually joined wilson s mentorship program for black boys as she discusses her experience with the school wilson davis likes to focus on the successes she estimated at least 85percent of her students graduated from high school and 40percent went on to college i don t think bush was a racist or tried to pimp out these children that wasn t his heart wilson davis said but i think it s a fair question for a community to want to hold him accountable even so wilson davis retains warm feelings for bush the last time wilson davis texted bush was in 2011 she hoped to catch up with him during his trip to a majority black high school in florida that was excelling on standardized tests that day bush was sitting in the front row of the auditorium with president obama security stopped her outside the room was so crowded with so many well wishers that his past prot g e couldn t get in ed o keefe steven
