november in the general election smith has not officially endorsed her party s presumptive nominee but she did speak out about the allegations in aninterview with slate i think an investigation is warranted given the circumstances i think that a lot of it has already been done but i don t think that is a compelling component in my campaign she said what i find really interesting is that this is where republicans want to go right now we suspect this will be a very nasty campaign they ll try to shift the narrative to china they ll try to shift the narrative to these allegations congressman ami bera said in an interview with cbs news the california democrat is a frequent surrogate for biden s campaign and co chairs house democrats program for vulnerable incumbents still bera doesn t think the attacks are having much of an impact on the democratic races it s obvious that the republican members of congress in down ballot races as well as the president can t run on his failed record of leadership he said while several house democrats have held out on individually endorsing biden a group representing many of them the new democrat coalition is giving him its support his allies insist the delays have more to do with timing and the pandemic than with reade s accusations new hampshire congressman chris pappas who recently endorsed biden is a member of the democratic congressional campaign committee s dccc frontline program for vulnerable incumbents it was important for vice president biden to address these allegations head on and it is always important that women are able to
