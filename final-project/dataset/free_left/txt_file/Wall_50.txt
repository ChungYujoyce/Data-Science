advertisement supported by a retired judge will also examine whether the former national security adviser committed perjury by katie benner washington the federal judge overseeing the case against president trump s former national security adviser michael t flynn appointed a hard charging former prosecutor and judge on wednesday to oppose the justice department s effort to drop the case and to explore a perjury charge against mr flynn judge emmet g sullivan s appointment of the former judge john gleeson was an extraordinary move in a case with acute political overtones mr flynn pleaded guilty twice to lying to investigators as part of a larger inquiry into russia s interference in the 2016 election mr flynn later began fighting the charge and sought to withdraw his guilty plea then last week the justice department abruptly moved to drop the charge after a long campaign by mr trump and his supporters prompting accusations that attorney general william p barr had undermined the rule of law and further politicized the department judge sullivan also asked judge gleeson to explore the possibility that by trying to withdraw his pleas mr flynn opened himself to perjury charges the justice department declined to comment judge gleeson did not respond to a request for comment judge sullivan had said on tuesday that he would consider briefs from outsiders known as amicus curiae or friend of the court who opposed the government s request to dismiss the case against mr flynn transcript from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily today federal prosecutors are asking a court to throw out their own criminal case against former national security adviser michael flynn mark mazzetti on what led to that decision it s thursday may 14 mark remind us where the michael flynn story starts well michael flynn was a three star army general who had a quite distinguished career became the head of the defense intelligence agency under the obama administration and then he gradually sort of moves into the trump orbit in 2016 when trump was running for president during the republican convention we do not need a reckless president who believes she is above the law he famously leads a chant lock her up yes that s right lock her up of lock her up meaning to hillary clinton right if i did a tenth of what she did i would be in jail today and after trump is elected he announces that he s going to make flynn his national security adviser so it s during this time when there s a series of events that get michael flynn into trouble it s shortly after christmas in 2016 when the obama administration announces a number of sanctions against russia for its efforts to sabotage the 2016 campaign it was soon after that the washington post reports that trump s incoming national security adviser michael flynn repeatedly called the russian ambassador to the u s that the washington post reported that flynn had been on a number of phone calls with the russian ambassador on the exact same day on the same day the obama sanctions were announced which raised questions about whether the incoming trump administration was trying to meddle with the obama administration s foreign policy i talked to general flynn about that conversation actually it was vice president elect mike pence goes on face the nation they did not discuss anything having to do with the united states decision to impose a censure against russia pence says that flynn had told him the sanctions never came up on the call but the justice department had transcripts of the calls in which flynn had actually urged the ambassador not to overreact to the obama administration s sanctions f b i agents interviewed michael flynn about whether he discussed u s sanctions with russian so f b i agents are sent to the white house to interview flynn what has he told investigators he tells them that the sanctions never came up on the call right he s lying to the f b i right this all becomes public and in february 2017 general michael flynn suddenly resigned late last night flynn is forced to resign he is the shortest serving national security adviser now in modern history and what happens to flynn once he s pushed out of the white house the f b i continues to investigate flynn but very little is heard from him for a number of months and during this time president trump starts leaning on james comey the f b i director in essence to drop the flynn investigation right and that raised this idea that the president of the united states was trying to obstruct justice and that s this kind of cataclysmic moment that ultimately sets off a chain of events that leads to not only comey being fired but also the appointment of mueller as the special counsel right in many ways the flynn saga is the beginning of the mueller saga and the beginning of a very dark chapter for the trump administration that s correct what ends up happening to michael flynn well flynn pled guilty to repeatedly lying to the f b i flynn ends up pleading guilty to lying to the f b i says that he is cooperating becomes a cooperating witness in the mueller investigation he s awaiting sentence court documents make clear that flynn was not acting alone and the significance was that he was the first top white house official to plead guilty as part of the mueller investigation court papers say flynn could get up to six months behind bars but he was under mark i feel like for many people that is where the michael flynn story pretty much ends right i mean you have this three star general national security adviser who just totally falls from grace after lying to his bosses and the f b i and now he s headed to prison that s right and the mueller investigation marches on and the next significant point is the end of 2018 into 2019 when flynn is set to be sentenced by a federal judge and the mueller team weighs in breaking news right now bob mueller s office is recommending to the judge that michael flynn actually not receive any prison time and says flynn s been a good witness michael flynn cooperated plenty with the special counsel they recommend very little if any jail time the defendant provided firsthand information about the content and context of interactions between the transition team and russian government officials and something curious happens then where flynn s legal team which had been very cooperative towards the mueller investigation clearly they cut what seemed to be a pretty good deal with the mueller team decide to take a more combative stance they enter into the public record this idea that maybe flynn had been railroaded that the f b i may have set him up so this angers the judge he really reads flynn and his team the riot act saying are you now saying you re not remorseful and why are you now accusing the f b i of misconduct and basically says let s take a pause we re going to put this off for a few months and come back to me when you ve found some remorse in the intervening time the ground starts to shift william barr has just been sworn in as the new attorney general gaining broad control of the special counsel robert mueller s russia investigation william barr takes over as attorney general i believe it is vitally important that the special counsel be allowed to complete his investigation he during his confirmation hearing pledges that he s not going to interfere with the mueller investigation so mueller famously then delivers his report to barr in march of 2019 the deputy attorney general and i concluded that the evidence developed by the special counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense and barr writes a very short summary of sorts that he says summarizes mueller s findings which we now know misinterprets the mueller report it s quite clear starting at that point that barr has great issues with not only the mueller investigation but how this all began how the russia investigation began at the f b i and whether there was real misconduct i ve been trying to get answers to questions and i found that a lot of the answers have been inadequate and i also so he makes no secret of the fact that he s going to start investigating the investigation he is going to launch a campaign to get to the bottom of what happened and whether there really was a political effort to go after donald j trump and his advisers and what does that mean for michael flynn awaiting sentencing for lying to the f b i as the ground shifts and as it s clear that barr is going to look at the predicate for the entire investigation flynn decides to get a new lawyer nothing about this case was done right they violated every rule every protocol who is not only a lawyer but also a pundit of sorts the entire prosecution was false it must be dismissed this is a texas lawyer named sidney powell who has made no secret of the fact that she thinks the entire thing is a witch hunt their prosecution of general flynn was needed to keep the obstruction hoax going against the president because they already knew the russia hoax had fallen apart very much in line with what the president of the united states has said so the whole thing was orchestrated and set up within the f b i and days before she takes over as flynn s lawyer she writes a secret letter to attorney general barr where she writes quote it is increasingly apparent that general flynn was targeted and taken out of the trump administration for concocted and political purposes wow so you re saying flynn recognizes the winds are changing recognizing that there s literally a new sheriff attorney general in town who s skeptical of the entire russia investigation and so flynn hires a lawyer who fits quite nicely into that dynamic yes and during that period of time attorney general barr decides to appoint another prosecutor who s going to examine the case and see whether there had been any misconduct that had taken place so just to be clear in addition to examining the roots of the russia investigation broadly barr appoints a specific prosecutor inside the department of justice just to examine the flynn case that s right and that leads to the release of a number of documents to the public in recent weeks that have led both flynn s lawyers and the president to make the case that michael flynn was indeed railroaded and set up by the f b i we ll be right back mark tell us what s inside these documents in essence the documents are internal f b i and justice department communications around the time that flynn was interviewed by the f b i and what they show kind of broadly are that there was concern about the decision to interview flynn one of the documents that got a lot of attention was written by bill priestap who at the time was the head of the f b i s counterintelligence division which was running the whole russia investigation and this is january 24 four days after the trump administration takes over and right before there is this decision to go send f b i agents to interview the national security adviser and priestap writes quote what s our goal truth admission or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired wow in another document he seems to understand the risks of conducting this interview and he says protect our institution by not playing games and if we are seen playing games the white house will be furious some of that language is quite potentially inflammatory the idea that the person running the investigation is wondering if their goal might be to get the national security adviser fired essentially to get him in trouble it raises this question of whether sidney powell flynn s lawyers had a point that they were trying to set him up right and finally there s also interesting divide that is revealed between the f b i and the justice department and what some of the documents show is that there was some concern of justice department about what the f b i was up to so there s some concern about whether or not interviewing flynn is at all a good idea right and we find out that the f b i only tells the justice department they re going to go do this while the agents are on their way to the white house huh mark what happens once these internal f b i documents are released what s the reaction this unleashes a torrent of criticism he should dismiss the case for egregious government misconduct without a doubt by flynn s lawyer sidney powell that the government has been hiding this evidence that shows their own crimes while they were accusing mr flynn falsely of any crimes because they made it all up by other commentators on the right a lot of people close to this feel like michael flynn was setup never lied admitting that they got things completely wrong and actively worked to defame instead it looks like two systems of justice in terms of how the f b i handled hillary clinton and how they handled donald trump by president trump when i looked at what they did to him they tormented him dirty cops tormented general flynn making the case that flynn should never have been interviewed and the case should now be dropped and what would be the legal basis for that argument what in the documents do flynn s lawyers seize on and say makes his prosecution illegitimate well they re saying that these documents reveal that there was real concern in the f b i about whether the interview should have taken place in the first place mm hmm and if the interview doesn t take place then there s no lies to worry about and if there s no lies then there s nothing to prosecute flynn on and therefore there is no case period and michael flynn should walk free you have no predicate to be there in the beginning then whatever you find is immaterial to the investigation and this is what barr seizes on when he makes this incredibly dramatic decision last week just in this afternoon the justice department is dropping its criminal case against president trump s former national security adviser retired general michael flynn to drop the charges against michael flynn the justice department today is holding that there was not a legitimate basis to do an investigation of flynn barr said there was never any good reason to interview michael flynn in the first place and so whatever flynn said during the interview was irrelevant and barr even goes further than that attorney general barr thank you for speaking first to cbs news hi catherine in an interview last week he not only criticizes the decisions that were made at the time to interview flynn there was not in our view a legitimate investigation but he also goes to bat for flynn going all the way back to flynn s phone calls with the russian ambassador and it is very typical and very common for the national security team of the incoming president to communicate with foreign leaders and that call there was nothing wrong with it whatever in fact it was laudable and it was nothing inconsistent with the obama administration s policies and it was in u s interest he was saying to the russians don t escalate he actually says that the phone calls were laudable and that it was perfectly understandable that flynn would talk to the russian ambassador to try to lower tensions in a very tense environment when history looks back on this decision how do you think it will be written well history is written by the winners so it largely depends on who s writing the history i mean what s fascinating about what barr is doing is that it does not feel like every day when the department of justice sides with a defendant in a criminal prosecution over its own prosecutors who have successfully gone after that defendant and it s in keeping with what william barr has done for a year from the time that robert mueller presented his report to barr barr has questioned the legitimacy of the investigation and any fruits of that investigation he has questioned whether those prosecuted were done so fairly or whether the f b i overreached he has also backed decisions to lower sentences of others mark is barr s legal analysis in the flynn case sound is it in dispute barr s decision has been widely criticized plenty of legal experts say that prosecutors in general have wide discretion to decide which aspects of the investigation they want to pursue what is germane to the case and in this specific instance the fact that there was an ongoing investigation into contact between trump aides and the russians would make flynn s calls germane to this particular investigation that is not to say that now looking back there haven t been instances of f b i abuse over the course of the russia investigation mark given everything you ve just said and reading these documents that have been released from the department of justice about the debate that went on inside the f b i these notes from an agent about how to conduct this interview whether they might basically trap flynn in a lie and get him fired i mean is there a version of this where what bill barr has done is exactly what any justice system should do when there are serious questions about the legitimacy of a prosecution which is kind of give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant you always want greater transparency when it comes to how an investigation was conducted that s true if the target is michael flynn or if the target is someone far less famous the concern of course is whether there is abuse going on in the other direction what do you mean that what the attorney general is doing is in effect launching a campaign to discredit the investigation to discredit the mueller probe to discredit its results in a way that will ultimately benefit his boss president trump remember president trump who s been railing against the quote unquote witch hunt for years will be using this for his re election campaign so the concern of course is that bill barr is kind of acting as a proxy warrior for the president but mark is it possible that both things can be true that the attorney general bill barr may be trying to discredit the entire russia investigation and in the process very much oversimplify things and that the prosecution of michael flynn might be flawed yes both of those things can be true and this is why the passions are so intense on this issue because both sides want to control the narrative and because of that can t allow necessarily any gray area in this argument either michael flynn is a hero or he s a traitor either the mueller investigation was a just pursuit or it was a witch hunt and of course there is a lot of space between those characterizations and nuance that gets lost because the political debate is black and white so mark what s going to happen to michael flynn now well of course given what william barr decided there is a very likely scenario that michael flynn soon is a free man and he is brought back into the fold and in the coming months we see him once again campaigning for donald trump thank you mark thanks michael on wednesday night the times reported that before the department of justice sought to throw out the case against michael flynn it had interviewed the f b i official whose notes have been interpreted as potentially seeking to entrap flynn in that interview the official bill priestap said that his notes had been misconstrued and that there was no effort to set flynn up we ll be right back here s what else you need to know today the scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent significantly worse than any recession since world war ii we are seeing a severe decline in economic activity in a speech on wednesday the chairman of the federal reserve warned that the pandemic could permanently damage the american economy if congress does not act to prevent a wave of bankruptcies and prolonged unemployment long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up and leave families in greater debt the message from jerome powell suggested that the trillions of dollars that congress has already pumped into the economy may not be enough additional fiscal support could be costly but worth it if it helps avoid long term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery and the house of representatives is poised to temporarily change its rules to allow lawmakers to vote and hold committee hearings remotely so that they can avoid traveling to washington during the pandemic the rules expected to pass tomorrow would mark a major change for a body long defined by the tradition of meeting and voting in person that s it for the daily i m michael barbaro see you tomorrow while judges do sometimes appoint such third parties to represent an interest they feel is not being heard in a case judge sullivan s move was highly unusual said samuel buell a former federal prosecutor who now teaches criminal law at duke university judge sullivan he said is essentially bringing in an outsider to represent the point of view of the original prosecutors who believed mr flynn had committed a crime before mr barr intervened and essentially replaced them with a prosecutor willing to say he had not this is extraordinary for the judge to appoint somebody to argue against a prosecutors motion to dismiss a criminal case mr buell said but it s extraordinary for a prosecutor to move to dismiss this sort of criminal case what the justice department did in the first case is as far as any of us can figure out unprecedented he added so the fact that this is pretty unprecedented too is not that surprising it was not immediately clear what judge sullivan was focused on with his request for input on whether to essentially accuse mr flynn of criminal perjury mr buell said he doubted it would qualify as perjury for mr flynn to embrace the justice department s claim that he committed no crime because his admitted lies were purportedly immaterial to a proper investigation whether or not that legal theory is true but mr buell said there could be a legitimate issue if mr flynn were to claim that he did not lie after all a notion the justice department s filing also hinted at despite previously telling judges that he had mr flynn s lawyers objected to judge sullivan s earlier order suggesting he would accept input from third parties and said that outside opinions were best left to op ed sections this court is not a forum for their alleged special interest mr flynn s lawyers wrote in court papers judge gleeson who served on the federal bench in brooklyn and ran the criminal division in the federal prosecutor s office there has already made plain his skepticism of the justice department s motion to dismiss the flynn case he co wrote an op ed article this week in the washington post urging judge sullivan to scrutinize it prosecutors deserve a presumption of regularity the benefit of the doubt that they are acting honestly and following the rules he wrote along with two other former federal law enforcement officials in new york but when the facts suggest they have abused their power that presumption fades the department made conflicting statements to the court they wrote saying that judge sullivan had the authority the tools and the obligation to decide whether the motion to withdraw was credible there has been nothing regular about the department s effort to dismiss the flynn case they wrote the record reeks of improper political influence the son of irish immigrants judge gleeson has said in interviews that he took a job as a prosecutor in brooklyn after he was rejected from a post in the manhattan federal prosecutor s office then run by rudolph w giuliani as a prosecutor in brooklyn judge gleeson rose to legal stardom when he successfully prosecuted the notorious mobster john gotti president bill clinton appointed him to the federal bench in 1994 and he served until 2016 judge gleeson is highly regarded among current and former prosecutors who described his sharp courtroom skills in putting mafiosos and other criminals in jail but he also fought for lower sentencing guidelines and advocated on behalf of policies that would keep nonviolent offenders out of prison judge gleeson brings a keen sense of justice and of federal court procedures to the task of seeking to understand how this very unusual case came about said carl tobias a professor at the university of richmond school of law he shares that sense with judge sullivan who has displayed little tolerance for the government overstepping its bounds after prosecutors secured a conviction on corruption charges in the 2008 trial of senator ted stevens of alaska judge sullivan dismissed the charges and ordered an independent prosecutor to examine whether the prosecutors had improperly withheld evidence in nearly 25 years on the bench he said in an angry lecture i ve never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that i ve seen in this case a report later backed his suspicions but no charges were filed judge sullivan a clinton appointee as well has also closely overseen mr flynn s case since he began presiding over it in 2018 he noted at an aborted sentencing hearing that year that he was alarmed to see mr flynn appear to argue in court filings that he had not really lied and that investigators had coerced him judge sullivan demanded that mr flynn acknowledge he had entered his plea knowingly voluntarily intelligently and with fulsome and satisfactory advice of counsel he said he could not remember accepting a guilty plea from someone who maintained that he was not guilty and i don t intend to start today he also excoriated mr flynn for his crime noting that he lied to federal agents on the grounds of the white house i can t make any guarantees but i m not hiding my disgust my disdain for this criminal offense the judge said internal tensions over the justice department s decision to withdraw the charge against mr flynn have also seeped into view the career prosecutors on the case squared off against other law enforcement officials including the u s attorney in st louis jeff jensen whom mr barr brought in to review it according to people familiar with the conversations they argued about whether the fact that mr flynn had lied to investigators about communications with the russian ambassador to the united states at the time sergey i kislyak was material to the department s larger investigation into russian election interference in seeking to dismiss the charge the department insisted it did not additionally bill priestap the former head of f b i counterintelligence cast doubt on their argument for dropping the case in an interview conducted just days before the department filed its motion the department did not include information from mr priestap s interview when they told the court they wanted to dismiss the case a justice department official said that law enforcement officials were writing a report on the interview and would soon file it with the court judge sullivan s unusual appointment of judge gleeson came after another federal judge in washington criticized mr barr s handling of the russia investigation in a ruling in a separate a freedom of information act lawsuit judge reggie b walton said that mr barr presented a distorted and misleading picture of the report by the special counsel robert s mueller iii before he made it public judge walton questioned whether mr barr made a calculated attempt to influence public discourse about the mueller report in favor of president trump charlie savage adam goldman and
