the far left is up in arms again this time over a hacked tape of hillary clinton at a fundraiser in a wealthy virginia suburb special correspondent there i was watching college football and the ryder cup as my daughter sat next to me on the couch drawing rapunzel and ariel halftime of the game i was watching came so i moseyed over to my office to look in on the political world expecting not much new at 5 o clock on a saturday didn t see much at first and then oh what s this something about basement dwellers and hillary making fun of people living in basements what oh christ here we go again backstory the intercept the i think it s fair to say anti clinton though by no means pro trump web site got a tape of a talk clinton gave at a private fundraiser in mclean virginia back in february no check that it looks like the washington free beacon got it first and posted it tuesday but the conservative beacon reflecting house priorities led with the fact that clinton evidently said on the tape that she wouldn t upgrade the nuclear arsenal which for the beacon indicates of course that she wants america to lose after that i m not certain what happened but it seems as if after the beacon published the audio a couple intercept reporters were the first people on the left who got around to listening to it the intercept account as you might guess didn t give a rat s pooper about the nuclear arsenal but led with the fact that clinton said somewhat unfortunately but in context only somewhat for reasons i ll explain that she occupies the center left to the center right that was a responsible and for the intercept predictable and understandable way to play the story but then by the time it got to the twittersphere clinton was somehow making fun of sanderistas mocking them for being such losers that they re living in their parent s basements the hashtag basementdwellers was trending like mad when i checked in and i d imagine it ll be going strong all night i read a few of them which boiled down to fuck you hillary you corporate hack this is why we need the revolution and you re going to be the first to face the firing squad although i thought i smelled a lot of trolling from the deplorable caucus too of all the arrant bullshit i ve seen on twitter this election this is easily the bullshittiest she insulted no one in fact quite the opposite for someone speaking behind closed doors to ardent supporters she was not only restrained but she openly and directly asked her supporters to be patient with the impatient that is to understand the views and motivations of the younger people who wanted more radical change the intercept quoted two passages i ve not listened to the tape yet but we can presume that between them the beacon and the intercept plucked out the interesting parts so here s what the intercept came up with quote one it is important to recognize what s going on in this election everybody who s ever been in an election that i m aware of is quite bewildered because there is a strain of on the one hand the kind of populist nationalist xenophobic discriminatory kind of approach that we hear too much of from the republican candidates and on the other side there s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college free healthcare that what we ve done hasn t gone far enough and that we just need to you know go as far as you know scandinavia whatever that means and half the people don t know what that means but it s something that they deeply feel so as a friend of mine said the other day i am occupying from the center left to the center right and i don t have much company there because it is difficult when you re running to be president and you understand how hard the job is i don t want to overpromise i don t want to tell people things that i know we cannot do quote two some are new to politics completely they re children of the great recession and they are living in their parents basement they feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves and they don t see much of a future i met with a group of young black millennials today and you know one of the young women said you know none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college and we don t believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance so that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics and so if you re feeling like you re consigned to you know being a barista or you know some other job that doesn t pay a lot and doesn t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it then the idea that maybe just maybe you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing so i think we should all be really understanding of that and should try to do the best we can not to be you know a wet blanket on idealism we want people to be idealistic we want them to set big goals but to take what we can achieve now and try to present them as bigger goals all right let s parse them in the first quote the first sentence is just an opener and the second critiques the trump movement the third sentence critiques the sanders people but there s nothing condescending in it maybe that whatever that means after the mention of scandinavia is a little dismissive but really now we re at the point where we re not permitting people speaking in private the occasional verbal tic of the sort we all employ then comes center left and center right it s the mention of center right that the intercept meant to rub in her face and in a perfect world i d rather she d not said it but it s quite obvious that she is contrasting herself with the movements to her left and to her right the very two movements she had just described so she was really just saying i m in between those two and who knows there were probably republicans in the room it was mclean she may have been trying to reassure them and get them to tell their friends you know we can live with her no that s not pandering it s politics if she weren t chasing responsible republican votes she d be an idiot now the second and offending graf how in the world these words can offend anyone is just absurd ok baristas but i m sure even most baristas have higher aspirations in life but the main thing is that when she says they are living in their parents basement she s obviously not making fun of them she s just describing them indeed she is explaining to these rich people in one of america s richest towns hey take a minute to understand where these folks are coming from and she s doing so the week after sanders throttled her in new hampshire a point in time when if anything she d have been prone to lash out at them there s nothing patronizing about any of this i also saw a bunch of people on twitter saying in effect for the life of me i don t see what the big deal is here i retweeted a guy who said the basementdwellers controversy is proof enough of the reason why she didn t release her speech transcripts amen to that so why is this even a thing i think chiefly because it s a hacked transcript hacked transcripts are the crack of twitter who exactly hackers who breached the email account of a campaign staffer according to the beacon country not specified and because it s hillary hoo boy hacked hillary emails there must be something there so the transcript is scoured and in fact it s disappointing but there s something there if read in negative and paranoid enough light honestly people are such babies sometimes correction saturday oct 1 7 10 p m originally this column said the daily caller first got the audio it was as corrected the washington free beacon also the beacon first published its story tuesday not thursday as this column originally said
