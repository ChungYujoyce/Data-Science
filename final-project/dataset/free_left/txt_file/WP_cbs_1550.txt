donald trump jr said tuesday in an interview on cbs this morning that there are very few people his father can fully trust now there are people that are doing great jobs he said i think mike pompeo s doing a great job i think a lot of his cabinet s doing a very good job trump jr also said president trump s personal attorney rudy giuliani is doing a good job i think it s different in that my father s a fighter right and so is rudy trump jr said federal investigators are looking into giuliani s involvement with two of his associates who were indicted for campaign finance violations he was also named in the house impeachment inquiry testimony of former u s ambassador to ukraine marie yovanovitch in the transcripts released monday yovanovitch said giuliani worked to have her removed from her post trump jr also addressed his recent claims that hunter biden tried to benefit financially from his father s position as vice president cbs this morning co host anthony mason asked him aren t you benefiting essentially from your father being president not even a little bit from that from the politics i ve benefited from my father s name i m not going to hide from that so has hunter i even can t fault him for that trump jr responded but trump jr said his family business stopped doing new deals since his father took the presidency trump jr was promoting his new book triggered how the left thrives on hate and wants to silence us gayle king we know that your father operates on his instinct and his gut outside of himself who do you think whose advice do you think he respects and trusts the most donald trump jr listen i think without question jared and ivanka are doing an amazing job i think they re getting things done and i think you know there are very few people that he can fully trust now there are people doing great jobs i think mike pompeo s doing a great job i think a lot of his cabinet s doing a very good job anthony mason is rudy giuliani doing a good job trump jr i think in his role he s outside of government that way but in his role i think he s doing a good job king he seems to be creating more problems for the trump administration trump jr again i think it s different in that my father s a fighter right and so is rudy and i think the reality is this my father has shown republicans it s okay to fight back we ve turned the other cheek as conservatives for 50 years and all it s done is allowed us to cede ground we have to fight back the same way the democrats fight and i think my father does that and i think that creates a lot of controversy because people aren t used to it trump jr i ve benefited from my father s name i m not going to hide from that so has hunter i even can t fault him for that there s a difference though when hunter biden s getting board seats coming back with 1 5 billion from china because of his father s taxpayer funded office hunter biden knows nothing about energy never invested in it in his life he gets a board in a company a corrupt ukrainian oil company in a language he doesn t speak because his father s handling that region we were international business people gayle you can vouch for that for decades and more importantly we stopped doing new deals we have deals that we were obligated to finish that we signed up in 2010 mason but you have expanded some of those deals you re expanding in scotland you ve traveled to india to indonesia trump jr we have to finish out the deals that we have that are existing we have literally a contractual we have not signed a new deal abroad since my father took the presidency now we d be able to legally we chose not to and did that publicly so as not to even create the notion of impropriety we didn t magically become international business people because of my father s office we frankly stopped our international expansion because of it and that s a big distinction that the media really likes to neglect dokoupil the thing that everyone seems to agree on in this country is that the temperature is too high people on all sides of the political persuasion they say that do you agree that the temperature is too high in this country that we re too divided and if so what are you doing to heal that divide cause it seems like you re doing the opposite trump jr listen i d love to see it get back to a place of normalcy i don t know that that exists today i mean i think when i look at what s going on when i look at sort of the media bias when i look at those things it makes it very hard for my father to do his job for example last weekend al baghdadi the leader and founder of isis was killed you can t say hey we should get back to normal when thewashington postis going around and calling the leader of isis a guy that lit people on fire in cages who throws homosexuals off buildings is an austere religious scholar you know you need some grown ups in the room there too because that s not working dokoupil i m asking you if you re interested in any kind of healing rhetoric that might bring the country closer together and you re picking a fight with thewashington post trump jr i think we re actually all pretty let live and let live so is my father but today you know it s sort of the woke goalposts they keep moving the example i use in the book is obviously as it relates to you know trans women in sports identify how you want i think it s wonderful i don t care when you start saying okay i m a man i ve become a woman i m now winning national championships setting weightlifting world records you know displacing women who ve worked their entire lives to get to a point in their careers i think that s wrong and that s the point the goalposts never stop moving mason are you interested in running for political office trump jr i m interested in winning 2020 for my father right now we ll worry about everything else later king no no no in the book you said listen i never thought i d be in politics i never thought i d be a vegan but now you admit that you ve got the political bug trump jr but i won t be a vegan i promise you mason do you see yourself running for office trump jr listen i don t ever rule anything out the reality is this right now i like the campaigning part i actually enjoy some of that fight i like getting out there and being with real people and seeing the difference that my father and his policies are making in their lives i don t know right now at this stage of my life that i would like the day job component of it watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream
