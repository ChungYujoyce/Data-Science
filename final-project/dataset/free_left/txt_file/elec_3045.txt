the big idea during their two hour debate in miami last night hillary clinton attacked bernie sanders for siding with both the castro brothers and the koch brothers the democratic front runner attacked her rival for being insufficiently critical of george w bush and excessivelyideological she also suggested that the vermont senator was supportive of vigilantespolicing the southern border and auto workers losing their jobs so much for pivoting toward donald trump and the general election clinton s surprise loss in michigan seems to have prompted another change up in her strategy her over reaction during the eighth democratic debate which was sponsored by univision and the washington post is one of four reasons that she lost 1 by throwing the kitchen sink at bernie hillary sounded nervous and even somewhat desperate certainly more so than she needs to be the former secretary of state had some very good moments connecting with an immigrant who wants to be re united with her husband and opening up about not being naturally good at politics but the night will likely be remembered for a stream of over the top attacks on her insurgent challenger that undermined the credibility of more effective and legitimate hits senator sanders stood with the minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous absurd efforts to quote hunt down immigrants clinton said at one point no i do not support vigilantes and that is a horrific statement and unfair statement to make sanders replied clinton claimed sanders only criticizes barack obama and bill clinton i wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing president george w bush she said bernie is in fact a staunch and outspoken bush critic the folly of bush s iraq war which hrc voted for is a staple of his stump speech i gather secretary clinton hasn t listened to too many of my speeches he quipped but the most disingenuous attack of the night came when clinton interjected i just think it s worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry the koch brothers have just paid to put up an ad praising senator sanders she was referring to a web video released by freedom partners part of the koch political network which highlighted sanders s opposition to the reauthorization of the export import bank just as obama did until he became president the vermont senator sees federal government backed loans to general electric and boeing as corporate welfare get the latest campaign news delivered directly to your email inbox from the daily 202 sanders protested there is nobody in the united states congress who has taken on the koch brothers who want to destroy social security medicare medicaid and virtually every federal program passed since the 1930s more than bernie sanders he said in the third person clinton then highlighted sanders s opposition to ex im which she claimed has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in florida so from my perspective she said you sided with the koch brothers the attack came just a few hours after vice news posted a story noting that fossil fuel interests have pumped 3 25 million into the largest super pac supporting clinton s candidacy and she s taken nearly 268 000 in contributions from individuals employed in the oil and gas sector so far this cycle sanders who has no super pac has received just 35 000 from people in that industry there is a tactic in high school debate called the spread it s when you throw out so many arguments that your opponent cannot possibly respond to all of them especially with the limited time they have to speak it s especially effective when your arguments are just off the wall enough that the other side has not prepared responses ahead of time then when you get a chance to respond to their refutation you zero in on whatever they dropped and hammer them for it spinning the judges on why it is crucially important to the broader topic being debated it felt like clinton was trying to do just that last night alas this is not a high school debate tournament and the winner is not determined by points or on what competitive debaters refer to as the flow by coming at him from all sides clinton s overarching message was mushy and discordant what s so baffling is that clinton did not need to go this route despite tuesday s setback in the midwest she s marching toward the democratic nomination because of her huge margin in mississippi she actually received more delegates even if she wanted to attack a lot of this dirty work is best left to surrogates or even paid advertising the post s chief correspondent dan balz calls clinton s attack on sanders for opposing the auto bailout which she first outlined during the sunday night debate in flint and then doubled down on last night a stretch at best and a deliberate distortion at worst david axelrod who was senior adviser to obama in the white house felt compelled to weigh in she did it again and i ll say it again it s misleading to imply that tarp ii was an auto bailout bill demdebate the tactic was reminiscent of the campaign s earlier claim that sanders wanted to dismantle the affordable care act and leave millions of people without health insurance balz adds an argument that no matter how one feels about his support for a single payer type system did not ring true how many democrats out there believe that bernie supports the koch brothers the minutemen and opposes obamacare and auto bailout 2 clinton s lurch to the left on immigration may hurt her in a general election pretty much every media outlet including the post leads its coverage of the debate with the candidates taking very liberal positions on immigration to appeal to latino voters in front of an expressive audience at miami dade college each candidate pledged to go further than president obama to protect immigrants in the united states without proper documentation and to give them a path to achieve u s citizenship anne gearan and john wagner write i will not deport children i do not want to deport family members either clinton pledged when pressed stop the raids stop the roundups as she often has before clinton ripped sanders for voting against the 2007 immigration bill championed by ted kennedy sanders alleged that clinton has changed her position over time when she was a senator from new york she opposed drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants and she sounded a different tune about the refugee crisis in previous interviews while clinton declined to call donald trump a racist she described his support for mass deportation and blocking muslim immigration as un american the fight over immigration could become one of the most significant issues of the general election especially if trump is the republican nominee hillary might be thinking about activating the obama coalition but coming out against enforcement actions to deal with illegal immigration could make it harder to appeal to some voters impossible to imagine a wider gap between trump position mass deportation and new dem one no more deportation whole middle gone if you re a moderate republican appalled by trump clinton not making it easy for you to defect tonight she s talking straight to dem base 3 clinton was on the defensive for much of the night facing tough questions and tenacious moderators who followed up when she dodged it s never good when you re asked about what happens if you get indicted asked if she would drop out if the justice department filed criminal charges against her for mishandling retroactively classified material on her private email server clinton said oh for goodness that is not gonna happen i m not even answering that question she vigorously denies wrongdoing on how her votes in the senate for a border fence are different from the wall trump is proposing he s talking about a very tall wall right a beautiful tall wall she joked the most beautiful tall wall better than the great wall of china that would run the entire border that he would somehow magically get the mexican government to pay for it s just fantasy the miami herald called that a shining moment for her on benghazi clinton was shown a tape of the mother of one of the four dead americans saying she believes clinton misled her about the attacks blaming an anti islam video even as she wrote a more honest email to chelsea she s wrong she s absolutely wrong clinton replied explaining that she said what she believed at the moment she said it this was complicated she said it s worth noting that moderator jorge ramos got booed by the democratic audience when he brought up the tragedy in libya and the crowd cheered clinton s response on her refusal to release the transcripts from speeches to goldman sachs let s not kid ourselves hillaryclinton can release her paid wall street speeches now or wait until the general doitnow lis smith who ran obama s war room in 2012 and worked for martin o malley earlier this cycle wrote on twitter hillaryclinton s wall street speeches are probably fairly anodyne but the longer you wait the more nefarious they seem romney many reporters were critical telltale sign when hillary starts an answer with well we know she won t answer the question 4 sanders did a much better job than he has in previous debates at pushing back on clinton bloomberg s mark halperin gave sanders an a and hillary a b on the grounds that he was consistently more precise and energetic than in the most recent debate less negative more natural more earnest and more on message than his opponent he struck many progressive chords that got the audience revved up and cheering clinton s delegate lead looms large but he showed why he is inspiring tens of millions of liberals across the country politico s glenn thrush argued that while nobody won and nobody lost there is no more disciplined candidate in the 2016 field than the 74 year old none sanders message discipline allows him to engage in politically expedient character attacks that are the staple of standard issue negative campaigning while portraying himself as a class warrior impelled only by principle paradoxically sanders biggest mistake of the campaign saying the american people don t give a damn about clinton s email server has turned out to be one of his canniest moves the fact that he turned down a free shot at the first debate has given him a permission structure to hammer her relentlessly subsequently to be sure sanders came across poorly on his answer about a 1985 tv interview in which he praised fidelcastro and nicaragua s sandinista government when moderators played the 30 year old clip recorded after he toured south america sanders claimed the castro regime has improved health care and education on the island look let s look at the facts here he said cuba is of course an authoritarian undemocratic country and i hope very much as soon as possible it becomes a democratic country on the other hand it would be wrong not to state that in cuba they have made some good advances in health care they are sending doctors all over the world the clinton campaign pounced was waiting for

headed for a long slog dan balz explains a few days ago wednesday s debate here appeared as if it might be an anticlimax as clinton rolled toward the nomination instead sanders arrived reenergized and reinvigorated after his surprising victory in michigan rather than questions about sanders s viability clinton faced questions about what had gone wrong with her campaign whatever transpires from here this is not the campaign clinton envisioned she remains the favorite to win the nomination michigan did not change that but because of that vote she faces renewed doubts about her effectiveness as a candidate there are contests next tuesday in florida illinois missouri north carolina and ohio a washington post univision news poll conducted on the eve of our debate found that clinton leads sanders 64 percent to 26 percent among likely democratic primary voters in florida a victory that big in a state as big as florida could help move the narrative back in her direction the post s fact checkers

tremendous hatred there trump told cnn s anderson cooper last night cooper pressed trump on whether he was talking about radical islam or islam itself trump replied it s radical but it s very hard to define it s very hard to separate because you don t know who s who jose a delreal michelle fields the breitbart news reporter gives her own account of the physical altercation she had at trump s tuesday night press conference in jupiter fla trump acknowledged the question but before he could answer i was jolted backwards someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down i almost fell to the ground but was able to maintain my balance fields says that the post s ben terris identified trump campaign manager corey lewandowski as the culprit i quickly turned around and saw lewandowski and trump exiting the building together no apology no explanation for why he did this even if trump was done taking questions lewandowski would be out of line campaign managers aren t supposed to try to forcefully throw reporters to the ground no matter the circumstance but what made this especially jarring is that there was no hint trump was done taking questions no one was pushing him to get away he seemed to have been happily answering queries from my fellow reporters just a moment before the daily beast s lloyd grove highlighted the mild rebuke of fields bosses at the famously trump friendly breitbart trump and his outsider juggernaut seem to be doing much more than reinventing rules and terrifying the washington establishment the reality television billionaire might also be laying groundwork for a not so brave new world in which a campaign manager can assault a female journalist while her news organization responds with a mild rebuke in a vague statement perceived by some to be designed to protect the perpetrator the breitbart statement struck sources within breitbart and outside the company as strangely inadequate given that it blames an unidentified someone uses the conditional phrase if that s the case and leaves open the possibility that lewandowski didn t lay hands on breitbart political reporter michelle fields fields who was later sporting a purple bruise as a result of the encounter had yet to hear any supportive words or anything for that matter from breitbart executive chairman stephen k bannon or editor in chief alex marlow ted cruz

remarkable data points postconservative writerjennifer rubin who has long been a rubio cheerleader says it is time for the senator tofold we say this with no joy having credited rubio with courage on immigration reform and creativity in advancing a credible domestic agenda he is by far the most electable of the remaining candidates but to get to the general election one must win the primary blame
