when buzzfeed published that now infamous dossier of unproven claims about donald trump and russia in january former hillary clinton campaign aides expressed outrage that news outletsthat had obtained the dossier before election day did not make its contents public in time to influence voters and clinton lateraired the same grievancein her book about the presidential race it turns out that the reaction of the democratic presidential nominee and her team was disingenuous the washington post reported on tuesday night that the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee helpedfund the dossier compiled by a former british intelligence officer through a law firm hired to conduct opposition research the clinton camp left out its own role in the dossier s creation as it ripped the media for sitting on information that journalists had been unable to verify what clinton and her advisers presented as their judgment that themedia had made the wrong call was in fact their frustration at having failed to plant negative news reports before ballots were cast clinton campaign dnc paid for research that led to russia dossier recall that buzzfeed published the dossier in full on jan 10 after cnn reported that the fbi had briefed president barack obama and then president elect trump on its contents many journalists criticized buzzfeed s decision arguing that news outlets should not spread claims they can t corroborate even if the fbi considers the claims significant enough to share with the president and his soon to be successor but clinton press aides brian fallon and nick merrill contended on twitter that the real journalistic malpractice was not publishing information contained in the dossier earlier this was long rumored during the campaign and many reporters know at least some of what russia was alleged to havehttps t co 3twqooyake today has brought a gush of reporting that outlets knew about and sat on prior to november 8cc glencaplin1https t co xxw7as8nl4 i repeat certain media outlets were told this prior to november 8 https t co cx63guajeb in fact if we want to get specific one outlet a very very prominent outlet threw cold water on this when slate beat them to the punch https t co g3hyquaftu merrill was referring to the new york times which reported on oct 31 2016 that the fbi had chased a lead which they ultimately came to doubt about a possible secret channel of email communication from the trump organization to a russian bank journalist franklin foer had reported on the possible secret channelin slate earlier that day also that day mother jones magazine reported that a former senior intelligence officer for a western country had provided the fbi with memos based on his recent interactions with russian sources contending the russian government has for years tried to co opt and assist trump and that the fbi requested more information from him the memos comprised the dossier that buzzfeed later published consistent with the mother jones report the times reported that intelligence officials have said in interviews over the last six weeks that apparent connections between some of mr trump s aides and moscow originally compelled them to open a broad investigation into possible links between the russian government and the republican presidential candidate still the times added throwing the cold water merrill spoke of they have said that mr trump himself has not become a target and no evidence has emerged that would link him or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to russia s election operations clinton complained about the times report in her post election book what happened note that clinton described the dossier only as having been prepared by a well respected former british spy as if the spy christopher steele had acted on his own clinton certainly gave no indication that her campaign helped finance his work there is a fundamental contradiction here clinton wanted the dossier to be viewed as credible yet she did not want to be connected to it she hoped the media before election day would publish claims about trump to which she was unwilling to attach her own name update appearing on cnn wednesday morning fallon said he personally did not know that the clinton campaign helped fund the dossier and said he was unsure whether clinton did how could you not know that the clinton team was paying for it cnn s john berman asked and didn t someone in the clinton campaign know this i m sure that there s a small group of folks that were aware fallon replied but it was kept for reasons that i can understand to a very select group according to fallon clinton may have known but the degree of exactly what she knew is beyond my knowledge fallon might be right but ignorance is a pretty weak excuse here at minimum some people within the campaign were aware of funding the dossier yet the campaign allowed spokesmen and the candidate herself to make public statements that were misleading by omission receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every day all stories linked in the newsletter are free to access by signing up
