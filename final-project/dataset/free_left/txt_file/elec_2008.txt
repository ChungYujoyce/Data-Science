advertisement supported by transcript aawsa by thomas kaplan senator bernie sanders prevailed over hillary clinton on tuesday in the oregon primary according to the associated press while mrs clinton claimed victory in a tight race in kentucky the day s other contest mrs clinton raced around kentucky in the two days before the primary hoping to fend off mr sanders in a state that she won easily in 2008 in unofficial results late tuesday night mrs clinton edged mr sanders by about 1 900 votes or less than half a percentage point with all counties reporting the associated press had not declared a winner by midnight the close result meant that she and mr sanders would effectively split the state s delegates nonetheless winning kentucky would give her a symbolic triumph that could blunt the effect of her loss in oregon as she turns her attention to donald j trump her likely general election opponent with a lead in delegates that is almost impossible for mr sanders to overcome mrs clinton is moving closer each week to claiming the democratic nomination but her march has been encumbered by mr sanders s persistence in the race and his success in recent contests including victories in indiana s primary on may 3 and west virginia s last week his continued strength has put a spotlight on her vulnerabilities as she heads toward a likely general election matchup with mr trump and on a lack of unity and even fractiousness within the democratic party last weekend bitter feelings from mr sanders s supporters spilled into view at nevada s state convention which descended into chaos prompted death threats against nevada s democratic chairwoman and raised the prospect of discord at the national convention in july in philadelphia the fury was sparked after a dispute over convention rules and delegate qualifications that supporters of mr sanders saw as unfair with mr sanders pressing on with his campaign and mr trump now the presumptive republican nominee mrs clinton has been campaigning against two opponents at once trying to defeat mr sanders in state after state while also building an argument against mr trump her task was on display as she campaigned on sunday and monday in kentucky where she spoke at a pair of black churches in louisville greeted patrons at a smoky diner in paducah and held a series of rallies where she warned about mr trump while urging voters to support her on tuesday in an acknowledgment that she was still engaged in a primary battle she faulted mr sanders for voting against the auto industry bailout a claim that is not as clear cut as she suggested it was but she was more expansive in taking aim at mr trump calling him a loose cannon and warning about his views on foreign policy which she said will be a big part of the general election i ll tell you this she told patrons at the diner on monday i m not going to give up on kentucky in november mr sanders also spent time in kentucky with rallies over the weekend in bowling green and paducah he too looked toward the general election arguing that he not mrs clinton was the more formidable candidate to take on mr trump citing polls of hypothetical matchups speaking on tuesday night at a rally in carson calif mr sanders said there are a lot of people out there many of the pundits and politicians they say bernie sanders should drop out the people of california should not have the right to determine who the next president will be an interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 democratic nomination process could unfold well let me be as clear as i can be he continued we are in till the last ballot is cast with her overwhelming support from superdelegates the party leaders who can vote as they wish mrs clinton could clinch the nomination by june 7 when six states vote or caucus including california and new jersey but mr sanders has said he would try to persuade superdelegates to back him instead based on his strength against mr trump if they want the strongest candidate to defeat donald trump bernie sanders is that candidate mr sanders said in paducah mrs clinton and her husband former president bill clinton have been treated well by kentuckians in the past mr clinton won the state in both 1992 and 1996 and mrs clinton won in a landslide against barack obama in the 2008 primary mr sanders noted that landslide on tuesday in pointing out that this year s kentucky primary ended in a virtual tie in this year s campaign mr sanders has been embraced by white working class voters and young people in many places which has raised questions about mrs clinton s ability to attract such voters in november s general election as she campaigned in kentucky mrs clinton recalled the prosperity of the 1990s and appealed to voters who have fond memories of her husband saying on sunday that he would be in charge of revitalizing the economy she also worked to recover from when she said in march we re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business mrs clinton was discussing renewable energy and she went on to say that coal miners should not be left behind but the statement has haunted her kentucky is one of the nation s biggest coal mining states and mrs clinton stressed her commitment to coal miners we can t and we must not walk away from them she said on sunday at a rally in fort mitchell i feel such a sense of obligation afterward judy gilbert 55 said she would vote for mrs clinton in tuesday s primary but asked if she thought mrs clinton would win the state ms gilbert hesitated and brought up coal mr sanders wound up doing well in kentucky s coal regions helping offset mrs clinton s advantage in louisville and lexington you know a person could say one bad thing and everybody remembers it and she can say 10 good things and nobody remembers that ms gilbert said and that s the truth in life advertisement
