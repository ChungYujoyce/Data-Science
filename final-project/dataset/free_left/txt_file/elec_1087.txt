advertisement supported by by jonathan martin and matt flegenheimer urbandale iowa senator ted cruz s leading iowa supporters say his get out the vote operation is the best they have seen for a presidential campaign here he had better hope they are right with his monthlong lead in the polls erased mr cruz s hopes for pulling out a much needed victory over donald j trump in the iowa caucuses on monday now rest in the hands of thousands of campaign workers and supporters who are spending this weekend telephoning emailing and knocking on the doors of likely caucusgoers mr cruz s campaign boasts a chairman or chairwoman for each of iowa s 99 counties captains in 1 537 of the state s 1 681 precincts and 10 000 people from this state and beyond who have volunteered to help in the final push but it is precisely whom all those cruz backers are striving to reach and reach again that illustrates the differing approaches and expectations of the cruz and trump campaigns as 46 volunteers sat making calls and eating popcorn in mr cruz s office park headquarters in suburban des moines around lunchtime on thursday bryan english mr cruz s state director described the iowans they were targeting our voters tend to be voters who vote consistently mr english said the campaign worked from lists of past caucus participants then built profiles on individual voters based on what the voters relayed as their overriding areas of interest it is a sophisticated narrowly tailored approach borrowing from the latest research in behavioral psychology the campaign gave its precinct captains talking points from which to write personal notes or to make calls telling supporters that the captains were looking forward to seeing them on monday if i know someone s looking for me on caucus night if you and i are planning to see each other on caucus night i m more inclined to go because i want to keep my commitment to you to show up mr english said the method assumes a carefully cultivated list of supporters well acquainted with what is expected of them when they show up at their precincts mr trump s campaign conversely is counting on a surge of new caucus participants with little experience of what can be a forbidding process the pamphlets he passes out at his rallies include instructions to find one s precinct online reminders that one can register as a republican right before caucusing and bullet points noting that the ballot is secret and that most caucuses take less than one hour mr cruz s supporters are skeptical that mr trump can produce a wave of new voters he is not as organized they say with striking self assurance i ve seen no evidence of and heard no supporting evidence to suggest they re running anything like this mr english said nodding toward the din of dozens of simultaneous phone conversations if this is what it takes to get regular caucus voters to go to caucus it would take this plus something in order to get people who don t a look at the latest results for iowa and new hampshire and how this year compares to previous election seasons this is now the assumption on which mr cruz s iowa campaign rests that while turnout may increase above the 121 500 who voted in the 2012 republican caucuses it will not exceed 140 000 jeff roe mr cruz s campaign manager said the operation had amassed enough committed supporters he would not say how many to withstand a swell of voters a well executed turnout effort he noted can increase a candidate s vote share from 2 5 to five percentage points as late as friday mr cruz s campaign was still trying to identify and potentially persuade additional voters rather than only call already committed supporters to urge them to caucus a sign of just how volatile the race remains in the closing days mr cruz s supporters in offices here and in northwestern iowa were making more than 15 000 calls a day with a refined list of exactly which voters they have identified as up for grabs mr roe said at a bloomberg politics breakfast on friday that there were 9 131 iowans deciding between mr cruz and mr trump 3 185 choosing between mr cruz and ben carson and 2 807 who were down to mr cruz or senator marco rubio of florida if those voters make up their minds based on how much contact they have had with the campaigns it could be enough for mr cruz the junior senator from texas to pull out a win in a monmouth university poll last week 25 percent of likely republican caucusgoers who had been contacted by a candidate and asked to caucus said they had heard from mr cruz s campaign more than any other candidate 13 percent said they had been contacted by mr trump in interviews many cruz voters reported receiving mail and phone calls recently from the cruz campaign though they did not necessarily answer those calls caller id is great said bill ellis 61 of graettinger iowa at campaign events volunteers have made the rounds with voters asking them if they planned to caucus for mr cruz and if they knew their caucus location if the voters did not volunteers offered to look it up for them many of the volunteers are staying in a dormitory known as camp cruz which has attracted hundreds of cruz enthusiasts from states as far away as texas and idaho it gives you some credibility when you say i jumped on a plane from georgia and came on my own expense said kathy hildebrand 62 of snellville ga hauling a box of iowa shaped cruz sugar cookies at a recent event they care what you think after that the main super pac supporting mr cruz keep the promise i has also been lending a hand with nine iowa workers more than some lower polling candidates actual campaigns as the campaign entered its final hours mr cruz s supporters expressed confidence in their organization i ve never seen anything like it said bob vander plaats a prominent iowa evangelical if we lose it s not because they haven t done an unbelievable job we just got beat in a strange environment advertisement
