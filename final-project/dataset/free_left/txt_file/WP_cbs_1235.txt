10 000 people to visit the volcano every year brad scott a volcanologist with gns science said the eruption was significant and sent a plume of steam and ash about 12 000 feet into the air he said it had affected the whole of the white island crater floor the geonet agency at first raised its alert level to four on a scale where five represents a major eruption it later dropped the alert level back down to three scott said that was because the eruption wasn t sustained beyond the initial blast there will be questions asked as to why tourists were still able to visit the island after scientists recently noted an uptick in volcanic activity geonet monitoring cameras captured images of tourists walking around the crater of the volcano moments before the eruption on friday but the organization later said it had removed the video clips from its website at least while rescue efforts remained underway last photos here are the white island tour operators rescuing people timestamp

zealand s south island a large group of tourists was stranded monday after heavy weekend rains unleashed mudslides that cut off a town popular for its glacier close to 1 000 tourists were stuck in the small town of franz josef after landslides and flooding cut the main highway authorities said road access likely wouldn t be restored until friday and some of the tourists were choosing to leave by helicopter or small plane while others decided to wait until the highway reopened westland mayor bruce smith said many of the 970 tourists in franz josef were taking the news in stride but some were frustrated their travel plans had been disrupted he said there were about 20 planes and helicopters flying in and out of the town to help people leave he said some tourists wanted to stay with their vehicles while others were trying to get confirmation their travel insurance would cover the extra costs of flying out they all have the option of taking fixed wing planes or helicopters smith said it s just a question of who writes the check i understand that smith said there would have been many more people stuck if the slips had occurred a few weeks later he said the summer tourist season peaks in february when the town gets about 6 000 tourists traveling through each day dan burt a spokesman for aviation tourist operator inflite said it had flown about 60 tourists from the town on monday on two planes and two helicopters it had diverted to the area he said it was charging them its normal rate of about 600 new zealand dollars 393 for the trip out burt said many tour operators and rental car companies had been good about allowing people to leave their cars behind they ve said look you get out of there and we ll worry about vehicle later burt said we re trying to make sure people have a really good experience when they fly with us we don t want their last impression of new zealand to be three days stuck in franz josef tourists typically visit the area to view the franz josef
