advertisement supported by but even as president trump acknowledged that the coronavirus has been deadlier than he had previously predicted he pressed to reopen the country by peter baker washington president trump predicted on sunday night that the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the country may reach as high as 100 000 in the united states twice as many as he had forecast just two weeks ago even as he pressed states to reopen the shuttered economy mr trump who last month forecast that fatalities from the outbreak could be kept substantially below the 100 000 mark and even as low as 50 000 acknowledged that the virus has proved more devastating than expected but nonetheless he said that parks beaches and some businesses should begin reopening now and that schools should resume classes in person by this fall we re going to lose anywhere from 75 80 to 100 000 people the president said in a virtual town hall meeting at the lincoln memorial hosted by fox news that s a horrible thing we shouldn t lose one person over this but he credited himself with preventing the toll from being worse if we didn t do it the minimum we would have lost was a million two a million four a million five that s the minimum we would have lost probably higher it s possible higher than 2 2 million the death toll passed 67 000 on sunday more than the total american deaths in the vietnam war and already higher than the president s earlier prediction more than 1 000 additional deaths have been announced every day since april 2 and while the rate appears to have peaked it has not begun to fall in a significant sustained way the model embraced by the white house a month ago had assumed the death rate would begin to fall substantially by mid april despite that mr trump indicated again that he favored lifting stay at home orders and other restrictions that have cratered the economy and put more than 30 million people out of work arguing that the government had armed itself enough against the virus to be prepared to curb any additional outbreak even after people begin emerging from their homes to re enter workplaces and other public spaces at some point we have to open our country the president said and people are going to be safe we ve learned a lot we ve learned about the tremendous contagion but we have no choice we can t stay closed as a country we re not going to have a country left mr trump asserted again that the virus would eventually fade this virus will pass he said it will go will it come back it might it could some people say yes but it will pass while he has previously expressed doubt about a second wave in the fall anticipated by public health experts he conceded that it could happen we may have to put out a fire he said the president s appearance on fox in which he sat at a distance from the hosts at the foot of the abraham lincoln statue and took questions sent by video from around the country came in the middle of a furious debate in the united states about how and when the states should begin restoring a semblance of everyday life the program was titled america together returning to work as of friday more than a dozen states had begun to reopen their economies and public life while many others had set plans to do so under certain conditions and with certain precautions in some cases over the warnings of public health specialists who feared that moving too quickly would reignite a wave of infections mr trump predicted that a vaccine would be developed by the end of 2020 which would be sooner than some public health experts anticipate and much faster than any other vaccine for such a major virus we are very confident that we re going to have a vaccine at the end of the year by the end of the year he said even if it is developed that soon though he did not say whether it could be approved and produced in sufficient quantities for widespread use by then the president confirmed that he was warned about the virus which originated in china in an intelligence briefing in january but asserted that it was characterized as if it was not a big deal he said intelligence agencies would release information about his briefings as early as monday on jan 23 i was told that there could be a virus coming in but it was of no real import mr trump said in other words it wasn t oh we ve got to do something we ve got to do something it was a brief conversation and it was only on jan 23 shortly thereafter i closed the country to china we had 23 people in the room and i was the only one in the room who wanted to close it down mr trump was referring to his decision on jan 30 to block entry by most foreign nationals coming from china a move that in fact was supported by a number of his advisers and came only after major american airlines had already canceled flights some public health advisers have said that the travel limits helped slow the spread to the united states but that the trump administration did not use the extra time to adequately prepare by ramping up testing and producing medical equipment mr trump said his travel limit which did not apply to americans or legal residents was not driven by the jan 23 warning i didn t do it because of what they said he said they said it very matter of factly it was not a big deal in forecasting the toll of the virus the white house had relied on models by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington which last month had predicted 60 415 deaths by the first week of august last week the institute increased its estimate to 72 433 by early august but now the toll looks likely to pass that number within a week it looks like we re headed to a number substantially below the 100 000 mr trump had said on april 10 that would be the low mark and i hope that bears out he said a lower number would amount to a victory for him hard to believe that if you had 60 000 you could never be happy but that s a lot fewer than we were originally told and thinking as late as april 20 he said we re going toward 50 or 60 000 people vice president mike pence and treasury secretary steven mnuchin appeared with mr trump on sunday s broadcast mr pence acknowledged making a mistake by not wearing a mask during a visit to the mayo clinic last week despite the medical center s policy because masks are meant to protect other people and he has been tested regularly mr pence said he was in keeping with federal guidelines i didn t think it was necessary he said but i should have wore the mask at the mayo clinic the fox town hall came on a day when mr trump lashed out at former president george w bush who called for national unity in a three minute video message posted on saturday let us remember how small our differences are in the face of this shared threat mr bush said in the video which was set against music and photographs of medical workers helping victims of the virus and of ordinary americans wearing masks in the final analysis we are not partisan combatants we are human beings equally vulnerable and equally wonderful in the sight of god we rise or fall together and we are determined to rise while mr bush never mentioned mr trump s name the sitting president clearly took the message as an implicit rebuke in a twitter message mr trump paraphrased a fox news personality saying oh bye the way i appreciate the message from former president bush but where was he during impeachment calling for putting partisanship aside mr trump then added in his own voice he was nowhere to be found in speaking up against the greatest hoax in american history hours later mr trump went after another predecessor reposting a tweet from a pro trump website accusing former president barack obama of plotting against him evidence has surfaced that indicates barack obama was the one running the russian hoax said the original message retweeted by the president mr bush s video message was part of a series of videos aired online as part of a 24 hour live streamed project the call to unite that also featured oprah winfrey tim shriver julia roberts martin luther king iii sean combs quincy jones naomi judd andrew yang and others mr bush s office said he had no response to mr trump s message the video was a part of an event called a call to unite said freddy ford the former president s chief of staff i hope those covering it will resist the temptation to use it as a call to divide mr obama s office had no comment advertisement
