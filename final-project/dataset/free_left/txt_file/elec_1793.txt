live coronavirus around the world by mark mckinnon we learned a lot aboutthe candidates last night but the most important takeaway is that sen kamala harris is ready for the fight and former vice president joe biden is not harris who has shown her prowess grilling everyone from supreme court justice brett kavanaugh to us attorney general william barr came out of the gate with high expectations and went on to exceed them she lit up the stage every time she spoke which was often and she came across as poised poignant and punchy with the confidence of a chief executive when everyone was shouting and arguing over each other harris like a teacher taking control of an unruly class delivered the line of the night america doesn t want a food fight they want to know how to put food on the table and she showed no fear by directly attacking biden s record on race biden who had a terrible night proved why it s a miserable job being a part of the old guard when it seems the democratic party is leaning toward diversity and a progressive vision for america his fellow democrats showed little deference and biden played defense much of the evening too often leaning on his obama crutch two lines in particular characterized the depth of his challenge defending himself on race issues he responded with a line that sounded as figurative as literal my time s up i m sorry and when rep eric swalwell reminded him of times he talked about passing the torch biden painfully and unconvincingly declared i m still holding onto that the torch translated you can have my torch when you tear it from my dead cold hands mayor pete buttigieg had a great night demonstrating why he has come from nowhere to be a top tier candidate in a field crowded with better known personalities when he speaks buttigieg sounds thoughtful and earnest without a hint of the over rehearsed soundbite that often comes with more seasoned politicians it s refreshing to hear a democrat talk about faith and values and having recently come under fire after a white officer fatally shot a black man in south bend indiana buttigieg took responsibility for the lack of diversity on the police force by admitting i couldn t get it done while many commended buttigieg for his honesty john hickenlooper took advantage of the moment by pointing out that when he was mayor of denver colorado he diversified the police force and implemented de escalation training years ago hickenlooper said the question they are asking in south bend and across the country is why has it taken so long ouch many of the candidates had a decent showing but what will be remembered after thursday night is that harris brought the fireworks while biden fizzled oh and that marianne williamson will win with love mark mckinnon is a former

for nothing at thursday night s democratic debate viewers got a look at a former vice president a few members of congress a midwestern mayor an entrepreneur a former governorand a new age guru the challenge for this diverse group was to stand out in a positive engaging way one thing was clear thesecandidates were certainly ready to take each other on as well as the current president unlike wednesday night s much more genial gathering members of this group jumped in interrupting and assailing each other s policies almost from the very start in a way you cannot blame them they had the advantage of anticipating what a few of the questions would be so they were ready to rumble the evening s star was kamala harris sheseized her moment deliveringsharp impassioned answers that did not avoid the questions looking at you bernie sanders she made easy to remember points noting that americans should only have to have one job to earn a decent living she criticized trump s tax cuts for benefiting the rich when her fellow candidates became too rambunctious she shut them all down saying america does not want to witness a food fight they want to know how we re going to put food on their table and then she took issue with biden s past position on busing offering up an anecdote that was impossible for him to defend her personal story of being a child of busing herself was the viral moment of the night hands down the runner upat this debatewas pete buttigieg he presented himself very capably more earnest new potential leader than youthful upstart the greatest disappointment was kirsten gillibrand for way too much interrupting and overtalking not a good look when you are trying to sell yourself to people who may be seeing you for the first time and let s just say that biden and sanders did not have their best nights in general all of these democrats deserve commendation for discussing immigration in a thoughtful way with policy ideas instead of ugly rhetoric whether the topic was migrant children or decriminalizing unauthorized entries everyone on the stage demonstrated that they grasp the nuances and realities of this complex issue far more than our

primary debate hosted by the league of women voters with the following declaration if we in fact have new leadership that replaces old leadership but basically going in the same direction that s just a new face or a new name for an old game jackson fell short in his bid for president but his words from 35 years ago still ring true america desperately needs a new generation of leadership and while rep eric swalwell encouraged former vice president joe biden to pass the torch the begrudging response from the senior leaders revealed that they aren t planning to loosen their grip any time soon fortunately for the democratic party sen kamala harris just might snatch that torch harris stole the show tonight and was the clear adult in the room like a true career prosecutor she was relevant and disciplined most important her policy solutions such as giving every working american up to 500 a month through a massive middle class tax cut offered the economic reassurance that families need tonight harris put to bed any concerns about her electability and proved she has the fearlessness to stand toe to toe against trump bakari sellersis a former democratic member of the south carolina house of representatives and a cnn commentator follow him on twitter bakari sellers by tara setmayer who would ve thought that the most talked about moment of a democratic presidential primary debate in 2019 would be an issue about race from the 1970s but here we are former vice president joe biden s recent ill advised comments about his ability to work with segregationists in the senate back then invoked as an example of civility and his ability to reach across the aisle have plagued his campaign for almost two weeks leading into the first debate biden s inability to put an end to the controversy opened him up to an attack that he was tone deaf on the issue of race sen kamala harris used her oratory skills as a former prosecutor to take biden to task and handily won the exchange giving her the coveted debate moment candidates yearn for whether biden s position was mischaracterized or not he has to be better prepared to fend off the predictable attacks he s going to face as the current frontrunner biden s biggest advantage is the idea of his electability and experience but if he continues to allow his opponents to have moments on the national debate stage at his expense those assets will be undercut a competition over who s more woke in the democratic primary isn t a winning strategy for the general election but if biden becomes the nominee democrats run the risk of depressing the minority vote in key states like michigan which contributed to hillary clinton s loss in 2016 heading in to the next debate biden needs to sharpen his responses and remind voters why he is best suited to defeat donald trump tara setmayer is a former gop communications director host of honestly speaking with tara podcast and a cnn political contributor by david gergen the second night of democratic debates proved even more chaotic and noisy than the first but through the din a few things did became clearer two tiers have now emerged among the candidates the first comprising joe biden bernie sanders elizabeth warren pete buttigieg and kamala harris and the second for everybody else they all turned in superior performances in these initial debates perhaps cory booker and julian castro can still move up but no one else seems likely among the top five however there may well be more fluidity biden had lots of physical vitality in his first outing but seemed occasionally slow in processing questions and he spent more time defending his past than envisioning a future whether he will wear well over the course of a year and a half on the campaign trail is simply unknowable the question arises about who if anyone among the other top four can turn this into a two person race with biden sanders seems the least likely the country just doesn t seem in the mood for a radical the other three are much more interesting possibilities warren has the most coherent thoughtful plans for the future and is a good debater harris has the most commanding presence and a dose of charisma to boot buttigieg is consistently the best at relating to a younger generation but biden showed in this first appearance that he will not easily give up the crown he is a proud man who flashed a degree of anger when challenged on his record bottom line the number of democratic candidacies will surely start to shrink by summer s end but the jockeying among the top five will likely become ever more intense while biden remains the favorite he may soon be hearing hoofbeats of more than one rival behind him david gergenhas been a white house adviser to four presidents and is a senior political analyst at cnn a graduate of harvard law school he is a professor of public service and the founding director of the center for public leadership at the harvard kennedy school by scott jennings listen closely to california sen kamala harris and she ll tell you exactly what the democrats are thinking we re a part of the government and we re here to help whether you want it or not first she admonished her fellow candidates to stop fighting hey guys america does not want to witness a food fight they want to know how we re going to put food on their table she scolded early on then came her big moment to prosecute the front runner joe biden her ambush on his position on busing should have been predictable for biden but he clearly wasn t ready and had no plan to counterattack harris on her controversial record as california s attorney general which would have been the smart play but her closing caught my attention as it recalled a sentiment she made in her food fight quip the government is going to take care of you i have what i call a 3 a m agenda that is about everything from what we need to do to deliver health care to how you will be able to pay the bills by the end of the month she started with talking about the government putting food on your table and ended with talking about the government paying your bills there was great honesty in those lines i would argue that democrats view government as a welfare state not as a vehicle to create an economic environment where families can provide for themselves this fundamental difference in the two parties will be on display in 2020 democrats have sweeping government solutions for everything and some candidates already admitted they will raise taxes to pay for it on wednesday julian castro said his health care plan would cover abortions for transgender people and tonight every democrat on stage agreed that his or her health care plan would cover undocumented immigrants these two moments sent a strong message to independent voters in swing states and i am not sure democrats are going to like how it was received harris and the rest of her cohorts gave passionate defenses of a massive expansion of the federal government even covering people who aren t citizens this sentiment will make up the core of the republican attack over the next year and a half they will raise your taxes to pay for stuff for other people period scott jennings a cnn contributor is a former special assistant to president george w bush and former campaign adviser to sen mitch mcconnell he is a partner at

harris the california senator dominated without shouting commanded the stage without interrupting and riveted the audience without setting herself on fire no one laid a glove on joe biden until harris in her controlled but forceful way hammered him for his comments about working with southern segregationists and his opposition to federally mandated busing in the 1970 s biden s defense was earnest but harris was having none of it she spoke passionately and powerfully about her own experience as a minority child who was bussed to school watching this i had the sense that harris could beat trump biden did well there were no gaffes and he showed flashes of fire he seems eager to take on trump as well mayor pete buttigieg had his best moment when speaking as a christian about how hypocritical it is for republicans to claim the mantle of religion and then put children in cages michael bennet the senator from colorado had moments of passion especially when speaking about health care and immigration and bernie sanders showed the spark that ignited his 2016 campaign i went to bed wednesday night depressed about the nine candidates on the stage who weren t elizabeth warren on thursday night i saw several democrats who could take back the white house from donald trump paul begala a democratic strategist and cnn political commentator was a political consultant for bill clinton s presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to clinton in the white house follow him on twitter paulbegala by roxanne jones joe biden may be a front runner but he sure didn t look like it at the democratic debate last night he looked tired deflected direct questions early on and no matter what he did could not handle the fire that kamala harris threw at him questions about why he opposed school busing in the 70s or why he continues to tout his ability to compromise back in the day with his racist segregationist colleagues and despite his decades of political experience biden found himself at one point drawn into a childish squabble with other candidates which led to a free for all until thankfully senator kamala harris jumped in and broke up the scrum reminding her peers that americans do not want to see a food fight on the stage they want to hear how the candidates can help them put food on the table amen sister for a minute it looked like the former vice president was back on track when he spoke about immigration and his work to not only provide health care for undocumented immigrants but to end family separations his answers were informed and focused could be that the road has been too smooth for biden so far he took his time jumping into the presidential race and was immediately rewarded with media fanfare record fundraising and an instant lead in the polls well it s a new day joe the democratic field is full of serious compelling candidates harris sen elizabeth warren and mayor pete buttigieg are gaining ground and looked strong in the first debates and they are coming for you voters are looking for a fresh conversation in the aftermath of movements like blacklivesmatter metoo the woman s march and too frequent school shootings and police killings of unarmed black and brown citizens early on many predicted that biden was the best bet to beat president trump but last night biden didn t even look or sound like he would be able to win the democratic primary the road is about to get bumpy for joe biden roxanne jones a founding editor of espn magazine and former vice president at espn has been a producer reporter and editor at the new york daily news and the philadelphia inquirer jones is co author of say it loud an illustrated history of the black athlete correction an earlier version incorrectly described pete buttigieg s title by ana navarro this second debate could not have been more different than the first it was heated it was dramatic it was rowdy and there were a lot of attacks against president donald trump and the democratic front runner joe biden if biden thought he could win the nomination by only focusing on trump and singing kumbaya when it comes to his primary opponents he got a rude awakening rep eric swalwell told biden to pass the torch sen kamala harris downright torched him she drew blood in fact the most valuable player trophy goes to harris she owned the stage she put into practice the skills she s honed as a prosecutor and as a senator biden was visibly shaken when she confronted him on issues of race and his past actions i couldn t help but imagine what it would be like to have her debate trump kamala harris is everything trump is not empathetic humane smart as hell lawful knowledgeable eloquent unifying composed adult sane not racist not misogynist not pendejo ana navarro is a
