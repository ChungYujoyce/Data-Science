at the skyrocketing number of americans who need help feeding their families all that and more is just ahead on face the nation good morning and welcome to face the nation by the end of today forty eight states will have reopened businesses or loosened stay at home orders in some form yet none of them have met the federal guidelines of having had two weeks of a declining number of cases at this point it s hard to know what the impact is yet of the reopenings either on the number of cases or on the economy cbs news national correspondent mark strassmann reports from atlanta mark mark strassmann cbs news national correspondent good morning margaret georgia is one of forty eight states to reopen this weekend every state but massachusetts and connecticut there is no question that raises the viral risk but every governor faces competing pressures begin vt mark strassmann this weekend a reopening america included beaches and parks whether it s smart whether it s safe is your judgment call this northern california restaurant defied a county order to shelter in place jeffrey letowt i ve had it so has have all my costumers so has the state of california let s open up mark strassmann crowded as it was virtually no one wore face masks chip whittpenn all the people in there sitting next to each other i mean i don t know what they re thinking mark strassmann they are thinking the economy keeps taking casualties thirty six million workers filed for unemployment in the last two months since the crisis began more than one hundred thousand small businesses have shuttered for good they re also thinking in the last two weeks america s new covid cases have declined but reopening renews worries about a resurgence andrew cuomo how you act will determine what happens to you literally crowd cheering mark strassmann behavior is the wildcard man just because everybody s doing it it doesn t make it legal mark strassmann like this scuffle in san antonio store employees confronted a customer who refused to wear a face mask texas reported its highest one day total of cases saturday with more businesses set to reopen tomorrow health experts still don t know how far the virus has spread only three percent of americans have been tested those experts credit the drop in new cases to physical distancing stay at home orders and face masks and they shutter imagining a reopened america looking like this crowded park in san francisco end vt mark strassmann reopening safely takes discipline this weekend will show whether people have it whether they respect the viral threat by following all the safety rules with memorial day weekend just ahead margaret margaret brennan mark strassmann thanks we go now to london and cbs news senior foreign correspondent elizabeth palmer elizabeth palmer cbs news senior foreign correspondent elizapalmer margaret all over the world the dilemma is the same how and how fast to lift the lockdown certainly in countries where the infection rate is declining but also in some where it s still climbing like russia begin vt elizabeth palmer moscow was doused in disinfectant as president putin announced he is planning to ease restrictions even though russia now has the second fastest infection rate in the world after the u s another epicenter is brazil where health workers and grave diggers know this is going to get a lot worse before it gets better applause elizabeth palmer but in a small victory brazil s covid belittling president bolsonaro has finally started wearing a mask sort of jair bolsonaro speaking foreign language elizabeth palmer by contrast in europe the number of covid victims is going down and things are opening up it s a calculated risk that life can return to normal or normal ish without provoking a fresh coronavirus crisis even the largest church in the world st peter s in the vatican got a final deep cleaning before its reopening tomorrow the exception is the u k man 1 wait we protest elizabeth palmer a handful of protesters did demonstrate in london yesterday against the continuing lockdown but they were outnumbered by the police and the rest of the country which is opting for continued caution on the other side of the world after a parched fifty three days pubs reopened in northern australia man 2 it s delicious and it s cold and it s the first one elizabeth palmer and in kiev nurses cared for fifty one tiny babies all of them born in the pandemic to surrogates no one wants borders to reopen more than the babies future parents who are desperate to get to ukraine to pick them up end vt elizabeth palmer and in a reminder of how persistent this virus is the city of wuhan where it originated and which almost managed to stamp it out is now going to test all eleven million of its inhabitants it s an attempt to find and isolate people who have no symptoms but are carriers before they can set off a second wave margaret margaret brennan elizabeth palmer in london thank you we want to go now to health and human services secretary alex azar he joins us from hhs good morning mister secretary alex azar secretary of health and human services secazar good morning margaret good to be with you again margaret brennan great to have you operation warp speed which is what the white house is calling this push to have a vaccine by the end of the year three hundred million doses is the promise can you be clear here is the pledge that all three hundred and twenty eight million americans will be able to get a shot in their arm by the end of the year alex azar well margaret let s be clear that s a goal and you know i i i think the gretzky s once said that you fail to achieve a hundred percent of the goals you don t set and so it s not a pledge it s a goal of what we re going to mobilize the entire u s government and private sector to achieve what happened is you know these drug companies and vaccine makers they all said it s going to take this amount of time because they re using their traditional approaches you you do phase one phase two phase three trials in sequence then you do manufacturing well the president said that s not acceptable so what we re doing is wringing the inefficiency out of the development process to make the development side faster to get to safe and effective vaccines and at the same time we re going to scale up commercial sized manufacturing margaret brennan right alex azar and produce hundreds of millions of doses at risk they may not pan out they might not prove to be safe and effective but we ll have it so we could begin administration right away margaret brennan you said hundreds of millions of doses that is not the same thing as saying hundreds of millions of vaccines ready to be administered to the american public you said this week that the entire american population could receive vaccines by january that s the goal can you alex azar that s a margaret brennan can you clarify alex azar that s it hundred hundreds of millions we have hundreds of millions of people so three hundred million is the goal and by january that we would set whether by one or multiple vaccine candidates to be able to have let s let s focus our energies margaret brennan so is this is this alex azar on actually getting those vaccines developed at this point margaret brennan absolutely i just want to set expectations for the american people because clearly you re going to have a lot of people wanting this vaccine alex azar mm hm margaret brennan will it require booster shots are you sure two three hundred million doses is sufficient alex azar well those are great questions margaret and that s actually going to be part of the development programs that you study is do is it a single shot do you have a multiple with a booster or what type of immune response do you get your that s why you don t go into battle with just one target here so we had a hundred candidates originally we ve narrowed it to fourteen and we re going to keep narrowing that down to maybe four or five six that we really place the big financial bets behind and drive on and we might actually have multiple vaccines some appropriate for different populations and different settings as we as we see the data get generated here margaret brennan president trump said on monday we have prevailed on that same day may 11th all twelve of the different models that the cdc uses projected that there will be over a hundred thousand deaths by june 1st how can the administration say we ve prevailed when you see a death rate climbing like that alex azar well margaret as as you ll remember the president clarified that in response to a question that by prevailed he meant with regard to testing by building a really novel comprehensive private public sector diagnostic system here in the united states he did not mean the disease burden here and he actually i think clarified that you could never speak of prevailing or or success when there s even a single death every death is tragic the disease burden here is here and across the world has been has been horrible we ve worked to minimize that we believe that our actions to delay and and and and flatten the curve saved hundreds of thousands of lives that otherwise could have been lost but but that s still nothing to revel in in terms of any loss of life is tragic for the president or for any of us in the public health world absolutely margaret brennan but but given that some of the states are starting to reopen parts of their economy and there s a lag time of sometimes two to three weeks before you see the virus show up how how much of a sense do you have about whether reopening is re infecting the populace at large alex azar well these will be really important questions margaret for us to study through our comprehensive surveillance system so that s why a critical part of reopening has been influenza like illness surveillance and other hospital admission surveillance as well as syndromic testing of asymptomatic individuals especially in high risk communities and that s actually what s going to be really helpful with this federal system and the approach the president s taking of having each state taking a localized decision it s going to give us really good data you know georgia margaret brennan so we don t know what risk of reopening in in other words just yet but you are going to be monitoring it is what you re saying alex azar we certainly we certainly will be monitoring but we ve seen some initial instances of states like georgia that have reopened florida that s reopening that we have not seen but again it s still early days we think the tools are there and it s also important to remember you know this gets set up as a health versus economy kind of conflict margaret brennan right alex azar it s actually health versus health we see we see suicidality we see reduction in cardiac procedures cancer screenings pediatric vaccinations there is a real a very real health consequence to these shutdowns that must be balanced against as we as we try to reopen this economy and move forward margaret brennan absolutely whistleblower doctor rick bright is going to appear on 60 minutes tonight he specifically names you in his complaint as having downplayed the catastrophic threat the last time that you were with us here on face the nation was march 1st and at that time you told me what your viewers need to know is the risk to the average americans remain low do you stand by that i mean do you take responsibility for any missteps you might have alex azar so margaret brennan taken alex azar so margaret i think if we found the entire clip because i was using words only that doctor fauci doctor redfield doctor schuchat doctor messonnier would tell me to say and would repeat publicly also i believe what i said is the risk to the average american at this time remains low but that could change rapidly we always were i was always focused on warning that the situation could change that at the moment the risk was low to any individual american margaret brennan right alex azar so i stand by that in the sense that that s what the public health people were i don t make this stuff up i go with what fauci and redfield and schuchat and messonnier and others say because they are the public health experts margaret brennan certain certainly but they report up to you the cdc has been blamed for failure and mistakes with testing do you take responsibility for that alex azar so we were confronting a situation here that s completely novel there has never been a national immediate testing regime across public and private sectors we have had to literally build this from the ground up margaret that s what that s what some folks don t quite understand here is that the cdc s role is to develop an initial fairly low throughput public health test that health labs will will do for initial diagnosis but then we count on the private sector actually to scale up these high throughput large test capacities and that s what we ve done in historic time you know these tests normally would take margaret brennan so so you don t alex azar six to nine months to get margaret brennan take responsibility for any problems that the cdc has admitted to having had alex azar we you know what did the what problem did the cdc have the cdc had an issue as they scaled up manufacturing of tests to get them out to about ninety public health labs there was apparently a contamination at an end stage there on the third part of the reagent that never led to false negatives or false positives but that prevented some of the scale up for a couple of weeks but that was never going to be the backbone of testing of broad mass testing in the united states margaret that depends on the companies like abbott and roche and thermo fisher margaret brennan well your your colleague alex azar for these high throughput tests margaret brennan i just want to clarify because your colleague peter navarro has said that the cdc let the country down margaret brennan given the cdc reports alex azar well margaret brennan up to you do you take alex azar i margaret brennan responsibility for that what do you think about that alex azar i don t believe the cdc let this country down i believe the cdc serves an important public health role and what was always critical was to get the private sector to the table margaret brennan all right mister secretary thank you for your time alex azar thank you margaret margaret brennan face the nation will be right back with the speaker of the house nancy pelosi stay with us announcements margaret brennan we go now to capitol hill and the speaker of the house nancy pelosi madam speaker good morning to you representative nancy pelosi speaker of the house speakerpelosi good morning margaret brennan i want to talk about this three trillion dollar package that you just passed but i want to quickly get your reaction to the white house one white house adviser saying that the cdc let the american people down with testing you just heard the health and human services secretary say he does not believe that is the case what do you think happened here representative nancy pelosi well margaret brennan did the cdc let the american people down representative nancy pelosi well the cdc was grossly cut in the president s budget but setting aside how we got here let s talk about how we go forward it is important for us the american people want the economy to open up we all do we want our societies to to open up we all do and in order to do that we have testing tracing treatment and isolation and that is the path it s what the scientists advise that is what we do in the heroes act we talk about how we can get there with a plan this we haven t had a plan let s go forward in a bipartisan way to have a plan a plan to test we have no idea the size of this challenge to our country because we have not sufficiently tested let s test so that we can diagnose and then we can treat and then decrease the number of people who have died imagine that ninety thousand americans almost ninety thousand americans have lost this life their lives to this awful villain we whatever our differences have to join together to fight this enemy to the lives and the livelihood of the american people ninety thousand people we send our condolences and our prayers to their families we will always carry them in our hearts margaret brennan mm hm representative nancy pelosi sadly the number is projected to even grow and then nearly a million and a half people infected so we have a common enemy and as we go forward let s do so with a strategic plan margaret brennan mm hm representative nancy pelosi a plan that has a timetable it has it has a a goal a timetable margaret brennan right representative nancy pelosi benchmarks and the rest to get the job done for the american people margaret brennan i want to ask about your plan because as you just mentioned that heroes act is the three trillion dollar bill that you just passed republicans are looking at a different deadline say that the enhanced unemployment benefits that exist now don t expire until july let s see what reopening looks like and what a new package should be tailored to why do you think there s not merit to that argument that a few more weeks before crafting a bill could be more effective representative nancy pelosi no time is of the essence and we passed our proffer what we put forth in the past bills they ve put forth their proposal and then we worked in a bipartisan way that s what we all anticipate now across the country republican and democratic mayors governors and the rest all want this bill to happen in terms of the investments in state and local and tribal and territorial governments and also in terms of the testing to be done across the country largely at the state level time is very important we have lost time but again setting aside how we got here we cannot take a pause they may think it s okay to pause well people are hungry across america hunger doesn t take a pause people are jobless across america margaret brennan mm hm representative nancy pelosi that doesn t take a pause people don t know how they re going to pay their rent across the country we have we have to address this with humanity with humanity margaret brennan has there been any has there been any republican response any counter offer or opening to begin negotiations since you passed this bill which the white house says has no chance of becoming law representative nancy pelosi that isn t so we and no bill that is proffered will become law without negotiation so yeah but again with the other bills we had four bills all bipartisan the bill that leader mcconnell put forth the cares one was his offer nobody says doesn t have a chance because he just put it forth margaret brennan mm hm representative nancy pelosi the interim ppp bill was his offer we margaret brennan has he reached out to you representative nancy pelosi well we just passed the bill within a matter of a matter of hours ago but i do have confidence i have confidence because the american people and the governors and mayors as i ve said in a bipartisan way know that we have to support our local government that s where our health we have health care workers police and fire first responders in other words emergency our teachers our sanitation workers you know they re at risk of losing their jobs margaret brennan mm hm representative nancy pelosi many of these people risk their lives to save lives and now they may lose their jobs and margaret brennan repub representative nancy pelosi by the way i think it s important to note that everything sounds like a big number but everything that we have in the state and local column there is less than the republicans put in their tax scam to give eighty three percent margaret brennan are you are you open to representative nancy pelosi of the benefits to the top one percent margaret brennan liability protections for employers that s what republicans say is their red line to get what you want what will you give on that representative nancy pelosi well we have no red lines but the fact is the best protection for our workers and for their employers is to follow very good osha mandatory guidelines and we have that in our bill and and that protects workers protects their lives as well as protects the employer if they follow the guidelines remember when people go to work they go home they could bring it home to their children margaret brennan yeah representative nancy pelosi or they could bring it home to a senior living in their home there is a this is beyond just the individual at work margaret brennan madam speaker late friday president trump sent you a letter saying that he was going to remove the inspector general of the state department steve linick this is the fourth ig to be removed in six weeks why was linick removed what s behind this representative nancy pelosi well this is new to us and typical of the white house announcing something that is very unsavory they would do it late on a friday night the fact is as you indicated it s the fourth inspector general inspectors general that office was created after watergate to make sure that there was integrity in the departments the agencies of government they re supposed to show cause even republicans in congress are concerned about and have spoken out margaret brennan was he investigating the secretary of state when you say unsavory is that what you mean representative nancy pelosi well i mean unsavory when you take out someone who is there to enforce the to stop waste fraud abuse or other violations of the law that are they believed to be happening so again let s take a look and see the president has the right to fire any federal employee but the fact is if it looks like it s in retaliation for something that the attorney the ig the inspector general is doing that could be unlawful margaret brennan was he investigating the secretary of state as eliot engel has said speaker pelosi i trust the word of my chairman again i ve just passed a big bill and i i only got this letter from the president that night but he didn t say in his letter any reason except that he lost confidence well he s lost confidence in other igs because they had been investigating or looking have reason to believe that something should be margaret brennan okay representative nancy pelosi investigated that he is doing i really do margaret brennan understood representative nancy pelosi think that presidents should not have the ability margaret brennan madam representative nancy pelosi to undo investigations into their own actions margaret brennan madam speaker thank you very much for joining us today we have to leave it there representative nancy pelosi my pleasure thank you so much thank you margaret brennan we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan ahead a preview of 60 minutes interview with the chairman of the federal reserve we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan we ll be back with former white house economic advisor gary cohn and former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb announcements margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation last week another three million americans filed for unemployment retail sales and factory output recorded record declines signs of the economic damage from coronavirus tonight on 60 minutes scott pelley talks with the most powerful man in the finance world federal reserve chairman jerome powell here s a preview begin vt scott pelley 60 minutes what economic reality do the american people need to be prepared for jerome powell 60 minutes well i would take a more optimistic cut at that if i could and that is this is a time of of great suffering and difficulty and it has come on us so quickly and with such force that you you really can t put into words the the pain people are feeling and the uncertainty they re realizing and it s going to take a while for us to get back but i i would just say this in the long run and even in the medium run you wouldn t want to bet against the american economy this economy will recover it may take a while it may take a period of time it could stretch through the end of next year we really don t know scott pelley can there be a recovery without a reasonably effective vaccine jerome powell assuming there is not a second wave of of the coronavirus i think you ll see the economy recover steadily through the second half of this year for the economy to fully recover people will have to be fully confident and that that may have to wait the arrival of of a vaccine end vt margaret brennan scott s full interview with the fed chairman airs tonight on 60 minutes we go now to gary cohn he is the former director of the national economic council under president trump he joins us from long island new york good morning gary cohn former national economic council director gary d cohn good morning margaret margaret brennan you just heard the federal reserve chairman say no full recovery until there is a vaccine is the logical extension of that that there will be widespread unemployment well into next year gary cohn so first of all i thought chairman powell did a very good job of summarizing the economic situation with some optimism and saying look if we don t get a second outbreak in the fall which is just predicted we don t know if that will happen or not that we we will continue to grow our economy and our economy will continue to have a natural recovery so and he was quite optimistic and and i am quite optimistic the u s economy is quite resilient and i and i have to remind people that we ended up in this economic situation by necessity we made a conscientious decision to shut down our economy and have everyone stay home to flatten the curve margaret brennan right gary cohn which was the right decision but we created this economic situation we can unwind this much more quickly than some of the comparisons that we were making in time where we re where there were situations where our unemployment data happened over a long period of time margaret brennan right gary cohn because of declining employment declining sales margaret brennan but the but the counter to that is there are people in immediate and severe pain now i mean the fed revealed this week that forty percent of people making under forty thousand dollars a year lost their jobs in just one month in march gary cohn yeah margaret brennan i mean we re hearing about food insecurity the fed chair pointed to congress and you just heard the speaker of the house say time is of the essence do you agree with her that more emergency aid needs to happen now or can you wait as republicans want to do gary cohn so i think i agree with fifty percent of what the the speaker was saying so part of the heroes act was to get money or is to get money to the states to the state and local government and i do think that is very important the state and local governments have been hard hit the last thing we want to see is state and local governments in our time of need having to lay off firemen policemen teachers first responders front line people that we re reliant upon for our everyday life that would be the complete wrong outcome here so the federal government does have to step in and help out states just like they ve helped small businesses and big bus big businesses they should help the states that doesn t mean they should re return the states to perfect financial condition on the other half of the bill and and you didn t ask me about that there is some things in there that are much more aimed at a a recovery than the current position we re in in addition to that if we really want to get the people back to work that chairman powell was talking about we need to reopen the economy those people earning less than forty thousand dollars a year are very important and we rely on them but think about the health care system the health care system is twenty percent of our gdp if we get our health care system back up and running a lot of people in the lower wage bracket end up working in the health care system we need that to happen margaret brennan so gary cohn if we get people going back to work think of what it means to go back to work margaret brennan sure gary cohn you get in your car you drive you go to the gas station margaret brennan but it s not it s not an either or it s not an either or it s a how right and part of what gary cohn it margaret brennan congress will be doing is figuring that out policy wise the administration is floating the idea of a payroll tax cut slashing the corporate tax rate suspending capital gains on assets bought between now and the end of the year how does any of that help the people who are in pain now gary cohn well look margaret we have to decide where we are are we responding to the crisis or are we trying to stimulate a recovery and look this is a very difficult situation because the federal government sits on top and then each state is going to decide what we re doing if we re trying to respond to the crisis we re right and this is where i agree with the speaker we have to get the states money to help them respond to the crisis if we re trying to stimulate economic growth which would be the second half of the equation we would use a different set of tools to stimulate economic growth and we have a huge toolbox of tools we can use to stimulate economic growth margaret brennan but but those specific proposals payroll tax cuts lowering the corporate interest rate does that do any of what you re talking about gary cohn well look payroll tax cuts puts money in the pockets of people who are working margaret brennan right gary cohn right now we re talking about the unemployed people margaret brennan exactly gary cohn payroll tax cut doesn t help an unemployed person so i am not in favor of a payroll tax cut margaret brennan so what are you saying are you saying more direct gary cohn i mean i am in favor of getting people back to work margaret brennan okay but are you also saying more direct aid to people because one of the questions around extending unemployment benefits as they are now is this unintended consequence of people actually sometimes making more gary cohn exactly margaret brennan on unemployment than if they take the option to go back to the employer that maybe furloughed them so what s the solution there gary cohn so margaret look i think you just hit on a very important concept when we first started the enhanced unemployment benefits we did it for a specific purpose purpose we wanted to and we needed to get people out of the economy we needed them to stay home so we changed the definition of unemployment we said look stay home don t look for a job we don t want you to leave your house now i think we have to go back to the more traditional definition of unemployment if you re unemployed you get benefits but if you need to be looking for a job and if you get offered a job you should have to take that job and you should come off of unemployment benefits we need to transition out of the extraordinary measures that were justifiable sixty days ago ninety days ago into the the real world margaret brennan mm hm gary cohn of what is the the continuous definition of unemployment margaret brennan two things do you think equity markets are behaving rationally and are you accepting the idea that the tax cuts that you personally helped usher through for the trump administration may have to disappear as so many on wall street are predicting to pay for all this gary cohn well first of all i have i have said it and i ll say it again we now understand that we have to be in the positions of federal government to spend two to five trillion dollars at a moment s notice to support our infrastructure and support our economy that said we need to sit down to look at both sides of the equation we need to sit down and look at the revenue side of the equation and we need to look at the expense side of the equation so i would say yes that the tax situation in the united states has to be readjusted everything should be on the table margaret brennan okay gary cohn but remember at the expense side of the equation everything should be on the table as well as far as the stock market goes remember the stock market is margaret brennan so so your tax cuts you mean you accept would likely have to go away gary cohn so so i think everything is on the table and and remember remember mar margaret i think the tax cuts are completely misconstrued we gave big tax breaks to to lower income earners and we taxed higher income earners and in fact in the heroes bill you ll see they re trying to roll back the salt deduction the salt deduction margaret brennan right gary cohn was a way that we taxed most of the higher earners only the top thirty percent of earners really use the salt deduction they are the ones that own the big homes and pay the big real estate taxes and pay big state income taxes then they re using that deduction rolling that deduction back does not make sense right now when the federal government needs money in in this environment on the stock market look the stock market margaret brennan yeah gary cohn is very forward looking and i think the stock market like chairman powell is fairly optimistic of where we re going to get to and and and there is a path forward margaret brennan okay gary cohn and i will remind people it s also it s made up of the largest companies in america margaret brennan right gary cohn and a lot of those companies have actually become more essential to our daily lives today not less essential margaret brennan all right gary cohn if there were an index of small local businesses margaret brennan okay gary cohn i think that index would be trading at depressed values margaret brennan gary cohn thank you for joining us we have to leave it there we ll be back gary cohn margaret announcements margaret brennan we re back with former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb who joins us from westport connecticut good morning scott gottlieb md former fda commissioner scottgottliebmd good morning margaret brennan you heard secretary azar say hundreds of millions of people three hundred million doses of a vaccine by january is that realistic scott gottlieb well first we have to remember that the doses probably we have to cut it in half because many of these vaccines and sanofi has already spoken to this you re going to probably need two doses of the vaccine so whatever supply we have is probably sufficient to actually dose and inoculate about half the number of people i think our expectation should be that we re going to have millions of doses of vaccine available in the fall to do large phase three clinical trials maybe low tens of millions of doses if multiple manufacturers make it through phase one phase two studies and we might make them available under an emergency use authorization if we do have outbreaks or an epidemic in the fall for certain high risk groups another thing to consider is that these vaccines may not be completely protective what they may do is prevent you from getting covid the disease and from getting severe pneumonia but you may still get the infection so you may still be able to get and transmit the infection but you just won t get as sick and that may be how these vaccines ultimately are used and so what you might do in that situation if we do have an epidemic is use the vaccines on people who are really high at high risk of a bad outcome like people maybe in a nursing home but i think our base assumption should be that we ll have millions of vaccines maybe low tens of millions of vaccines if multiple manufacturers are successful in those early studies margaret brennan so three hundred and twenty eight million americans eight billion people in the world they re going to want this overnight what you re saying is that s not happening by january period scott gottlieb well remember it takes it takes a while to manufacture a vaccine and then once you manufacture it you have to do stability testing so you don t just manufacture a vaccine and roll it off the line and then send it out into the public to be to have people inoculated with it you re going to hold it you do stability testing so you make sure the vaccine is appropriate for use in 2009 with h1n1 when we went to make that vaccine so we had the vaccine construct it worked well in the laboratory and in small scale studies when we went to scale up the manufacturing we found we weren t getting good yield with it and we actually lost about two months in that process of trying to make that vaccine in time for the fall so a lot of things there s a lot of uncertainties as you go from vaccines that you re manufacturing on a smaller scale in a in an experimental fashion in early stage studies when you try to scale up and get volume so a lot of things can go wrong a lot of things can be delayed it s very hard to get to the point where you re manufacturing at high high quantities i would say that s probably more likely a 2021 event that we re going to have the vaccine available in sufficient quantities to mass inoculate the population and remember there might be two hundred million people who want this vaccine who are eligible for it that might take four hundred million doses and so it s probably a 2021 event i do think we ll have the vaccine available in the fall for use maybe to ring fence an outbreak if you have an outbreak in a large city or to inoculate a certain portion of the population on an experimental basis to protect them because they re at high risk of a bad outcome margaret brennan we re learning more about this virus including the potential risk to children what would you tell parents who are concerned about these reports out of italy the u k and now the u s that young children are being affected scott gottlieb look the reports are deeply concerning there appears to be some kind of post viral syndrome associated with this virus the who and the cdc have now stepped forward and said they ve associated with this virus although it s not definitive the causal relationship it appears to be some kind of post viral immune type phenomena we see this in other kinds of viruses what we don t know is the denominator we don t know how many kids have actually had the virus is it hundreds of thousands of millions of children that have had the virus and we re seeing you know maybe a hundred or two hundred of these cases or have only thousands of kids had the virus and we re seeing hundreds of cases that would be deeply concerning if the incidence was that high this was first detected by the british april 26th the italians have reported on a cluster and then new york city doctors and health officials were the first to report on a cluster here in the united states they ve now reported on more than a hundred of these cases and three tragic deaths but again we don t know that denominator of how many kids are getting infected there was a study in science magazine about two weeks ago that said that children are probably a third as likely to get infected with coronavirus as adults so that means that kids are getting infected but probably at a much lower rate than adults but they re still getting infected and if you figure maybe upwards of twenty million people in the u s margaret brennan mm hm scott gottlieb have had the infection at this point and that s possible that means a lot of kids might have had it as well margaret brennan well i know the cdc did put out some guidance on that this week saying call your pediatrician if your kid has any of the rashes like we just showed you on the screen scott gottlieb right margaret brennan but on the the issue of the cdc you you said before on this program the cdc needs to be sharing more information than they are in terms of what doctors are are seeing and learning there need to be more specific guidelines for businesses and schools you heard a white house adviser say the cdc failed the country on testing this morning alex azar disagreed with that the health and human services secretary how how do you assess what is happening at the cdc right now scott gottlieb well i disagree with that assessment as well about the diagnostic test even if the cdc had rolled out that test perfectly there still wouldn t have been enough testing in place in the nation to do what we call sentinel surveillance to try to detect this virus earlier what needed to happen was someone needed to pick up the phone and call the ceos of labcorp and quest and the other big labs probably sometime in january or at least in early february and get them spun up margaret brennan who would that person have been scott gottlieb because they re the only ones who margaret brennan the health and human services secretary or the fda commissioner scott gottlieb it would have been it would have been one of those two it would ve been someone within hhs to ask them to spin up tests and if they had asked the ceos to do that i m i m willing to bet that they would have done it and you would have gotten the big labs in the game that s what needed to happen as far as cdc is concerned i mean i think the part of the agency where i think there could be more information is trying to catalog the collected clinical experience we ve now had more than a million people infected with this in the united states probably tens of millions of people infected we ve had hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations ninety thousand deaths we haven t seen a really definitive systematic accounting of the collected clinical experience with those patients and their outcomes and what interventions were used on them this is what cdc does puts out this information is setting a public health emergency so can inform what we re doing we re learning a lot of this by word of mouth with physicians even on twitter that there that people have coagulopathy so their blood s clotting we re learning that maybe you shouldn t be ventilating patients on respirators as aggressively as we were we re learning that many patients are getting blood clots to their lungs and that s what may be causing some of the rapid decompensation margaret brennan mm hm scott gottlieb now we re learning about this pediatric syndrome so we re learning a lot that should be coming from the cdc i think that s where we can be doing much more putting out this information and the guidelines are a separate matter margaret brennan okay scott gottlieb i think the more that cdc puts out very detailed guidelines the better businesses can restart margaret brennan all of us want more facts thank you doctor gottlieb appreciate it scott gottlieb thanks a lot margaret brennan we ll be back in a moment announcements margaret brennan among the many disturbing pictures that we ve become accustomed to seeing since the pandemic started are those of people seeking help feeding their families the lines at food banks have been shocking the numbers are too in april more than one in five u s households reported not having sufficient resources to buy food that number increased to two in five households forty one percent for mothers with children twelve and under we go now to dallas and claire babineaux fontenot she is the ceo of feeding america the nation s largest hunger relief organization good morning to you claire babineaux fontenot ceo of feeding america good morning margaret brennan we ve heard the statistics in terms of who is most vulnerable and how hard they are getting hit we also know that food prices had their biggest spike in decades just last month this seems like the perfect storm what are you seeing at your facilities right now who is coming and what do they need claire babineaux fontenot well margaret i think you use the right term it is in fact the perfect storm we re seeing a marked increase in demand to the tune of on average sixty percent more people showing up in need of our services and at the at the time that we re having that increase in demand we have a decrease in donations we have an increase in cost of food and we have a decrease in volunteers so it is in fact a perfect storm margaret brennan how re claire babineaux fontenot so many of the people who are coming oh i m so sorry please finish margaret brennan yes no please so how are you managing that and and is is the person that you are serving now as challenging as it is different from what you saw just a few months ago is it a different demographic claire babineaux fontenot yeah that s exactly what i was going to say that forty percent on average of the people that we re seeing now have never relied upon the charitable food system before now so we re definitely seeing different people showing up so many of the people who are there they re kind of familiar to us some of the people who were donors are now in line in need of our services so there s been a change to be sure but one of the things that i think the american public simply wasn t aware of is that even before this pandemic there were nearly forty million people who were food insecure and over eleven million of them were children so we ve had a challenge for a while this pandemic has just heightened that challenge and a lot of people are in need of help right now margaret brennan i know things like diapers aren t covered by food stamps are are items like that what you need at your facilities what are you looking for right now to serve in particular those children claire babineaux fontenot well we need a a whole host of things first and foremost we need food so what we have done is we ve had a remarkable outpouring of support from across the country in in terms of dollars so that we can purchase food we ve also had some assistance from the congress and some of the legislation that s that s already been passed some help from the administration in the form of deregulation so that we re able to provide that food in a new way but there continues to be a need i i don t know that i mentioned that so far the members of our network just since march have provided over a billion meals to people facing hunger but our estimates are that over the course of the next twelve months that the need just inside of our system is over eight billion so big need and across all of those indices that you just described absolutely margaret brennan brookings said one in five american children are going hungry i know you just told us about the pain you re seeing particularly with kids forty one percent of mothers with children s ages twelve and under report food insecurity what is it i ve read that you need food and items from manufacturers claire babineaux fontenot yes margaret brennan not necessarily from individuals explain what s changed what do you mean by that claire babineaux fontenot well i i don t know that i would i would limit it just to to manufacturers so maybe the best thing for me to do is to start from the top and say what the hierarchy are of things that we think are absolutely essential right now you mentioned snap just a few moments ago margaret brennan food stamps claire babineaux fontenot truly snap is the yeah formerly known as food stamps thank you for that for every one meal that we re able to provide in the charitable food system snap can provide nine and one of the interesting things about snap is not only is it good for people right now in the mid in the middle of a pandemic and an emergency but it s also good for the economy we have data that shows that for every dollar invested in snap the return is a dollar seventy so there are lots of good reasons for all of us to be thinking about and urging our members of congress to pass additional legislation so that we can increase access to snap and so that we can increase the thresholds in terms of how much people can receive from snap so that s that s first and foremost secondly as i mentioned before we we re doing by the way may i take the opportunity to just acknowledge the remarkable people in this network and in other non profits as well who are really stepping up to this challenge margaret brennan mm hm claire babineaux fontenot and providing these services to people when they need it but the gap hasn t closed we ve done we we did some analysis that showed over a six month window our analysis showed that in our network alone that the gap was about 1 4 billion that assumed margaret brennan so those three billion that the usda is doing in terms of taking food from farmers and bringing it to banks that s not solving the issue claire babineaux fontenot well it s helping and we hope it will help it s early days and we re going to do everything in our power to make that program successful margaret brennan okay claire babineaux fontenot because an additional three billion dollars in food would would certainly be helpful right now but the gap still won t be closed even with that effort so my encouragement to your audience and to members of congress and the administration margaret brennan i understand claire babineaux fontenot and people all across the country is let s just keep trying to help margaret brennan yes claire babineaux fontenot and we can close this gap together margaret brennan we agree with you thank you so much we ll be right back announcements margaret brennan that s it for today thank you for watching for face the nation i m
