the expected timings of results all you need to know about the key battleground states plus drinks eats and tunes to get you through what could be a long night by adam gabbatt and tom mccarthy tue 8 nov 2016 10 00gmt last modified on tue 28 nov 2017 11 51gmt to become the 45th president of the united states hillary clinton or donald trump has to win 270 electoral college votes the candidates have spent what feels like 100 years locked in mortal combat but in the next few hours there will finally be a victor well probably if there s a 269 vote tie or a mandatory recount prepare for constitutional chaos each state is assigned a certain number of electoral votes ultimately based on its population california has the most with 55 seven states alaska delaware montana north dakota south dakota vermont and wyoming have just three electoral votes washington dc gets three too while there are 50 states in the us most of these are safely republican or democrat they vote the same way every time going back at least six elections so the presidential election boils down to just a handful of swing states the 10 or 11 states that have a recent history of selecting both republicans and democrats this is why voters in places such as ohio florida iowa north carolina virginia nevada colorado and new hampshire are subjected to a barrage of television advertising and campaign stops it s also why you have not seen clinton and trump holding rallies in louisiana safely republican or washington safely democratic trump faces a much more difficult path to victory he needs to win almost all of these swing states to become the next president whereas if clinton wins two or three she wins the race this is because democrats start from a stronger position there are 18 states plus dc that have voted for a democrat for president in every election since 1992 that batch amounts to 242 electoral votes there are only 13 states that have voted for a republican in every election since 1992 those states carry just 102 electoral votes if clinton simply wins all the states that have voted for her predecessors in the recent past then adds florida which has 29 electoral votes she is the next president if she loses florida but wins say virginia and north carolina she will be the next president trump needs to hold on to all the historically republican states win states such as georgia and arizona which are usually republican but where he has struggled in the polls and then win enough swing states to tip him over 270 for our international readers following along across europe and beyond a little light math for you in the uk ireland iceland and portugal add five hours to et anywhere else from poland west add six hours in eastern europe add seven hours australia add 16 hours and so on buckle in because now the real fun begins polls close in eastern kentucky and most of indiana parts of each state are on central time so the polls there close at 7pm et mike pence trump s running mate is the governor of indiana in the past 50 years the state has voted democrat only once for barack obama in 2008 in some states we will know the winner almost immediately after the polls close most news outlets including the guardian rely on the associated press to call races ap is able to announce the winners so quickly because it deploys thousands of people on election night to collect results from states counties and locales as they are announced it also uses exit polls and voting history solidly democratic or republican states are likely to be called quickly swing states are likely to take longer election drinking donald trump doesn t drink but donald trump doesn t have to worry about the prospect of a donald trump presidency a nice way to toast and mock if you were minded to do so the 70 year old builder might be to mix up a the donald cocktail as you settle in for the night it s got vodka goldschl ger gold leaf cinnamon schnapps and orange juice but the most fun bit is the cotton candy on top doesn t it look just like his hair election fuel it could be a long night or a short one but at this stage we likely do not yet know so our advice is to fuel yourself for a marathon not a sprint and you can feed yourself and honour ohio s prominent role in us elections by preparing a cincinnati chili it s a more mediterranean take on your traditional chili brought to cincinnati by macedonians in the 1920s if you re drinking more than one of the donald cocktails you will want to line your stomach election soundtrack rolling stones you can t always get what you want a perfect kick off to election night given that both candidates are incredibly unpopular with the american public trump likes the rolling stones and played this song at his rallies the rolling stones do not like donald trump and asked him to stop he didn t voting ends in three key swing states virginia florida and new hampshire where a minimal number of polling stations may stay open until 8pm et florida s 29 electoral college votes have proved crucial in the recent past al gore can tell you that he narrowly lost the state some still believe he actually won and the election to george w bush despite winning the national popular vote away from the top of the ticket florida senator and one time republican presidential candidate marco rubio is up for re election he has been running a bit ahead of democrat patrick murphy in the polls debbie wasserman schultz who resigned as chair of the democratic national committee in july after leaked emails showed the party favoring clinton s campaign is expected to comfortably win re election to congress virginia was a reliably republican state until obama won there in 2008 and again in 2012 the state s mix of less educated rural voters wealthy suburbanites federal government employees and military families academics jet setters and so on make it difficult to read but clinton has been decisively ahead this year new hampshire has been won by a democrat in five of the past six presidential elections but the granite state gave trump his first big primary win and recent polling here has shown a tight race other states closing at 7pm et include south carolina and vermont bernie sanders home state sanders won the democratic primary in vermont by an amazing 73 points but now he s with her election drinking supercall com has a cocktail called hillary s dirty little secret it s a vodka martini with hot sauce in it a reference to an interview in april where clinton said she always carried a bottle of hot sauce you could quip to your friends that it s a perfect choice as the race is beginning to heat up polls close in west virginia north carolina and ohio expect the result from west virginia very quickly trump should win easily north carolina and ohio are swing states and will take longer ohio has been seen as a reliable bellwether state voting for the presidential winner in every election since 1964 that run might be coming to an end however either because of the state s changing demographics or because of the strangeness of the current contest in terms of the unfavorability of both candidates while its demographics are complicated a mix of rust belt big cities appalachia farmland and more the ohio electorate has grown more white and less educated than the national mean that trend appears to account in part for trump s strength in the buckeye state this year election soundtrack the pretenders message of love because chrissie hynde is was born in akron ohio you could also make a point about spreading a message of love or of someone pretending to spread a message of love not that we re questioning in any way at all how much politicians love the voters in 2012 the associated press called the indiana result just before 8pm vigo county which borders illinois in west indiana is seen as the ultimate bellwether it has voted for the winner of every presidential election in 30 of the past 32 elections dating back to 1888 keep an eye out for its result a big swing state closes its polls at 8pm pennsylvania republicans have long dreamed of winning pennsylvania s 20 electoral college votes based on growing support among once flourishing manufacturing and mining sectors in the south western and north eastern corners of the state but clinton has been creaming trump in polls in philadelphia and its suburbs which is where most of the people live and she has been comfortably ahead in statewide polls for months pennsylvania will also be under scrutiny on election day because of trump s controversial claims that there has been voter fraud in philadelphia in the past and his calls for volunteer election monitors the results in non swing states will start to come in thick and fast connecticut delaware illinois maryland massachusetts mississippi missouri new jersey and rhode island all close at 8pm et and we can expect ap to call all these states pretty much immediately maine s polls also close at 8pm it is one of only two states the other is nebraska where voting finishes at 9pm that splits its electoral votes according to congressional district the state as a whole is likely to vote democrat but trump may steal an electoral vote in maine s second district which is made up of more rural voters election fuel there s a whole chefs for hillary page on pinterest a tribute to clinton s attempts to win the foodie vote one of the recipes is provided by john podesta the chairman of clinton s campaign it s called salsa di noci and is basically nuts and pasta but arranged into a large h shape the polls in georgia close at 7pm or 8pm depending on location in the 2012 election mitt romney was declared the winner just before 8 30pm a democratic candidate hasn t won in georgia since proper southern boy bill clinton in 1992 but strong support for hillary clinton in georgia counties with a high african american population and in atlanta have made her a threat to trump if clinton wins georgia trump might as well concede don t hold your breath election tunes marvin gaye inner city blues make me wanna holler the african american vote is in and trump gets a big 1 polls close in two traditional swing states wisconsin and colorado and in arizona which is usually firmly republican but is swingy this year an increasingly influential hispanic bloc and mormons who can t stand trump not to mention a superior democratic ground game mean that clinton has a decent chance of becoming the first democrat to win arizona since her husband in 1996 when the polls close in new york at 9pm et they will have been open for 15 hours the longest polling window of any state barring an almighty upset clinton will quickly be declared the winner wyoming louisiana north and south dakota kansas and texas all close at 9pm too the networks should swiftly call these for trump unless loose talk of clinton taking texas which last went democratic in the watergate era comes true if it s that kind of night water the horses and go to town nebraska which like maine splits its electoral votes by congressional district shuts its polls at 9pm et barack obama won nebraska s second district omaha in 2008 clinton could do the same this year thanks to a well financed get out the vote effort spearheaded by susan buffett daughter of warren election fuel new york cheesecake hillary clinton was born in chicago but was a senator from new york for eight years donald trump was born in queens new york before inheriting his father s successful real estate business in january trump claimed his popularity was such that he could stand in the middle of fifth avenue in new york city and shoot somebody without losing voters trump has been trailing clinton by 20 in new york election soundtrack fleetwood mac silver springs i know i could ve loved you but you would not let me laments arizona s stevie nicks might trump be thinking the same thing when the grand canyon state s results come in given clinton s apparent strength in pennsylvania we may see the state called for her by 10pm or in a deeply troubling upset for her trump may win the new hampshire result should also come in around this time they will offer one of the first concrete indications of how the night is going nevada and iowa are the final swing states to close their polls in the past two elections iowa was called quickly for obama montana and utah also close at 10pm both are traditionally safe republican states but trump s unpopularity means independent evan mcmullin who s from utah has a strong chance of becoming the first non republican or democrat to win electoral college votes since 1968 utah has been called soon after the polls close in the recent past if mcmullin is declared the winner it s a good sign that the night is truly in uncharted territory terra incognita in the most exciting way former congressional staffer evan mcmullin buckle up america more election drinking yuengling brewery the oldest brewery in the us is based in pennsylvania its owner came out in support of trump in october a move which has seen some drinkers boycotting the beer you could however source some craft ale from the victory brewing company also based in pennsylvania we might be getting an idea of who will be victorious around this time election soundtrack neon trees your surrender it s almost definitely not about conceding a presidential election but if trump fails to win utah neon trees home state then he might want to think about surrendering to clinton polls in california hawaii oregon and washington close at 11pm et these are all safe democrat states that are unlikely to unexpectedly impact the outcome back in 2012 the associated press called the swing states of colorado iowa north carolina and ohio worth a combined 48 electoral votes in the space of 30 minutes at around 11pm then declared obama s re election at 11 38pm in 2008 networks announced obama had won just after 11pm we might know the outcome sooner this time or we might not know for a while if clinton s lead in opinion polls translates to the actual polls then we may see states called for her earlier on the back of strong early voting results if enough swing states are called quickly we could find out the result before 11pm et or if trump proves the polls wrong the race could as quickly run to him separately there are some individual states to look out for ohio is one some polling experts believe that if trump doesn t win there it is effectively game over fivethirtyeight com gave him less than a 1 chance of winning the presidency if he fails to take the buckeye state likewise if trump loses north carolina or pennsylvania or florida it also becomes very difficult for him to win and beyond that if clinton can win georgia remember these are usually solidly republican it would suggest she is in for a blowout victory that could see the election called for her very early in 2012 virginia was only called for obama after midnight and florida was not called for four days clinton is polling well ahead of trump in virginia and strong early voting results might see her announced the winner early election soundtrack queen latifah u n i t y we may see the first female president following a campaign marked by sexism and inappropriate behaviour towards women queen latifah called out the disrespectful treatment of women in this 1994 hit election fuel cuban sandwich florida s signature dish is said to have originated in cuba or in key west part of the florida keys archipelago it s got ham swiss cheese mustard and pickles in it and might be a good way to soak up the booze in the early hours we would expect a victory speech and a concession speech though trump has spoken of a threat that the election could be rigged and refused to say that if he loses he will accept the result if elected clinton would be the first woman to be elected us president she has repeatedly spoken about breaking the glass ceiling in politics and has chosen to hold her election night party at new york city s javits center which actually has a glass ceiling if trump is elected he will be the first person with his own vodka line to be elected president and only the fifth president to have never held elected office the winner will have 73 days to set up a new government before they are sworn into office on 20 january 2017 but if you re concerned about post election withdrawal symptoms don t worry the midterm elections sometimes seen as a referendum on the president will take place in november 2018 all 435 members of the house of representatives will be up for re election along with a third of the senate and more than half the governors and then in summer 2019 a whole new cast
