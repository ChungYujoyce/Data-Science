facing unusual scrutiny the u s has voiced harsh criticism and temporarily suspended funding to the organization pending a review and the world health assembly has endorsed an investigation into how the who s leadership managed the coronavirus pandemic in a letter posted overnight on twitter by president trump he threatened topermanently cut funding to the organization the who director general agreed to undertake an independent review and adding to the level of u s china tension china s president xi jinping announced on monday that china would donate 2 billion toward the organization s coronavirus response effort dr david nabarro a special envoy of the who director general on covid 19 and a medical doctor with a long history of battling global viruses cautioned against conducting a forensic examination of the organization amid the pandemic in an interview with cbs news pamela falk i m pleading with people not to try to do a forensic examination right in the middle of a response he said because it s like basically taking the fire engines away from the fire and asking it to go for routine maintenance when desperately needed to put out a flame read excerpts of falk s interview with dr nabarro below pamela falk how worried are you about a second wave of coronavirus with countries opening up dr david nabarro i think more than a second wave i m worried about repeated new outbreaks i want to differentiate this from a flu pandemic which tends to come in waves this is a completely new thing it s a coronavirus a set of current virus outbreaks and they come in little spikes that build up really fast and i m extremely worried that in the current lockdown situation the viruses all over the world are in lots of different places my worry is that there will be more outbreaks and that we will find that for various reasons we don t have the capacity everywhere to close outbreaks down and it s particularly difficult in overcrowded cities it s particularly difficult in very poor settings it s particularly difficult when a lot of refugees and others are gathered together in very difficult circumstances goodness me there are reasons to be worried the accusation by many countries including president trump in the united states is that some of the decisions made were political specifically the issue with the chinese communist party leadership failing to share research about human to human transmission that it should have been sooner and that they haven t shared virus samples to what extent is that legitimate countries provide information to the who secretariat the who secretariat is allowed to ask them for additional details or to ask them to explain things but there s no compulsory powers with the world health organization it has to work with what it gets from countries so if a country decides for some reason that they re going to be slower than perhaps they might be to inform the world health organization that they ve got a problem due to a disease the world health organization hasn t gotten the power to go flying into that country and trying to find out more detail about what s going on china still hasn t shared the live virus samples correct well actually i thought that but as far as i m concerned every piece of material that was being required has been obtained including the virus sequence which is the key thing and samples have been shared i have not heard of any failure to share because this has been really important and as far as i know everything that s been requested by the who has been made available by the chinese authorities the issue that you re referring to which is in the resolution that s being discussed right now is where did the virus come from and there s a request from governments who are meeting in this world health assembly for a formal investigation to be done now we d expect that that s normal it s part of learning the lessons and there is a mechanism available the who is underfunded you say oh terribly and i think these questions that you re asking utterly legitimate questions that we really posed in this as a result of this resolution but please can we just not further burden the staff running the place with further having to do an inquiry now let s do it when the things have come down say next year but absolutely ask the question i m pleading with people not to try to do a forensic examination right in the middle of a response because it s like basically taking the fire engines away from the fire and asking it to go for routine maintenance when desperately needed to put out a flame president trump suspended payments was considering reinstatement we re back to he hasn t made a decision yet do you have a message this organization is extraordinary it focuses on the inequities the inequalities in health between poor and rich like no one no other body in the world it is the meeting place of all the people who are working on health all over the world it sets the standards on nutrition on non communicable diseases on everything to do with environmental health every area of health the who sets the standards it maintains the numbers it tells us who s dying of what it sets up programs to improve malaria children s health women s health road accidents patient safety you name it they do it because each year the bosses the world health assembly gives them more work to do suddenly in the middle of this massive crisis they get told that the major stakeholder thinks they ve messed up and so he s going to take the money away so it s kind of bizarre that suddenly this country that s been really big in the who has decided that it s going to cut the budget i don t understand it it just doesn t make sense doesn t add up right in the middle of something that s affecting 7 8 billion people you know it s kind of if you explained it to anybody else especially given the support that s always been there from the people the people of the united states to who they just couldn t understand it and sometimes it feels like a bad dream for staff inside the organization they feel dumbfounded they re doing the best they re working with their americans in there many many many and they re doing such good work they can t understand it first published on may 19 2020 10 51 am 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved pamela falk is cbs news foreign affairs analyst
