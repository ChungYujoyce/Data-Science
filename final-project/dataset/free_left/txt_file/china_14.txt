sunday to help bring chinese telecom giant zte back from the brink of collapse undercutstop law enforcement and intelligence officials who have warned for years that the company s products could be used for cyberespionage in the united states zte has close ties with china s government and u s officials have raised concerns that its phones and other devices could be used as surveillance tools against americans lawmakers immediately pointed out the contradiction our intelligence agencies have warned that zte technology and phones pose a major cyber security threat rep adam b schiff calif the ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee tweeted at trump yesterday you should care more about our national security than chinese jobs as sen marco rubio r fla put it in a tweet this morning the problem with zte isn t jobs trade it s nationalsecurity espionage problem with zte isn t jobs trade it s national security espionage any telecomm firm in china can be forced to act as tool of chinese espionage without any court order or any other review process we are crazy to allow them to operate in u s without tighter restrictions https t co axttdgufc9 the head of the fbi and other intelligence chiefs incongressional testimonythis year urged american citizens to steer clear of products from zte and its chinese rival huawei and just two weeks ago the pentagonbanned the companies phonesfrom being sold on military bases saying they may pose an unacceptable risk to department s personnel information and mission as my colleagues tony romm damian paletta and steven mufson report the commerce department last month said it wouldbar u s firms for seven years from exporting critical microchips and other parts to zte as punishment for violating a sanctions settlement over illegal shipments to iran and north korea on wednesday zte said it would shut down its global businessbut was actively communicating with the relevant u s government departments in order to facilitate the order s modification or reversal trump appeared receptive to the idea sending shockwaves through the national security establishment by tweeting sunday thathe and chinese president xi jinping were working to give zte a way back into business fast president xi of china and i are working together to give massive chinese phone company zte a way to get back into business fast too many jobs in china lost commerce department has been instructed to get it done it s striking that he is overruling the judgment of his own national security apparatus in order to help a chinese company succeed abraham denmark director of the asia program at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars told me there s often tension between economic issues and national security issues and this tweet seems to suggest in this case the economic issues won out adam segal director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the council on foreign relations called trump s instruction to his commerce department to assist zte highly unusual given the intelligence community has given several unambiguous warnings about using zte and huawei products when intelligence officials return to work today i would expect to see some pushback segal predicted with officials stressing that commercial sanctions might be modified but zte should stay out of u s networks in a statement later sunday white house spokeswoman lindsay walters signaled the commerce department would play a major role in the way forward the administration is in contact with china on this issue among others in the bilateral relationship president trump expects commerce secretary wilbur ross to exercise his independent judgment consistent with applicable laws and regulations to resolve the regulatory action involving zte based on its facts but lawmakers too may try to intervene after all it was congressional investigators who sounded the alarm about possible cyberespionage by zte and huawei in 2012 after an 11 month probe by the house intelligence committee concluded that the companies were essentially arms of the chinese government that could be used as conduits for spying on american citizens and companies and rubio along withsen tom cotton r ark introduced a bill earlier this year that would bar the u s government from buying or leasing telecommunications equipment from the companies over those concerns in february fbi director chris wray told the senate intelligence committee that americans shouldn t use zte or huawei products or services he was joined by the heads of the cia and national security agency and the director of national intelligence who also cautioned against the public using zte s products we re deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don t share our values to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications networks wray testified that provides the capacity to exert pressure or control over our telecommunications infrastructure he said it provides the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information and it provides the capacity to conduct undetected espionage given this former national security officials tweeted their shock about the announcement sunday from david gomez a former fbi counterterrorism agent and cybersecurity strategist wow i rarely comment on potus tweets but this one deserves a response telecommunications companies like zte use their devices and networks to compile intelligence on behalf of the chinese govt that is just a fact 28yearsinintelsaysso https t co

in china for a telecom company that is known to be beholden to the chinese govt puts us citizens and sensitive info at risk there is no reward for the usg national security can t be used as leverage https t co rwpax1mln2 and josh campbell former fbi special agent didn t mince words we don t need to just pump the brakes we need to throw the car in reverse and immediately retreat from this ludicrous idea that we are going to enable a counterintelligence threat like zte we should not be making life easier for hostile intelligence services but not everyone is as worried sascha segan a mobile analyst at pc magazine criticized the intelligence community for failing to detail the exact reasoning behind the alleged threat posed by zte which rejects the idea its products are a security risk for americans u s intelligence chiefs paint a dark picture of zte and huawei which they claim are chinese spying operations but we haven t seen a shred of actual evidence that either company s phones are dangerous to americans in any way he wrote in a february article the intelligence officials disparaging these companies have also given no evidence and been careful not to state that the handsets themselves are a clear and present threat just that they have an animus against these companies a i voted sticker is shown by a keyboard in the voting machine hacking village during the def
