asra q nomani is a former wall street journal reporter and a co founder of the muslim reform movement she can be found on twitter at asranomani a lot is being said now about the silent secret trump supporters this is my confession and explanation i a 51 year old a muslim an immigrant woman of color am one of those silent voters for donald trump and i m not a bigot racist chauvinist or white supremacist as trump voters are being called nor part of some whitelash in the winter of 2008 as a lifelong liberal and proud daughter of west virginia a state born on the correct side of history on slavery i moved to historically conservative virginia only because the state had helped elect barack obama as the first african american president of the united states but then for much of this past year i have kept my electoral preference secret i was leaning toward republican presidential candidate donald trump tuesday evening just minutes before the polls closed at forestville elementary school in mostly democratic fairfax county i slipped between the cardboard partitions in the polling booth a pen balanced carefully between my fingers to mark my ballot for president coloring in the circle beside the names of trump and his running mate mike pence after hillary clinton called trump to concede making him america s president elect a friend on twitter wrote a message of apology to the world saying there are millions of americans who don t share trump s hatred division ignorance she ended ashamed of millions that do that would presumably include me but it doesn t and that is where the dismissal of voter concerns about clinton led to her defeat i most certainly reject the trifecta of hatred division ignorance i support the democratic party s position on abortion same sex marriage and climate change did you vote for donald trump tell us why but i am a single mother who can t afford health insurance under obamacare the president s mortgage loan modification program hope now didn t help me tuesday i drove into virginia from my hometown of morgantown w va where i see rural america and ordinary americans like me still struggling to make ends meet after eight years of the obama administration finally as a liberal muslim who has experienced first hand islamic extremism in this world i have been opposed to the decision by president obama and the democratic party to tap dance around the islam in islamic state of course trump s rhetoric has been far more than indelicate and folks can have policy differences with his recommendations but to me it has been exaggerated and demonized by the governments of qatar and saudi arabia their media channels such as al jazeera and their proxies in the west in a convenient distraction from the issue that most worries me as a human being on this earth extremist islam of the kind that has spilled blood from the hallways of the taj mahal hotel in mumbai to the dance floor of the pulse nightclub in orlando fla in mid june after the tragic shooting at pulse trump tweeted out a message delivered in his typical subtle style is president obama going to finally mention the words radical islamic terrorism if he doesn t he should immediately resign in disgrace around then on cnn s new day democratic candidate clinton seemed to do the obama dance saying from my perspective it matters what we do more than what we say and it mattered we got bin laden not what name we called him i have clearly said we whether you call it radical jihadism or radical islamism i m happy to say either i think they mean the same thing by mid october it was one aug 17 2014 email from the wikileaks treasure trove of clinton emails that poisoned the well for me in it clinton told aide john podesta we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of qatar and saudi arabia which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil the politically correct name for the islamic state and other radical sunni groups in the region the revelations of multimillion dollar donations to the clinton foundation from qatar and saudi arabia killed my support for clinton yes i want equal pay no i reject trump s locker room banter the idea of a wall between the united states and mexico and a plan to ban muslims but i trust the united states and don t buy the political hyperbole agenda driven identity politics of its own that demonized trump and his supporters i gently tried to express my thoughts on twitter but the pantsuit revolution was like a steamroller to any nuanced discourse if you supported trump you had to be a redneck why this frenchman plans to resist president trump by becoming a u s citizen days before the election a journalist from india emailed me asking what are your thoughts being a muslim in trump s america i wrote that as a child of india arriving in the united states at the age of 4 in the summer of 1969 i have absolutely no fears about being a muslim in a trump america the checks and balances in america and our rich history of social justice and civil rights will never allow the fear mongering that has been attached to candidate trump s rhetoric to come to fruition what worried me the mostwere my concerns about the influence of theocratic muslim dictatorships including qatar and saudi arabia in a hillary clinton america these dictatorships are no shining examples of progressive society with their failure to offer fundamental human rights and pathways to citizenship to immigrants from india refugees from syria and the entire class of de facto slaves that live in those dictatorships we have to stand up with moral courage against not just hate against muslims but hate by muslims so that everyone can live with sukhun or peace of mind i finished in my reflections to the journalist in india he didn t get the email i didn t resend it afraid of the wrath i d receive but then i voted we are a
