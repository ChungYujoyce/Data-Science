advertisement supported by by jonathan martin des moines senator ted cruz of texas powered by a surge of support from evangelical christians dealt a humbling loss to donald j trump in the iowa caucuses on monday throwing into question the depth of support for mr trump s unconventional candidacy in the first contest of what so far has been more a populist revolt against the political order than a traditional republican primary senator marco rubio of florida finished a strong third bolstering his case to consolidate the support of republicans uneasy about the two top finishers with 98 percent of precincts reporting mr cruz had nearly 28 percent of the vote mr trump 24 percent and mr rubio 23 percent mr cruz s victory was hard earned he fought off a barrage of attacks in the campaign s final weeks from mr trump as well as from iowa s longtime governor terry e branstad and republican leaders in washington who warned that the hard line mr cruz would lead the party to electoral disaster this fall transcript na having felled the brash mr trump who unceasingly predicted victory and dominated the race up until the first voting mr cruz can credibly portray himself to conservatives who have yearned to unite behind a strong champion as a giant killer to god be the glory mr cruz told jubilant supporters tonight is a victory for the grass roots tonight is a victory for courageous conservatives all across iowa and our great nation the close race illustrated just how turbulent the republican race may be with the vote fragmenting between mr cruz s evangelicals and tea party adherents mr trump s blue collar political newcomers and mr rubio s mix of conservatives and pragmatic republicans hungry for victory turnout was about 185 000 a record according to edison research which conducted entrance polls at precincts across the state mr trump s success had been expected to hinge on whether he could mobilize his supporters but the turnout was not enough to deliver him a win even though 46 percent of those who turned out were participating in a republican caucus for the first time 11 photos view slide show instead mr trump paid the price for building only a rudimentary political organization in the state the brew of energy and anger powering his candidacy did not fully translate into votes i love you people i love you people a subdued sounding mr trump unconvincingly told a crowd of iowans in west des moines we will go on to get the republican nomination and we will go on to easily beat hillary or bernie or whoever the hell they throw out there mr trump s celebrity fueled airplane hangar rallies proved no match for mr cruz s fervent appeal to christian values in winning over iowa s evangelical voters who made up nearly two thirds of those who did show up to caucus mr cruz won about a third of the evangelical vote that achievement was even more remarkable given the competition mr cruz also faced from mr rubio and ben carson the spiritually minded retired neurosurgeon among others when mike huckabee and rick santorum won the iowa caucuses in 2008 and 2012 respectively they did so without formidable opposition for those voters each ran again this year but failed to earn significant backing transcript na the victory for mr cruz also was a validation of the iowa tradition that success here comes from intensive retail campaigning he built an extensive organization and spent months visiting each of iowa s 99 counties the throngs of iowans who came to see mr trump s improvisational performances by contrast may have come away entertained but not enough of them seemed persuaded that he was presidential the question for mr cruz now is whether to compete aggressively in new hampshire which votes next tuesday or divide his time between there and the next battleground south carolina which holds its primary on feb 20 and has an evangelical population closer in size to iowa s mr cruz has trailed well behind in recent new hampshire polls but mr trump his aura of invincibility gone could prove vulnerable there as well should mr cruz whose 19 million war chest is the most money of any republican candidate find success with that state s more secular voters it would signal that he has the potential to unite a wider republican electorate transcript na yet the strong iowa finish by mr rubio the choice of a plurality of voters who said they made their decisions in the last week will allow him to begin making the case to republican donors activists and elected officials that he is the strongest candidate acceptable to them who can win over grass roots conservatives mr rubio s late surge was a vindication of his strategy he waited to aggressively compete in iowa until january when he crisscrossed the state furiously with 36 events in the final four weeks portraying his third place showing in the best possible light mr rubio subtly took aim at both mr cruz and mr trump on monday suggesting they could not defeat mrs clinton when i m the nominee we are going to unify our party and we are going to unify the conservative movement mr rubio said to hundreds of supporters in des moines while mr cruz a pastor s son counted on christian conservatives mr rubio aggressively tried to woo that constituency too he ran an ad in which he spoke of the free gift of salvation offered to us by jesus christ and in the final debate before the caucuses held thursday in des moines he notably referred to jesus christ who came down to earth and died for our sins with the top finishers a businessman who had never run for office and two first term senators governing experience evidently mattered little to iowans the five current or former governors still running won a combined 8 percent less than what the retired neurosurgeon ben carson received even after his campaign nearly unraveled in the weeks before the caucuses after months of watching vast crowds wait hours in line to fill gymnasiums many iowans thought mr trump s star power would shatter turnout records it may have helped but it was mr cruz who benefited most he won support from local conservative leaders including representative steve king and as mr trump began to assail him mr cruz delivered sharp counterattacks over mr trump s past liberal views particularly on abortion rights mr cruz was also helped by mr trump s self inflicted wounds in recent weeks mr trump spoke of the new testament s second book of corinthians as two corinthians a telling lapse in the eyes of evangelicals he proclaimed that he could shoot somebody on fifth avenue in manhattan and still wouldn t lose voters and thursday mr trump skipped the only republican debate held in iowa to avoid a confrontation with mr cruz and fox news it was enough to make iowans uneasy perhaps most critically though mr trump lacked the organization that mr cruz had put into place in iowa given his reliance on voters new to the caucus process mr trump needed a robust get out the vote operation but he was badly out organized by mr cruz who relied on scores of church pastors and brought in hundreds of volunteers from as far as idaho and texas instead mr trump ran a campaign in his own self regarding image he defied history s lesson that the caucuses are won through one on one campaigning and humble requests of support there were no community round tables no bus tour through courthouse towns and little in the way of unscripted interaction with voters outside of posing for pictures and signing autographs what iowa rituals mr trump did submit to had a novelty quality to them as when he made a show of stopping in at a pizza ranch restaurant a campaign trail staple and once stayed overnight at a holiday inn express good mattress he said and when he indulged in the pandering to iowa institutions that is typical of political supplicants here he did so in his exaggerated almost comic style as if he were playing the role of presidential candidate i am a great christian he assured iowa s voters who may have been skeptical about a thrice married new york casino magnate mr trump also vowed to support the ethanol referring to the federal biofuel subsidies prized by the agriculture industry here while occasionally musing that he might just buy a farm in iowa and when senator charles e grassley came to one of his rallies mr trump did not evince much knowledge about the senator s 40 year tenure in congress but did say this is a great guy this is a great guy at times mr trump even mocked iowans he repeatedly noted that the winner of the republican caucuses had not won the nomination in 16 years chiding them for picking losers in the final weekend every public poll showed mr trump winning but mr trump s problems were registering with mr cruz s camp mr cruz s campaign manager jeff roe was coolly confident late sunday he nonchalantly assured a reporter of victory saying that mr trump was sliding and might even finish third
