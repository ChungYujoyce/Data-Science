drug administration about hydroxychloroquine and its effectiveness in treating the coronavirus phony during a cabinet meeting tuesday afternoon i ll stay on it for a little while longer i m just very curious myself but it seems to be very safe said the president cbs news campaign reporter nicole sgangasays mr trump 73 revealed to reporters during a white house event on monday that he has been taking the antimalarial drug he frequently touts as treatment for covid 19 according to thefda hydroxychloroquine is linked to serious and even fatal heart risks in some patients the largest study on the drug to date showed itdid not improve the condition of coronavirus patientsand was tied to a greater number of deaths the agency has warned against its widespread use white house physician dr sean conley confirmed in a memorandum he and mr trump had several discussions about hydroxychloroquine and decided the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks earlier in the day the president also responded to comments made by house speaker nancy pelosi after he said he was taking the drug i don t respond to her i think she s a waste of time mr trump told reporters he later called the california lawmaker a sick woman who has a lot of mental problems pelosi said monday night mr trump should not be taking hydroxychloroquine due to his age and weight as far as the president is concerned he s our president and i would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists especially in his age group and in his shall we say weight group morbidly obese they say pelosi said during an interview with cnn on monday night so i think it s not a good idea vice president mike pence chaired the 7th national space council meeting at nasa headquarters in

american soil cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidarreports astronauts robert behnken and douglas hurley who also joined the meeting will be thefirst to fly in spacex s crew dragon capsule since the

trailblazers of a new era adding the launch next week comes at an important time in the life of our nation as the country recovers from the coronavirus pandemic we are one week and one day away from when america will return american astronauts on american rockets from american soil to space pence said it is a time of great hope and encouragement towards the end of the meeting a pool reporter asked pence if he is also taking hydroxychloroquine pence smiled and simply said thank you in an interview following the space council meeting fox news kristin fisher asked the vice president if he is taking hydroxychloroquine i m not but i would never begrudge any american taking the advice of their physician pence replied hydroxychloroquine is a drug that s been around for more than 40 years for treatment of malaria but early in this process the fda approved what s called off label use where physicians could prescribe hydroxychloroquine in terms they deemed appropriate so my physician has not recommended that but i wouldn t hesitate to take the counsel of my doctor any american should do likewise on wednesday vp pence will travel to orlando florida where he will meet with governor ron desantis to discuss the state s reopening pence will also deliver personal protective equipment to a nursing home as part of an initiative to deliver ppe to more than 15 000 nursing homes across america val demings cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchellreports that congresswoman val demings of florida joined the state s democratic party during a virtual press conference on tuesday to call out the trump administration s handling of the coronavirus pandemic the press conference came one day ahead of pence s upcoming visit to orlando where he s scheduled to pass out personal protective equipment to nursing homes a move that the fldp chair terrie rizzo called too little too late demings called the move another smoke and mirrors moment where the administration wants to distract voters the president and the vice president want you to take your eyes off the real conditions on the ground pay no attention to the number of people who have died pay no attention to the number of people who are sick ignore the fact that this country s numbers continue to increase demings said during the virtual gathering we have had the worst response in the world compared to other industrialized countries demings added that while the president isn t responsible for covid 19 we would be in a much different place today if his administration had heeded to earlier warnings from public health experts and scientists earlier this month presumptive nominee biden said demings was one of a group of women being considered as one of his vice presidential picks and the former democratic house manager in the impeachment trial of mr trump has said herself that she would be honored to serve as vp but when asked whether she d had contact with the biden campaign during the virtual press conference a fldp moderator said they wouldn t be taking questions on that subject at the moment elizabeth warren senator elizabeth warren on tuesday pressured treasury secretary steven mnuchin to require that all large and mid sized businesses getting pandemic aid from a 500 billion federal reserve fund keep their workers on payroll mnuchin declined to make such a commitment citing payroll requirements for airline bailouts and the main street lending program and the rest was left up to you and what you re saying is that you won t do it you re boosting your wall street buddies and you are leaving the american people behind warren said in a senate banking committee hearing according tocbs news campaign reporter zak hudak mnuchin who has the authority under the cares act to set the terms of pandemic relief bonds purchased by the federal reserve said he had set the terms based on bipartisan discussions i think that s a very unfair characterization he said and these issues were discussed with both republicans and democrats at the time you were not necessarily part of those discussions but these were completely discussed the federal reserve has set some restrictions on companies from whom it will buy bonds including that a majority of their employees are in the united states and that they are not already receiving other cares act support ahead of the hearing warren sent a letter to the federal reserve in boston and new york requesting that executives of companies receiving that aid be subject to criminal and civil penalties including disgorgement if they provide fraudulent or misleading information or misuse funds mnuchin said in the hearing that we will review that warren also released her second wave of endorsements for up and down ballot democrats since leaving the presidential race notably she backed mj hegar an air force veteran who will appear in a runoff election in mid june to be democrats challenger for senator john cornyn as a dedicated combat veteran and working mom who has lived through many of the challenges facing texans mj hegar is a proven fighter warren said in a statement she will ensure every texan has affordable health care economic opportunity and a government that works for the people not corporate special interests or billionaires in addition to a slew of incumbents warren endorsed georgette gomez a progressive backed by congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez who is running against former hillary clinton adviser sara jacobs to replace rep susan davis in california when she retires gretchen whitmer michigan governor gretchen whitmer commented on speculation that she is being considered as democratic presumptive nominee joe biden s potential running mate according tocbs news campaign reporter jack turman asked on the today show if she is being vetted by the biden campaign whitmer responded that she has had a conversation with some folks but added that she is focused on leading michigan through the coronavirus pandemic it was just an opening conversation and it s not something that i would call a professional you know formalized vetting whitmer later added this is the most direct answer whitmer has given to a question about being a vice presidential contender whitmer has been asked repeatedly about vice presidential speculation in the last month but has typically only responded that her energy is dedicated to handling the current crisis whitmer one of the national co chairs for biden s campaign recently participated in a virtual roundtable hosted by the biden campaign with connecticut governor ned lamont and new jersey governor phil murphy florida one day after every florida county entered into a full phase 1 reopening across the state the number of covid related deaths surpassed 2 000 in florida on tuesday the full phase 1 reopening allows for restaurants and retail establishments to expand indoor occupancy to 50 and also permits museums libraries and gyms to operate at 50 of their buildings capacities during a virtual press conference with the florida democratic party demings and state leaders cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchellasked what the leaders thought about this new phase of the state s re opening our economy is suffering this is florida where tourism is so critical but to reopen while our numbers are continuing to increase and look i know also that the rate of increase has gone down somewhat but we have to be so careful and so strategic in terms of reopening said demings who added that she did appreciate the idea of a phased re opening but countered that floridians have received mixed messages from the state s governor florida democratic state senator victor torres said that idea of a gradual re opening isn t being adhered to by some patrons in restaurants salons and bars that s where i have a problem because guess what if this comes back it s gonna come back double the amount said torres during the virtual press conference tuesday we re gonna really face a challenge in the safety for our people michigan michigan secretary of state jocelyn benson announced today that michigan will be mailing all registered voters absentee ballot applications for the august primary and november general election according tocbs news campaign reporter adam brewster there are 7 7 million registered voters in michigan and 1 3 million are already on the permanent absentee voter list by mailing applications we have ensured that no michigander has to choose between their health and their right to vote benson said in a statement voting by mail is easy convenient safe and secure and every voter in michigan has the right to do it in 2018 michigan voters passed a ballot measure that made the state a no excuse absentee voting state meaning anyone could request a mail ballot without a reason this goes a step further to put the application in voters mailboxes during the march presidential primary the first statewide election since the no excuse absentee law took effect 876 845 people returned absentee ballots that was almost double the number from the 2016 presidential primary new york a three judge panel ruled tuesday that the new york democratic presidential primary may proceed as planned on june 23rd cbs news campaign reporter nicole sgangasays the decision by the u s court of appeals for the second circuit follows new york state s appeal of a federal judge s order last month that required new york state hold its election returning all qualified candidates including senator bernie sanders to the ballot we have reviewed all of the remaining arguments raised by defendants on appeal and find them to be without merit judges wrote in a joint decision tuesday new york state board of elections co chair douglas kellner confirmed another appeal would not be filed following the opinion pennsylvania tens of thousands of voters in montgomery county pennsylvania likely received faulty supplemental instructions for filling out their mail in ballots according to the official in charge of elections in the county although the instructions printed on the ballots themselves were correct the ones printed on a separate sheet of paper incorrectly directed voters to fill in bubbles to the left rather than the right of the names of candidates for whom they wish to vote as a result a voter following the supplemental instructions and not the correct ones would fill in bubbles for presidential or state attorney general and auditor general candidates when trying to cast their votes for delegates lee soltysiak the chief operating officer and clerk for montgomery county toldcbs news campaign reporter zak hudakin a statement that the county became aware of the mistake may 14 and corrected the supplemental instructions sent with all ballots since then soltysiak said he did not think voters would make mistakes on their ballots because of the incorrect directions since the instructions are correct on the ballot itself and many candidates do not have an oval to their left on the ballot we do not believe this will have an impact on how people will mark their ballots or our ability to accurately count their vote he said the supplemental instructions also contradicted the ones on the ballots themselves with regard to what color ink voters should use to fill in the bubbles while the ballots directed voters to fill in the bubbles with a black pen the supplemental instructions said they could also use blue soltysiak said this will not be an issue because scanners read both colors of ink accurately and if there was ever an issue with the type of pen used by a voter the scanner would recognize the issue and the ballot would instead be counted by hand at tabulation the blunder comes as pennsylvania election boards cope with issuing well over 10 times the number of mail in and absentee ballots they ve sent in past years late last year the state legislature passed a bill to allow no excuse mail in voting across the state as the spread of covid 19 shut down the state and the legislature moved the primary back a month pennsylvanians applied in droves to vote by mail they can apply to vote by mail until may 26 a
