advertisement transcript i m michelle goldberg i m ross douthat i m frank bruni and this is the argument music playing before we start ross welcome back michelle and i missed you did you really frank i know that you got some excellent fill ins for me over the last two weeks and i m just grateful that you were willing to take me back after i bailed on you guys in order to propagate the human species or some nonsense like that well ross the guests we had in your place they couldn t replace you but they were probably getting a little bit more sleep than you are these days they probably are and were and continue to i m speaking to you guys from the attic of my lovely house where we have in fact added one more human being so we now have four children nine and under all the way down to little rosemary who s three weeks old yesterday sharing the great coronavirus lockdown experience and rosemary is wonderful we re very happy to have her and about the experience the less said the better well ross i have no news to rival yours except i should tell our listeners that i m in a sort of techno internet hell in which my connectivity from a remote location into the podcast central is not so great so if today s recording sounds a little rougher at least on my end than usual it is a technological problem and actually and not just frank then i m in maine where i ve always known that rural broadband was a problem i m now discovering that firsthand so my end might also seem a little bit less than professional someday a future archaeologist of the american empire is going to trace the collapse of the american republic during the coronavirus through the degradation of argument podcast audio quality so just so everybody knows laughter the three of us are audio confused but i think we re clear on what we want to talk about music playing this week the trump administration has dropped all charges against michael flynn is this the white house s corruption and cronyism in overdrive or is it not quite that simple the democratic president of the united states before barack obama charged with process crimes and did not ultimately go to jail for them and the rule of law survived then when we talk about which americans are hit hardest by covid 19 are we too quick to blame the sick i think everybody when you re threatened wants to sort of reach for reasons why this might not be you and finally a recommendation well the baby you know she spits up a lot music playing last week attorney general bill barr dropped the case against michael flynn president trump s former national security advisor flynn had pled guilty to the charge that he lied to the fbi about talking with the russian ambassador before trump s inauguration our duty we think is to dismiss the case a crime cannot be established here they did not have a basis for a counterintelligence investigation against flynn at that stage the president instantly applauded the development but for many critics of this administration barr s decision is a gross miscarriage of justice another glimpse into the ethical void of donald trump s white house michelle you ve written critically about barr in the headline of one column you bluntly asked not whether he s corrupt but how corrupt he is does the flynn news surprise you at all and how alarmed should americans be about it well i mean it doesn t surprise me because the answer to how corrupt is bill barr is about as corrupt as it s possible for a government official to be without being actively on the take and i think americans should be extremely alarmed this is really really bad it comes on the heels of barr himself intervening to try to get a more lenient sentence for roger stone another one of trump s cronies and it s dangerous both because you have this nakedly political intervention on behalf of one of trump s friends but also because it s part of i think a broader effort to create what donald trump has been calling obamagate and maybe ross can explain what he thinks conservatives mean when they talk about obamagate but donald trump has this i m rubber you re glue or no puppet no puppet you re the puppet approach to his own crimes right where he projects them onto his enemies and what he has tried to do now and what barr i think is really helping him do is to delegitimize the entire russia investigation and so what really frightens me is that this is the first step in barr opening some sort of investigation into members of the obama administration very possibly including joe biden this is really the worst case scenario of what the trump administration was going to look like i mean i agree with michelle that the general situation at the moment is close to what i feared most about the trump administration but i don t really find the michael flynn and russiagate stuff to be a huge part of that in fact i sort of have the opposite feeling that the deeper we get into the actual crisis of the coronavirus and the trump administration s various failures in handling that the sort of the more absurd it seems that we spend all of this endless time early in this administration obsessing about whether michael flynn was actually a traitor i think the obamagate stuff as far as i can tell is basically trump trying to suggest that obama himself played an inappropriate slash corrupt role in directing the fbi investigation into the trump campaign michael flynn and so on which to the extent it were true would be a scandal i don t really see evidence just from the one oval office conversation that we have evidence for that obama did anything like that as far as i can tell what actually happened with michael flynn was not obamagate but another version of our favorite long running show of comeygate where all the evidence that s come out surrounding flynn suggests that basically the f b i went on a kind of fishing expedition with flynn trying to get something on him without the knowledge and to the surprise of people like sally yates and the justice department and what they ended up getting him on was a possible violation of the logan act for which no one has ever been prosecuted a failure to register as a foreign lobbyist which is something that people get slaps on the wrist for and some kind of alleged lie in his conversations with f b i agents which the lie has never been identified and it s not clear to me what flynn was actually going to go down for except that the f b i wanted to get him and he had a bunch of shady connections and they were able to sort of bully him and threaten to prosecute his son and get him to plead guilty so it just seems to me like another case study in the f b i really pushed the envelope as it did with carter page and investigating trump s cronies if they had pushed the envelope and come up with big evidence of deep ties to russia we would say well they pushed the envelope and they did the right thing but since they didn t come up with that evidence it just looks like they overreached the bigger issue for me is that look we still don t know what flynn said on that call with kislyak that call where he basically said not to retaliate for the sanctions that obama imposed because of russia s interference in the election it s hard to say we didn t get them because the trump administration has succeeded in keeping the contents of that conversation quiet it s one of many many pieces of information that they ve quashed and then use the absence of that information as if it were somehow exonerating to them but what you just said before that we re into the worst case scenario the trump administration and to me that just makes it all the more germane the role that russia played in bringing us to this place where we are on our knees i think we can put aside the specifics of the michael flynn of what he s accused of doing and that sort of thing we can put aside russia and we re still left with what leaves me most gobsmacked which is bill barr s behavior over time i mean at every single juncture here he seems to take the misdoings the evils of both trump and his administration and to launder them in some fashion i think that has been so persistent so consistent i m hard pressed to think of an attorney general in recent memory who s acted this flagrantly politically over and over again and that i think raises concerns well beyond the specifics of russia or this case no well look but that s why he was chosen in the first place right he s this sort of he s smarter than the average trumpist and maybe even less principled this is somebody that the conservative new york times columnist william safire called cover up general barr when he served in george h w bush s administration that s why they brought him in and he gave this really chilling interview to one of the networks where they asked him how he thought history would remember these decisions and he said something like history is written by the winners that s not he said that s not what he said he said first well history is written by the winners so you know i mean he was sort of poking at the whole sort of journalistic narrative conceit of the idea that there is this sort of authoritative history that s like god but isn t god but is somehow watching us all the time but then the very next thing he said was a defense of his behavior in this case and he said i think if the people writing history are reasonable they will see that i did the right thing which doesn t mean he did the right thing but he wasn t like on network tv bragging about how he had destroyed the very concept of truth of course it was like a sly little fuck you to people who expect some sort of standards in their public servants followed by a justification of his behavior right of course he s not out there saying yes the truth is what the trump regime says it is he s just kind of slyly hinting at that where people who are either in despair over what s become of our liberal democracy or people who are gloating over what they ve been able to do to us but don t you think it s possible that barr who is a man who has always who is a conservative partisan who s always believed strongly in sort of presidential prerogatives genuinely believes that the overreach involved in the investigation of the trump campaign and some of trump s appointees is more of a scandal than the russia scandal itself and that s what s motivating his behavior it s not possible for me to believe that anybody can have that that can be a good faith opinion that anyone holds well see haven t you missed me ross and michelle just to stoke your differing opinions here i think i ve got a question that you ll answer differently so now that the case against flynn has been dropped and we ve had i think both the vice president and president kind of praise him and i think vice president pence the man who supposedly lied to according to previous narratives that now no one s paying much attention to even said something like i d welcome him back ross michelle what should and what will happen to michael flynn from this point forward well my sense is that he s going to become a huge conservative celebrity right you have the trump administration talking about him i believe as their nelson mandela what should happen i don t believe it will happen i think if elizabeth warren for example was the democratic nominee and had promised some sort of retroactive accountability for all the abuses of trump s justice department you might see a prosecution of him for he was also acting and this is also insane that up until the day of the election he was also acting as a paid unregistered foreign agent of the turkish government right so this is another one of these kind of utterly bonkers subplots that just gets lost because there s so much madness around it but part of his plea when he pled guilty was that he wasn t going to face any sort of repercussions for that well presumably his guilty plea is now null and void because he now says that he s not guilty i think it s important to know if that s still on the table or not it certainly should be i don t know that it will be i don t think that a joe biden administration is going to be interested in going back and relitigating all of this stuff but i would love to see a justice department and attorney general adam schiff who went through and tried to again clean up some of the just utter sort of rule of law disaster that they perpetrated on us flynn will be a fox news celebrity and his and his well but i think that if there isn t a trump second term his star will fade a bit and maybe a la oliver north he ll attempt to run for office somewhere but will gradually fade away and i guess to michelle s point i just think that when the trump administration is over and there s a new administration in power or even now you know with the house in democrats control there are probably better uses of the democrats time including uses that involve investigating aspects of the trump administration than going back and reprosecuting michael flynn for failing to register as a foreign lobbyist which is again a kind of seedy and shady thing but not a serious breach of the kind that we normally put presidential appointees in jail for and i think there are bigger things for the enemies of donald trump to focus on than going back and getting michael flynn as it happens right after the case against flynn was dropped former president obama was on a phone call with obama administration alumni as often happens in this day and age someone recorded it and leaked it and he told them in regard to barr s decision to swoop in and drop the flynn case he told them our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk is he being overdramatic ross or does he have a point there i think he was probably being a little bit overdramatic i think that we have plenty of examples including the democratic president of the united states before barack obama who were charged with process crimes and did not ultimately go to jail for them and the rule of law survived i think that again we still don t actually know what flynn said to the fbi and in fact jim comey in testimony before congress before the mueller investigation sort of took off said that the fbi agents didn t necessarily think he lied to them so this is not my central anxiety of what is happening at this moment in the united states of america rule of law or not well we don t know what flynn said but we do know that barr keeps swooping in and swooping in and swooping in let s leave things there next up the coronavirus blame game music playing they re too old they re too fat they were in poor health to begin with or maybe they re poor period or they re brown or black people of color are being especially hard hit by the coronavirus with higher infection rates and higher death rates the same goes for people with chronic illnesses lately when some americans talk about who s suffering most it seems like they re rushing to put those people into categories categories that make it someone else s disease and maybe someone else s problem and while some of what they say is grounded in statistics are they also constructing a false and dangerous sense of safety and are they insinuating that some lives matter less than others ross i d love to hear your thoughts so i think there are two things going on here one there is a kind of frankly dumb narrative that s taken hold among especially certain republicans who are arguing for a quick reopening where they want to emphasize at every turn the extent to which the coronavirus only kills people who have pre existing conditions only kills people who are between the ages of 75 and 95 in an effort to minimize the scale of the problem in order to make a case that we ve overreacted and need to reopen things quickly and finally it ignores what i think is sort of one of the more significant long term stories of the virus which is that we just don t know what kind of damage it does to people who don t die the times carried a big story just the other day about people who just have lingering symptoms that go on and on and on for weeks and probably months and sort of chronic inflammation chronic pain in different places we don t know what kind of long term damage it does to people s lungs you don t want that narrative to take hold at the same time the realities of who gets this and who gets sickest are really important to figuring out how to treat it and how to respond to it and so on there is a lot of evidence for instance that vitamin d deficiency plays some kind of role in making people sicker and the fact is that lots of african americans in colder climates have worse vitamin d deficiency i believe than white people and that is again a really important fact that isn t just an artifact of racism or something like that so there s really important stuff here that needs to be sort of acknowledged and addressed and dealt with without leaping to the narrative that it s not a problem because the old or the sick or the poor are the ones dying you know ross what i worry about and you just talked about that in a very kind of sane and rational public health policy way and you re right we need to know who gets it who suffers the most because that s one of the ways we craft policy i just worry a lot the conversations that say you don t need to worry about this meaning the disease bleed into you don t need to worry about them meaning the people who are hit hardest by the disease and it s a way i think in which people not only exempt themselves from concern about how vulnerable they might be to a kind of bad go round with this but they almost give themselves permission not to be concerned about the whole of it that s what i worry about i think it s so easy for one to bleed into the other i thought it was fascinating for instance to watch the twitter thread of a guy named david lat who was one of the founders of the blog above the law he was hospitalized for covid 19 he was on a ventilator and so he wasn t exactly what people thought of as someone who was kind of in the crosshairs of the coronavirus and of covid 19 they were so focused on finding a reason why it was him and it turned out he had childhood asthma but we don t know that that was a conspirator in this but it was this desire that you could just feel and hear of putting people with this in a box that excludes oneself that becomes a way to ratchet down one s concern across the board that s what concerns me but i mean that to me is understandable i mean at least it s psychologically understandable right i find myself doing it and i push back on it but i think everybody when you re threatened wants to sort of reach for reasons why this might not be you you know and then i ve been sort of flattened by terror at this new syndrome that s affecting children and where there s been a number of children in new york city with this rare inflammatory disease so i do want to know i do find myself thinking was there something else wrong what is the chance that this is going to happen to me and my family and so i feel like that part of it is sort of it s maybe not good but it s understandable michelle as you were talking about that i was recalling it kept coming back into my head a conversation i had with a friend recently and this is a friend who really trusts me as a fairly empathetic person and is sensitive and all those things and she was relaying the news a couple weeks ago i think it was about the death of a 29 year old editor at people magazine this got a bit of attention in the news and on twitter and she said she saw the kind of bulletin that this 29 year old editor at people magazine died she was horrified by that age that kind of contradicted the prevailing coronavirus narrative and then she saw a picture and this editor was significantly significantly overweight and she immediately said oh i saw that and i was so relieved now she s speaking colloquially and sloppily but then you go on twitter and look a little deeper into this and i know we should never judge too much by twitter because it can be a singular sewer and there was in fact a lot of back and forth of people coming close to or actually kind of blaming this woman for her death because she was so overweight it is true and it is important for us to say that it does seem that covid 19 takes a much much worse and more damaging and even fatal course in obese people it s important to get the message out that that s not an ideal state of health but there s a very easy way for that to bleed into a much more harshly judgmental and cruel narrative and maybe i m a little sensitive to this myself my memoir was called born round it was about how fat i used to be and how fat i try not to be and how fat i sometimes end up being regardless and people s lives are pretty complicated and they re in the sorts of situations of health circumstances they are for a whole lot of different reasons and i wish our conversation around this disease would do justice to that i mean i think generally i ve had some battles with illness over the last five years and generally my impression has been that people who are healthy myself included have no idea how easy it is to become unhealthy and how quickly and randomly and strangely it can happen and so there s this sense that you don t even necessarily recognize as a sense but a sense of sort of invincibility if you think of yourself as a healthy person and people want to preserve that sense obviously especially at a moment when there s a deadly disease around but there is also to come back to the balancing act there is a balance you have to strike so to take the outbreaks in meatpacking plants on the one hand it s bad if people end up dismissing the severity of those outbreaks because they re happening to immigrant workers or minorities or poor people and if anything the conditions that we re seeing in meatpacking plants should be a sign that we need greater reforms of those industries that being said if you live in the state of iowa and you have an outbreak in a meatpacking plant that is a very different public health problem than having an outbreak in a suburban and rural town where people are living sort of spread out suburban or ex urban or rural lives and it has different public health implications if most people who are dying are dying in very specific conditions then that affects the choices that public health officials make about lockdowns and distancing and school closures and so on and the same with the kawasaki disease issue that michelle raised i too am really really interested in learning what predisposes kids to get these kind of covid related inflammations but figuring that out is a necessary step to the reality that eventually we re going to have to reopen schools and we re going to have to come up with some kind of public health balance based on the best information but we can t just keep schools closed indefinitely while we on the assumption that if there s any kid who is vulnerable you can t have schools be open so it s just a tricky balance to strike i think one of the pieces when we talk about people kind of dwelling on people being overweight and therefore vulnerable and blaming them is that i think it dovetails with another kind of sociological piece of all this which i ve written about which is kind of shaming people for improper social distancing or shaming people for having a hard time abiding by the rules of lockdown because in both cases there s a pretty substantial public health literature and kind of experiential record that shaming people is a really bad tool for behavioral change so even if you re going to take into account that yes people who have bigger bodies have bigger risks and that s something that public health officials should be aware of and that s something that individuals should be aware of you re not going to be able to shame them into kind of losing weight in lockdown and in fact it s hard to imagine a worse environment for trying to kind of start really hard grueling behavioral change so just as you kind of can t shame people i don t think into full compliance with social distancing you re not going to shame people into weight loss even if that would protect them from some of the ravages of covid michelle i could not agree with you more i feel like i keep seeing stinginess of spirit when we need generosity of spirit more than ever to get through this and there s something else i think we have to say here which is when we re talking about who seems to be the most likely to be infected who has the worst course of it when they get covid 19 a lot of people who look perfectly fine who are very young who don t get any symptoms if they throw all caution to the wind because they feel invincible they can still nonetheless be spreading it to the most vulnerable to just use the handiest terms available the strong have a responsibility to the weak in this situation and i worry sometimes they forget it yeah although i would say that i think there can be a little bit of an illusion created by twitter about how people are reacting to this i mean i think generally americans have behaved pretty well through all of this and you have strong public support for social distancing across party lines i mean i think you have interesting patterns too where the core of the republican party right now are senior citizens and senior citizens are the most vulnerable and so they re likely to be less than enthusiastic about a sort of well just go out and be warriors kind of mentality so i think americans have done at least decently well under pretty difficult circumstances even if there s been a little too much shaming on twitter com i have been impressed and surprised by how patient to this moment americans have been but i worry that right now that may be breaking down i mean polls still suggest support for social distancing but i m hearing more and more conservative politicians speak more and more bluntly about essentially saying we have to sacrifice a few for the many well and the whole warrior language right it s a completely ridiculous metaphor and again the americans on the front lines they certainly didn t volunteer for this war and they re certainly not the people who work at the supermarkets restaurants and meatpacking plants they didn t volunteer to go to war nor are we treating them like soldiers right if you really want to extend the warrior analogy we should be certainly picking up the cost of their health care no well i just wrote a column that used the war analogy complete with quotes from general patton but i think the war analogy is appropriate to thinking about things like having an army of people tracing cases or even running centralized quarantine systems it s appropriate for thinking about the federal and state responses to this but it s not at all the right way to think about the lives of ordinary people going about their daily lives i guess i m more optimistic that fundamentally the sort of warrior rhetoric is a kind of cable news talk radio bubble and that in reality you can see in the data that states have already started to reopen and people are going to out a little bit more because it s warmer weather but they aren t resuming their normal lives completely people are being it suggests that people are being pretty responsible and that means one the economy is not going to come roaring back despite what donald trump hopes but it also probably means that we re not going to get sort of egregious new york style spikes we re more likely to be in a kind of partially shut down stalemate for a while to come while we await either better policy from the central government or some kind of treatment breakthrough well ross we are glad to be back to normal here on the argument and to have you with us again and in honor of your return you get to give us our weekly recommendation when we suggest something to take people s minds off the news you ve had a couple of weeks to think about something good so lay it on us well so i m going to do two things so we got this thing called the snoo for our new baby which is supposed to be the incredibly state of the art baby bassinet that will actually rock your baby to sleep for you and buy you an extra hour of sleep and i really wanted to give you guys a sort of definite recommendation not that either of you are planning to have a newborn anytime soon but maybe some of our listeners are but then we ve been too chicken to use it it s why well the baby you know she spits up a lot and when we lay her in her crib we sort of prop her up a little bit because we re worried about her spitting up and isn t that illegal stop snitching michelle goldberg laughs no the rules have if anything i think probably just gotten more rigorous but anyway the snoo you like strap them down you swaddle them and then strap them down and so they re flat and anyway so we ve just chickened out and i can t tell you one way or another whether the snoo works or not and we re actually packing it up you can rent it so i recommend renting your high tech labor saving sleep saving baby equipment because it might work for you but if you are like us and are too chicken to actually turn it on you can always send it back music playing that s our show this week thank you for listening if you re liking what you hear please leave us a rating or review in apple podcasts doing that helps other people find the show the

before we start ross welcome back michelle and i missed you did you really frank i know that you got some excellent fill ins for me over the last two weeks and i m just grateful that you were willing to take me back after i bailed on you guys in order to propagate the human species or some nonsense like that well ross the guests we had in your place they couldn t replace you but they were probably getting a little bit more sleep than you are these days they probably are and were and continue to i m speaking to you guys from the attic of my lovely house where we have in fact added one more human being so we now have four children nine and under all the way down to little rosemary who s three weeks old yesterday sharing the great coronavirus lockdown experience and rosemary is wonderful we re very happy to have her and about the experience the less said the better well ross i have no news to rival yours except i should tell our listeners that i m in a sort of techno internet hell in which

the very next thing he said was a defense of his behavior in this case and he said i think if the people writing history are reasonable they will see that i did the right thing which doesn t mean he did the right thing but he wasn t like on network tv bragging about how he had destroyed the very concept of truth of course it was like a sly little fuck you to people who expect some sort of standards in their public servants followed by a justification of his behavior right of course he s not out there saying yes the truth is what the trump regime says it is he s just kind of slyly hinting at that where people who are either in despair over what s become of our liberal democracy or people who are gloating over what they ve been able to do to us but don t you think it s possible that barr who is a man who has always who is a conservative partisan who s always believed strongly in sort of presidential prerogatives genuinely believes that the overreach involved in the investigation of the trump campaign and some of trump s appointees is more of a scandal than the russia scandal itself and that s what s motivating his behavior it s not possible for me to believe that anybody can have that that can be a good faith opinion that anyone holds well see haven t you missed me ross and michelle just to stoke your differing opinions here i think i ve got a question that you ll answer differently so now that the case against flynn has been dropped and we ve had i think both the vice president and president kind of praise him and i think vice president pence the man who supposedly lied to according to previous narratives that now no one s paying much attention to even said something like i d welcome him back ross michelle what should and what will happen to michael flynn from this point forward well my sense is that he s going to become a huge conservative celebrity right you have the trump administration talking about him i believe as their nelson mandela what should happen i don t believe it will happen i think if elizabeth warren for example was the democratic nominee and had promised some sort of retroactive accountability for all the abuses of trump s justice department you might see a prosecution of him for he was also acting and this is also insane that up until the day of the election he was also acting as a paid unregistered foreign agent of the turkish government right so this is another one of these kind of utterly bonkers subplots that just gets lost because there s so much madness around it but part of his plea when he pled guilty was that he wasn t going to face any sort of repercussions for that well presumably his guilty plea is now null and void because he now says that he s not guilty i think it s important to know if that s still on the table or not it certainly should be i don t know that it will be i don t think that a joe biden administration is going to be interested in going back and relitigating all of this stuff but i would love to see a justice department and attorney general adam schiff who went through and tried to again clean up some of the just utter sort of rule of law disaster that they perpetrated on us flynn will be a fox news celebrity and his and his well but i think that if there isn t a trump second term his star will fade a bit and maybe a la oliver north he ll attempt to run for office somewhere but will gradually fade away and i guess to michelle s point i just think that when the trump administration is over and there s a new administration in power or even now you know with the house in democrats control there are probably better uses of the democrats time including uses that involve investigating aspects of the trump administration than going back and reprosecuting michael flynn for failing to register as a foreign lobbyist which is again a kind of seedy and shady thing but not a serious breach of the kind that we normally put presidential appointees in jail for and i think there are bigger things for the enemies of donald trump to focus on than going back and getting michael flynn as it happens right after the case against flynn was dropped former president obama was on a phone call with obama administration alumni as often happens in this day and age someone recorded it and leaked it and he told them in regard to barr s decision to swoop in and drop the flynn case he told them our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk is he being overdramatic ross or does he have a point there i think he was probably being a little bit overdramatic i think that we have plenty of examples including the democratic president of the united states before barack obama who were charged with process crimes and did not ultimately go to jail for them and the rule of law survived i think that again we still don t actually know what flynn said to the fbi and in fact jim comey in testimony before congress before the mueller investigation sort of took off said that the fbi agents didn t necessarily think he lied to them so this is not my central anxiety of what is happening at this moment in the united states of america rule of law or not well we don t know what flynn said but we do know that barr keeps swooping in and swooping in and swooping in let s leave things there next up the coronavirus blame game music playing they re too old they re too fat they were in poor health to begin with or maybe they re poor period or they re brown or black people of color are being especially hard hit by the coronavirus with higher infection rates and higher death rates the same goes for people with chronic illnesses lately when some americans talk about who s suffering most it seems like they re rushing to put those people into categories categories that make it someone else s disease and maybe someone else s problem and while some of what they say is grounded in statistics are they also constructing a false and dangerous sense of safety and are they insinuating that some lives matter less than others ross i d love to hear your thoughts so i think there are two things going on here one there is a kind of frankly dumb narrative that s taken hold among especially certain republicans who are arguing for a quick reopening where they want to emphasize at every turn the extent to which the coronavirus only kills people who have pre existing conditions only kills people who are between the ages of 75 and 95 in an effort to minimize the scale of the problem in order to make a case that we ve overreacted and need to reopen things quickly and finally it ignores what i think is sort of one of the more significant long term stories of the virus which is that we just don t know what kind of damage it does to people who don t die the times carried a big story just the other day about people who just have lingering symptoms that go on and on and on for weeks and probably months and sort of chronic inflammation chronic pain in different places we don t know what kind of long term damage it does to people s lungs you don t want that narrative to take hold at the same time the realities of who gets this and who gets sickest are really important to figuring out how to treat it and how to respond to it and so on there is a lot of evidence for instance that vitamin d deficiency plays some kind of role in making people sicker and the fact is that lots of african americans in colder climates have worse vitamin d deficiency i believe than white people and that is again a really important fact that isn t just an artifact of racism or something like that so there s really important stuff here that needs to be sort of acknowledged and addressed and dealt with without leaping to the narrative that it s not a problem because the old or the sick or the poor are the ones dying you know ross what i worry about and you just talked about that in a very kind of sane and rational public health policy way and you re right we need to know who gets it who suffers the most because that s one of the ways we craft policy i just worry a lot the conversations that say you don t need to worry about this meaning the disease bleed into you don t need to worry about them meaning the people who are hit hardest by the disease and it s a way i think in which people not only exempt themselves from concern about how vulnerable they might be to a kind of bad go round with this but they almost give themselves permission not to be concerned about the whole of it that s what i worry about i think it s so easy for one to bleed into the other i thought it was fascinating for instance to watch the twitter thread of a guy named david lat who was one of the founders of the blog above the law he was hospitalized for covid 19 he was on a ventilator and so he wasn t exactly what people thought of as someone who was kind of in the crosshairs of the coronavirus and of covid 19 they were so focused on finding a reason why it was him and it turned out he had childhood asthma but we don t know that that was a conspirator in this but it was this desire that you could just feel and hear of putting people with this in a box that excludes oneself that becomes a way to ratchet down one s concern across the board that s what concerns me but i mean that to me is understandable i mean at least it s psychologically understandable right i find myself doing it and i push back on it but i think everybody when you re threatened wants to sort of reach for reasons why this might not be you you know and then i ve been sort of flattened by terror at this new syndrome that s affecting children and where there s been a number of children in new york city with this rare inflammatory disease so i do want to know i do find myself thinking was there something else wrong what is the chance that this is going to happen to me and my family and so i feel like that part of it is sort of it s maybe not good but it s understandable michelle as you were talking about that i was recalling it kept coming back into my head a conversation i had with a friend recently and this is a friend who really trusts me as a fairly empathetic person and is sensitive and all those things and she was relaying the news a couple weeks ago i think it was about the death of a 29 year old editor at people magazine this got a bit of attention in the news and on twitter and she said she saw the kind of bulletin that this 29 year old editor at people magazine died she was horrified by that age that kind of contradicted the prevailing coronavirus narrative and then she saw a picture and this editor was significantly significantly overweight and she immediately said oh i saw that and i was so relieved now she s speaking colloquially and sloppily but then you go on twitter and look a little deeper into this and i know we should never judge too much by twitter because it can be a singular sewer and there was in fact a lot of back and forth of people coming close to or actually kind of blaming this woman for her death because she was so overweight it is true and it is important for us to say that it does seem that covid 19 takes a much much worse and more damaging and even fatal course in obese people it s important to get the message out that that s not an ideal state of health but there s a very easy way for that to bleed into a much more harshly judgmental and cruel narrative and maybe i m a little sensitive to this myself my memoir was called born round it was about how fat i used to be and how fat i try not to be and how fat i sometimes end up being regardless and people s lives are pretty complicated and they re in the sorts of situations of health circumstances they are for a whole lot of different reasons and i wish our conversation around this disease would do justice to that i mean i think generally i ve had some battles with illness over the last five years and generally my impression has been that people who are healthy myself included have no idea how easy it is to become unhealthy and how quickly and randomly and strangely it can happen and so there s this sense that you don t even necessarily recognize as a sense but a sense of sort of invincibility if you think of yourself as a healthy person and people want to preserve that sense obviously especially at a moment when there s a deadly disease around but there is also to come back to the balancing act there is a balance you have to strike so to take the outbreaks in meatpacking plants on the one hand it s bad if people end up dismissing the severity of those outbreaks because they re happening to immigrant workers or minorities or poor people and if anything the conditions that we re seeing in meatpacking plants should be a sign that we need greater reforms of those industries that being said if you live in the state of iowa and you have an outbreak in a meatpacking plant that is a very different public health problem than having an outbreak in a suburban and rural town where people are living sort of spread out suburban or ex urban or rural lives and it has different public health implications if most people who are dying are dying in very specific conditions then that affects the choices that public health officials make about lockdowns and distancing and school closures and so on and the same with the kawasaki disease issue that michelle raised i too am really really interested in learning what predisposes kids to get these kind of covid related inflammations but figuring that out is a necessary step to the reality that eventually we re going to have to reopen schools and we re going to have to come up with some kind of public health balance based on the best information but we can t just keep schools closed indefinitely while we on the assumption that if there s any kid who is vulnerable you can t have schools be open so it s just a tricky balance to strike i think one of the pieces when we talk about people kind of dwelling on people being overweight and therefore vulnerable and blaming them is that i think it dovetails with another kind of sociological piece of all this which i ve written about which is kind of shaming people for improper social distancing or shaming people for having a hard time abiding by the rules of lockdown because in both cases there s a pretty substantial public health literature and kind of experiential record that shaming people is a really bad tool for behavioral change so even if you re going to take into account that yes people who have bigger bodies have bigger risks and that s something that public health officials should be aware of and that s something that individuals should be aware of you re not going to be able to shame them into kind of losing weight in lockdown and in fact it s hard to imagine a worse environment for trying to kind of start really hard grueling behavioral change so just as you kind of can t shame people i don t think into full compliance with social distancing you re not going to shame people into weight loss even if that would protect them from some of the ravages of covid michelle i could not agree with you more i feel like i keep seeing stinginess of spirit when we need generosity of spirit more than ever to get through this and there s something else i think we have to say here which is when we re talking about who seems to be the most likely to be infected who has the worst course of it when they get covid 19 a lot of people who look perfectly fine who are very young who don t get any symptoms if they throw all caution to the wind because they feel invincible they can still nonetheless be spreading it to the most vulnerable to just use the handiest terms available the strong have a responsibility to the weak in this situation and i worry sometimes they forget it yeah although i would say that i think there can be a little bit of an illusion created by twitter about how people are reacting to this i mean i think generally americans have behaved pretty well through all of this and you have strong public support for social distancing across party lines i mean i think you have interesting patterns too where the core of the republican party right now are senior citizens and senior citizens are the most vulnerable and so they re likely to be less than enthusiastic about a sort of well just go out and be warriors kind of mentality so i think americans have done at least decently well under pretty difficult circumstances even if there s been a little too much shaming on twitter com i have been impressed and surprised by how patient to this moment americans have been but i worry that right now that may be breaking down i mean polls still suggest support for social distancing but i m hearing more and more conservative politicians speak more and more bluntly about essentially saying we have to sacrifice a few for the many well and the whole warrior language right it s a completely ridiculous metaphor and again the americans on the front lines they certainly didn t volunteer for this war and they re certainly not the people who work at the supermarkets restaurants and meatpacking plants they didn t volunteer to go to war nor are we treating them like soldiers right if you really want to extend the warrior analogy we should be certainly picking up the cost of their health care no well i just wrote a column that used the war analogy complete with quotes from general patton but i think the war analogy is appropriate to thinking about things like having an army of people tracing cases or even running centralized quarantine systems it s appropriate for thinking about the federal and state responses to this but it s not at all the right way to think about the lives of ordinary people going about their daily lives i guess i m more optimistic that fundamentally the sort of warrior rhetoric is a kind of cable news talk radio bubble and that in reality you can see in the data that states have already started to reopen and people are going to out a little bit more because it s warmer weather but they aren t resuming their normal lives completely people are being it suggests that people are being pretty responsible and that means one the economy is not going to come roaring back despite what donald trump hopes but it also probably means that we re not going to get sort of egregious new york style spikes we re more likely to be in a kind of partially shut down stalemate for a while to come while we await either better policy from the central government or some kind of treatment breakthrough well ross we are glad to be back to normal here on the argument and to have you with us again and in honor of your return you get to give us our weekly recommendation when we suggest something to take people s minds off the news you ve had a couple of weeks to think about something good so lay it on us well so i m going to do two things so we got this thing called the snoo for our new baby which is supposed to be the incredibly state of the art baby bassinet that will actually rock your baby to sleep for you and buy you an extra hour of sleep and i really wanted to give you guys a sort of definite recommendation not that either of you are planning to have a newborn anytime soon but maybe some of our listeners are but then we ve been too chicken to use it it s why well the baby you know she spits up a lot and when we lay her in her crib we sort of prop her up a little bit because we re worried about her spitting up and isn t that illegal stop snitching michelle goldberg laughs no the rules have if anything i think probably just gotten more rigorous but anyway the snoo you like strap them down you swaddle them and then strap them down and so they re flat and anyway so we ve just chickened out and i can t tell you one way or another whether the snoo works or not and we re actually packing it up you can rent it so i recommend renting your high tech labor saving sleep saving baby equipment because it might work for you but if you are like us and are too chicken to actually turn it on you can always send it

stitcher is attorney general bill barr s dropping of all charges against michael flynn an utter breakdown of justice or is it absurd to fixate on flynn and dredge the russia investigation up again amid a pandemic this week ross douthat returns to the argument to debate frank bruni and michelle goldberg over just how alarmed americans should be by recent actions of the trump justice department is it corruption and cronyism in overdrive or was flynn s admission of guilt the result of an f b i fishing expedition plus what exactly is obamagate then the columnists discuss the internet s urge to stigmatize the coronavirus infected who have chronic conditions like obesity what is behind the healthy s desire to other the sick and how can we encourage a generosity rather than a stinginess of spirit in this moment of collective crisis and finally ross has a recommendation for new parents don t commit to high tech baby gear background reading ross on what barr signifies to conservative elites and the coronavirus as a war american s aren t exactly winning michelle on just how corrupt barr is and the failure of social shaming to enforce coronavirus rules frank on barr s perverse servility to president trump and a loss of community support in the coronavirus crisis the former columnist william safire on barr the patsy prosecutor i ve been an op ed columnist for the times since 2011 but my career with the newspaper stretches back to 1995 and includes many twists and turns that reflect my embarrassingly scattered interests i covered congress the white house and several political campaigns i also spent five years in the role of chief restaurant critic as the rome bureau chief i reported on the vatican as a staff writer for the times s sunday magazine i wrote many celebrity profiles that jumble has informed my various books which focus on the roman catholic church george w bush my strange eating life the college admissions process and meatloaf politically i m grief stricken over the way president trump has governed and i m left of center but i don t think that the center is a bad place or compromise a dirty word i m italian american i m gay and i write a weekly times newsletter in which you ll occasionally encounter my dog regan who has the run of our manhattan apartment i ve been an op ed columnist since 2009 and i write about politics religion pop culture sociology and the places where they all intersect i m a catholic and a conservative in that order which means that i m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution but i tend to agree with liberals that the republican party is too friendly to the rich i was against donald trump in 2016 for reasons specific to donald trump but in general i think the populist movements in europe and america have legitimate grievances and i often prefer the populists to the reasonable elites i ve written books about harvard the g o p american christianity and pope francis i m working on one about decadence benedict xvi was my favorite pope i review movies for national review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows i have three small children two girls and a boy and i live in new haven conn with my wife i ve been an op ed columnist at the new york times since 2017 writing mainly about politics ideology and gender these days people on the right and the left both use liberal as an epithet but that s basically what i am though the nightmare of donald trump s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward i ve written three books including one in 2006 about the danger of right wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise my other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and in a brief detour from politics about an adventurous russian migr who helped bring yoga to the west i love to travel a long time ago after my husband and i eloped we spent a year backpacking through asia now we live in brooklyn with our son
