 2016 true to form the real estate mogul tries to turn the tables by going on the attack by nick gass 09 04 2015 07 36 am edt updated 09 04 2015 12 45 pm edt ap photo donald trump tore into radio host hugh hewitt as a third rate radio announcer on friday after the republican presidential candidate struggled to answer a question about the leaders of major terrorist groups the previous day the move followed a familiar script for the real estate mogul who has unexpectedly soared to the top of the republican presidential polls when backed into a corner go on the attack and change the headlines advertisement responding to a question about his views on the iran deal and the country s elite quds force from the washington post s david ignatius on msnbc s morning joe trump took the opportunity to take a shot at the california based radio personality who will incidentally be asking questions at the next gop debate on sept 16 and by the way when you say quds vs kurds i thought he said kurds this third rate radio announcer that i did the show for it was like gotcha gotcha every question was do i know this one and that one you know he worked hard on that i thought he said kurds trump said by the way i do think the kurds while we re on it i do think the kurds are not being utilized properly and not being treated properly by us hewitt in a statement to politico said he thought many of trump s answers were excellent but that we disagree on what constitutes a gotcha question dt has been my guest four times in the past 30 days and i hope he keeps coming back hewitt said referring to trump best interview in america but i won t change my debate prep or question set because of his or others critiques or praise i ask questions that i think many gop primary voters are interested in whether of dt or all the other gopers others interviewed this week include christie graham huckabee rubio and walker as well as fiorina twice they all get tough questions with some overlap and some new ones each time hewitt on his show on thursday asked trump i m looking for the next commander in chief to know who hassan nasrallah is and zawahiri and al julani and al baghdadi do you know the players without a scorecard yet donald trump the refereneces to the respective leaders of hezbollah al qaeda jabhat al nusra and the islamic state appeared to stump trump no trump said by nick gass you know i ll tell you honestly i think by the time we get to office they ll all be changed they ll be all gone trump said i knew you were going to ask me things like this and there s no reason because no 1 i ll find i will hopefully find gen douglas macarthur in the pack trump by going on the attack on friday is taking on another major figure in conservative media after aggressively insulting fox news host megyn kelly in the wake of last month s presidential debate while some had predicted the feud with kelly and fox news chairman roger ailes would be trump s undoing it appears only to have empowered him trump also found at least some support from gop rival rand paul telling sirius xm i also do think that running through a list of every different arabic name and asking somebody to respond to them is maybe a little bit of a game of gotcha paul went on to say but i do think knowing the difference between hamas and hezbollah knowing the difference between shiites and sunnis and knowing a little bit of the history or a significant amount of the history of what s been going on in the middle east is important for our next leader i m not into defending donald trump and you won t find it very often but i think some interviewers do like to play this game but florida sen marco rubio had no such sympathy telling cnn that trump s answers are very concerning this should be part of the reason why you are running because you understand the threats that the world is facing you have deep understanding and you understand what to do about it he continued though did not mention trump by name and if someone doesn t i think it is very concerning speaking friday on morning joe trump again called the iran deal disastrous on several fronts including the number of americans who remain imprisoned in the country the 24 day waiting period allowed for some inspections among other aspects of the contract that people aren t even talking about including one that we re supposed to essentially come to their defense the iranians defense and if israel attacks where are we by nick gass well believe me that ll never happen but how do they agree to things like this we have a horrible contract but we do have a contract i have all of my life i ve loved to buy bad contracts when key people go bust and i make those contracts good this is a perfect example of taking over a bad contract trump said adding that he recognized the popularity of ripping up the contract but life doesn t work that way trump also weighed in on the situation with kentucky county clerk kim davis remarking that same sex marriage is the law of the land and that if davis is unwilling to grant marriage licenses someone on her staff should do so i would say the simple answer is let her clerks do it trump said missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news every morning in your inbox 2020 politico llc
