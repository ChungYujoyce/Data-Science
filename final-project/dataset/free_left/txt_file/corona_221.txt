advertisement supported by with his coronavirus briefings gov andrew cuomo has emerged as an authoritative voice in the crisis by jesse mckinley and shane goldmacher albany n y gov andrew m cuomo awoke before dawn on tuesday emerging after a few hours sleep to board a helicopter to new york city for the coronavirus briefing that has become a daily ritual for him and for the millions of people now watching but this event would be different the outbreak was moving faster than he had expected with the number of confirmed cases doubling every three days and he decided he needed to show people including the white house how desperate the situation had become you want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators the governor said referring to a recent federal government shipment to new york what am i going to do with 400 ventilators when i need 30 000 he said later you pick the 26 000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators the governor repeatedly assailed the federal response as slow inefficient and inadequate far more aggressively than he had before mr cuomo was once considered a bit player on the national stage an abrasive presence who made his share of enemies among his democratic party peers he was too much of a pragmatist for his party s progressive wing too self focused for party leaders and too brusque for nearly everyone but now he is emerging as the party s most prominent voice in a time of crisis his briefings articulate consistent and often tinged with empathy have become must see television on tuesday his address was carried live on all four networks in new york and a raft of cable news stations including cnn msnbc and even fox news in a sign of the way mr cuomo has become the face of the democratic party in this moment his address even pre empted an appearance by former vice president joseph biden on abc s the view in new york mr cuomo s handling of the crisis has fostered a nationwide following mr biden called mr cuomo s briefings a lesson in leadership and others have described them as communal therapy sessions the same blunt and sometimes paternalistic traits that have long rubbed his critics raw have morphed into a source of comfort the governor s actions have not always been at the forefront he waited several days last week as the count of confirmed cases continued to rise before instituting an order to close nonessential businesses and ask residents to stay at home even as gov gavin newsom of california had already done so the question of whether to enact a shelter in place edict degenerated into a semantics debate with mayor bill de blasio resurfacing a petty feud between the two new york democrats mr cuomo also changed course within the span of a sunday afternoon deciding to close new york city s schools hours after casting doubt on such a plan still mr cuomo s daily addresses have stood in stark contrast to the sometimes contradictory pronouncements coming from washington mr cuomo s briefings have been filled with facts directives and sobering trends on tuesday the governor disclosed that the number of positive cases in new york had risen past 25 000 and that the state now projects it will need up to 140 000 hospital beds to house virus patients there were also signs that washington was listening after mr cuomo spoke on tuesday vice president mike pence said 2 000 ventilators were being sent to new york with a promise of 2 000 more on wednesday mr cuomo s explanation for his popularity is simple i m not doing anything different than i have ever done the governor said in an interview on monday it s just a bigger audience and it s a more intense time that fire was evident on tuesday as he disparaged a remark by texas s lieutenant governor that older residents might not mind dying to save the economy my mother s not expendable mr cuomo said adding we re not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable and we re not going to put a dollar figure on human life since the crisis began to take shape the governor s aggressive posture has won compliments from admirers ranging from conservative pundits like sean hannity who recently hosted mr cuomo on his radio show to the progressive comedian chelsea handler i m officially attracted to andrew cuomo even president trump has taken notice his team has scheduled his appearances in the afternoon so as not to interfere with mr cuomo s briefings including on tuesday when the president s town hall event on fox news began after the governor s briefing ended transcript from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily today for the past decade governors have been relegated to the sidelines of american politics alex burns on how the pandemic is changing that it s friday april 3 so alex up until the past few months how would you describe the role of governors in the united states look i think that they were very much the supporting cast of american politics they perform a function that i think people in their states recognize is super important but they have not been seen for a decade or more now as the kind of people who the great mass of american voters look to for inspiration direction national leadership in any kind of crisis you said a decade or more so that s a change right now for most of that three or four decades prior to that governors were seen as the most capable leaders in the country between 1976 and 2008 the country was exclusively led in the white house by former governors except for a four year period i remember when i announced for president in december of 1974 jimmy carter there was a major headline on the editorial page of the atlanta constitution that said jimmy carter s running for what and the what the what was about this big followed by ronald reagan good evening to all of you from california tonight i d like to talk to you about issues a little interregnum there for george hw bush then back to bill clinton welcome to one of my favorite places the old state house is an important building to all arkansans but it s particularly special to me then george w bush i come from texas i ve got a record as a governor i ve been setting agendas it was a country led for decades by governors and starting with barack obama and now obviously president trump that pattern has been totally broken and why do you think that was during that 30 or 40 year that we all looked to governors you know for decades governors would run for president on a narrative of getting stuff done and so many of the issues that were at the forefront of american politics relating to the size and function of government relating to the budget and education and health care issues like abortion rights these were issues that governors could deal with at the state level and then take that narrative to the national level starting in 2008 and really the years before that all politics become so heavily nationalized the media environment is totally different where people are learning about the political scene more from cable news and the internet than from their local paper and the issues facing the country are so much bigger or seem so much bigger than the issues facing any one state the iraq war the financial crisis and the great recession these are not challenges that a governor necessarily has a good story to tell about confronting so the nationalization of american politics is kind of the death knell for the governor as the go to figure in our politics so how does this crisis change that dynamic you know i think it didn t need to change that dynamic but because you have had such absent or inconsistent leadership from the federal level for months now it has really fallen to leaders on the state level to deal one by one with this crisis that has completely consumed everything else going on in public life and when do you think you started to see that when it came to the governors i want to welcome everyone to the state of washington a place where people are very much united and active and confident in our ability to take strong measures to slow down the spread of this epidemic so this really starts in washington state which is the first place in the country with a large cluster of coronavirus cases i m very pleased that the seven million people in washington i think are united themselves as being leaders in acting responsibly right now and i want to jay inslee he s a respected longtime figure in democratic politics he ran for president last year for a couple months on a platform of mainly confronting climate change and he became sort of a popular figure in the party but didn t make it very far in the democratic race so starting today i am ordering pursuant to my emergency powers that certain events in kings snohomish and pierce county with more than 250 people are prohibited by order of the governor early in march he takes steps to lock down big sections of his state especially in the seattle area which has the most severe early outbreak of the coronavirus go ahead what are the penalties exactly for not abiding by the ban the penalties are you might be killing your granddad if you don t do it and i m serious about this the principle reason this is going to work is for people to understand the consequences of lack of community responsibility not far from washington state you have other outbreaks in california the fact is the experience we re having on the ground throughout the state of california require us to adjust our thinking and to adjust our activities where governor gavin newsom a guy who has been talked about in democratic politics for a long time as a future presidential candidate decides by the middle of the month that he is going to need to take much more aggressive steps than the federal government and there s a recognition of our interdependence that requires of this moment that we direct a statewide order for people to stay at home he is one of the first big state governors to issue what we now think of as a lockdown order we are confident that the people of the state of california will abide by it they ll do the right thing they ll meet this moment they ll step up and they have we re now at a critical time here in ohio in regard to the coronavirus but it s not just democrats and it s not just heavily coastal urban states taking these kinds of steps in march the decisions that we make as individuals in the next few days the next several weeks will really determine how many lives are going to be lost in ohio pretty early in the month you also have mike dewine the republican governor of ohio taking some of the most aggressive measures to close schools ban large public gatherings even at a point when ohio has a tiny number of confirmed cases but at the time that mike dewine essentially shuts down ohio you don t have any kind of message like that coming from the leader of his own party president trump and here is the truth with or without a test the virus is here it lives among us and we must be at war with it this enemy is dangerous it is relentless and we must stop it from surviving multiplying and thriving but at this point in the middle of march most governors are not taking steps like these at all and many governors are not even speaking publicly about the coronavirus as a looming threat to their own states it is deep breath time that s why all of a sudden andrew cuomo comes to the forefront this first of all this is not our first rodeo with this type of situation in new york 1968 we had the hong kong flu 2009 we had the swine flu avian flu ebola sars mers and what strikes you about the way cuomo is handling this look when you have a national scale crisis typically it is the president who people hear from every day about the threat that is coming into their homes and into their neighborhoods and what their government is going to be doing to help protect them that s not happening here from the white house where it does start to happen is albany where andrew cuomo who is one of the longest serving most prominent governors in the country in the state that is home to much of the national media uses that platform to speak to an audience across his state but well beyond his state about the dilemma confronting governors like him this is a dramatic time and an unprecedented time and great challenges require great leaders and great solutions and that s what this is every single day now the country hears from andrew cuomo about the nature of the threat confronting new york in many cases the really specific resourcing issues facing the state we have 53 000 hospital beds in the state of new york we have 3 000 icu beds this is the kind of nitty gritty of governing that most americans have not paid a whole lot of attention to over the last decade at least as it pertains to government at the state level he mixes it together with these sort of philosophizing pep talks for the state sometimes in these positions you have to make difficult decisions talking about the emotional strain and the anxiety that people are facing in a way that i think most people would traditionally expect from a president but my adage in these disasters emergencies has always been do everything you can prepare for the worst hope for the best and the most consistent message throughout all this time is that the measures he is taking are an effort to hold back the worst of the problem but that in order to actually meet the problem and fix the problem he is going to need a lot more help from the federal government each of these governors is experiencing what is probably the most important moment in their political lives they are all saying quite pointedly that they cannot master this moment on their own that without the resources and the leadership of the federal government there is only so much that each state can do piece by piece we ll be right back alex so far we ve talked about what a handful of early acting governors have been up to as this pandemic has spread across the country and more and more governors have to decide how to approach this how are you seeing that breakdown kind of governor by governor well by late march this morning i have signed an executive order which institutes a stay at home directive no maryland resident should be leaving their home you have 16 states that are in some form of lockdown today i m issuing a stay home stay safe executive order for all michiganders with a population totaling nearly half the country i signed a second executive order stating clearly that the rules i have laid out supersede all other orders issued by county or municipal officials they are a sobering reminder of the challenge we are confronting as one new jersey family as i ve said before most of these states are pretty blue pretty urban there are a couple redder states in there states with republican governors but for the most part the overarching pattern here is big states with democratic governors moving fastest but that of course creates a pretty messy and inconsistent approach in a state by state way that s right and some of the biggest states in the country that don t have cases detected early governors who are inclined to act aggressively go weeks and weeks without taking similar steps these are states largely with conservative republican governors who are closely aligned with president trump florida is probably the best example of this this is a state governed by a republican named ron desantis his whole campaign in 2018 was about his support for president trump and he doesn t shut down the state for weeks and weeks you know it s just a different situation we re a big diverse state if you look at new york state obviously new york city surrounding areas some of the other places yeah they re just in a different situation but i look forward to the guidelines and he gets publicly frustrated with people leaving other states that are locked down and coming to florida pointing a finger at new york in particular but yet people are riding the subway in new york city people fly all over the place from some of the hot zones i mean you know really how does that make any sense if we re trying to contain this thing but this is what happens when you don t have a uniform response around the country and it becomes very very clear over the course of march and the very beginning of april that florida is going to have a huge problem on its hands alex you have identified a bunch of contiguous states in the south where the leaders generally republicans loyal to president trump seem resistant to closing down their states and i wonder why you think that that is the case you know i think some of this is ideological that republican governors and particularly southern governors have a different view of whether it s appropriate and when it s appropriate for a governor to use his power to halt business commerce normal cultural life some of these states are more rural states and in much of the country i think even to this day there s still the perception that the coronavirus is an urban problem and clearly that is the case that it is an urban problem but it s also clear that it s not just an urban problem and you know in so many of these southern states it really does also boil down to loyalty to the president and partisanship governor desantis in florida is really the perfect example of this so i m in contact with them and basically you know i ve said are you guys recommending this as he for weeks and weeks resists taking more aggressive action to mandate social distancing says pretty much explicitly if the white house told me to act differently the task force has not recommended that to me if they do you know obviously that would be something that would carry a lot of weight with me that would carry a lot of weight with me it s as close as we get to hearing a republican governor who s not taking action say to the white house please tell me what to do and so it s not an accident that the republican governors for the most part who do break with the president are people who are so well established in their home states like mike dewine or who are leading states that aren t really that conservative to begin with like maryland and massachusetts where they may have more political freedom to go their own way than a republican governor of georgia in president trump s republican party i can also imagine how as a governor of a more rural state where the virus is not really hugely present there would be a natural inclination not to shut down social and commercial life because many of those states kind of have an institutional social distance houses are really far away from each other there isn t density and so it would be natural to wait until the federal government said no no no you need to do this now i think that s really right and i think that sort of magnifying that even further the governors in these states are largely elected by constituencies who are the most representative of the dynamics that you re talking about that the republican governor of georgia which is not an overwhelmingly rural state is elected with the overwhelming support of the rural parts of the state so even at the point where you see an outbreak in atlanta an outbreak in miami or tampa or jacksonville the governors of these states still have to worry about pressure from the business community statewide and from voters who may see what s going on in miami or atlanta as largely irrelevant to their own lives and so these governors are really looking to the white house for leadership and direction on what exactly they should be doing we will be extending our guidelines to april 30 to slow the spread on tuesday we will be finalizing these plans and providing a summary of our findings supporting data and strategy to the american people right and they got it many of them in the last couple of days is my sense when the president disclosed those really scary models that said they re shocking numbers you know you re talking about deaths even at the low end you were shocked when you see 100 000 and 120 000 and 200 000 people over potentially a very short period of time 200 000 could die and it felt like one by one the holdout states started to lock themselves down the president just the other day announced they are going to do a 30 day extension for the current guidelines i mean i think it s clear that that represents effectively a national pause that s really how you know so much of this was about partisanship and presidential leadership when the president goes out and says basically best case scenario 100 000 people are going to die you see one by one these states flip almost overnight so given those circumstances and given the unique situation in florida i m going to be doing an executive order today directing all floridians to limit movements and personal interactions outside the home to only those so in the end alex now that we know that a lot of these holdouts would only act when they got a definitive signal from the president to act and in some cases that meant waiting months into this pandemic do we think that there are going to be meaningful consequences either good or bad for the governors who waited as these governors did or for the governors who acted very early on behalf of their constituents you know right now the public opinion information we have suggests that governors across the board are enjoying a real surge in confidence and support from their voters the overwhelming political test going forward is going to be how did you handle this crisis and how many lives did you save and how quickly did you bring back the economy looking at the trend lines in the states that have moved most slowly to confront this it s hard not to anticipate a very very difficult stretch for these governors as the consequences of their choices become really clear finally alex i wonder about another aspect of this the rule of the president typically as the source of calm and comfort in moments like this thinking of course of f d r and his fireside chats that hasn t necessarily happened here it has been instead the governors that s right you know what people have heard from president trump when he has been attempting to calm the country has been a message that this isn t so bad and it might actually be over pretty fast that s a message he has moved off of in the last week what they have been hearing from governors in time of war we have to make sacrifices and i thank each and every one of you for all that you are doing every single day has been a different kind of candor about just how tough this is going to be and how long it might last this crisis can take a toll on our mental health check in with family call your loved ones go for a walk read those books on your list or even go outside and put your holiday lights back up really a pretty direct message of comfort to people who are understandably really scared right now practice humanity we don t talk about practicing humanity but now if ever there s a time to practice humanity the time is now the time is now to show some kindness show some compassion you hear them talking with a level of emotional rawness and directness about the difficulty ahead really telling their states that they are facing many many long and difficult months and asking voters to trust them that it will be ok in the end alex thank you very much thank you i am convinced that we can do this we can do this we must keep our wits about us that means all of us yeah we have a problem yes we will deal with it yes we will overcome it but let s find out better selves in doing it here s what else you need to know today on thursday the department of labor said that 6 6 million americans filed for unemployment benefits last week as the pandemic wiped out jobs across the economy over the past two weeks 10 million americans have filed for such benefits in what economists are describing as a financial catastrophe and house speaker nancy pelosi during a conference call called a stunning development more than 6 6 million filing for unemployment last week alone doesn t that just not take your breath away i mean the virus does too but 2 6 million filing for unemployment the job losses are now a global phenomenon in britain almost one million people have applied for welfare benefits austria has its highest unemployment rate since the end of world war ii in norway the unemployment rate has jumped from 2 3 to 10 4 and in spain more than 800 000 workers have lost their jobs meanwhile the times reports that the u s is expected to advise all americans to begin wearing masks or some form of face covering whenever they go out in public to avoid spreading the virus the daily is made by theo

took issue on tuesday with the governor s comments about not receiving enough ventilators from the federal emergency management agency we are working very very hard for the people of new york the president said we are working a lot with him then i watch him on this show complaining with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer practically sequestered in negotiations over economic relief measures and mr biden at home in wilmington del mr cuomo has effectively offered the democratic response he represents the kind of leadership we should have in the presidency and don t said representative jackie speier a california democrat who said her west coast constituents are praising mr cuomo his stock has gone way up for all of that positive press the sudden spotlight has shone on mr cuomo at a politically inopportune time his friend mr biden is quickly closing in on the democratic presidential nomination something that mr cuomo like his father the former gov mario m cuomo had been said to covet mr cuomo has consistently insisted he s happy in albany where he has a deep understanding of levers of power as the first cases appeared in new york for example mr cuomo secured 40 million from the legislature to fight the virus as part of a bill that also greatly expanded his authority over disaster management something he said he knew he would need as the virus began to spread outside of china anyone who was watching realized it right away mr cuomo said adding it was inevitable that what happened in china was going to happen here since then the governor has used his executive authority to close schools shutter broadway and send the national guard to support the beleaguered residents of new rochelle a suburb just north of new york city that was an early hot spot for the virus and while the state s high caseload has put him on the front lines and the front page he may ultimately be judged by the final toll of the crisis which he has said could last six months or more mr cuomo acknowledged that he is on a steep learning curve in dealing with the pandemic and that mistakes might be made on the day mr cuomo ordered the closure of nonessential businesses he said i accept full responsibility if someone is unhappy somebody wants to blame someone people complain about someone blame me updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities mr cuomo s forthrightness has led to praise from an unlikely and diverse set of commentators george conway the conservative attorney who is also the husband of white house counselor kellyanne conway he s doing a terrific job with these presentations nikki haley the former united nations ambassador and a potential future republican candidate for president i look forward to watching gov cuomo s news conference every day and even the leading strategists for his old rivals in new york a large measure of mr cuomo s sudden popularity seems to lie in the tonal and material differences between his briefings and those of mr trump s i think the rest of the country is witnessing and appreciating this because of the lack of leadership coming from the white house representative grace meng a new york democrat and vice chair of the democratic national committee said ms meng said democratic lawmakers in congress are now tuning into mr cuomo daily and then group texting about what he says every morning they watch gov cuomo and his briefing and discuss it on our text chains she said but unlike most democrats mr cuomo has been careful to not criticize mr trump personally for the federal government s response to the virus while not sparing agencies like fema which he castigated on tuesday in fact he has praised the president and the vice president by name on several occasions a calculated strategy that paid earlier dividends the state s public health laboratory in albany wadsworth center was the first to be given approval by the f d a to administer its own coronavirus tests independent of the centers for disease control and prevention a military hospital ship is now planning to port at the new york harbor and a raft of federal field hospitals will be constructed in and around new york city now one of the epicenters of the virus in the world mr cuomo s approach to mr trump has contrasted with the more confrontational style of mayor de blasio who has frequently blamed mr trump for not acting decisively to attempt to curb the spread of the virus while the president seemed displeased with mr cuomo s broadside on tuesday he had previously made it clear that he preferred the governor s approach to that of city hall i m dealing with the governor mr trump said on friday the governor agrees with me and i agree with him even on tuesday before the president criticized mr cuomo for complaining he acknowledged that he had just seen the governor s briefing i watched governor cuomo and he was very nice mr trump said the governor has a history of course of working with republicans until 2019 the new york legislature had largely been split by virtue of the republicans long hold on the state senate a situation which some progressive groups accused mr cuomo of encouraging as a way to thwart policies he felt were too liberal or impractical the governor also shares other personal touch points with mr trump they are both from queens have known each other for years and have followed in their fathers footsteps mr cuomo s father who looms large in the current governor s life also had a moment of national prominence the famed shining city on a hill speech in 1984 which seemed poised to propel him to higher office it did not mr cuomo has found a poetic almost sentimental streak amid the dark news appearing alongside his daughters at news conferences and naming a new law aimed at protecting older residents from infection for his mother matilda on monday sitting with his daughter cara kennedy cuomo the governor said the crisis had afforded him opportunity to spend more time with her as she has volunteered to help with the state s response staying with him in the governor s mansion she s going to go do her thing but this crazy situation is crazy as it is came with this beautiful gift mr cuomo said so one door closes another door opens think about that jonathan martin
