 simi valley calif the last time carly fiorina was here theformer hewlett packard chief executive sketched out her foreign policy blueprint one thousand people heard her condemn the slow training of anti islamic state forces the ambitions of china and the wonky tooth to tail ratio of military power to military bureaucracy it was sober it was serious it was basically ignored like much of this summer s political news fiorina s july speech was subsumed by donald trump it inspired only a fraction of the news searches that rolling stone attracted last week when it quoted trump seemingly making fun of her looks according to google trends data the rise of trump and of retired neurosurgeon ben carson two first time candidates who prefer broad strokes to policy debates has left the republican establishment looking confused and helpless originally expecting a clash of ideas among a diverse talented field the establishment s national security brahmins paired up with candidates and got to work only to be blown out of the conversation by trump that has left some republicans hoping that wednesday s debate will break the fever and change the tenor of the race from flashy to substantive hugh hewitt the syndicated orange county radio host who will co moderate the event has promised to grill candidates about geopolitics and world leaders if that happens the debate will become a crucial test for trump and carson and for the staying power of their campaigns trump in texas we are a dumping ground for the rest of the world if this isn t the moment to finally get serious when the hell will it be asked sen lindsey o graham s c another republican presidential contender is the next time we get serious about foreign policy going to be when we get attacked everybody criticizes barack obama s foreign policy everybody knows he has no strategy in iraq and syria but we need something specific to replace that if we don t hear that from the candidates this week will have been a waste of time graham is an unwilling mascot for how foreign policy has fallen out of the primary debate just months ago he was engaged in a near daily debate with fellow gop candidate rand paul the libertarian leaning senator from kentucky over issues including iran and the islamic state i m running graham said because the world is falling apart on wednesday afternoon graham will join former senator rick santorum pa another longtime washington hawk at the four man second tier debate santorum is at least invited to a policy focused forum later this week in greenville s c hosted by heritage action for america graham who lives near the venue is not video where trump stands on foreign policy that will leave the task of vetting carson and trump on wednesday to nine other candidates and the moderators neither front runner has laid out a specific plan for attacking the islamic state trump consistently has told audiences that he has a secret plan that he cannot share lest the enemy find out both candidates have been light on strategies for other crises sen john mccain r ariz chairman of the senate armed services committee and the 2008 republican presidential nominee lamented how little attention has been paid to foreign policy there certainly hasn t been very serious discussion of it because of the nature of the campaign mccain said just rhetoric mccain added about trump he s not been asked tough questions he s said he wants to deport 11million people how do you do that he hasn t answered that question he said in the middle east he would go and quote take their oil i d like to know how you do that i think the american people deserve an explanation not all of them want one at least not yet trump and carson both bombed interviews with hew itt to no appreciable effect in march carson appeared not to realize that the baltic states were nato members asked about the fumble he explained that a president would have access to a lot of experts in a lot of areas and that he would not be stymied by gotcha questions you don t want to devote all your attention to learning facts on a fact sheet he said his standing has grown dramatically since then trump under more scrutiny fared even worse he d previously told meet the press host chuck todd that his foreign policy advice came from watching sunday talk shows and talking to national security hawks faced with hewitt s questions trump seemed to confuse iran s quds forces for the decidedly non iranian kurds and he couldn t describe the difference between hezbollah and hamas it was a disaster compounded by fiorina s largely adroit answers to the same questions yet like every disaster of trump s summer it did not halt his momentum in poll after poll he has held his position as front runner of the republican field since early july hewitt meanwhile returned to his debate prep with some new thinking about how to really draw out the candidate i don t think those questions quiz questions about knowledge tell you anything about understanding hewitt said knowing names is dumb that s not necessary i wish i had phrased my question to trump as general soleimani who leads the quds forces is about to get 100billion what will the impact of that be that s what i wanted to ask and it went off the rails it s true that trump s and carson s actual positions have been largely unexamined and have remained room shaking applause lines at his rallies trump offers audiences a vision of an america that s always winning that learned from the iraq war which he came out against 16 months after the invasion that is ready to take the oil from conquered islamic state territory we re going to have so many victories he told more than 10 000 people in dallas on monday at some point it s going to be coming out of your ears he offered no more detail tuesday in los angeles when he delivered what was billed as a national security speech we re going to make our military so big and so strong and so great it s going to be so powerful that no one is going to want to mess with us he said carson has offered a lower decibel version of the same idea minus the oil seizures at a rally last week in anaheim calif carson said that some generals had told him that the islamic state could be defeated easily if the military s hands aren t tied in anaheim and at a later rally in a houston suburb carson said he would oblige i would use every resource including financial resources offensive and defense resources covert and overt activities he said in texas i would use everything possible not to contain them but to destroy them for the people who study foreign policy and try to shape the national conversation the simple answers from carson and trump are frustrating yet totally understandable the rise of the islamic state has stoked panic among some conservative voters but it has not defined their conversations in the most recent gallup poll conducted in august only 19percent of voters listed a foreign policy issue as the most important problem facing this country today only 3percent said specifically that the biggest problem was the islamic state the gop s hawks have tried with little success to sober up the base former vice president richard b cheney and his daughter liz reemerged last week with a book exceptional and an argument about how the party must rediscover its inner hawk they sold 14 000 copies according to nielsen s bookscan service yet they were stymied by a problem bedeviling former florida governor jeb bush s white house bid lingering ill will toward the administration of his brother george w bush both trump and carson tell voters they are right to be skeptical of military adventures in the wake of the iraq war the debate about what a serious foreign policy may look like has been paused and every other candidate wants to change that we haven t even begun the substance part of the campaign said paul who has fallen in most polls but will take part in the main debate it s really been about celebrity and really sophomoric insults i think the beginning of the decline of trump is at hand might have begun with perry dropping out the media and the voters may be starting to ask oh my goodness we are promoting something bad for the country do we want someone this unserious in charge of our nuclear arsenal mike debonis in washington contributed to this report mike debonis in
