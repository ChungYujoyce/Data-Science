 2016 he insists he isn t giving up on the state but his schedule suggests otherwise by gabriel debenedetti 02 24 2016 05 05 am est updated 02 24 2016 10 29 am est vermont sen bernie sanders waits to speak to the crowd at the jenkins orphanage in north charleston south carolina nov 21 2015 ap photo columbia s c with just a few days until the south carolina democratic primary bernie sanders is all but writing the state off he hasn t said that of course but his schedule reflects it advertisement sanders was in massachusetts monday night and virginia tuesday morning while he attended a televised town hall in south carolina tuesday night and followed with an early morning news conference his itinerary wednesday consisted of events in kansas city missouri and tulsa oklahoma after that his schedule called for a trip to ohio thursday with stops in other march voting states likely to be added an aide said a candidate s time is a campaign s most precious resource so by spending so much of it somewhere other than south carolina the sanders campaign is engaging in the cold calculus of primary politics making the tough decision to send the senator to the states where he expects to be the most competitive by daniel strauss it s a reflection of the cloudy outlook in south carolina where hillary clinton currently holds a double digit lead in every poll ahead of saturday s primary but also of sanders strategic map through mid march the campaign s goal is to project the message that he is running a durable national campaign and central to that plan is a strong showing on super tuesday march 1 followed by solid performances in big state primaries like michigan on march 8 and ohio on march 15 asked whether he was writing the state off at his morning news conference an opportunity for him to get into the local media stream before he headed off to missouri sanders said nooo noo no no no we came to south carolina and if you look at the polls we were at 7 8 9 percent in the polls we were 50 60 70 points behind we have waged a very vigorous campaign we have closed the gap very significantly he said nonetheless he conceded this from day one was going to be a very difficult state for us we re not writing off south carolina but you all know there are a dozen states voting on march 1 sanders and his aides bristle at the idea that they re giving up on south carolina partly because they ve invested in a large local organization for months and because of sanders widely publicized struggles courting african american voters they re eager to avoid the perception that his choice to effectively stop campaigning in a state where black voters make up more than half of the democratic primary electorate implies he s ceding the black vote to clinton all across the country bernie invested a lot of time and money and has a sizable operation here they re certainly not skipping the state said brady quirk garvan chairman of the charleston county democratic party but it s clear their focus is on tuesday and moving forward past south carolina after barely mentioning south carolina in his speech and communications to supporters upon losing nevada on saturday sanders was forced to face that question the next day on cbs face the nation insisting that he was not skipping the state i m talking to you from columbia south carolina we have a major rally this evening we re not skipping over anything he told host john dickerson sunday flashing some irritation at the implication but i think that after south carolina we have 11 states we stand a good chance of winning a number of those states indeed the sanders campaign is keeping surrogates like actor and activist danny glover and former naacp president ben jealous in the state while maintaining its ads on the air and on the radio and on tuesday the campaign released a spot featuring spike lee as part of its effort to grow sanders share of the black vote by eliza collins sanders himself held several south carolina events sunday but in a sign of his deficit with the black voters who will likely decide the democratic primary the senator struggled to win attention amid a crowd of roughly 800 churchgoers at the largely black brookland baptist church in west columbia even as jealous tried to invoke barack obama s historic 2008 campaign in his introduction at his large energetic rally in greenville that night the crowd was overwhelmingly white meanwhile recognizing the political opportunity presented here clinton is re doubling her efforts plastering the state with campaign appearances and surrogate events over the rest of the week she s hoping to run up the score and come away with a considerable delegate lead not only is she spending a lot of time here but the number of surrogates and the number of events they re doing you can t cross the street without crossing a hillary event said quirk garvan they know they re going to win and this is about running up the score and having a decisive victory the former secretary of state s team believes her plan to stay in south carolina for the rest of the week will help her gain a big delegate margin from the state while allowing her to jump to other southern states like georgia on friday if she wants to shore up her support there ahead of march 1 she has the added benefit of former president bill clinton making the rounds for her in other key super tuesday states colorado oklahoma and texas so far this week with a virginia stop coming wednesday that s a tactic that the sanders camp recognizes but doesn t have the luxury of pursuing with super tuesday when 11 states will hold democratic contests fast approaching sanders is merely engaging in a bit of political triage in south carolina his campaign needs to perform well in the first half of march to stay competitive against clinton people close to sanders didn t expect so much of the national media coverage following nevada to portray clinton as having regained her stride and they re now looking to super tuesday where in a handful of states sanders is ahead in the polls or is running competitively as a means of checking her momentum which they hope also will be limited by super tuesday s quick arrival on the heels of south carolina since each state in the primary process allocates its delegates to the convention proportionally the sanders camp figures he ll walk away from south carolina with some delegates no matter what and recognizing that the vermont senator does better when he can spend serious time in states aides think as long as he can claim enough delegates between march 1 and 15 from the ones he s now visiting he can remain neck and neck with clinton through the month if that plan works said a senior sanders aide it will be because he performs well all across the country while clinton s big wins will have largely been concentrated in the south that would enable the underdog s camp to make the point that he s a national not regional candidate by gabriel debenedetti still with sanders momentum seemingly stalled here as voting nears one clinton camp concern is managing expectations despite her wide lead in the polls press secretary brian fallon sought to tamp down overconfidence with a tweet suggesting the margin could be in the single digits but at sanders 5 200 person rally in greenville on sunday night the senator made a slight concession of his own instead of his predicting that his host state would help spur on his political revolution or predicting victory as he often does he subtly lowered hopes for the crowd as far as making history goes sanders told the assembled they simply have an opportunity missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and
