advertisement supported by news analysis by michael barbaro for much of his career in washington ted cruz has been dismissed as a cartoonish sideshow an ostrich boot wearing ideologue who once delivered a sleep inducing 21 hour monologue on the floor of the senate reading from the children s story green eggs and ham a wacko bird in the words of a republican colleague senator john mccain of arizona on thursday night that simplistic superficial image was swept away mr cruz did not just dominate much of the republican debate he slashed he mocked he charmed and he outmaneuvered everybody else onstage but none as devastatingly and as thoroughly as this campaign s most commanding performer donald j trump in the process mr cruz the high school student who once recited the constitution from memory and the princeton debater who dazzled judges with his ability to entrap less shrewd rivals showed the american public that his surging candidacy is not a fluke twenty six minutes into what had been a slug free evening a moderator asked mr cruz about a question that mr trump has mischievously injected into their neck and neck competition whether mr cruz s canadian birth disqualifies him from serving as president transcript na mr cruz was ready he started off with an expression of generosity you know back in september my friend donald said he had had his lawyers look at this every which way he said his hands sweeping the air to dismiss the topic there was nothing to this this birther issue mr cruz said mimicking the man standing directly to his right he paused to let that sink in as the crowd began to applaud then he delivered the blow now since september the constitution hasn t changed mr cruz said as the rising applause rose to a roar but the poll numbers have hoots and hollers came from the convention hall in south carolina a genuine and unfamiliar expression nervousness crept across mr trump s face he clenched the podium his leg jiggled but mr cruz was not done he offered a law professor s allocution on the subject of foreign born citizens eligibility for the american presidency the facts and the law here are really quite clear mr cruz said he then ticked off household names in american politics mccain romney both of them he said would be disqualified from the oval office if the conspiracy theories advanced by mr trump prevailed then came the most crushing line of the night interestingly enough donald j trump would be disqualified mr cruz said with a smile reminding mr trump that his mother was born in scotland which under some extreme interpretations of the constitution would bar him from the presidency donald he said i m not going to use your mother s birth against you mr trump seemed unsure of how to respond he offered a series of shaky indignant protestations not me he said humorlessly but i was born here he tried it wouldn t work he interrupted then he put forth what seemed a desperate and unintentionally honest explanation for why he had suddenly challenged mr cruz s legal ability to hold the office political opportunism because mr trump said conceding his rivals rise in the polls now he is doing a little bit better with the crowd won over to mr cruz s side mr trump failed to break through for the first time in the wild caustic and bruising republican campaign mr trump was in the position that so many who have tried to challenge him had found themselves in flustered frustrated and unable to regain his footing for those watching on television including democrats who had lumped mr cruz and mr trump together as a dream ticket of easily marginalized if not parodied general election candidates mr cruz seemed like something else an intelligent and brutal tactician who may prove a more formidable and nimble opponent should he gain his party s nomination according to the associated press donald j trump and hillary clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party s nomination for president mr cruz did not get the best of every exchange his attack on new york values led to mr trump s most powerful moment of the debate a patriotic ode to new yorkers who bravely rebuilt the city s spirit and its infrastructure after the attacks on the world trade center in 2001 the people of new york fought and fought and fought mr trump said his usual volubility replaced by a somber tone as he offered personal recollections of what he called the smell of death he added everybody in the world loved new york and loved new yorkers mr cruz always a keen reader of the room sensed in a shift in the mood he seamlessly turned to mr trump and conspicuously applauded as if they were suddenly teammates mr cruz has repeatedly been described as the least liked among the republican candidates that may still be true but to the audience he kept ways to show a different side a slyly humorous and even personable one as he and mr trump debated which one would serve as the other s vice president mr cruz said he had a better job in mind for the construction minded mogul i d love to get you to build a wall he told mr trump with a wry grin advertisement
