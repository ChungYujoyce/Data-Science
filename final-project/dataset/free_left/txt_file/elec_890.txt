americans admire protest movements and civil disobedience but they draw the line at violence so harassing and beating up trump supporters could do him a lot of good special correspondent my central supposition about this election is that donald trump will lose because most regular middle americans just won t vote to make that man their president this has nothing to do with ideology it s just about trump not everyone out there adores hillary clinton by a long shot and i understand well that for a lot of people this is a choice between beef liver and lumpfish but i just think at the end of the day most people will say no i just can t i just can t help make that crude boorish vindictive childish man the president of the united states i think this is what will save clinton and the country in the end but as soon as i think that i think but what if i m wrong what could make people change their views on trump become sympathetic to him in theory a number of things trump could stop being crude boorish vindictive and childish i said in theory clinton could be indicted the economy could tank i think those are unlikely and yes i saw the jobs report but it s early days to start talking about a recession and it may be a silver lining of the report that it makes the fed wait longer to raise rates which most economists i talk to think it should do anyway but here s one thing that s not a long shot and is in fact happening right now that i fear will make trump a more sympathetic figure to the kinds of americans i m talking about left wing protestors turning violent and throwing eggs at trump supporters and burning hats and flags now no doubt someone has already fired off an abusive tweet at me calling me names and screaming at me that i just want powerless people to stfu as they say in twitterland no i do not want powerless people to stfu i emphatically want powerless people to have more power and the way you get more power in this country is by protesting peacefully and voting and doing all those boring things and i emphatically don t want a racist misogynist neo fascist in the oval office but violent protests at his rallies increase the likelihood of us getting exactly that the operative word in that previous sentence is violent protest americans like it s in the dna and all that protest got us where we are it got us the 40 hour work week the civil rights revolution the end of the vietnam war occasionally in these instances things turned violent especially in the case of labor organizing but usually the violence was initiated by those who held the power the companies in the case of union organizing or the state in the case of civil rights in the modem day american context it s not in the interest of the powerless to initiate violence they ll always get screwed always they ll always be blamed by the media called rabble rousers and trouble makers and the worst of the footage like those people throwing eggs at that woman in the trump football jersey in san jose will be shown over and over and over again giving my regular middle americans up above reason to think the violence was 50 times worse than it actually was and those regular middle americans will say to each other goodness jean those protestors are just awful aren t they why yes they are bob so rude and dirty too that s not the american way and it will go on from there and that night after dinner they ll flip on cnn because these are not fox viewers an important point and they ll see more footage and they ll see interviews with trump supporters who were standing there more or less minding their own business and suddenly got their faces punched in and they ll work themselves into a reactionary state and decide that maybe a vindictive boor is precisely what those people need i guess the thinking of violent protestors is trump is a fascist and the right response to fascism is violence in some times and some places yes it s been the necessary response but we re not anywhere near that point trump doesn t have a private army yes some of his rallies were getting awfully creepy there for a while and he did inexcusably egg his people on toward violence but all that has tapered off if trump won the presidency and assumed emergency powers then yeah i d understand violence then might even advocate for it but we re a long way from that instead we have reached a point where we have to start worrying about the impact of all this you have to admit it takes a lot to make donald trump look like a victim but that s what he ll look like to middle america if this violence continues and it will continue there is however one person who might have the power to end it no not hillary i mean the candidate the protestors peaceful and violent alike undoubtedly admire the most if this gets much worse even though none of this is his fault maybe bernie sanders could step up here that would be actual leadership update i see that sanders to his credit did denounce the violence and say he didn t want those kind of supporters but they might not listen even to him deep down some of these people probably want trump because a trump victory would confirm their deepest held belief about what a fascist country this really is they ll erase out the part about how they helped make it so
