advertisement supported by republicans it turns out can t do economic policy by paul krugman opinion columnist america s catastrophically inadequate response to the coronavirus can be attributed largely to bad short term decisions by one man and i do mean short term at every stage donald trump minimized the threat and blocked helpful action because he wanted to look good for the next news cycle or two ignoring and intimidating anyone who tried to give him good advice but here s the thing even if he weren t so irresponsibly self centered he has denuded the government of people who could be giving good advice in the first place trump disbanded the national security council s pandemic response team in 2018 although he now with his characteristic refusal to accept responsibility for anything says that he knew nothing about it and he has in general staffed his administration with obsequious toadies who never tell him anything he doesn t want to hear what s now becoming clear is that when it comes to dealing with the economic fallout from covid 19 the situation may be even worse there are still some competent professionals holding senior positions at federal health agencies who could give trump good advice if he were willing to listen but serious economic thinking has effectively been banned from this administration if not the whole republican party as far as i can tell the trump team is utterly incapable of formulating a coherent response to the gathering economic crisis as a result there are only two potential loci of intelligent economic policymaking left in washington one is the federal reserve the other is the congressional democratic leadership at this point in other words it s pretty much up to jay powell the fed chairman and nancy pelosi speaker of the house the question is whether trump and senate republicans will let them save the economy powell of course slashed interest rates and announced a large asset buying program on sunday he was right to do so but it s painfully obvious that these moves won t be sufficient indeed will probably do little to stop the economy s tailspin remember in 2007 8 the fed cut rates five times as much as it did sunday and it still wasn t able to prevent the worst slump since the great depression in fact powell himself basically acknowledged as much declaring that he and his colleagues don t have the tools to reach those most in need of help and that fiscal responses are critical fiscal responses of course have to come from congress true in another time under another president the white house would have played a crucial role in shaping crisis legislation but last week as the house drafted and then passed an economic relief bill one that was helpful if still clearly inadequate it was almost entirely a democratic effort democratic staff members put together the key elements of the bill paid sick leave for many though not enough workers enhanced unemployment benefits increased federal contributions for medicaid and more true steve mnuchin the treasury secretary negotiated with pelosi basically to make the bill a bit worse but democrats set the shape of the bill even as trump was proposing the grandiose notion of a payroll tax holiday which has been panned even by conservative economists as greg mankiw chairman of the council of economic advisers under george w bush wrote a payroll tax cut makes little sense in this circumstance because it does nothing for those who can t work president trump should shut the hell up and while the white house was basically out of the loop republican senators have been actively obstructionist offering no serious proposals of their own but holding up a vote on the house bill even though that bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support why are republicans useless at best in the face of an economic crisis as i ve pointed out before there are many competent center right economists but the g o p not just trump but the whole party doesn t want their advice it prefers hacks and propagandists the people mankiw famously called charlatans and cranks whose only idea is tax cuts the party truly has nobody left who is capable of putting together a plausible economic rescue package the senate probably will eventually pass pelosi s bill but with all signs pointing to a steep economic dive we need a much bigger stimulus package perhaps along the lines being developed by chuck schumer the senate minority leader as soon as possible this package shouldn t include tax cuts it should focus overwhelmingly on cash grants perhaps a basic grant to every legal resident plus additional grants to those in special need and since there s nobody left in the g o p who can put together a coherent stimulus plan democrats will have to do the job perhaps with help from the federal reserve intervention to stabilize highly stressed financial markets i admit to being somewhat worried that democrats won t go big enough but my bigger worry is that republicans will undermine their efforts it s now up to powell and pelosi to rescue the economy and trump and company need to get out of their way the times is committed to publishing a diversity of
