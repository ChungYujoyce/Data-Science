nominee added to his delegate total by winning the kansas democratic party primary with over 76 of the popular vote all officially declared candidates remained on the ballot and vermont senator bernie sanders was the only one other than biden to reach the 15 viability threshold gaining 23 of the popular vote according to cbs news estimates biden will earn at least 29 delegates from the state of kansas sanders who has said he wants to continue to assemble as many delegates possible prior to the democratic convention in order to exert significant influence over the party platform will also earn some delegates this was the first state party run primary in kansas since 1992 in 2016 kansas democrats held caucuses and less than 40 000 participated the kdp said the 2020 primary set a participation record with 146 873 ballots cast for a total turnout rate of 34 7 among registered democrats in kansas kdp chair vicki hiatt told cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidar she was satisfied with the turnout rate but acknowledged it would have been higher if the race was still competitive and if we hadn t been dealing with covid 19 the kdp decided to move its primary to all vote by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic hiatt said she was only expecting about 70 000 ballots to be cast but the party ended up processing nearly twice as many that led to a need for more manpower hiatt said she explained that over a 10 day period her team limited to 10 volunteers working at a time processed about 70 000 the following weekend another 72 000 ballots showed up in the mail that was kind of an eye opener that oh my gosh it s taken us this long to get through 70 000 and now we have another 72 000 to go through that was kind of an awakening hiatt said under normal circumstances hiatt said she would have called in 50 volunteers to help process ballots and answer a swarm of last minute calls from voters hiatt said despite some little glitches the feedback she has received in her state is that voting by mail is kind of the standard for moving forward hiatt said she hopes it will reach a point where state funding will be provided to help cover the costs adding it is very difficult for a state party by itself to fund something of this magnitude pennsylvania almost a million residents in pennsylvania have applied to vote by mail in the state s june 2 primary election according tocbs news campaign reporter zak hudak as covid 19 has shut down non essential businesses in the state pennsylvania has received 948 831 requests for mail in and absentee ballots with another three weeks remaining to apply according to a press release from the governor s office the state legislature had passed and governor tom wolf signed a bill last year allowing residents to apply for mail in ballots without an excuse but in a press conference the governor and secretary of state said voters will be able to go to the polls if they want to i want pennsylvanians to know that they have options for how to cast their ballots including both voting by mail and voting in person wolf said voting is the cornerstone of our democracy and pennsylvanians can still cast their ballots while keeping themselves safe and healthy wolf plans to ease social distancing restrictions in some less populated areas in northcentral and northeast pennsylvania friday but said people living in areas that remain under stay at home orders june 2 will still have the option to go to a polling place to vote wolf said the state would not require voters to wear masks to polling places but he urged them to do so if it s going to work it s going to work because pennsylvanians recognize they don t want to infect other pennsylvanians he said secretary of state kathy boockvar said requiring mail in voting anywhere would not be an option because some people with disabilities cannot vote by mail the pennsylvania legislature in march moved its planned april primary to june and agreed to allow mail in ballot counting to begin the morning of election day still the state will have to process at least ten times the absentee ballots it did in the 2016 primary election posing potential problems for a state department already seeing an increase in work from covid 19 relief efforts that s a huge increase for the work that s going to be required of the county election offices across the state boockvar this is a concern and something we are going to need to do everything we can to help and recognize it is an issue congressional coverage in the senate six candidates competing in the democratic primary to take on republican senator david perdue in november participated in a televised debate sunday night reportscbs news political unit associate producer eleanor watson georgia public broadcasting and the atlanta press club sponsored the debate which took place virtually because of coronavirus concerns the 90 minute debate went through a range of issues early on including the candidates personal backgrounds but turned to focus on how the candidates would respond to the effects of the coronavirus the candidates were asked at the tail end of the debate whether there should be a fuller investigation of tara reade s accusation against joe biden the candidates all agreed that women should be taken seriously and there should be due process for the accused seven candidates will be on the june 9 primary ballot but one of the candidates did not respond to an invitation to participate in sunday s debate according to moderator donna lowry the democratic senatorial campaign committee has not endorsed in this race yet but fundraising numbers show former house candidate jon ossoff is leading the rest of the pack in the house the special election in california s 25th district between democrat christy smith and republican mike garcia is eight days away and while in person voting at selected pollsbegan over the weekend this has been labeled as an all mail ballot election so much so that the earlyabsentee ballot countshows a turnout of about 21 already with about 91 000 mail ballots returned republicans hold the edge so far with a bit over 41 696 ballots returned compared to 31 610 democrat ballots this equates to about 31 of eligible republican ballots being turned in compared to 19 for democrats who hold a registration advantage in the los angeles county area district political data inc vice president paul mitchell toldcbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarrothe early disparity amongst the two parties checks out with prior patterns where older conservative voters vote early while younger minority voters vote a bit more last minute we used to attribute this kind of jokingly to well you know the people who know where their stamps are vote first but the pattern has held true even though all mail ballots now are postage free he said mitchell also pointed out that the pandemic has created an unprecedented environment for this election making it harder to read as much into any of the early numbers we ve never had an election where everybody was staying home where in some households the most exciting thing in a given day is checking for the mail he added instead think of this as the first case of this all mail voting in this kind of election and see if we can learn something from it that we ll be able to apply to november outside groups have been funneling money in the last minute push the house gop backed congressional leadership fundcontributed 14 756 this past saturday and have spent more
