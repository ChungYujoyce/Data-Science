the massachusetts senator was the only major 2020 contender to rebuff the crucial state during the midterms she s now making up ground by natasha korecki 01 05 2019 10 36 pm est updated 01 06 2019 12 22 pm est des moines iowa just two months ago sen elizabeth warren risked political backlash here by opting to avoid a trip to iowa during the critical midterm elections the only major potential 2020 candidate to do so but less than a week into the new year warren already flipped that on its head becoming the first major candidate to land on the ground in the first in the nation presidential caucus state lapping up media attention locking down key staff and organizers and capitalizing on pent up 2020 democratic excitement advertisement i m here tonight because i believe i believe in what we can do a hoarse sounding warren told a capacity crowd in des moines on saturday night just one of five stops during her iowa blitz i believe that this right now is our moment our moment to dream big to fight hard and to take back this country with a new year s eve announcement of an exploratory presidential bid warren already beat several competitors to the punch and was dominating the news cycle last week nationally that s after the 2020 aspirant suffered setbacks last year when she was widely criticized for the clumsy october release of the results of a dna test in an attempt to address her previous native american ancestry claims and even as she boasts of having the most advanced presidential campaign in waiting warren has lagged behind former vice president joe biden sen bernie sanders and former rep beto o rourke in early polls both nationally and in iowa photo gallery by quint forgey but on saturday her early out of the gates visit looked more than promising here hundreds of people snaked around one block then wrapped around another waiting outside for her evening appearance in all more than 1 000 people packed the venue and spilled into an overflow area the bad news is i ve got a cold the good news is nevertheless i persist she said to roaring applause if there s a message from the vibrant crowds it s that iowa democrats are far from weary of an impending 2020 campaign despite a bruising midterm election fight instead 2020 cannot get started soon enough according to nearly two dozen people who attended warren events and talked to politico while some already backed warren many who showed up at the senator s organizing stops were just starting their examination of what s to be an extensive democratic roster many expressed deep frustrations over trump administration policies and described a readiness to begin hearing from what s expected to be a sprawling democratic field i take nothing away from sen warren s visit i think people are genuinely excited to see her said penny rosfjord an iowa democratic party central committee member and 4th congressional district chair but honestly i think everybody is ready they re

to watch her through the open garage entrance of a bowling alley people are hungry for hope hope there s something out there that s going to turn this around because this is just scary deb schwiesow who saw warren in council bluffs said about the excitement behind the visit i want a very strong democrat to run against trump i want this nightmare to end i think we re just off track we re off track as a country and we have to get back on center last year warren took some hits for skipping iowa during the midterm elections even as everyone from biden to sens kamala harris and cory booker held fundraising events in competitive races warren had sent staff and resources to the state and to the democratic party here but facing her own reelection she didn t campaign on the ground for any candidates while iowa is expected to soon be overrun with warren s would be competitors this weekend she had the place to herself the energy here has just been amazing said rob gilmer of council bluffs among those who stood outside to hear warren s remarks hearing the notice then driving here and the crowds it s just incredible this is what politics is all about 2020 elections by natasha korecki warren had a captive audience in which she tested campaign themes of taking on major corporations challenging government corruption and exploring economic inequality while weaving a personal narrative that focused on her family s financial struggles when growing up in oklahoma that narrative centered on stresses on her family after her father suffered health issues and her mother fearing she and her children could lose it all stared at a special dress on the bed she was crying and she was saying we will not lose this house we will not lose this house we will not lose this house warren says in a tale she repeats at events she was 50 years old she had never worked outside the house and she was terrified warren goes on to say that while a minimum wage job propped up her family back then it couldn t now why is the path getting rockier and particularly rockier for people of color she said in her iowa swing the massachusetts senator made a rare move in kicking off the iowa campaign in the western rural part of the state council bluffs sioux city and storm lake deep republican territory at least part of which is in the congressional district of conservative firebrand rep steve king that usually doesn t happen democratic campaigns usually start in the bigger more democratic areas said david yepsen an iowa based political analyst and a former longtime dean of the iowa press corps it s a recognition by her that if national democrats are going to get to 270 electoral votes in 2020 and have any hope of winning back the u s senate they ve got to run better in rural states and regions all across the country wisconsin central pennsylvania michigan etc these depressed areas have been a breeding ground for trump supporters and she s betting she might be able to evoke a
