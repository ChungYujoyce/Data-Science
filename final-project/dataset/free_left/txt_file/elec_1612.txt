interesting member of the family and ted really likes to rub people s backs by michael kruse december 11 2015 michael kruse is a senior staff writer for politico michael kruse is a senior staff writer for politico it s called project x according to the clapperboard seen briefly deep into the footage roughly 15 hours of raw unedited video meant for use in making ads for ted cruz s presidential campaign vast swaths are just cruz and his wife and their two young daughters matching dresses a must walking talking smiling laughing fishing eating holding hands riding horses doing puzzles reading stories saying grace cruz spends some time toting a shotgun around a field and firing it at unseen targets in the sky filmed the last week of last year some three months before cruz made his candidacy official with a speech at liberty university it was discovered this past summer on youtube labeled online simply as cruz tx footage 01 to 16 advertisement clips have been surfacing on tv and the internet showing odd glimpses of the life of a highly scripted candidate some of the things in the clips we already know cruz and his father for instance are gifted talkers what they say on camera is rehearsed and familiar as in nearly verbatim to anybody who has seen their stump speeches but watch all of it and you learn some things about ted cruz that are hard to imagine ever showing up in a campaign ad despite the stagecraft you encounter a family that s messier than the one you ll almost certainly see portrayed as the cruz campaign enters the thick of the primaries the footage offers an intriguing familial mishmash of single mothers half siblings and stepparents bearing burdens of modern america depression drinking drugs cruz s wife an executive for goldman sachs currently on a leave of absence because of the campaign describes herself as a traditional mom albeit one who cops to not cooking and likens her handling of multimillion dollar investment portfolios to her family s missionary work in africa cruz s daughters adore him you re told and yet you learn that they sometimes consider him a guest in their houston home it also becomes clear that the death of cruz s half sister and what he then did for her son is a story he thinks reflects well enough on him that he wants to tell it in all its wince inducing detail cruz s mother is the least willing participant here the most interesting too in part because she is at times so obviously reluctant to play along why is this available all of it to anyone evidently shooting video like this and posting it in a public space lets campaigns and their supportive pacs share the content without technically communicating which would be against the rules what s great about this footage is the camera keeps rolling people keep talking and cruz keeps rubbing and rubbing and rubbing his family members shoulders and backs the staged hugs the awkward outtakes the never to be prime time scenes the unrehearsed off script interactions these are the moments that feel the most revealing the most captivating the most authentic it s an unexpected window into the orbit of a candidate who is otherwise disciplined and relentlessly on message this is my uncle ted cruz here seated on an overstuffed chair is a person you re not expecting a heavyset blue eyed young man wearing a buzz cut a red and white shirt with horizontal stripes and a smattering of tattoos on his arms does one of them say menace on a matching chair to his left the princeton educated harvard educated former supreme court clerk and current u s senator and presidential candidate to whom he s related my name is joe maykopet he says to the camera and everybody else i m 29 years old from philadelphia pennsylvania and this is my uncle ted cruz a highlight on some of the moments from ted cruz s campaign broll with his family it s unclear what purpose he s supposed to serve in this context cruz starts talking you know my nephew joey cruz says reaching over and placing his hand on maykopet s back is someone who i ve known his entire life i remember holding joey when he was a newborn baby i was 15 when he was born his mom is my oldest sister miriam miriam is nine years older than i am i have two older sisters miriam and roxana who are a year apart in age and they re half sisters they re sisters from my father s first marriage and when both of them were little girls our father and their mom divorced cruz continues and you know kids react differently to divorce they react differently to their parents splitting apart it was very hard on my sister miriam it was very hard on her she like a lot of kids unfortunately do think she blamed herself as a little girl for her parents not staying together and miriam passed away a few years ago cruz doesn t say how but she died in 2011 in pennsylvania of an accidental drug overdose it remains unclear at this point in the footage how this information might find its way into a political ad cruz keeps talking the friday cover by paul krishnamurty wealth of nations by zachary karabell history dept by josh zeitz um when miriam got older um she struggled he says she had a difficult life miriam had a lot of problems with alcohol abuse and substance abuse pretty much her entire adult life um she took a lot of pain meds she took a lot of she made a lot of bad choices he keeps talking about how she raised joey as a single mom how she had problems with the law how she fell in with some pretty unsavory characters how he and his father once went to philadelphia where she was living in what was basically a crack house leaving behind their rings and watches and wallets to try to help her get back on her feet all of this unspools uncomfortably as maykopet sits listening to cruz s version of his sad challenging upbringing with his late mother at the end of which finally cruz gets to what appears to be the takeaway the loan he took out on his credit card to pay for maykopet to go to boarding school all told cruz says it was about 20 000 maykopet then talks for a while about his life ever since he works in a chocolate factory before a man behind the camera cuts to the crux let s wrap it up comes the voice from behind the camera and say i look back and really appreciate the sacrifice my uncle ted made when i was younger it really helped me get some discipline and it turned my life around i really appreciate it cruz s nephew listens gamely to the prompt ok can you say that again maykopet says working to remember what they re wanting him to say one more hug and we re out of here says the cameraman what is daddy doing why is daddy in d c ok i m going to say what i really think you guys can decide if you want to use this heidi cruz says into the camera with a laugh cruz s wife blond hair blue dress glossy lips about to say something she knows she shouldn t yet clearly she has things to say the former heidi nelson claremont mckenna grad harvard business grad managing director at goldman sachs before taking a leave of absence for the current campaign who in 2005 worked through a bout of depression briefly in public after moving to texas from washington where she worked in the george w bush administration because her husband had taken a job as the state s solicitor general who in 2011 on a panel discussion about work life balance stressed the importance of hiring live in help because it allows me to work 80 hours a week elsewhere in the footage her husband recalls that she had her blackberry on her while in labor with their first child she was literally on her blackberry working he says she says her dream as a girl was to work in washington which she did until she didn t and that i don t cook because her twice weekly chore as a little girl was cleaning the house instead of preparing the meals and she goes to contorted lengths to describe herself as a traditional mom the emotional center of the household my most treasured role she also at one point stresses to the camera that her husband is in fact not uncool if anyone were ever to ask or wonder and who hasn t it is absolutely not true that i am cooler than ted ted is absolutely the coolest person in our family and i say that from the bottom of my heart she then adds curiously considering cruz s clothes any bit of coolness that i may have added would be simply on the attire front thanks to his wife you learn that cruz likes games movies chuck e cheese s and reading bedtime stories with a very animated voice here though she grins readying to tell the camera what i really think into it she goes our daughters caroline and catherine love their father and ted was first elected to the u s senate when catherine was barely 2 years old and caroline was 4 so all that catherine has known is her daddy being in the u s senate and she is very proud of that she loves going to washington d c to visit him and to see his office you can just feel the but building on the other hand she says our now 6 year old was quite remembering of the times before he was a politician before he was a u s senator and she will often ask why do people want a picture with daddy what is daddy doing why is daddy in d c there was a time when we were flying back from washington in the back of southwestern airlines as we always do and catherine said very loudly caroline we should move to washington d c to be with daddy all week and caroline said very clearly right back in a loud voice catherine we will not move to d c we are texans we will stay in texas one time when he came home they always run to the front door and jump on him and want to play games because that s what they do together and one time they were running towards the front door and caroline shrieked there s a guest in the house there s a guest in the house the literal point in her words so even though they know he s very much a part of our home they do sometimes see him as a guest she also says using words that say a lot at least to anybody who s a parent that cruz as a father to the girls is their friend and their buddy i know it s hard mom that s too personal ted she says i don t want to tell that green jacket gold earrings this is cruz s mother who comes off in the footage as a no bs irish italian she s the best character here cruz judging from his voice is standing behind the camera well i want to tell that he cajoles and you re the best person to tell that well eleanor darragh 81 says back at him there s some very personal details that i don t want to go into it s difficult to determine what more cruz wants from her or why you can t hear a question but he does want more darragh had grown up in wilmington delaware with a father who drank too much and didn t think daughters should go to college but had gone to houston s rice university and graduated in 1956 with a math degree before going to work as a computer programmer at a shell research lab a strong willed careerist woman more than 50 years ago she at one point in the footage delivers bluntly to the camera the reason she never learned to type i didn t know how to type and i didn t want to learn how to type because i didn t want somebody asking me to type letters for them so if someone asked me to type a letter i d say i m sorry i can t type a letter i don t know how to type you ll have to get someone else to do it a secretary i m not a secretary i m a programmer cruz s wife doesn t cook his mother doesn t type she had been married before cruz s mother and had a baby boy named michael who died in his sleep in his crib the grief had wrenched apart her marriage cruz mentions this in his book not in this video and his mother doesn t offer this back story either but knowing it makes watching her talk about her difficult on and off second marriage to cruz s father all the more uncomfortable she had married rafael cruz a cuban who had fled to texas and in 1970 in canada where they were working in the oil and gas business in calgary she had given birth to their son rafael edward cruz who later as a teen decided to call himself ted in the footage she already had touched on this not oversharing but saying matter of factly ted s dad left us in canada it was a very painful time for me i was very angry and i was very hurt but i continued working at the company that we had founded and put ted in day care and had a nanny that would come in who would stay with him i was very determined to have ted have a father to me that was important i didn t want to be a single mother i felt that his having a father was the most important goal in my life i was really a drunk cruz s father says in a different moment they would get back together cruz s parents but ultimately would divorce once their talented promising son went out on his own off to princeton now pushed by her son to say more she starts talking again when ted was 3 cruz cuts her off look at me he says to his mother clear and curt before perhaps realizing the need for a softer tone i know i know he says i know it s hard mom i i ok she says her facial expression a cross between exasperation and resignation i m not used to this at all nobody s prop an extra in nobody s show but still a mother she relents when ted was 3 rafael left and went to houston when her husband became a christian she says she was skeptical so i was on edge most of the time just waiting for him to fail waiting for him to do something wrong because i didn t really believe that he had changed but it was important enough for me for ted to have a father that i was willing to go along with it to see if we could not make a go of it and it was a full three years after we moved to houston that i hit bottom emotionally and was able to accept the lord myself and that changed my life is that that last part the message that might show up in a cruz ad together scene real quick the cameraman says and let s move on yep cruz says he emerges from behind the camera and slides onto the couch next to his mother she sighs and smiles sort of you ve got to train me i m sorry she says no you re doing great cruz says draping his arm over her shoulders you re very natural on tv cruz then says his mother is an incredible prayer warrior and that not a day goes by that my mom is not lifting me up in prayer that s right she concurs for hours cruz says pausing at a time at which point eleanor darragh just can t help herself the mother of this rising conservative presidential candidate looks at the ceiling and makes a face that can only be interpreted as saying one thing no california by jeremy b white updated 05 08 20 09 44 pm edt by sam sutton and carly sitrin by bill mahoney and josh gerstein updated 03 29 20 02 48 pm edt 2020
