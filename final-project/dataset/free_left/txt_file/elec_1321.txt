 2020 elections but his fundraising slowed down in the second half of the month democratic presidential candidate joe biden chip somodevilla getty images by scott bland 04 20 2020 11 14 pm edt link copied joe biden raised 46 7 million in march his campaign announced monday notching his best fundraising month of the campaign and besting president donald trump as he took control of the democratic primary the fundraising prompted by biden s strong win in south carolina s primary on the last day of february and a cascade of super tuesday victories amounted to more than half of what biden had raised in the entire campaign prior to that month biden raised just over 88 million from the second quarter of 2019 through the end of february advertisement biden spent 32 5 million and ended march with 26 4 million in his campaign account according to a campaign finance report biden s campaign filed later monday night that s far less than the 94 million in trump s account at the end of february as the president has built up cash without having to worry about a competitive primary the republican national committee has also built a large cash on hand advantage over the democratic national committee but biden and the dnc outraised trump and the rnc in march the dnc buoyed by an 18 million transfer from billionaire mike bloomberg s campaign that sparked a campaign finance complaint brought in 32 7 million in march to the rnc s 24 million trump s campaign has yet to file its march financial report but republicans had previously said that trump the rnc and affiliated fundraising committees raised 63 million in march less than the combined 79 4 million raised by biden and the dnc it s unclear if biden s financial surge will continue at the same pace in the long term though biden said in the march 15 democratic debate against bernie sanders that he had raised 33 million to date that month meaning his fundraising tailed off in the second half of march as the coronavirus pandemic prompted stay at home orders mass unemployment and other large scale economic disruptions while also shutting down public campaign events the biden campaign has since shifted to holding online events but biden noted in an email to supporters monday night that the pandemic may well hamper his campaign s finances this month and beyond i know that april may not match march in fundraising and that s okay by me biden wrote in an email to supporters the world has changed a great deal it s unrecognizable at times your family and your community need your generosity and strength now more than ever link copied 2020 politico llc
