democratic party and the rise of progressive presidential candidates are unnerving moderate democrats who increasingly fear that the party could fritter away its chances of beating president trump in 2020 by careening over a liberal cliff two months into the presidential campaign the leading democratic contenders have largely broken with consensus driven politics and embraced leftist ideas on health care taxes the environment and middle east policy that would fundamentally alter the economy elements of foreign policy and ultimately remake american life led by senator bernie sanders of vermont a democratic socialist who is the top candidate in the race at this early stage many vocal leaders in the party are choosing to draw lessons from liberal victories in 2018 rather than the party s breakthroughs in moderate suburban battlegrounds that delivered democratic control of the house these progressive democrats risk playing into mr trump s hands he has repeatedly branded them socialists yet they argue that their ambitious agenda can inspire a voter revolt in 2020 that elects a left wing president those ideas that we talked about here in iowa four years ago that seemed so radical at the time remember that mr sanders returning to iowa this week for the first time as a 2020 candidate crowed on thursday shock of all shocks those very same ideas are now supported not only by democratic candidates for president but by democratic candidates all across the board from school board on up check out the democratic field with our candidate tracker the sprint toward populism amounts to a rejection of the incremental and often defensive brand of politics that has characterized the party s approach to highly charged issues for 40 years yet when nearly half of voters indicate in polls that they will not support the president s re election many moderates say the cautious strategy in 2018 that helped the party pick up 21 house seats that mr trump carried two years earlier should be the playbook for next year what we saw in the midterms is a lot of people from the center and moderate part of the party really win and take back the house said senator maggie hassan of new hampshire alluding to the careful and poll tested campaigns many democrats in republican leaning districts ran last year we need to make sure we re being as pragmatic as we can this moderate wing of the party lacks an obvious standard bearer former mayor michael r bloomberg of new york who would have run a centrist campaign begged off this week senator sherrod brown of ohio a midwestern progressive who favors a within the system style of pragmatic politics also decided not to run senator amy klobuchar of minnesota who is running has presented herself as a centrist but has not yet gained traction should former vice president joseph r biden jr enter the race as his top advisers vow he soon will he would have the best immediate shot at the moderate mantle and if he does not run democrats like former gov terry mcauliffe of virginia or gov andrew m cuomo of new york might try to seek that role mr biden s candidacy would immediately thrust a fundamental dispute to the center of the democratic race do americans simply pine for a pre trump equilibrium less chaos and more consensus or do the yawning disparities of these times call out for a more transformational administration read more a beat trump fervor is producing big turnouts for 2020 democrats mr sanders and other democratic candidates like senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts are plainly wagering that voters want more than a return to normalcy in 2016 iowa helped begin the political revolution mr sanders recalled on saturday at a rally in des moines referring to his near victory in the state s caucuses that year now as we move to 2020 our job is to complete that revolution the liberal candidates have dominated the policy debate in the race so far ms warren proposed on friday that the government break up big tech giants like amazon and facebook the latest and perhaps boldest proposal to come from her campaign and mr sanders s platform medicare for all free college tuition and an aggressive plan to combat climate change has grown in popularity according to polls speaking at the university of iowa as part of his campaign swing mr sanders also took aim at establishment democrats and won his loudest and most sustained applause by pledging to push through his universal health care bill mr sanders and ms warren along with a new generation of high profile progressives like representative alexandria ocasio cortez of new york have emerged this winter as the clearest and most vocal arbiters of democratic aspirations if not the immediate congressional agenda they are at least hastening the tectonic shifts taking place in the party it was no accident that house democrats modified a resolution targeting representative ilhan omar of minnesota for her controversial claim that pro israel advocates carry an allegiance to a foreign country after ms ocasio cortez other lawmakers of color and the party s leading presidential hopefuls rebelled against singling out ms omar the episode marked a striking departure from the down the line support for israel that has characterized the upper ranks of most democratic primaries relying on wealthy donors has also been standard fare and unremarkably so in past white house races but mr sanders elevated the issue of campaign finance in his 2016 race and his jeremiads against the billionaire class have all but made super pacs verboten in this race he and ms warren are refusing to hold high dollar fund raisers representative ayanna pressley of massachusetts who won her seat after defeating an incumbent democrat last year conceded that the first months of 2019 had inflicted growing pains on democrats but she argued it was merely a necessary side effect in the party s evolution after we build that muscle we re going to flex it ms pressley said yet mr biden in speeches at home and abroad has used much of the first part of this year pledging to restore the dignity he believes that the country has lost in the trump years promising a restoration rather than a revolution and as his supporters put it less subtly his campaign would represent something else overwhelmingly the primary electorate of the democratic party wants to win senator chris coons of delaware said he argued that mr biden could repair a lot of the ways in which our position in the world has been harmed while offering a hopeful optimistic positive vision at home that would heal the divisions he said mr trump has exacerbated to such moderate democrats the most instructive recent election is not that of mr trump in 2016 but rather the 2018 midterms when many of the democrats who won in battleground house districts and governor s races were decidedly less confrontational than mr sanders the overwhelming majority of seats we picked up were by center left candidates representing more centrist type districts said representative brendan boyle of pennsylvania adding there s still lots of folks on our side who are o k with compromise other democrats are even blunter fretting that the party risks alienating the broad middle of the electorate at a moment mr trump is making no attempt to appeal to such voters you live for the day in politics when the other guy is conceding the majority of the country said larry grisolano a longtime democratic strategist yet for many democrats especially younger voters who have largely known only mr trump and another once unlikely president for eight years before that it is a hopelessly outdated notion that the party must be prudent about who it nominates and tread only within centrist confines on animating issues like climate change racial justice and universal health care these progressives have no more experience with a right of center reagan era framework than their parents did with the new deal we have had enough of the centrist corporatist democratic the type of democrat that my mom would have voted for back in the 90s said jake peters a 23 year old iowan and sanders volunteer who drove two hours to see him speak in council bluffs this week we just don t have patience for the platitudes and mr trump has emboldened these young activists heightening the urgency they feel about enacting a progressive agenda and convincing them that mr sanders s blunt force message about injustice is what s needed to defeat the president chris kivlahan 22 who came to the iowa city rally described a sanders presidency this way i think if it s going to happen now is the time and trump is the candidate to be running against democrats in washington are seeing the tensions within the party firsthand as they try to balance an agenda that their newly elected moderates can support while also mollifying more liberal newcomers who are eager to impeach mr trump and pursue far reaching goals such as the green new deal a lot of young people have come into a world where there was more diversity more opportunities and where they had use of social media said representative elijah cummings of maryland about the expectations of next generation activists and lawmakers some of whom serve on the oversight committee he chairs a guy like me i had to fight to even get in the door to tell some of these younger democrats that a uncompromising progressive platform may be unattainable let alone who can and cannot be elected president is difficult given mr trump s victory and the chasm they see between the scale of the problems they will confront and the policies in place today and unlike many in the party s pragmatic wing these democrats believe the recipe for success in the general election is not to nominate another seemingly safe candidate like hillary clinton who was unable to galvanize the base and lost crucial votes to a green party nominee but to put forward somebody who will energize reluctant voters obviously we ve shown that we re at a place where we re o k with nontraditional candidates said riley wilson a 29 year old nebraskan who crossed the missouri river to see mr sanders he added i think so many people just aren t involved at all in politics and i think he would be able to bring some of those people into the fold because they ll feel like they have options that they haven t had before politically speaking and about the republican strategy led by mr trump himself to pin the socialism label on the democrats in 2020 senator brian schatz of hawaii said it was mostly just his party s elite donor class that had anything to fear from a sweeping progressive agenda well them and the arbiters of conventional political wisdom he added what we ve learned from last two presidential elections is that nobody knows anything mr schatz said of the election of former president barack obama and mr trump the people who write op eds and stroke their chins and tell us how to win are the people who have been getting it wrong for almost two decades now updated may 25 2020 advertisement
