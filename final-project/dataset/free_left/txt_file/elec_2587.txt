advertisement supported by by alexander burns and maggie haberman donald j trump was in a state of shock he had just fired his campaign manager and was watching the man discuss his dismissal at length on cnn the rattled candidate s advisers and family seized the moment for an intervention joined by his daughter ivanka and her husband jared kushner a cluster of mr trump s confidants pleaded with him to make that day june 20 a turning point he would have to stick to a teleprompter and end his freestyle digressions and insults like his repeated attacks on a hispanic federal judge paul manafort mr trump s campaign chairman and gov chris christie of new jersey argued that mr trump had an effective message if only he would deliver it for now the campaign s polling showed too many voters described him in two words unqualified and racist mr trump bowed to his team s entreaties according to four people with detailed knowledge of the meeting who described it on the condition of anonymity it was time he agreed to get on track nearly two months later the effort to save mr trump from himself has plainly failed he has repeatedly signaled to his advisers and allies his willingness to change and adapt but has grown only more volatile and prone to provocation since then clashing with a gold star family making comments that have been seen as inciting violence and linking his political opponents to terrorism advisers who once hoped a pygmalion like transformation would refashion a crudely effective political showman into a plausible american president now increasingly concede that mr trump may be beyond coaching he has ignored their pleas and counsel as his poll numbers have dropped boasting to friends about the size of his crowds and maintaining that he can read surveys better than the professionals the upshot s presidential forecast updated daily in private mr trump s mood is often sullen and erratic his associates say he veers from barking at members of his staff to grumbling about how he was better off following his own instincts during the primaries and suggesting he should not have heeded their calls for change he broods about his souring relationship with the news media calling mr manafort several times a day to talk about specific stories occasionally mr trump blows off steam in bursts of boyish exuberance at the end of a fund raiser on long island last week he playfully buzzed the crowd twice with his helicopter but in interviews with more than 20 republicans who are close to mr trump or in communication with his campaign many of whom insisted on anonymity to avoid clashing with him they described their nominee as exhausted frustrated and still bewildered by fine points of the political process and why his incendiary approach seems to be sputtering he is routinely preoccupied with perceived slights for example raging to aides after senator marco rubio of florida in his re election announcement said he would stand up to the next president regardless of party in a visit to capitol hill in early july mr trump bickered with two republican senators who had not endorsed him he needled representative peter t king of new york for having taken donations from him over the years only to criticize him on television now and mr trump has begun to acknowledge to associates and even in public that he might lose in an interview on cnbc on thursday he said he was prepared to face defeat i ll just keep doing the same thing i m doing right now he said and at the end it s either going to work or i m going to you know i m going to have a very very nice long vacation jason miller a spokesman for mr trump said the republican nominee was still determined to win and dismissed accounts that he was downcast mr miller pointed to the crowds mr trump attracts as a sign of strength behind the scenes we have a very motivated and very focused candidate in donald trump who knows what he needs to do to win this race mr miller said people around mr trump and his operation say they are not ready to abandon hope of a turnaround but he is in a dire predicament republicans say because he is profoundly uncomfortable in the role of a typical general election candidate disoriented by the crosscurrents he must now navigate and still relying impulsively on a pugilistic formula that guided him to the nomination his advisers are still convinced of the basic potency of a sales pitch about economic growth and a shake up in washington and they aspire to compete in as many as 21 states despite mr trump s perilous standing in the four states florida ohio pennsylvania and north carolina likely to decide the election charles r black jr an influential republican lobbyist supporting mr trump said the campaign was in a continuing struggle to tame him he has three or four good days and then makes another gaffe mr black said hopefully he can have some more good days of mr trump s advisers mr black said they think he is making progress in terms of being able to make set speeches and not take the bait on every attack somebody makes on him people who donated to establishment republican candidates in the primary season are more likely to give money to hillary clinton than to donald j trump mr trump s advisers now hope to steady him by pairing him on the trail with familiar more seasoned figures people he views as peers and enjoys spending time with like former mayor rudolph w giuliani of new york and former gov mike huckabee of arkansas mr giuliani who campaigned with mr trump early in the week said he did not see the candidate as unmoored or unhappy if anyone was disconcerted mr giuliani suggested it was the people steering his campaign he doesn t seem to be as unnerved by these things that go wrong as the people around him mr giuliani said still he allowed i think it is true that maybe it took him a little while to realize that we re moving from a primary campaign to a presidential campaign mr trump he said had become a little bit more realizing there are certain days left and you ve got to get messages out on those days even before mr trump s most recent spate of incendiary comments republicans who dealt with him after the primaries came away alarmed by his obvious unease as the de facto party leader after a meeting in late may between mr trump and karl rove the architect of george w bush s presidential victories mr rove told associates he was stunned by mr trump s poor grasp of campaign basics including how to map out a schedule and use data to reach voters sitting with mr rove in the manhattan apartment of a mutual friend the casino magnate steve wynn mr trump said he would compete in states like oregon which has not voted republican since ronald reagan s 1984 landslide mr rove later told people he believed mr trump was confused and scared in anticipation of the general election according to people who have heard mr rove s account a few weeks later when governor christie brokered a meeting at trump tower between mr trump and governors from around the country mr trump offered a desultory performance bragging about his poll numbers listening passively as the governors talked about their states and then sending them on their way mr trump never asked them for their support three people briefed on the meeting said with donors mr trump has been an indifferent ambassador for his campaign he has resisted making fund raising calls and during at least two major events in july in new york and chicago burned valuable hours with potential contributors by asking them to go around the room one by one giving him their thoughts on whom he should pick as his running mate that left little time for the donors to query mr trump about policy or strategy or for him to reassure them about his campaign jay bergman an illinois oil executive who attended the event in chicago said he wondered if mr trump had taken that approach to avoid answering questions on matters of policy too mr trump has engaged only fleetingly and idiosyncratically before delivering a policy speech in detroit on monday he delegated the formation of an economic plan to a few conservative economists outside his campaign who consulted him from time to time and ultimately haggled over the details in his office as he followed their conversation stephen moore a heritage foundation fellow said he and arthur laffer the supply side economist had tangled over the top tax bracket while mr trump observed from behind his desk eventually siding with mr moore mr trump he said also expressed strong views about the taxation of interest on business loans citing his experience as a developer he s a typical businessman right mr moore said he lets people argue it out and arthur made his case and others made their case he s not the world s expert on the tax code mr moore added but he has very good intuition about how these things will affect real people at the last minute mr trump interjected to direct his advisers to incorporate a tax deduction for the cost of child care in his economic plan the issue which mr trump had not discussed on the campaign trail is a favorite of his daughter ivanka mr trump s reliance on his family has only grown more pronounced mr kushner mr trump s son in law who has no background in politics has expanded his role he now has broad oversight over areas including the campaign s budget messaging and strategy with the power to approve spending mr trump has also continued to seek advice from corey lewandowski the campaign manager whom mr trump ousted in june at his children s urging efforts to bring in high profile experienced hands have been fruitless mr kushner had suggested enlisting steve schmidt senator john mccain s 2008 presidential campaign manager but despite having met once with mr trump during the primaries and speaking with him a few times mr schmidt never signed on mr trump s advisers believe he is nearly out of time to right his campaign on tuesday hours before his explosive comment about second amendment people taking action if mrs clinton is elected his brain trust reassembled again at trump tower in a reprise of their stern meeting in june they again urged mr trump to adjust his tone and comportment the top pollster tony fabrizio gave an unvarnished assessment warning that mr trump s numbers would only move in one direction absent a major change mr trump people briefed on the meeting said digested the advice and responded receptively it was time he agreed to get on track advertisement
