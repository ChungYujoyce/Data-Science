filed under donald trump s impaired judgment may well have already cost american lives every parent has warily confronted the hypothetical question what would you do if you suspected your child was unwell not physically but emotionally unwell or mentally unstable imagine learning your teenager for example had been yelling demeaning slurs at the girls in his class harassing them and calling them names and that he d been secretly using his social media accounts to go on late night rants against perceived enemies attacking their looks and again calling them names in unending seething rambling posts in depth political coverage sports analysis entertainment reviews and cultural commentary or that he d been increasingly susceptible to bizarre and otherwise implausible conspiracy theories and was spreading them unprompted to anyone who would listen presumably you d be very very concerned these aren t normal behaviors nor are they signs of a well adjusted healthy and happy person they are rather signs of a person who has lost the ability to manage his or her emotions if this were your child you d intervene as quickly as you could getting him or her the help that is clearly needed likewise if this were your friend you might suggest he or she see a therapist to work through anger issues if this were your co worker you d probably alert someone in human resources and what if this were the president of the united states not only are these behaviors the norm for president donald trump but they also seem to have worsened at one of the most precarious and critical times for our country as we face a global pandemic that has killed nearly 70 000 americans less than two weeks after unimaginably suggesting injecting disinfectants might help kill off the coronavirus the past few days have seen him spiral out of control proving utterly incapable of staying focused on the biggest crisis a president can face instead he has it s a frightening commentary on the slow normalization of this completely abnormal behavior that we can greet the undeniable deterioration of the president of the united states with mere shrugs and the only concerns from his inner circle seem not to be about the mental instability itself but the political ramifications of it being exposed in daily press briefings advisers have argued they could be alienating some viewers including senior citizens worried about their health an associated press report says and officials at trump s re election campaign have also noted a slip in trump s support in some battleground states and have expressed concerns that the briefings which often contain inaccurate information may be playing a role the giant orange elephant in the room isn t that trump s impaired judgment might cost him the election it s that it may well have already cost american lives waiting until november to get trump out of harm s way is the only real option we have the constitution s 25th amendment designed to remove a president who is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office is inarguably applicable but politically impossible so like worried parents we ll just wait anxiously hope the worst doesn t happen and that there s a light at the end of this very dark tunnel until then who knows what our very sick president will do next send letters to letters suntimes com know about breaking news as it happens we follow the stories and update you as they develop there were no surprises this week as the sky waived forward alexis prince and 2020 third round pick japreece dean to trim their roster to 11 players by tuesday s deadline which was established last week in order for players to get paid starting june 1 lo m s probable es que vuelvan a o hare esta noche durmiendo ah de nuevo tratando de apoyarse uno con el otro usando sus chamarras para cobijarse me horroriza que nos sigas mintiendo y creas que esta reuni n es suficiente dijo una activista durante la reuni n virtual del s bado here s what we know today about the continuing spread of coronavirus and its ripple effects in chicago and illinois result ser el fin de semana de un memorial day m s mortal desde el 2015 the 29 year old also allegedly tried to hit officers with objects he threw out of a window police said
