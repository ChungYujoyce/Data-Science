advertisement by stuart a thompsonapril 30 2020 a vaccine would be the ultimate weapon against the coronavirus and the best route back to normal life officials like dr anthony s fauci the top infectious disease expert on the trump administration s coronavirus task force estimate a vaccine could arrive in at least 12 to 18 months the grim truth behind this rosy forecast is that a vaccine probably won t arrive any time soon clinical trials almost never succeed we ve never released a coronavirus vaccine for humans before our record for developing an entirely new vaccine is at least four years more time than the public or the economy can tolerate social distancing orders but if there was any time to fast track a vaccine it is now so times opinion asked vaccine experts how we could condense the timeline and get a vaccine in the next few months instead of years here s how we might achieve the impossible normally researchers need years to secure funding get approvals and study results piece by piece but these are not normal times there are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to covid 19 being explored if you want to make that 18 month timeframe one way to do that is put as many horses in the race as you can said dr peter hotez dean of the national school of tropical medicine at baylor college of medicine select vaccines by clinical trial start date rna

clinical trials are ever approved by the food and drug administration the rest fail in one way or another they are not effective don t perform better than existing drugs or have too many side effects 37 fail phase 1 69 fail phase 2 42 fail phase 3 15 fail new drug application approved 37 fail phase 1 69 42 15 phase 2 phase 3 new drug application approved fortunately we already have a head start on the first phase of vaccine development research the outbreaks of sars and mers which are also caused by coronaviruses spurred lots of research sars and sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 are roughly 80 percent identical and both use so called spike proteins to grab onto a specific receptor found on cells in human lungs this helps explain how scientists developed a test for covid 19 so quickly there s a cost to moving so quickly however the potential covid 19 vaccines now in the pipeline might be more likely to fail because of the swift march through the research phase said robert van exan a cell biologist who has worked in the vaccine industry for decades he predicts we won t see a vaccine approved until at least 2021 or 2022 and even then this is very optimistic and of relatively low probability and yet he said this kind of fast tracking is worth the try maybe we will get lucky varicella 28 years flumist 28 human papillomavirus 15 rotavirus 15 pediatric combination 11 covid 19 goal 18 months varicella 28 yrs flumist 28 h p v 15 rotavirus 15 pediatric combo 11 covid 19 goal 18 months the next step in the process is pre clinical and preparation work where a pilot factory is readied to produce enough vaccine for trials researchers relying on groundwork from the sars and mers outbreaks could theoretically move through planning steps swiftly sanofi a french biopharmaceutical company expects to begin clinical trials late this year for a covid 19 vaccine that it repurposed from work on a sars vaccine if successful the vaccine could be ready by late 2021 as a rule researchers don t begin jabbing people with experimental vaccines until after rigorous safety checks they test the vaccine first on small batches of people a few dozen during phase 1 then a few hundred in phase 2 then thousands in phase 3 months normally pass between phases so that researchers can review the findings and get approvals for subsequent phases but if we do it the conventional way there s no way we re going to be reaching that timeline of 18 months said akiko iwasaki a professor of immunobiology at yale university school of medicine and an investigator at the howard hughes medical institute there are ways to slash time off this process by combining several phases and testing vaccines on more people without as much waiting last week the national academy of sciences showed an overlapping timeline describing it as moving at pandemic speed it s here that talk of fast tracking the timeline meets the messiness of real life what if a promising vaccine actually makes it easier to catch the virus or makes the disease worse after someone s infected that s been the case for a few h i v drugs and vaccines for dengue fever because of a process called vaccine induced enhancement in which the body reacts unexpectedly and makes the disease more dangerous researchers can t easily infect vaccinated participants with the coronavirus to see how the body behaves they normally wait until some volunteers contract the virus naturally that means dosing people in regions hit hardest by the virus like new york or vaccinating family members of an infected person to see if they get the virus next if the pandemic subsides this step could be slowed that s why vaccines take such a long time said dr iwasaki but we re making everything very short hopefully we can evaluate these risks as they occur as soon as possible this is where the vaccine timelines start to diverge depending on who you are and where some people might get left behind if a vaccine proves successful in early trials regulators could issue an emergency use provision so that doctors nurses and other essential workers could get vaccinated right away even before the end of the year researchers at oxford announced this week that their coronavirus vaccine could be ready for emergency use by september if trials prove successful so researchers might produce a viable vaccine in just 12 to 18 months but that doesn t mean you re going to get it millions of people could be in line before you and that s only if the united states finds a vaccine first if another country like china beats us to it we could wait even longer while it doses its citizens first you might be glad of that though if it turned out that the fast tracked vaccine caused unexpected problems only after hundreds or thousands are vaccinated would researchers be able to see if a fast tracked vaccine led to problems like vaccine induced enhancement it s true that any new technology comes with a learning curve said dr paul offit the director of the vaccine education center at the children s hospital of philadelphia and sometimes that learning curve has a human price once we have a working vaccine in hand companies will need to start producing millions perhaps billions of doses in addition to the millions of vaccine doses that are already made each year for mumps measles and other illnesses it s an undertaking almost unimaginable in scope companies normally build new facilities perfectly tailored to any given vaccine because each vaccine requires different equipment some flu vaccines are produced using chicken eggs using large facilities where a version of the virus is incubated and harvested other vaccines require vats in which a virus is cultured in a broth of animal cells and later inactivated and purified those factories follow strict guidelines governing biological facilities and usually take around five years to build costing at least three times more than conventional pharmaceutical factories manufacturers may be able to speed this up by creating or repurposing existing facilities in the middle of clinical trials long before the vaccine in question receives f d a approval they just can t wait said dr iwasaki if it turns out to be a terrible vaccine they won t distribute it but at least they ll have the capability to do so if the vaccine is successful the bill and melinda gates foundation says it will build factories for seven different vaccines even though we ll end up picking at most two of them we re going to fund factories for all seven just so that we don t waste time bill gates said during an appearance on the daily show in the end the united states will have the capacity to mass produce only two or three vaccines said vijay samant the former head of vaccine manufacturing at merck the manufacturing task is insurmountable mr samant said i get sleepless nights thinking about it consider just one seemingly simple step putting the vaccine into vials manufacturers need to procure billions of vials and billions of stoppers to seal them sophisticated machines are needed to fill them precisely and each vial is inspected on a high speed line then vials are stored shipped and released to the public using a chain of temperature controlled facilities and trucks at each of these stages producers are already stretched to meet existing demands mr samant said it s a bottleneck similar to the one that caused a dearth of ventilators masks and other personal protective equipment just as covid 19 surged across america if you talk about vaccines long enough a new type of vaccine called messenger rna or mrna for short inevitably comes up there are hopes it could be manufactured at a record clip mr gates even included it on his time magazine list of six innovations that could change the world is it the miracle we re waiting for rather than injecting subjects with disease specific antigens to stimulate antibody production mrna vaccines give the body instructions to create those antigens itself because mrna vaccines don t need to be cultured in large quantities and then purified they are much faster to produce they could change the course of the fight against covid 19 on the other hand said dr van exan no one has ever made an rna vaccine for humans researchers conducting dozens of trials hope to change that including one by the pharmaceutical company moderna backed by investor capital and spurred by federal funding of up to 483 million to tackle covid 19 moderna has already fast tracked an mrna vaccine it s entering phase 1 trials this year and the company says it could have a vaccine ready for front line workers later this year could it work yeah it could work said dr fred ledley a professor of natural biology and applied sciences at bentley university but in terms of the probability of success what our data says is that there s a lower chance of approval and the trials take longer the technology is decades old yet mrna is not very stable and can break down inside the body at this point i m hoping for anything to work said dr iwasaki if it does work wonderful that s great we just don t know the fixation on mrna shows the allure of new and untested treatments during a medical crisis faced with the unsatisfying reality that our standard arsenal takes years to progress the mrna vaccine offers an enticing story mixed with hope and a hint of mystery but it s riskier than other established approaches imagine that the fateful day arrives scientists have created a successful vaccine they ve manufactured huge quantities of it people are dying the economy is crumbling it s time to start injecting people but first the federal government wants to take a peek that might seem like a bureaucratic nightmare a rubber stamp that could cost lives there s even a common gripe among researchers for every scientist employed by the f d a there are three lawyers and all they care about is liability yet f d a approvals are no mere formality approvals typically take a full year during which time scientists and advisory committees review the studies to make sure that the vaccine is as safe and effective as drug makers say it is while some steps in the vaccine timeline can be fast tracked or skipped entirely approvals aren t one of them there are horror stories from the past where vaccines were not properly tested in the 1950s for example a poorly produced batch of a polio vaccine was approved in a few hours it contained a version of the virus that wasn t quite dead so patients who got it actually contracted polio several children died the same scenario playing out today could be devastating for covid 19 with the anti vaccination movement and online conspiracy theorists eager to disrupt the public health response so while the f d a might do this as fast as possible expect months to pass before any vaccine gets a green light for mass public use at this point you might be asking why are all these research teams announcing such optimistic forecasts when so many experts are skeptical about even an 18 month timeline perhaps because it s not just the public listening it s investors too these biotechs are putting out all these press announcements said dr hotez you just need to recognize they re writing this for their shareholders not for the purposes of public health covid 19 lives in the shadow of the most vexing virus we ve ever faced h i v after nearly 40 years of work here is what we have to show for our vaccine efforts a few phase 3 clinical trials one of which actually made the disease worse and another with a success rate of just 30 percent 60k deaths deaths from covid 19 in the u s 50k 40k deaths from h i v aids in the u s 30k 20k 10k 0 1990 2000 2010 2020 60k deaths deaths from covid 19 in the u s 50k 40k deaths from h i v aids in the u s 30k 20k 10k 0 1990 2000 2010 2020 researchers say they don t expect a successful h i v vaccine until 2030 or later putting the timeline at around 50 years that s unlikely to be the case for covid 19 because as opposed to h i v it doesn t appear to mutate significantly and exists within a family of familiar respiratory viruses even still any delay will be difficult to bear but the history of h i v offers a glimmer of hope for how life could continue even without a vaccine researchers developed a litany of antiviral drugs that lowered the death rate and improved health outcomes for people living with aids today s drugs can lower the viral load in an h i v positive person so the virus can t be transmitted through sex therapeutic drugs rather than vaccines might likewise change the fight against covid 19 the world health organization began a global search for drugs to treat covid 19 patients in march if successful those drugs could lower the number of hospital admissions and help people recover faster from home while narrowing the infection window so fewer people catch the virus combine that with rigorous testing and contact tracing where infected patients are identified and their recent contacts notified and quarantined and the future starts looking a little brighter so far the united states is conducting fewer than half the number of tests required and we need to recruit more than 300 000 contact tracers but other countries have started reopening following exactly these steps if all those things come together life might return to normal long before a vaccine is ready to shoot into your arm stuart a thompson is a writer and the graphics director for times opinion
