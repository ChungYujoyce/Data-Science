 bow n h marco rubio is in an enviable position among mainstream republican presidential candidates after his strong finish in iowa yet the man is running scared the young floridian is stumping through new hampshire as if he s campaigning to win the cautious caucus he gives the same speech everywhere the most tightly managed candidate in the race he shuns risk and appears to live in mortal terror of mentioning the man who dominates the race at a town hall event here in central new hampshire on wednesday morning rubio as usual didn t mention donald trump in his speech but the first questioner a businesswoman practically begged the candidate to trash trump asking him to comment on trump s very definite views of the disabled including calling people stupid and attempting to remove disabled veterans from one of his properties rubio demurred saying only that he had already called out donald for his distasteful mocking of a disabled reporter at an event he then dropped the trump talk and moved on rival chris christie mocked rubio on tuesday as the boy in the bubble managed by his handlers this criticism apparently smoked rubio out because he took a few questions from reporters before his event in laconia n h on wednesday afternoon the first questioner noted that rubio had poked other candidates but not mr trump why donald hasn t really outlined any position on policies rubio reasoned so when the time comes and it s appropriate we ll do so why do you deliver the same speech wherever you go the second questioner asked cause it s my message he said it s the reason i m running for president rubio s determination not to be taken off of this bland message or to engage trump may give the impression that he is above the fray but it also can make him look weak and callow while other candidates particularly jeb bush have denounced trump s outrages rubio and allied groups have spent upward of 30million on ads so far some of it targeting bush christie and ted cruz but none of it targeting trump rubio has mentioned trump a couple of times on twitter in debates he has frequently deflects questions about the mogul after the december debate in which rubio declined a chance to take on trump s proposed ban on muslims entering the country fox news asked rubio why he hadn t gone after trump rubio said he wasn t going to spend a valuable 75 seconds on a debate stage talking about something that s never going to happen likewise asked to comment on trump s qualifications as a conservative rubio said that the billionaire is running as someone who s a populist who s upset about the direction of this country as am i as are millions of americans on other occasions rubio declined to talk about trump s mosque closing ideas well i think we need to target radicalism and trump s plan for mass deportation of illegal immigrants both sides have points to make here that are valid asked back in september whether he would engage trump rubio replied no i m ready to talk about who i am and why i m running it s not as if trump returns the politeness ann coulter warming up a trump crowd tuesday night called rubio a cuban boy who wears high heels and has big ears ever cautious rubio ridiculed last month for wearing booties with thick heels quickly retired the offending footwear rubio s strong iowa finish has brought new attention and overcapacity crowds in new hampshire but the would be supporters are greeted by a robot the closest rubio gets to trump in his stump speech is observing as he did here in bow that you have a right to be angry but anger is not a plan what exactly do you want to do or as he put it in laconia a few hours later anger is not a plan frustration is not a plan you have a right to be frustrated you have a right to be angry but what exactly are you going to do about it voters questions rather than spurring spontaneity inspire more caution asked wednesday what he d do about the millions of illegal immigrants who otherwise haven t broken any law rubio said we ll figure something out the logic behind rubio s candidacy recited in his speeches is that as he put it in bow i give us the best chance to win and if you don t believe me ask a democrat they do not want to run against me or as he said in laconia if i m our nominee we will win and the democrats know this they do not want to run against me if he keeps playing the boy in the bubble they may reconsider twitter milbank read more from dana milbank s archive follow him on twitter or subscribe to his updates on facebook read more paul waldman can the media and the gop establishment sell marco rubio ed rogers is this now a cruz rubio race george will marco rubio s record of bad judgment we are a participant in the amazon services llc associates program an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon com and affiliated sites
