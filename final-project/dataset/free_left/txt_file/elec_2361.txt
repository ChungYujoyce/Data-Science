it s been obvious for some time that the republican establishment was likely going to have to make a choice between the lesser of two evils the gop establishment lane has had a pile up right at the start and nobody can get through it so the outsider lane is the only one available they are coming very close to having to decide which horse to jump on and by the looks of it they ve decided that if they have to make this unpalatable choice in order to have a chance to win the election they will choose donald trump yesterdaysalon s elias isquithwrote about this and cited awashington post story that had the republican fatcat donorsall starting to sniff around trump looking for ways to curry favor now that their favorites like marco rubio and jeb bush seem to have cratered we all know trump cannot be bought he says so every day greed is simply not part of his personal character even more importantly trump has no ego so it s very unlikely he will be influenced by flattery and sweet talk from his wealthy peers nonetheless they seem to think it will be worth their while to get access to him go figure meanwhile the new york times reportedthat retired senator bob dole always one to spill the beans even before he became an elder statesman and decided he really didn t give a damn about propriety anymore says trump is the establishment s man and he didn t mince words about reason they just cannot stand ted cruz i question his allegiance to the party mr dole said of mr cruz i don t know how often you ve heard him say the word republican not very often instead mr cruz uses the word conservative mr dole said before offering up a different word for mr cruz extremist i don t know how he s going to deal with congress he said nobody likes him but mr dole said he thought mr trump could probably work with congress because he s you know he s got the right personality and he s kind of a deal maker the remarks by mr dole reflect wider unease with mr cruz among members of the republican establishment but few leading members of the party have been as candid and cutting if he s the nominee we re going to have wholesale losses in congress and state offices and governors and legislatures said mr dole who served in the house and senate for 35 years and won the iowa caucuses twice he described mr cruz as having falsely convinced the iowa voters that he s kind of a mainstream conservative the only person who could stop mr cruz from capturing the nomination i think it s trump mr dole said adding that mr trump was gaining a little it s hard to wrap your mind around a party that thinksdonald trump king of the birthers the man who promises to deport 12 million latinos bring back torture and summary execution and bar all muslims from entering the u s is less of an extremist than ted cruz apparently all that s fine as long as you don t say mean things about elected officials and have they never heard a donald trump speech not to say that that ted cruz isn t an extremist of course he is he s a bona fide far right conservative movement zealot and sure the party establishment has been at war with the tea party freedom caucus types for a while now but they haven t come right out and openly dissed them suddenly they are feeling free to do that and that s because they have another far right zealot to present to the rubes one who they believe is more malleable and would by necessity be forced to turn to them for expert guidance if he were to win the nomination according to the national review sreport from the gop s retreat last week these people feel downright confident that trump is such an empty suit they ll be able to dominate him with little problem cruz not so much the developing feeling among house republicans donald trump is preferable to ted cruz if you look at trump s actual policies they re pretty thin there s not a lot of meat there says one republican member in ryan s inner circle who requested anonymity to speak frankly about the two front runners as leadership has carefully avoided doing all week if trump were to get the nomination he would be looking to answer the question where s the beef and we will have that for him says the member the member says he believes that when it comes down to it almost all of the candidates would subscribe to the conservative agenda he and the rest of leadership are hoping to advance except that is for cruz look at the senate he hasn t been a team player he s always been his own person with his own aspirations and his own vision only concerned with where he wants to go and you know for us we want to work closely with the president and with cruz there s a question of whether that could happen cruz was certainly looking out for himself but there are millions of tea partiers who think he was doing exactly what they sent him to washington to do and looking out for them essentially these establishment types are repudiating the conservative movement in favor of someone they clearly and surely erroneously see as a sort of simple clown they ll be able to dominate once he s in office and is dependent upon their superior knowledge and experience what planet are they on do they really look at trump and see someone who plays well with others someone who isn t a stone cold narcissist and megalomaniac who is clueless about everything important to the job he is seeking do they think this is all an act if all this is true and the establishment is truly reconciling itself to donald trump thenrepublicans have managed to be even more nihilistic and irresponsible than i ever could have believed possible they hate ted cruz for being rude and self serving more than they are concerned that trump is promising to turn this country into an authoritarian police state of course cruz would not be a goodpresident he would be a nightmare too but i would have thought the republicans had enough respect for themselves their party and the movement they created to acknowledge that ted cruz is at leastqualifiedto be president and be willing to lose with him rather than risk the world falling into the hands of an unhinged messianic billionaire bond villain indeed one would think they d see the silver lining in losing with cruz since the tea partiers would never be able to say that he lost because he wasn t conservative enough if the gop accepts donald trump s openly xenophobic white supremacist nationalist agenda as the republican platform whatever was left of sanity in the gop is gone they are setting their party on fire and risking immolating the whole country in the process even worse they don t seem to care that the election of this man as president of the united states would turn the entire world order upside down overnight because everyone on the planet would assume that the world s only superpower gone mad and they would be right it s important to note that that trump has expressed admiration for only two leaders during this campaign vladimir putin and kim jong un it s highly unlikely if trump becomes the most powerful man in the world he ll be humbly asking the house gop weenie caucus to hold his hand and tell him what to do and yes in case you
