watch cbsn live july 3 2019 6 10 am cbs news intelligence matters russ traverscorrespondent michael morellproducer olivia gazis jamie benson michael morell russ welcome to the show it is great to have you on intelligence matters russ travers it s my pleasure michael michael morell so russ maybe the place to start is by having you talk a bit about your career in the ic and how did you find yourself working on terrorism at the end of the day russ travers sure it was a lot of serendipity i started out as a military intelligence officer in the army and i d always thought i wanted to go to law school so i took the opportunity when i got out of the service to come up to dc went to law school at night and worked at dia for several years i spent some time with the national intelligence council michael morell do you remember what you worked on at dia russ travers i was primarily a soviet analyst michael morell okay as were many people at the time russ travers yeah it was back in that generation for sure and at the tail end of my time at dia i was working on soviet perceptions issues kind of trying to get in the head of what was going on with change in the soviet union so it was really interesting and then was selected to go to the national intelligence council for a couple years so i spent two years as a deputy nio i went back to dia as sort of the equivalent of a national intelligence officer for the defense department and michael morell dios i think they were called right russ travers they were called dios that s right michael morell yeah defense intelligence officers yeah russ travers indeed and then my hierarchy at dia thought i needed to get some current intelligence time so i went down to the j2 and i spent about three years as the senior person down in the joint staff as the deputy in the j2 office and from there my wife was foreign service so i was looking for an overseas slot and so michael morell and j2 is the intelligence russ travers it is the director for intelligence on the joint staff right we went to london for two years from 99 to 01 and then 9 11 happened while we were there and i got called back to be one of the deputies at dia and i had the homeland security account at the time and spent a couple years doing that and then in 2003 when president bush announced the stand up of the terrorist threat integration center to bring together cia and fbi john brennan headed ttc at the time he was looking for a defense intelligence ses and so i raised my hand because i very firmly believed that the inter agency approach was the way to go so i ve pretty much spent all my time either bouncing back between nctc and the white house since then michael morell yeah and at the white house you were remind us russ travers i had two jobs one i worked for john brennan as the guy that was working on the wikileaks issue back in 2010 went back to nctc and then went back to the white house as a special assistant to the president doing transnational issues i was very firmly of the view that we could utilize lessons learned from the counter terrorism fight for all other transnational issues and so i tried to expand on that while i was at the white house michael morell so russ what s the role of nctc what does it do every day russ travers yeah it s an important question because when we were formed there was already a robust counter terrorism community and so the way i try to explain it is in the early days we were working on the tactical shortcomings associated with the 9 11 problem why did we miss it what were the information sharing issues why weren t we properly coordinated and integrated across the government and so that was really the first for the first several years we were focused on that i think there is actually probably a broader issue and that is nctc i think will prove to be the first foray into how the government deals with the downsides of globalization and so we re really fleshing that out as we work through the counter terrorism effort because these problems straddle foreign and domestic they don t lend themselves to any one department or agency within the government and so as a result nctc serves that we straddle the foreign and domestic and therefore we support both fbi and cia and we draw from information across the entirety of the government so we have broader authorities than anybody in terms of accessing information michael morell russ perhaps we can dig into the current terrorist threat picture facing the united states and our allies and maybe the place to start because it s in the news is iran can we talk a little bit about iran and terrorism is it a state sponsor of terror do you consider the attacks on commercial ships that we ve seen acts of terror how do you think about iran russ travers yeah there s no question in our mind that iran is the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism and the quds force as you may have seen was designated as a foreign terrorist organization and the way they will use the shia militia groups to attack whether it s political or military targets around the middle east is a matter of tremendous concern to us and so we certainly do view those as state sponsored terrorism michael morell and they have a long history russ travers they do indeed decades michael morell in this area russ travers yeah michael morell secretary pompeo has said that the iranians were responsible for recent attack in kabul that injured four us servicemen is that the way you see that attack russ travers it is we can t go very far into that but yes we do believe that the iranians are pretty far afield and they are in fact coordinating many nefarious activities around that area michael morell and why at the end of the day would the iranians i think i know the answer to this but why would the iranians want to support a sunni group the taliban right when they re shia why would they want to do that russ travers anything they can do to poke a stick in the united states eye is something that they re going to do they want us out of the area they want to be the hegemony in the area and we are a counterweight to that michael morell and then maybe the most important iranian terrorist link is hezbollah could you talk a little bit about hezbollah the threat it poses not only in the region but more globally russ travers effectively the same answer as you say hezbollah s been a problem for us for many many decades nasrallah is a very serious actor he has cultivated capabilities michael morell he s the leader of the group russ travers he is the leader of hezbollah we think that they re careful in terms of their degree to escalate they don t want warn i think there have been instances before where there have been miscalculations and he wants to be careful about that but he certainly has a very rich set of capabilities to utilize against western actors michael morell and to remind people i think this is true correct me if i m wrong but prior to 9 11 hezbollah had killed more american than any other terrorist group russ travers no question that s right michael morell russ does any other country come close to iran as a state sponsor is pakistan up there how do you think about that russ travers none whatsoever they are in a category of themselves michael morell the pakistanis though if we could just maybe unpack that a little bit all administrations have been frustrated with pakistan s support to terrorist groups this administration has done it publicly to a degree that others haven t why do the pakistanis provide support to the taliban and then why do they provide support to anti india groups russ travers well this too goes back decades the pakistanis have been and will forever be very concerned about the indians and they will look at their proxies as an ability to push back against india they re feeling a little bit isolated themselves and so they will take every opportunity to push back against any perceived enemies michael morell okay isis and al qaeda handful of questions here what s the primary difference between the two russ travers well they ve come up through different areas obviously al qaeda in iraq was an offshoot of al qaeda and that became isis they do have different theological approaches in that elements of isis have declared al qaeda to be apostate there are areas in which isis and al qaeda will cooperate for instance in west africa there are areas in which they fight amongst themselves in yemen and in somalia given the view of the necessity of a near term caliphate which is very much in isis s view al qaeda was much more long term about this you have those kinds of differences between and amongst themselves michael morell so the isis threat how do you see it in the aftermath of the collapse of the caliphate russ travers yeah you know there s a lot of very good news out there in terms of isis s as you say the defeat of the caliphate they lost a ton of leaders for a while they were having a very difficult time exercising command and control pushing money around but on the flip side a lot of that capability is being reconstituted we re looking at a core of isis that is still exercising command and control over michael morell reconstituted in russ travers in iraq and syria michael morell iraq russ travers and syria primarily michael morell now syria russ travers in iraq and very much of an insurgency forum but i think it s important to note that they ve known that this has been coming for a couple of years and so they ve been planning for it and so they re operating in insurgent cells and they probably at a minimum there are 14 plus thousand individuals operating largely in iraq and to a lesser degree syria this is an order of magnitude more people than isis had six seven years ago at the beginning of the insurgency so we need to recognize that that combination coupled with the inability of iraq to deal with very dissatisfied sunnis in the north and western part of iraq is going to be a huge problem going forward but in addition to that the global nature of this can t be overestimated because they do in fact have individuals in 20 or so countries networks that range from hundreds of people to thousands of people and if you just compare the map the way it s spreading particularly in places like africa this is going to be a concern for us for a very long while it s a challenge for intelligence community because we need to distinguish between and amongst what are local insurgency problems or maybe they are a step higher and they can affect us interests whether they be private or governmental and then at the highest are they able to reach out and touch the united states and just imagine the challenge this poses to our community in terms of collection and analysis of a very diffuse diverse threat michael morell in terms of isis outside of iraq and syria where are those parts of the world that you re most worried about russ travers oh isis khorasan in afghanistan is certainly a big concern isis sinai is pretty active the extent to which we are seeing isis sprout up in africa is a challenge because it s not an area that we are particularly well postured to do collection against there is michael morell and is this primarily west africa russ travers west africa but also in the eastern part of the democratic republic of congo mozambique had an islamic insurgency problem for 25 years they have now wrapped themselves in the isis flag and so they re threatening liquid natural gas us interests in northern mozambique so we need to be particularly attuned to where the us interests are and the ability of these capabilities to attack us michael morell do you have the sense that americans understand what you just said about isis because it s my sense that people think problem solved russ travers i think you re exactly right that they do view problem solved and we need to be incredibly careful when i testify now complacency is the word that i use a lot because i do worry that we are a bit of a victim of our own success there s a bit of a fatigue factor i think settling in with terrorism in general and because we haven t seen obviously a large scale attack in the united states on the scale of 9 11 in two decades even attacks against western interests you have to go back several years to charlie hebdo for al qaeda or for the paris or brussels attacks several years and so there s a sense that maybe the problem s gone away i completely agree that there is a bit of a lull and that s a good thing but i think it s at the same time there are a lotta ominous trends out there and i don t think anyone wants to view this lull as continuing in perpetuity we ve got a lot of work to do and the key question now is going to be the extent to which we reallocate resources and attention away from terrorism i actually am in complete agreement with former secretary mattis s national strategy that says we need to focus on great power states and so forth we just need to be careful that we don t take our eye off the ball when it comes to terrorism because we ve built what i believe is the best example of integration across our government with the ct community and well it s robust and i suspect there are resources that can be taken away we need to ensure that we don t go too far and undermine our capabilities and put us back in kind of a pre 9 11 state michael morell so russ we talked about isis al qaeda how do you think about the al qaeda threat today russ travers you know they ve been waiting in the wings much like isis we have a command and control structure we have a half dozen or so affiliates they are to varying degrees in better or worse shape but in general we re seeing what used to be very sort of hierarchical when we were looking at this back after 9 11 we were focused primarily on one little piece of real estate along the pak afghan border and now you got north africa and you ve got yemen and you ve got somalia and so what we re seeing an interesting case from a few months ago there was an attack against a hotel in kenya that was executed by shabaab there was an attack a week or so later executed by jnim part of al qaeda and the islamic maghreb that was conducted against a west african un facility they came out almost immediately with an announcement that these were both done because of jerusalem related issues it was kind of a marketing campaign that demonstrates a lateral level of communication and coordination that didn t exist before and so their capabilities are of significant concern as well michael morell and if there was a particular al qaeda group to focus on to worry about would you say aqap in yemen or would you say something else russ travers yeah i think aqap in yemen is probably the greatest long term concern for us yes michael morell so russ let s switch from the actual groups to the homeland to the terrorist threat here in the homeland what do you worry about the most russ travers well i think the current threat as i said because there is a lull and diminished large scale external ops capability from both isis and al qaeda it is the hve threat for sure and that s michael morell and by hve you mean russ travers i m sorry homegrown violent extremist threat and that s a challenge for us because it tends to be very individually specific the notion of how individuals get radicalized and mobilized to violence there s a lot of people out there and a lot of discontented people out there and so it s a challenge for our law enforcement organizations in particular nctc s role in this is very much along the lines of looking at how the radicalization mobilization process works in support of the bureau and now we are dealing increasingly not only with islamists but also right wing domestic terrorism problem set and michael morell and you guys look at that too russ travers we have looked at it traditionally when there is a linkage to overseas and as we as a government think through how we re going to best posture ourselves to do domestic terrorism itself under our statutory remit international terrorism is where we are we have a degree of primacy the fbi is undoubtedly the lead on domestic terrorism and so we re trying to support them it is our view that a lot of the individuals who are in fact becoming radicalized and mobilized it s tactics techniques procedures that look a lot like islamists so there s a lot of use of the internet there s a lot of the same kinds of processes that individuals go through whether they be individualized or group or societal impact on people and so we think we can be value add there and we certainly believe that to the degree that right wing or left wing individuals in the united states have got contact with those overseas then that too is something nctc michael morell do we see any of those contacts do we see any of those links russ travers we do i think it s fair to say that there s a lot more of them there than we have seen thus far because it hasn t been an area of intense focus for this community for the last 50 years michael morell sure sure russ travers but there will be much more of it going forward but that s partly a collection issue i think michael morell yeah not only maybe some of it s been there for a long time we just haven t looked for it but it s undoubtedly grown as well as politics has become more divisive across much of the world russ travers i think that is exactly right and we need to be careful and we don t want this to become a cause and to some degree i m afraid it already has certainly the individual who conducted christchurch has become a bit of a celebrity in those circles much like the kid who conducted the attack up in the nordics several years ago and so what we re seeing is islamists sort of react to what s going on on the right wing we re seeing the right wing react to everything from immigration to islamists and that s going to be a challenge for all of us going forward michael morell in terms of the hve threat and particularly as it s motivated by isis have we seen a decline in that since they lost the caliphate or not russ travers it s a matter of some debate in the case of the united states we don t get a ton of these sorts of attacks sort of a half dozen or so a year i think is the accurate number where we have seen a substantial decline is in europe 2017 was sort of a high mark last year was substantially lower part of that we think is because of the decline of the caliphate partly it is because the europeans are just getting better at this and there s more information sharing and more coordination between and amongst those countries and so i suspect it s a little bit of both michael morell russ i want to switch back to some bigger picture issues if that s okay and we ve touched on these a little bit and maybe we can go a little bit deeper the first is how you think about the future of counter terrorism particularly at a time when so many other national security threats and challenges need the attention of the ic and you talked about this a little bit but may need a little bit more the ct is a bill payer for those and how would you advise the dni congress about thinking about risk in that environment russ travers it s a very timely question because i think there is a constituency that believes that ct does need to be part of a bill payer for some of these other issues and i don t necessarily disagree with that as i said nctc was additive to a pretty robust community that existed at cia and at fbi and dia and nsa and so forth and so what we need to do i think as a community as a government is determine how can we be the most efficiently organized do we have the right constellation of organizations and of authorities to work the ct problem to the extent it needs to be worked and then also do russia china cyber it s a pretty complicated world and so one of the points i took away when i was at the white house was that that transnational organized crime national strategy had just come out in 2012 i think and it explicitly said that tac transnational crime was robbed to pay terrorism all right when you think about risk and you think about some of these alternative national security problems transnational organized crime kills far more american than terrorism ever will and yet it is very under resourced when it comes to collection and analysis there s a great deal of effort within the law enforcement community but the national intelligence community has been somewhat less focused on it so my guess is as we move forward we are going to see some reallocation of resources and the issue is how do you ensure you have enough analysis but you re not too redundant are we collecting the right things when it comes to the terrorism problem again against a very diverse and diffuse threat which vastly complicates our efforts are we doing the big data thing correctly right now pretty much every department and agency is going after all the data it possibly can in support of its analysis that s probably not the most efficient way to do things but given the way our community is organized and structured and the authority is constructed that s the way things are right now so we ve got some really hard questions going forward i think because we are all swimming in that ever increasing size of the haystack and the needles themselves are getting more subtle again in the hve context how do you know when an individual is a particular concern this is eating the lunch of our colleagues in europe right now they will have tens and 20 thousands of individuals they should be following which one is more important how do you prioritize how do you allocate limited investigative resources my sense is that we are all going to be struggling with this which means you probably do run the risk that you re going to have small scale attacks we are never going to eliminate terrorism what we re trying to do is get it down to the point where it is a law enforcement problem and we have enough intelligence community focus on it to ensure that we know if it s becoming a greater problem michael morell so i share that view obviously i spent a huge chunk of my latter career focused on terrorism so i do share the view about being careful in removing resources and you know one of the things that jumps to mind to me russ is how many resources we moved away from the soviet union and russia and then where we found ourselves right in terms of our ability to collect intelligence on what became and what is today a crucial issue so that should be in the back of everybody s mind here russ travers yeah we spend a tremendous amount of our national treasure on the intelligence community it does seem to me like we should be able to walk and chew gum in all these areas but it s going require some really hard decisions i think michael morell so russ i also wanna ask you about something else you hinted at earlier and that is do you think there are lessons learned from the way the ic has tackled terrorism since 9 11 that can be applied to the other big issues that we re facing russ travers yeah i very much do as i think i suggested earlier i believe that the counterterrorism community is the best exemplar we have of interagency integration across our government and the things that we went through after 9 11 i think have got broader applicability and gets back to this notion of my own view would be that the imperative for our community is figuring out how do we deal with the downside of globalization where issues transcend department or agency equities they probably straddle the foreign and domestic community all right so how do you do that and a lot of it begins with information sharing michael morell a great example right would be foreign interference in our politics russ travers absolutely michael morell it s a great example fits all the categories you just said russ travers and i think that s really important because it s not just the traditional transnational threats cyber proliferation counterintelligence transnational crime like terrorism but it s also the great power struggle it s interference in elections it s also chinese intellectual property theft that goes on so we as a government are still struggling with how exactly do we deal with these problems how do we ensure that from our intelligence community perspective that we ve got our arms wrapped around them and what we ve found i think with the nctc experiment is that when you bring the government together in sort of a very large interagency taskforce we ve got 20 odd organizations at nctc we ve got all of their networks that come together you have the cultures of those organizations and then you have reach back michael morell and you have the authorities right too russ travers that s right and so i may be wrong but i ll bet down the road that we re going to see more of this nctc like approach to many of these problems because it s frankly worked pretty well i think michael morell so russ another area i want to talk about is politics you ve been at the intelligence business for a long time how do you think about the ic operating in such a politicized political environment today russ travers yeah so i do go back to the carter administration in terms of my service and at the end of the day the intelligence community we provide facts and objective analysis of those facts and we try to keep the debate intellectually honest and it seems to me that if we just keep our young people focused on that keep their heads down just do your jobs i m incredibly proud of the hierarchy within our intelligence community because i think they ve protected the young people and have been a source of tremendous support it s hard when the institutions are getting hammered the way they are i don t think it s healthy having done this for 40 years i look around a community that i m incredibly proud to have been associated with these are very bright people who are trying to do nothing more than good government and be supportive of our policymakers irrespective of party irrespective of affiliation and so long as we do that i think that whether it s our law enforcement intelligence professionals or our national intelligence professionals or our military intelligence professionals that they can keep their heads up and they can do good work and hopefully stay out of the political fray michael morell do your young officers worry about this and how do you talk to them about it russ travers they do our director joe maguire is fabulous at talking to our young people about focus on the mission and just leave all the political nonsense to the seniors and i think it helps i mean i think morale is actually pretty high honestly the terrorism community has been we haven t been hammered the way some parts of our government have so that s helped some but in general this is a leadership issue in terms of ensuring that all of our young people are able to come in and do their jobs the way they re supposed to michael morell russ you ve been terrific with your time i just have a couple more questions for you looking long term what do you see as the intelligence community s most significant challenges going forward russ travers you know when the irtpa intelligence reform terrorism prevention act it overhauled parts of our community after 9 11 was passed there was a lot of consternation about whether or not it had things right i think we re going to have to take a look at that moving forward but when you get down into the the practical issues data is a tremendous problem for us you know when nctc started the iphone hadn t been invented i mean we were dealing with documents off of the battlefield now we re dealing with phones and computers how do we process that information and how much information is enough and when do you just stop and we haven t got that figured out i completely agree with sue gordon who s been carrying the guide on for artificial intelligence and machine learning we are going to have to improve our use of technology to process that information however we again have got all of our departments and agencies within the community do this differently and so when you have unstructured data that s unstructured in different forms it makes it really hard for machines to help the analysts do their jobs and so there is some hard thinking that we re going to have to go through i think if we have any hope of being able to process that information i should say we have come lightyears compared to where we were 18 19 years ago in terms of our ability to process information and quote unquote connect those dots we re pretty good at it and we ve done it a lot whenever there s a dot that looks pretty suspicious we can pull the thread and we can work with all of our partners and good things happen overseas and in the united states the hardest issue is uncovering unknowns and that really came to light in 2009 with the christmas day bombing we didn t know that umar farouk abdulmutallab was an important guy and so a lot of what we ve been doing over the last decade as a community is trying to figure out how do you uncover individuals when you didn t know they were important and then how do you find all the relevant information that s going to be a problem for us i think going forward michael morell i think you know one of the issues is as fast as the community moves on the technology front technology is moving in most cases even faster right so not only how do you get to the cutting edge but then how do you keep up with the cutting edge russ travers that s right and it s not just technology the fact that technology is going so much faster than legal and policy and security issues they re lagging behind increasingly so they re getting left in the dust and that s a problem again because these problem sets that straddle foreign and domestic they ve got implications then for privacy for sovereignty for crying out loud and so how do we decide in the case of nctc intelligence community organization what role should we be playing in domestic terrorism purely domestic terrorism that s a very good question that we re going to have to work our way through michael morell russ one more question what do you want the country to know about the women and men who work at nctc russ travers you know we got about 1 000 individuals at all ranks all grades and background and i could not be prouder of those young men and women it s really the reason that i ve stayed around way past my retirement eligibility date because i so thoroughly enjoy and get tremendous reward from the work that they do they give up weekends and holidays and i think the american public doesn t have a clue as to the blood and sweat that our young people are throwing into this problem set because they care so desperately so i d like to see a greater recognition of just the role that our public servants play
