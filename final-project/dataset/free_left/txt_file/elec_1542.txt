advertisement supported by political memo by jonathan martin los angeles the mayor of los angeles was attempting to praise joseph r biden jr to the press but mr biden s aides were more focused on shooing the press away at the end of a made for cameras lunch he shared with mr biden at a taco stand last week mayor eric garcetti had to raise his voice over a phalanx of biden staff members who were attempting to end the question and answer session between the former vice president and about 40 reporters and photographers swarming their table i want to say one last thing the mayor twice said over the din before offering his homage los angeles loves joe biden and joe biden loves los angeles the tape recorders and cameras were soon shut off and mr biden exited king taco without having veered off message as the famously voluble mr biden makes his first retail campaign stops in the democratic primary and grows accustomed to the front runner status he never enjoyed in his two previous white house bids his campaign is grappling with how to showcase mr biden s never met a stranger persona without exposing him to an environment where he may commit a gaffe so far they have struck a safe if precarious balance just over two weeks into mr biden s candidacy the most notable feature of his campaign may be what hasn t happened he has not blurted anything out that delights his rivals horrifies his aides and reinforces his image as uncle joe america s there he goes again relative who makes you smile and wince in equal measure sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race it is early yet which even mr biden s friends allow as they hold their breath and precedent offers good reason to question whether his streak of mostly error free days can last but his staff has sought to mitigate the risk by effectively recreating the trappings of the vice presidency guarding question and answer sessions selecting safe interview settings and remaining all but glued to his hip when he greets voters on rope lines dips into ice cream shops and steps out of the black chevy suburbans that are indistinguishable from the secret service models he once rode in there are notes on his lectern to remind him of key policy points depending on the locale and his schedule has been carefully planned he has appeared at nearly as many fund raisers five as he has rallies six mr biden is not dodging the news media he has taken questions from national reporters and spoken even more frequently to local print and television outlets and he has opened his fund raisers to press coverage yet that step toward transparency also doubles as a means of nudging him to stay on script after courting danger by taking questions from donors at an appearance in south carolina mr biden said his nickname for president trump would be clown he did not ask for audience questions at subsequent fund raisers mr biden is hardly the only candidate to travel with an entourage and tread carefully around the news media senator bernie sanders of vermont for example rarely takes press questions and mr biden s aides feel they need to manage his appearances in part because of the sheer demand for access to a famous former vice president and the logistics of say moving tv cameras and boom microphones into a taco joint some democrats wonder whether such a cosseted approach is sustainable for a 76 year old candidate facing questions about his age especially in iowa and new hampshire where the famously demanding activists famously demand accessibility to presidential hopefuls mr biden delivered speeches but did not take questions during his first trip to iowa though he s expected to do so in new hampshire this week check out our tracker of the 2020 democratic candidate field after a speech he has planned for philadelphia this saturday aides say mr biden will turn to delivering some policy proposals including a foreign policy blueprint and some of his longtime friends are urging him not to don a rhetorical straitjacket handlers can ruin you said former senator harry reid of nevada adding fondly i had the best in the world shortly before mr biden stopped in to see him last week at his office in las vegas s bellagio casino mr reid who is also given to malapropisms recalled how his advisers relentlessly sought to steer his debates and news conferences and how he was better off being his unvarnished self i just think that joe biden just needs to be himself mr reid said in an interview everybody likes him he s a nice guy mr reid the former senate democratic leader is not endorsing a candidate but he said mr biden was in really a good position because people are looking for some stability mr biden has not been completely without bidenisms including two that drew attention to his age referring to the british prime minister as margaret thatcher rather than theresa may and boasting that he knew even more about foreign policy than henry kissinger does in the early stages of his candidacy though the most powerful check on mr biden has been mr biden himself to the pleasant surprise of his supporters he has demonstrated uncharacteristic restraint in the face of temptation when a woman yelled out you can hug and kiss me anytime at a rally near las vegas last week mr biden smiled made the sign of the cross and after a pause simply said that s nice thank you very much it was a markedly different response than before he got in the race when in the wake of claims from women that his physical contact made them uneasy he twice joked about hugging people during a speech to union members and when a biden supporter at the taco king yelled out his encouragement across the restaurant kick that orange ape out of office a reference to the well tanned incumbent the former vice president not only declined to pile on he even voiced his restraint i didn t say that he made clear to the press scrum he has also not taken the bait from his closest democratic rival in the polls mr sanders refusing to return fire when the senator has criticized him i will not speak ill of any of the democratic candidates i will not do it mr biden said in los angeles his aides believe that the intensely personal criticism he received from women last month and the subsequent coverage about his longtime penchant for physical contact was eye opening for mr biden it made clear that as front runner he would be under a microscope and face unrelenting scrutiny two of his advisers said it s not that mr biden wasn t already aware of the hot lights of the presidential stage his first white house bid flamed out after he was found to be borrowing from the speeches of others and his second campaign began with self created turmoil when he called barack obama the first african american candidate for president who was clean and articulate this time though mr biden plainly feels chastened he reaches for the phones of supporters when he greets them offering selfies as often as embraces and when he does hug a supporter it is usually when he is asked for one or after he asks permission democrats who know mr biden have been impressed with his discipline but are quick to muse about how he will fare as the campaign wears on as he grows more comfortable and perhaps less guarded i think they ve been really really adroit in the early going said david axelrod who helped lead both obama biden campaigns clearly they re trying to do enough to show the flag but not so much that it exposes him to either mistakes or fatigue but the pace is going to quicken as the race goes on and you can t keep him in candidate protection program mr biden will have to become more venturesome mr axelrod added because one of the tests for a guy who s 76 years old is can he handle this for now mr biden is avoiding risks at king taco mr garcetti invited two female customers to join him and his guest of honor when the mayor asked what they did for a living one of the women replied i own my spray tanning business do you need a spray tan much laughter ensued but it was the mayor who shot back with the irresistible rejoinder wrong candidate that s the other guy who s already in there mr garcetti joked about mr trump mr biden stayed quiet updated may 25 2020 advertisement
