read our privacy policy here a year ago concerned that ordinary citizens would be locked out of the presidential nominating process the nation argued that a vigorously contested primary would be good for the candidates for the democratic party and for democracy two months later senator bernie sanders formally launched a campaign that has already transformed the politics of the 2016 presidential race galvanized by his demands for economic and social justice hundreds of thousands of americans have packed his rallies and over 1 million small donors have helped his campaign shatter fund raising records while breaking the stranglehold of corporate money sanders s clarion call for fundamental reform single payer healthcare tuition free college a 15 an hour minimum wage the breaking up of the big banks ensuring that the rich pay their fair share of taxes has inspired working people across the country his bold response to the climate crisis has attracted legions of young voters and his foreign policy which emphasizes diplomacy over regime change speaks powerfully to war weary citizens most important sanders has used his insurgent campaign to tell americans the truth about the challenges that confront us he has summoned the people to a political revolution arguing that the changes our country so desperately needs can only happen when we wrest our democracy from the corrupt grip of wall street bankers and billionaires ad policy function load article ads if jquery ad halfpage 199733 0 is empty call ad new halfpage tn article ad halfpage 199733 0 rectangle 1 jquery expand

endorsing bernie sanders for president this magazine rarely makes endorsements in the democratic primary we ve done so only twice for jesse jackson in 1988 and for barack obama in 2008 we do so now impelled by the awareness that our rigged system works for the few and not for the many americans are waking up to this reality and they are demanding change this understanding animates both the republican and democratic primaries though it has taken those two contests in fundamentally different directions at the core of this crisis is inequality both economic and political the united states has become a plutocracy one in which as sanders puts it we not only have massive wealth and income inequality but a power structure which protects that inequality america s middle class has melted away while the gap between rich and poor has reached gilded age extremes the recovery that followed the 2008 economic collapse has not been shared indeed in the united states it seems that nothing is shared these days not prosperity nor security nor even responsibility while millions of americans grapple with the consequences of catastrophic climate change fossil fuel companies promote climate skepticsso that they can continue to profit from the planet s destruction while americans have tired of endless war the military industrial complex and its cheerleaders continue to champion the reckless interventions that have drained our country damaged our reputation abroad and created a perfect storm of pentagon waste fraud and abuse while americans of every ideological stripe recognize the need for criminal justice reform african american men women and children continue to be gunned down by police officers on the streets and mass incarceration continues largely unabated americans are fed up and fighting back seen in isolation the fight for 15 black lives matter the climate justice movement the immigrant rights movement the campaign for a financial transactions tax and the renewed push for single payer healthcare may seem like unrelated causes taken together they form a rising chorus of outrage over a government that caters to the demands of the super wealthy while failing to meet the needs of the many they share a fury at a politics captured by special interests and big money where pervasive corruption mocks the very notion of democracy senator sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country in bernie sanders these movements for greater equality and justice have found an ally and a champion in contrast to the right wing demagogues who exploit these crises to foment division the vermont senator has reached into a proud democratic socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity we must turn to each other not on each other sanders says and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all his campaign s funding reflects this commitment spurning the support of corporate super pacs and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors thanks to his campaign s integrity sanders alone has the potential to unite the movements emerging across the country into one loud irresistible demand for systemic political change for over three decades bernie sanders has defied the political odds while consistently championing ideas and issues long off our country s increasingly downsized political map as mayor of burlington he led the fight to keep the lake champlain waterfront open to the people and organized the sustainable redevelopment of the city s downtown area submitting balanced budgets all the while in the us house of representatives he helped organize the congressional progressive caucus and secured support for amendments to protect pensions and expand community health centers in the us senate he eloquently opposed surveillance abuses wars of choice the deregulation of banks and bailouts for billionaires and his effective chairmanship of the senate committee on veterans affairs has earned bipartisan accolades while we believe that sanders would make a great president we know his road to the white house remains steep at press time he is contesting for wins in iowa and new hampshire and gaining ground on front runner hillary clinton in national polls his economic populist message has resonated with many progressives and young voters but he has yet to marshal deep support among the african american latino and asian american voters who form core constituencies of the democratic party that said his campaign is attentive to the need to build a broader coalition and in sanders democrats have a candidate who can truly walk the walk a civil rights marcher in the 1960s with a consistent record of supporting racial justice women s equality and lgbt rights and they also have a candidate who has shown a willingness to listen and learn challenged early in the campaign by black lives matter activists sanders has since outlined a bold agenda for holding police to account reducing mass incarceration and reforming discriminatory drug laws voters can trust sanders because he doesn t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo voters can trust sanders because he doesn t owe his political career to the financial overlords of the status quo freed from these chains of special interest he can take the bold measures that the country needs sanders alone proposes to break up the too big to fail banks to invest in public education from universal pre k to tuition free public college to break the power of the insurance and pharmaceutical cartels with medicare for all reforms he alone proposes to empower workers with a living wage he alone stands ready to put americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and to confront climate change by making the united states a leader in renewable energy his audacious agenda proves that money in politics doesn t widen debate rather it narrows the

policy but what he has said and done inspires confidence an opponent of the iraq war from the start he criticizesthe notion of regime change and the presumption that america alone must police the world he rejects a new cold war with russia he supports the nuclear weapons agreement with iran and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation he has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with cuba and for reviving a good neighbor policy in the hemisphere sanders s foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home he would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession and he would champion a green new deal to combat climate

into a proud democratic socialist tradition to revive the simple but potent notion of solidarity we must turn to each other not on each other sanders says and unite to change the corrupted politics that robs us all his campaign s funding reflects this commitment spurning the support of corporate super pacs and relying instead on millions of grassroots donors thanks to his campaign s integrity
