federal laws already allow people across the country the option to register to vote at the dmv but oregon and california s laws are pioneering because they do it automatically it s hard to overstate how novel this concept is for the us throughout much of united states history governments frequently put up barriers aimed at preventing people from voting such as property ownership requirements poll taxes or literacy tests gradually many of these barriers have fallen to make it easier for people to register however many states including california still close off registration weeks to a month before an election an artificial obstacle that can prevent perfectly qualified people from voting if they simply miss a deadline these new proposals remove those obstacles oregon s law will register all adult citizens in the dmv s database while california s law will be implemented more gradually as people get or renew their licenses or state ids or change their addresses but both make it the government s responsibility to ensure that all eligible voters are registered so it s a big deal that governments are now trying to make it easier and easier to vote rather than more difficult matt yglesias has argued for going even further and enshrining an affirmative right to vote in our constitution read his case here in both california and oregon republicans opposed these proposals but generally didn t argue against the principle of easing registration instead the criticisms have fallen along two main lines first critics have argued that since voter registration data is more publicly accessible than dmv information automatically adding voters to the rolls could pose privacy concerns however supporters respond that people can always opt out second some republicans have cited concerns about voter fraud usually about potential registration of unauthorized immigrants but while california began issuing driver s licenses to unauthorized immigrants this year these licenses are distinctively marked and people with them would not be registered to vote automatically and oregon requires proof of citizenship for all driver s license applicants meanwhile national democrats are increasingly adopting mandatory voter registration as a major cause in a speech on voting rights this june hillary clinton called on all states to automatically register citizens to vote when they turn 18 unless they choose to opt out and legislators in 15 other states have introduced bills similar to oregon s new law the brennan center is tracking them here get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week
