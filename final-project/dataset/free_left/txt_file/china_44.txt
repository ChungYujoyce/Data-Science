advertisement supported by by mark landler cleveland president trump kept china in his sights on saturday using a visit to the industrial midwest to promote his hard line trade tactics while the white house rebuked the chinese government for demanding that foreign airlines change how they refer to taiwan we re going to have to rework trade with china he said to an enthusiastic crowd of about 600 in a theater here it can t go on like that mr trump noted that a high level trade delegation had just returned from meetings in beijing and that the administration would consider the next steps in what has become an increasingly bitter confrontation over steel tariffs and china s theft of american intellectual property just before he spoke the white house issued a statement sharply criticizing the chinese government for requiring united airlines american airlines and other foreign carriers to refer to taiwan hong kong and macau as part of china on their websites and in other materials this is orwellian nonsense and part of a growing trend by the chinese communist party to impose its political views on american citizens and private companies said a pointedly written statement attributed to the white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders president donald j trump ran against political correctness in the united states the statement said he will stand up for americans resisting efforts by the chinese communist party to impose chinese political correctness on american companies and citizens mr trump used somewhat milder language during his three hour visit to cleveland gathering a round table of steelworkers and small business people ostensibly to promote the effects of the republican tax cut he ended up celebrating seemingly every other aspect of his presidency including his poll numbers which he claimed were on the rise they actually say that i m popular can you believe that he said though he went on to complain i get nothing but bad publicity if there was a recurring theme however it was mr trump s insistence that he would restore the balance with major trading partners like china he listened as an ohio couple the thorntons recounted the hardship they suffered after the steel mill near youngstown that employed kevin thornton shut down because his wife sharlene said of competition from china we almost lost our home she said we struggled every day to

repeated his praise for china s president xi jinping mr trump said the united states would no longer tolerate running huge deficits with beijing we re going to be smart about our relationships with other countries he said you look at our trade deficits with every other country don t let anyone ever tell you that trade deficits are o k despite his occasional wanderings into other subjects mr trump largely stuck to his script after a wild week in which he spoke off the cuff about issues like his legal troubles and his efforts to win the release of three americans being held in north korea mr trump had suggested their release would be imminent but on saturday white house officials had no updates on the status of the three kim hak song also known as jin xue song tony kim also known as kim sang duk and kim dong chul mr trump s trip was intended to bolster the senate campaign of his preferred candidate representative james b renacci who is challenging the populist democrat senator sherrod brown and has allied himself closely with the president democrats and mr trump himself are treating the midterm elections as a referendum on his presidency the president also attended a fund raiser with 250 high dollar donors netting 3 million according to the republican national committee the news media was barred from attending mr trump steered clear of reporters shedding no light on the miasma of questions about his knowledge of payments to a pornographic film actress stephanie clifford after a series of conflicting statements by rudolph w giuliani one of the newest members of the president s legal team the white house statement on china came in response to a letter that the chinese civil aviation administration sent last month to 36 foreign carriers instructing them to stop listing taiwan hong kong and macau as independent entities beijing regards taiwan as a renegade province of china while hong kong and macau are former british and portuguese colonies that returned to chinese sovereignty almost two decades ago the white house accused china of coercing american companies and citizens and said it was an extension of the repression it practices on the internet domestically american companies it said should have the freedom to decide how to communicate with their customers the sharp response comes at a time of deepening tension between the united states and china over trade and security the trade meeting in beijing produced no agreement even on whether the two sides should meet again the white house also warned china of consequences after reports that the chinese government had deployed antiaircraft and anti ship missiles to three artificial islands in the south china sea advertisement
