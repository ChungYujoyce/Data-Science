watch cbsn live by margaret brennan camilla schick may 7 2020 7 21 am cbs news tracking down covid 19 s patient zero and how that person first contracted the coronavirus may take years especially as u s china relations tumble to a new low on wednesday secretary of state mike pompeo said the details of patient zero are in the possession of only the chinese communist party beijing denies any such cover up that heightened tension is complicating rather than helping researchers efforts to collaborate with chinese scientists to find answers the ongoing travel restrictions due to covid 19 also make it impossible for americans to do on the ground research u s medical experts tell cbs news the virus may actually have been circulating among humans for some time before the late 2019 wuhan outbreak the origin of the covid 19 virus sars cov 2 could be determined by collecting blood samples from different parts of china that had been drawn and stored in the country prior to the winter of 2019 according to dr ian lipkin of columbia university s center for infection and immunity and then testing them for antibodies to see if the virus was present in another area before the devastating wuhan outbreak at a minimum that would help to determine the evolution of the naturally occurring virus which was able to jump species from animal to human and then adapt itself as national institutes of health s nih dr anthony fauci put it to a high degree of efficiency in human transmissibility in an interviewwith the economic club of washington dc fauci said that this characteristic of the covid 19 coronavirus sets it apart from the other coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers i want to find out where it came from and find drugs to defeat it dr lipkin told cbs news in a phone interview lipkin hopes to be able to collaborate with chinese researchers to access local blood banks to determine if the virus was present anywhere from one to ten years ago he had conducted similar research with the virus that caused mers but conducting such research takes time and access if you start looking at haystacks how quickly do you find the needle lipkin said it is not easy to do this given that i cannot go back to china right now that is why lipkin argues anyone who wants to find answers to these questions would need to work in cooperation with chinese researchers and perhaps even china s ministry of health at present none of those options seem to be available china recently blocked the world health organization w h o from participating in its investigation of the virus the w h o representative in chinatold sky news last weekthat there was no good reason for its repeated requests to join the government investigation to have been declined secretary pompeo told reporters on wednesday that beijing continues to refuse to allow any access it s not even that in the moment they couldn t do the right thing they continue to be opaque and they continue to deny access for this important information that our researchers our epidemiologists need pompeo said university based researchers like dr lipkin are hopeful that they may be a preferable alternative to a politically charged entity as the w h o is at present however that still requires beijing to be open to such collaboration on their part of its own scientists a number of u s labs with past and present ties to the wuhan institute of virologyhave also fallen under us government scrutiny with federal moneypulled from at least one last month the nihcut all future funding to new york based non profit ecohealth alliance a week after a reporter had pointed out to president trump at a coronavirus task forcebriefing april 17that the wuhan lab had previously received u s funding via this project the non profit s director disease ecologist peter daszak had been studying bat to human transmission of coronaviruses in partnership for years with chinese virologist dr shi zhengli whose extensive work studying bat coronaviruses at the wuhan institute of virology remains in the spotlight for the theory that the virus escaped from a chinese lab daszak declined an interview with cbs news the actions that our government has taken including terminating peter daszak s grant means that we are not going to be part of any investigation we re out of it it s the most counterproductive thing that could have possibly been done dr gerald keusch of boston university s national emerging infectious diseases laboratories told cbs news it all comes down to people trusting one another sharing information when those relationships exist information gets transferred despite those complications dr lipkin argues that his approach of obtaining blood samples from blood banks would be a more effective way of answering the question of covid 19 s origins than demanding the chinese government hand over samples of the virus itself secretary pompeo s frequent public demands for international and particularly american investigators are politically embarrassing for beijing and have gone nowhere secretary pompeo has repeatedly said the u s needs access on the ground and that he is particularly interested in the wuhan institute of virology among other labs the new york times reported this weekthat agencies may have intercepted communications among chinese officials raising questions with each other concerning the wuhan lab however no u s official has publicly confirmed the existence of such conversations chinese officials could have been discussing such a possibility because of past experience with a lab accidentin 2004 that infected lab workers dr lipkin who advised on the 2011 hollywood movie contagion co authored areportin the scientific journal nature last month which laid out the case that covid 19 had natural origins ruling out the theory that the virus could be a man made bio weapon when asked by cbs news about the possibility of a lab accident causing the naturally occurring virus to spill into the population lipkin said is it possible that something like that can happen yes but what is the evidence that it did dr fauci toldnational geographic magazine this weekthat the question of whether the naturally occurring virus accidentally escaped from the wuhan lab only buttressed the argument that it existed prior to any theoretical lab accident the only two certainties at this point are that the outbreak began in china and that u s intelligence has concluded that it was not man made or genetically modified in anrare public statement last thursday the office of the director of national intelligence odni said it will rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in wuhan secretary pompeo has said both that there is enormous evidence that the outbreak originated from the lab and that there is no certainty of the virus origins no evidence has been publicly presented to substantiate any of the possible explanations including a theory posed by the w h o which has tied the first infections to the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan which species of bat first carried sars cov 2 is also unclear they talk about a certain kind of bat but that bat wasn t in that area mr trump told reporters in april referring to the wet market in wuhan that bat wasn t sold at that wet zone it wasn t sold there that bat is 40 miles away so a lot of strange things are happening but there is a lot of investigation going on and we re going to find out dr lipkin said that the coronavirus almost certainly originated in horseshoe bats far from the disease outbreak in hubei province he explained that there could also be multiple potential explanations as to how the virus spread particularly since it is believed to have had another animal host that facilitated its transfer to humans a civet cat for instance was floated by dr fauci as the animal that helped transfer the bat borne virus to a human another early theory involved a pangolin a scaly endangered creature native to asia that has been heavily trafficked on the black market scientists also believe there are many mostly unknown bat borne viruses i characterize the bat as the mosquito of the 21st century dr keusch said to cbs news it has been responsible for major epidemics in this case a truly global pandemic the wuhan institute s dr shi had in fact alreadydiscovered back in 2013 while hunting for the virus that had caused the 2003 sars epidemic the closest known virusto sars cov 2 in a horseshoe bat in yunnan southern china over a thousand miles away from wuhan the similar viral strain known as ratg13 shares 96 of its genome with sars cov 2 but that 4 difference means the two are not closely related as it amounts to a lot of genetic difference with regard to ancestry and evolution shi s team published their knowledge of having a similar virus to sars cov 2 innature in februarythis year and shi herself told scientific american magazine in march that she had searched through her samples of viruses collected over the past few years and was relieved to confirm the 2019 coronavirus was not in her collection dr chris beyrer an epidemiologist at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health told cbs news that the speed at which the 2019 coronavirus has spread likely indicates that it had time to circulate within the human population and adapt to become very good at human to human transmission before the first outbreak in wuhan raising even more questions over when let alone where and how the virus first jumped to humans from the period of the first chains of human to human transmission it s been very fast how long it took to adapt to human populations and under what circumstances that happened is harder to say it s probably a matter of months not weeks because it s such a transmissible virus beyrer said the other bat virus which continues to emerge in human populations is of course ebola beyrer also highlighted ebola periodically erupts and sometimes the outbreaks are very self contained viruses if their conditions for spread are met will start to spread could it be that there was a bat to human transmission somewhere else and it just turned out that the density of this industrial city of wuhan is where the eruption first appeared that is theoretically possible beyrer said but he argues human destruction of natural habitats and wild animals being brought from as far as beyond china s borders to chinese urban wet markets more likely helped the coronavirus find its way into humans i ve spent time in chinese industrial cities doing hiv work and i ve got to tell you there s no wildlife left there china is completely deforested and degraded environmentally these animals are coming from southeast asia and from their border regions this is about wildlife trafficking this list of unknowns suggests this scientific mystery could potentially keep epidemiologists and u s intelligence agents busy for years like the u s and australia the uk and germany also want to know where and how the virus originated as well as who is responsible for failing to halt its spread sooner but both european allies appear less pressing that this mystery be solved in the midst of a pandemic china has not welcomed any of those proposals the issue may well come to a head next week at the upcoming world health assembly in geneva as for china dr lipkin argues it is in beijing s interest to allow researchers to nail down the virus origins there is no downside to them if they prove that this thing originated in a cross species event
