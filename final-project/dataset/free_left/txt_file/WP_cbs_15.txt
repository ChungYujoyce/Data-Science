challenges and exasperation with the state the interview has been edited for length and clarity the deblasios first shared their story by texting norah o donnell we would like to hear from you too text 212 217 1107 cbs evening news tell us about the circumstances in which you find yourself you made a decision to stop working and seek unemployment richard deblasio in mid march i was still driving full time for uber as covid 19 was starting to become a reality it became a concern to me because i have some pre existing conditions i m a type 2 diabetic when i contacted my doctor he advised me that i should consider stopping uber and move forward from there it was around the time when our governor put a mandatory stay at home order in place uber partners the term the ride share company uses for its drivers were still able to work but it wasn t advisable if you had any preexisting conditions a week later they announced unemployment was going to be available for gig workers and independent contractors like myself the president signed the cares act on march 27 and i was lucky enough to get through and apply for unemployment that day it sat in pending status for five and a half weeks before i received a denial i must have spent six to eight hours days in a row trying to get anyone on the phone it was just the same repetitious we re unavailable we can t take any calls that s when the nightmare really started to begin cbs evening news what are the next steps after state unemployment deems you ineligible richard deblasio well we were told that if you applied for any type of unemployment benefits in the state of florida before april 4 you now have to reapply because the system is so old and backed up so you have to start that process all over again jessica deblasio it s our understanding that you need to get a denial from the state in order to get a link to the federal pandemic unemployment assistance or pua application and then you apply for that and wait for approval on that by the time this all comes to fruition we re just afraid that the eligibility of benefits is going to be over cbs evening news did florida unemployment relay clear directives for gig workers or independent contractors or designate a specific program this seems really hazy to follow richard deblasio no we ve done a lot of googling for information initially when you d call the 800 number at the end of march you d get a recorded message nobody is available to take your call or you d get a message that the line was too large and we re not accepting any calls at this point i had an alternate number that i found that linked me to florida unemployment and the person that answered after several days of trying said how did you get this phone number and i said google it just came up the next day that number was gone and of course that person gave me no information cbs evening news so all of these calls have been simply to determine eligibility for both your first and second applications richard deblasio yes and it continues to be very frustrating for the first application it was very hard getting an answer of you re ineligible well how come i was ineligible i fell in line just like workers out there who are in the same business i spent nine and a half hours one day calling and calling and calling florida governor ron desantis had advised that there was a new number set up for information to provide an additional form of contact because the system is so overwhelmed when you call that number it gives you the same recording that the original unemployment number gives you we re sorry we re not taking any calls i spent hours on the phone for five or six days in a row and then just got so frustrated that i gave up waited a day and went back and tried again i continue to try every day cbs evening news how much were you earning weekly when driving for uber what has the revenue loss been like for the household richard deblasio it was between 500 800 a week working in central florida the amusement park area prior to all this jessica deblasio it s a pretty large loss richard deblasio especially if you multiply that times 52 it becomes a significant amount cbs evening news gig workers comprise 22 of the florida workforce the highest proportion in the country according to a february study by adp research institute do you feel left behind richard deblasio i pay my taxes just like everybody else does you know what makes independent contractors and gig workers different from anybody else so when i hear w 2 employees are starting to receive benefits we re asking for the same for the state unemployment system to process our applications so we can be forwarded to the federal system and get the assistance that was created for us we re trying to survive this just like everybody else our state is ranked 50th out of 50 states for the worst unemployment system an associated press analysis of federal data found florida ranked at or near the bottom of all states in its speed of processing unemployment claims it s very hard to hear when you re in that number it makes you feel hopeless jessica deblasio i ve gotten to the point where i ve been reaching out to law firms trying to find somebody to help there s a particular firm in tallahassee that s handling a class action against the state right now they have about 4 000 cases you can t even get through to them i ve been trying for two weeks now and it s just busy signal after busy signal there s just no hope cbs evening news have you received any support from uber corporate richard deblasio that s a sore subject listen i love uber but i don t believe in all of their practices i don t think they take care of their partners as they should we re the face of the company the ones on the frontlines and i think they ve done exactly what the state of florida has done with the unemployment system for independent contractors they dropped the ball jessica deblasio he reached out to uber at the very beginning and asked is there any way you could assist your drivers with resources resources to stay healthy resources to keep your car clean they said absolutely not they didn t have the ability to do that cbs evening news jessica you re working full time from home as a paralegal what has it been like attempting to navigate this process with richard while also managing your own professional responsibilities jessica deblasio it s exhausting it s like two full time jobs in one he s on the phone in one room i m on the phone in the other room i check his status and then he checks his status 90 of the time when you even try to log on to check status it throws you off we don t know when the economy s going to be back we don t know when richard will be back to work it s the unknown and carrying a full time job and taking care of a family and taking on stress of the finances it s a lot to bear one of my bigger concerns is we can t even ask for governmental help it s a double edged sword thank god i have a paycheck which covers the basics but in the same respect it hurts me i can t apply for medicaid i can t apply for food stamps i can t apply for any help because i have a paycheck that s a certain amount of money it s that middle class situation where you re damned if you do and damned if you don t i mean we re stuck we re stuck cbs evening news health risks aside what would happen if you attempted to resume work richard richard deblasio i mean the work s not there i can turn my app on and i ve done it just to test it out and i can drive around hours in my city and if it goes off one time that s a lot i never knew how busy the uber system was until i moved to central florida from 6 a m to 2 a m it was nonstop now jessica deblasio it has crashed and burned cbs evening news what is weighing most heavily on you jessica deblasio the biggest weight bearing right now is what s going to happen on june 15 if unemployment doesn t come through what if the extra money is gone what are we going to have to sacrifice next to put food on the table cbs evening news what have you been doing to conserve resources jessica deblasio we got part of our stimulus we didn t get the full thing i ve literally piecemealed it okay we can take 200 for this week and this is what we have and i ve done it week by week just stretching things as far as we possibly can we re cooking every night and being frugal at the grocery store but we also have a 15 year old who eats like two full grown men so he s very expensive to feed richard deblasio you re trying not to overbuy but at the same time grocery stores are running out of essential items jessica deblasio i reached out to my auto loan carrier to ask for a two month deferment but once that two months is up then what it s been extremely challenging it s like you go to bed in one world and you wake up in a completely different one it s like the twilight zone we ve been together since middle school almost 30 years and i think this is the most challenging time we ve been through in 30 years cbs evening news how is your son doing is he aware of the financial strain jessica deblasio he s a nervous wreck richard deblasio he s 15 it s not like he s 5 and you can hide it he asked me yesterday are we bankrupt yet and i was like why would you say that he goes that s what all these big companies are doing and you re not working and you work for a big company cbs evening news where do you see yourselves june 1 what would you need in order to continue paying some of your bills richard deblasio if i start thinking about the next month it scares me jessica deblasio if there s no change and nothing comes in for us i really don t know i guess we d have to reach out and ask family to help at some point cbs evening news what s your message for florida s leaders jessica deblasio the band aid needs to be ripped off there needs to be a realization that this is a problem for a lot of families who are going to be in detrimental situations the next month or two if it s not fixed it shouldn t take 12 weeks for someone to start receiving any type of benefit from the state for unemployment when it s not the person s choice to be out of work we need help we desperately need help and it needs to be prioritized i mean enough is enough video edited by josh carney watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our
