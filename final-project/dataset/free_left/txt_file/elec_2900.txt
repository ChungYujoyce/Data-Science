 analysis interpretation of the news based on evidence including data as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events with breannedeppisch and joanie greve the big idea roy moore s victory in alabama and bob corker s retirement in tennessee on tuesday sent shock waves across the capitol and shivers down the spines of institutionalists in both parties the dual developments are fueling concerns about the long term health of the world s greatest deliberative body and heightening fears that the center may not hold in american politics president trump s chosen candidate lost by 9 points in a gop runoff luther strange who was appointed to replace jeff sessions when he became attorney general is the first incumbent to lose a primary in five years moore who brandished a revolver during a rally on the eve of the runoff has promised that he will never compromise he has twice been suspended as the chief justice of the alabama supreme court in 2003 moore disobeyed a federal judge s order to remove a statue of the ten commandments from the state judicial building then last year after getting elected back to the court he was removed again after urging state judges to defy the u s supreme court decision that legalized same sex marriage moore believes in the supremacy of the bible over the constitution and he compares homosexuality to bestiality karl rove has been calling him this year s todd akin corker the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee announced he won t seek a third term in 2018 after it became abundantly clear that he would face a well funded primary challenge from his right this is part of a bigger trend there are fewer dealmakers interested in the finer points of governing john mccain a giant of the senate is battling brain cancer and said this week that his prognosis is not good strange s loss may prompt additional retirements and will undoubtedly embolden potential primary challengers next year arizona sen jeff flake has already been in trouble now nevada sen dean heller and mississippi sen roger wicker who was chairman of the national republican senatorial committee last cycle both have fresh cause for concern a handful of the senate s most moderate democrats might also lose next year even though trump is unpopular nationally republicans might pick up seats in the 2018 midterms because of the nature of the map several democratic incumbents are up for reelection in ruby red states from west virginia s joe manchin to indiana s joe donnelly north dakota s heidi heitkamp and missouri s claire mccaskill if they lose they d almost certainly be replaced by much more ideologically rigid lawmakers who have less incentive to reach across the aisle a similar dynamic is at play in the house where several moderate republicans have recently announced their retirements rep charlie dent r pa lamented how hard it is to be a member of the governing wing of the republican party when he called it quits three weeks ago i ve fought to fulfill the basic functions of government like keeping the lights on and preventing default he explained regrettably that has not been easy given the disruptive outside influences that profit from increased polarization and ideological rigidity that leads to dysfunction disorder and chaos mitch mcconnell was yesterday s biggest loser his last ditch effort to repeal obamacare before the end of the month failed corker has been one of his most reliable allies and outside groups tied to the kentucky senator just spent about 10 million trying to beat moore the judge is openly antagonistic of mcconnell s leadership and assuming he wins the general election will undoubtedly become a pain in his caucus for the first time since 2006 republicans have full control of the federal government both chambers of congress the white house and the supreme court but gop leaders have mostly been unable to capitalize on this immense power for seven years republican politicians promised to repeal and replace obamacare yesterday once again they failed to follow through the conservative grass roots are understandably angry they are so angry that 10 million from mcconnell aligned outside groups and rescue missions from both trump and vice president pence couldn t pull strange across the finish line he ran a spirited campaign centered around a dissatisfaction with the progress made in washington mcconnell said in a statement congratulating moore last night i share that frustration this has happened before angry that the senate is dysfunctional voters elect new members who prefer to pour more sand into the gears than fix them unburdened by a sense of responsibility or institutional tradition moore will have an opportunity to use the considerable powers that individual senators possess to mangle the process of government writes stephen stromberg a post editorial writer when votes will be needed to keep the government open pass a budget or respond to a natural disaster moore is likely to join bomb throwers such as sen ted cruz r tex in threatening counterproductive disruption if the country refuses to bend to his views once in the senate moore is likely to remain there for many years posing a unique challenge to whoever may run the chamber democrat or republican in the future strange tried to make that argument in the closing days of the campaign but to no avail he warned that the race had become all about mitch mcconnell and the national agenda power between competing groups i actually had a conservative leader say luther this has nothing to do with you this is all about mitch mcconnell strange said saturday on fox news which is what my grandmother used to say was a classic example of cutting off your nose to spite your face my opponent would be an obstructionist and not advance the president s agenda luther strange concedes in homewood ala butch dill ap in some ways this is a redux of 2010 republican dealmakers have been on the defensive since the tea party movement emerged mcconnell masterminded the strategy of total obstruction from the start of barack obama s presidency now he s the victim of the party of no mentality that he forced his conference to embrace the well is poisoned democrats of course do not have clean noses harry reid s legacy will forever be tainted by his myopic decision to go nuclear on lower court judges in 2013 that gave mcconnell a pretext to change the rules this spring to allow neil gorsuch to be confirmed to the supreme court with a simple majority now blue slips one of the most cherished prerogatives of senators in the minority are in grave danger gorsuch has demonstrated with his early decisions that he is likely to be the most conservative justice on the high court the next democratic president will almost certainly nominate someone who is as far to the left as gorsuch is to the right the judiciary will continue to become more politicized and the country will continue its descent into tribalism the senate has lost much of its luster over the past several years as it became an increasingly majoritarian body trump who is not steeped in constitutional jurisprudence and does not seem to know the difference between articles and amendments has pushed hard to blow up the senate by changing the rules to pass legislation with a simple majority james madison the brains behind the constitution intended the senate to be anchor of the federal government madison explained to thomas jefferson who was abroad during the constitutional convention that he designed the senate to be a necessary fence against the fickleness and passion of the american people and their more uncouth representatives in the house george washington believed the senate s purpose was to cool house legislation like a saucer cools hot tea remember we didn t even start directly electing senators until 1913 all this dysfunction plays into trump s hands the president feels burned by republican congressional leaders who he feels made a strategic error by convincing him to focus on repealing obamacare before overhauling the tax code he is frustrated that he waded into alabama s senate race and got behind a losing horse at mcconnell s request sen bob corker r tenn speaks with reporters yesterday after announcing his retirement aaron p bernstein reuters this explains why so many senators in both parties mourned corker s departure as very bad news for the body minority leader chuck schumer d n y called corker a friend and a fine conscientious and hard working senator his thoughtfulness and dedication to the job make him a model senator schumer said we all regret him leaving sen mark warner d va partnered with corker to craft some of the financial rules that were included in the 2010 dodd frank bill and the two have spent the past few years pushing for an overhaul of the housing finance system in the face of heavy industry lobbying no matter the challenge you can always count on senator corker to bring a reasoned thoughtful approach and to make decisions based not on partisanship but on what he believes is in the best interests of the american people the democrat said i hope this is a wake up call to all of us in the senate that we need to recommit ourselves to creating an environment where reasonable thoughtful people of both parties can come together to solve problems tennessee s senior senator lamar alexander is a practitioner of consensus politics like corker in the tradition of the great howard baker he praised corker last night for trying to tackle intractable problems like the federal debt when there wasn t a political upside he says what he thinks does what he believes is best for tennesseans and has helped lead his colleagues on complicated issues the republican said his absence will leave a big hole in the united states senate corker s departure will be felt perhaps most acutely in the area of foreign relations paul kane and karoun demirjian explain he established his chops early in his senate career when lawmakers ratified the new start treaty a strategic arms control pact that regulates the size of the u s and russian nuclear stockpiles corker was one of the key gop players who negotiated changes that made it possible to bring more conservative votes on board corker also tackled nuclear security joining with ranking democrat benjamin l cardin md to design a bill that gave congress an opportunity to weigh in on a multilateral deal to rein in iran s nuclear ambitions before it could go into effect more recently corker has been the chief go between for the white house and congress when it comes to whether the president will certify iran s compliance with the deal next month sen bob corker r tenn presides over a hearing in may andrew harrer bloomberg news the tensions between congressional republicans and the white house were also certainly a factor in corker s thinking trump considered him for vice president last summer and secretary of state last fall but the tennessean has grown increasingly frustrated with the president s inability to lead he snapped after trump responded to the violence in charlottesville with false moral equivalency the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful corker told reporters last month trump who carried tennessee by 26 points last november fired back strange statement by bob corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in 18 tennessee not happy the two men met in the oval office the friday before last and corker urged trump to travel to alabama to campaign for strange you ve got to go he told trump we need you there to the winner goes the spoils politics in a constitutional republic is not supposed to be a zero sum game but that s increasingly becoming the mentality in the senate political fights from health care to climate change in the trump era increasingly look like the election itself a raw battle for resources and advantage between red and blue states john wagner explained in a smart piece over the weekend since gaining control of washington president trump and republicans in congress have pushed an array of policies that tend to punish states that voted democratic in last year s presidential election the authors of the cassidy graham health care bill used the fact that blue states would lose federal funding compared to red states as a selling point to woo conservative senators blue states would also take a disproportionate hit under a prominent provision in trump s tax plan john notes the vast majority of sanctuary cities threatened with loss of federal funding are in democratic leaning states as are the majority of young undocumented immigrants who could lose protection from deportation the administration has signaled its intent to significantly scale back mass transit funding traditionally favored by more liberal and urban states and all but one of the handful of states where marijuana has been legalized for recreational use are blue they are now watching nervously to see whether trump s justice department reverses course and launches a crackdown on those states and the district of columbia since taking office trump has held campaign style rallies exclusively in states he won last year and most of the events he has staged as part of his official travel have been in red states what we re witnessing is war between the red and the blue said thomas mann a senior fellow at the brookings institution this is hardball and it s distinctive from what we ve seen before evelyn ridgeway right roy moore s mother cries after

turned to his family and said they would have to get used to living with george wallace now mr shelby said they may have to get used to living with mr moore in the senate where he could be just as divisive luther who trump tweets backing the losing candidate in alabama get deep sixed by philip bump trump had pledged to endorse moore should he win and the president did so quickly trump also deleted a number of tweets that he d sent endorsing strange in the first place regrets in alabama senate race trump had a few by politico s josh dawsey trump told conservative activists who visited the white house on monday that he d underestimated the political power of roy moore attendees said the president asked questions that suggested he harbored doubts about his endorsement neither money

strange didn t seem to have any positive impact even in a state that loves trump trumpism rolls over trump in alabama senate race by abc news political director rick klein fundamentally though moore

into the 2018 midterm elections paul kane reports on tuesday before the election results were official most senate republicans remained staunchly behind mcconnell who next june is slated to become the longest serving gop leader in senate history he has won eight straight leadership elections by acclamation with no challenger and none appears on the horizon in the near term his colleagues say mcconnell is willing to absorb the criticism that conservative activists fire at him particularly if it keeps the friendly fire away from rank and file republicans but one thing that could hamper mcconnell s long term standing would be if he became a real albatross to his own incumbents in primary elections ahead two years ago this week john a boehner r ohio announced his resignation as house speaker because even close supporters feared voting for him because conservative activists had grown to despise boehner some knives are coming out for the leader republican consultant jordan gehrke argues in a new medium post that mcconnell is now a dead weight around the necks of gop senators who have to face an angry gop base in 2018 his firm worked for rep roy moore r ala in the first round of the primary and mcconnell s super pac spent about 4 million to beat him he then helped a pac that was helping moore during the runoff the brooks campaign began attacking mcconnell after an internal poll of alabama republicans found that it was a potent line of attack asked about mcconnell s endorsement 11 percent said it made them more likely to vote for strange 56 percent said it made them less likely to support him and 32 percent said it made no difference the best thing going for mcconnell is that there s no obvious replacement for him while you were sleeping acting dea administrator chuck

roughly when being put into police vehicles we have an obligation to speak out when something is wrong he wrote in the email according to two officials rod rosenstein had previously asked rosenberg if he would be interested in serving as the presidentially appointed head of the dea and rosenberg declined because rosenberg was considered a career justice department employee one of the officials said

arrange talks between north korean officials and gop linked u s experts in a neutral location like switzerland both declined their requests trump seemed to somewhat cool his harsh rhetoric against pyongyangyesterday writesanne gearan although the president repeated a threat of military action his language was mild by comparison to his branding of north korean leader kim jong un as a madman and his vow last week to totally destroy north korea if necessary to protect the united states or its allies trump also expressed confidence he could solve a decades long impasse that has bedeviled his predecessors north korea is a situation that should have been handled 25 years ago 20 years ago 15 years ago 10 years ago and five years ago and it could have been handled much more easily trump said

investigators are reaching back 11 years after several months of being at odds one source said the irs criminal investigation division is now sharing information about campaign associates the sharing happened after the two camps reached an agreement following consultation with officials at the treasury department the irs criminal investigation agents had been working with the fbi to investigate manafort since before the election in a similar probe that centered on possible money laundering and tax fraud issues it s unclear if flynn is now or was previously under investigation by the irs though mueller s team is examining flynn s payments from turkey and russia a former high level justice department official says the information shared would include anything tax return related such as real estate and banking records the former official added the irs is very restricted in what information it can share under title 26 us code and would normally need a specific grand jury subpoena in order to share tax returns with another agency the senate judiciary committee has agreed to subpoena documents from paul manafort as part of its ongoing russia probe according to the panel s top democrat karoun demirjian reports sen dianne feinstein told reporters tuesday the committee had decided to subpoena documents but a spokesman would not detail what documents the committee is seeking the senator added the panel will certainly use the subpoena power if necessary to get manafort to testify as well committee chairman chuck grassley also refused to disclose details noting while in principle a lot of things have been agreed to certain matters still have to be worked out and we ll wait until details are worked out till we make a final announcement roger stone told reportersthat manafort had informed him through their attorneys that he is expecting to be indicted by federal prosecutors neither stone nor manafort knows on what charge manafort might be indicted stone said the special counsel will try to manufacture a crime and then say look manafort we won t prosecute this if you say you were colluding with the russians stone said manafort is not going to lie and that would be a lie earlier tuesday stone testified for nearly three hours before a closed session of the house intelligence committee the former trump adviser denied all allegations of collusion with russia but refused to answer questions about his contact with a wikileaks intermediary prompting democrats on the panel to threaten subpoenas karoun has the story stone said he mainly answered questions about his contacts with a hacker believed to be behind breaches of democratic email accounts but he declined to answer members questions about the identity of his intermediary with wikileaks

prankster the very big ocean trump rejected critics who say he hasn t paid enough attention to the humanitarian crisis in puerto rico following its pummeling by hurricane maria he cited the very big ocean as an obstacle to delivering the services island residents need from phillip bump it s very tough because it s an island trump said during a meeting with members of the house in texas we can ship the trucks right out there and you know we ve gotten a pluses on texas and on florida and we will also on puerto rico but the difference is this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean and

sandhya somashekhar report everybody has said it s amazing the job that we ve done in puerto rico trump said during a rose garden news conference we re very proud of it this was a place that was

law is the future of subsidies known as cost sharing reductions which provide discounts to roughly 7 million lower income customers president trump has repeatedly threatened to stop the payments to insurers to offset those discounts and both the cassidy graham bill and recent bipartisan senate negotiations would have guaranteed those payments for another year or two some gop lawmakers expect that consumers could experience major problems in the months ahead and predict that those would backfire on democrats and build momentum for the law s eventual repeal sens lamar alexander r tenn and

turning full attention to passing a republican tax plan and delaying any further health bill until next year senate majority whip john cornyn r tex said that any attempt to combine health care and taxes on the next budget risks tainting tax discussions with old divisions over health care the argument appeared to sway most senate republicans even as the idea gained support among members of the

running the department he compared his experience taking over interior to capturing a pirate ship where only the captain and the first mate row over to take over the vessel zinke explained that he wanted to ensure interior officials accelerated federal permitting for drilling and mining activities on federal land saying it s necessary to relocate some of the department s major divisions to push

soundproof booths are used to conduct hearing tests but the epa sought a customized version one that eventually would cost several times more than a typical model that pruitt can use to communicate

and speech on the american campus are under attack sari horwitz debbie truong and sarah larimer report underscoring his intention to bring action to his words sessions said the justice department is filing a statement of interest in a campus free speech lawsuit filed by students at georgia gwinnett college students at the public school are challenging a policy that limits students expressive activity to two small free speech zones requires students to obtain approval from campus officials and restricts their activity to a specific date and time justice officials said we will be filing more in the weeks and months to come sessions said but sessions also invoked free speech to defend the president s right to call for the firing of professional athletes who peacefully protest the national anthem well the president has free speech rights too sessions said he sends soldiers out every day to defend this country under the flag of the united states under the national anthem and the unity that those symbols call on us to adhere to so i agree that it s a big mistake to protest in that fashion because it weakens the commitment we have to this nation that has provided us this

excluding the wider student body third year law student ambur smith said into the bullhorn some wore duct tape over their mouths and held signs that proclaimed deport hate free speech is not hate speech and sessions is afraid of questions sports illustrated tackles the relationship between sports and politics in its latest cover with the headline a nation divided sports united charles p pierce writes the inclusion of a national anthem any national anthem in a sporting event necessarily politicizes that event the protests of today are not about the anthem or the flag or the troops or even about donald trump the protesters are high profile african american athletes raising awareness of how lower profile african americans are often mistreated by police officers in short if you re going to perform national anthems you re going to have politics and if you have politics you re going to have political statements and this being the united states of america those statements are not always
