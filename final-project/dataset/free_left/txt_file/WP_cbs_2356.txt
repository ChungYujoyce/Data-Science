workers like her are in legal limbo as they anxiously await a decision by thesupreme courton the program known as daca or deferred action for childhood arrivals if the court sides with the trump administration they could be deported espinoza de pi a is a 26 year old registered nurse who has been working on the neuro floor of ssm health in the st louis missouri area for three years she mainly works with stroke and seizure patients but since the coronavirus outbreak began she has been rotating on the isolation floor tending to covid 19 patients i ve been exposed luckily i m fine because it was a couple days ago i haven t been feeling any symptoms or anything but it s just scary she said her health isn t her only worry the supreme court is expected to decide sometime in the next few weeks by june at the latest whether to end thedaca program created by the obama administration in 2012 which allows undocumented dreamers like her to study and work without the constant fear of having immigration officers turning up at their doors the trump administration is set on ending the program and could begin deporting daca recipients if the court clears the way i m exposing my life every day and exposing myself i m exposing my family people around me you know and it s like they don t see that they don t value that espinoza de pi a told cbs news in regards to the administration wanting to end the program on monday the supreme court granted a motion to allow asupplemental briefafter oral argument filed by daca recipient plaintiffs who argue that terminating daca during a national emergency would be catastrophic since daca recipients make up a large number of essential health care providers on the front lines battling covid 19 the motion urges the court to consider the significant adverse consequences of terminating daca for health care and other essential service providers and all those who rely on and benefit from the work of daca recipients jos mu oz the national communications manager at united we dream said the immigration network which was instrumental in pushing for daca in 2012 is concerned that if the supreme court were to side with the trump administration recipients would lose their work permits and ability to work he warned that would put a strain on so many of the systems that are really overwhelmed in the middle of this pandemic mu oz also noted that such a decision would have dire consequences for families who have been living in the u s for a large portion of their lives while some of the immediate consequences are obviously losing a work permit there is also the very real reality of the potential for deportation and another wave of family separation for daca recipients and their families he said francisco javier matias is 27 and works as medical assistant at two clinics in seattle evaluating patients for covid 19 both in person and via video he sees up to 14 patients a day with the risk of potentially infecting himself and his family i m helping people that are not daca recipients here in the united states through my job and there is definitely that fear if this daca gets to end and i m like so all of these years here have been for nothing or probably my time and my health and my family s health that i am putting at risk right now he said matias came to the united states when he was 11 years old with his parents and two other siblings from oaxaca mexico he fears that with the end of daca he and his parents and two out of his three siblings who were also born in mexico could be sent back to a country where he doesn t feel like he belongs seattle is my home i feel like being here it s like a safety net it s a safe place to be a part of i m also an lgbtq person so it kind of makes me feel safe he said espinoza de pi a says the possibility of daca ending is something she thinks about every day i have two kids they re both u s citizens here i would lose my family i would lose you know my license probably i wouldn t be able to take care of patients i would go to a country that i barely remember also a student trying to finish her bachelor s degree with aspirations of one day becoming a nurse practitioner espinoza de pi a wonders why daca recipients can t be offered a path to something more permanent we receive daca but you know we re also giving back a lot helping taking care of these patients being there with these patients because they re there by themselves they re in this scary virus that they don t know if they re going to come out of the hospital alive or dead first published
