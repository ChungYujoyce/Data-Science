mitchellreportthat some are calling on the former vice president to choose a woman of color as his running mate while others are specifically hoping a black woman will fill the position conversations with more than a dozen black women in congress and black women political leaders and activists in battleground states revealed this sentiment it s past time for women of color and particularly black women to be seriously considered for top positions like the role of vice president congresswoman marcia fudge of ohio said that at some point the democratic party must reward and recognize its loyal soldiers namely black women fudge also warned that if the party doesn t mobilize black women democrats can t win in november the mistake i believe we have made in the last couple of races we ve run is we neglect to bring out our base fudge said the base of the democratic party clearly is black and brown but more black than brown many leaders said that race shouldn t be the top or only factor in choosing the right running mate and all of the black women political leaders that cbs news spoke with said the eventual vice presidential pick must have a strong grasp on the problems facing the black community and particularly black women perryandmitchellreportedon cbsn that while prominent black women like former georgia state house leader stacey abrams and senator kamala harris of california were mentioned as viable prospects activists in battleground states like wisconsin believe that senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts is the candidate who can deliver on issues that are important to black women warren works with people and listens to people and will continue to push the work of making racial justice a priority advocating for black women s leadership across the country and lifting up especially in those down ballot races where there are so many powerful black women running in their communities said priscilla bort who is an organizer for the wisconsin working families

get their ballot in time due to post office delays in the letter larose stated that they are hearing reports that first class mail delivery which is 1 3 days is taking up to 7 9 days as you can
