constitutional provision that outlines procedures for the cabinet to remove a president from office if deemed incapacitated or unfit in a tweet the conservative writer david frum noted that the reported break in at the home owned by cummings occurred before trump s rat infested attack upon him but the gloating afterward remains dangerous incitement frum said trump renews attacks on
