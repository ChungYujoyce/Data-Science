republican karen handel spoke about social media and anger from the left in race that s drawn national attention as a referendum on the trump presidency ben jacobs in roswell georgia tue 20 jun 2017 12 54bst last modified on fri 14 jul 2017 17 58bst as voters go to the polls in a fiercely competitive special election in georgia involving record spending the republican candidate has blamed social media and journalism for fueling a lack of civility in american society speaking to the guardian before a lunchtime event in marietta on monday karen handel said a lack of civility in society was fueled by social media and the fact that journalism is not journalism anymore handel s election fight against the democratic candidate jon ossoff comes less than a week after the shooting of the republican congressman steve scalise and three others and following a series of smaller scale incidents of political violence in recent years both ossoff and handel have received threats envelopes containing white powder and threatening messages were mailed to handel s house and to her neighbors both candidates have had security in place in the final days of the campaign i don t think it is just in the world of politics handel told the guardian the lack of civility in society as a whole some of it i believe is very much fueled by social media and frankly it s fueled by the fact that journalism is not journalism any more there is a lack of civility in society as a whole social media has been fueling it journalism has been fueling it it s tabloid it s 24 7 news people get in the middle of a news cycle for 24 hours off of things that previously would never have gotten the kind of coverage that is happening in response to a quizzical follow up so you point the fingers at the journalism then handel said no don t put words in my mouth ben i had a very broad sentence see this is exactly what happens and why things are really broken you don t listen and you put words in people s mouth the guardian said i was trying to clarify handel responded no you really weren t but what i said was the following there is a lack of civility in society as a whole social media has been fueling it journalism has been fueling it this is a deep rooted problem in american politics right now which is going to take work and bipartisan commitment asked if the issue was partisan handel said i can only tell you what i have observed in this race the anger has been from the left with groups of trackers showing up and literally adopting a gang like posture and virtually stalking individuals referring to the threats she received in the mail she added just what i was subject to that literally we had to have hazmat in our home and people having profanity hurled at them for no reason other than who they are supporting in this race and it s interesting to me that it has been very much one sided handel s attitude was shared by some supporters including joann birrell a local elected official who said if you look at the folks who are doing this it s all anti trump protesters in contrast ossoff a 30 year old first time candidate who has seemed almost preternaturally on message focused a broader and non partisan call for civility he refused to address the political aftermath of the shooting of scalise which has been invoked against him in an ad released by a small and hitherto unknown political action committee i can t even think about the politics of it he said representative scalise is still fighting for his life politicizing it is disgraceful this is a tragedy that has united people to ossoff the heated political climate spoke to the need for candidates and elected officials and leaders to call for calm and civility and respect despite intense differences in political opinion and to lead by example he added this is a deep rooted problem in american politics right now which is going to take work and bipartisan commitment to try to heal wounds and focus on substance instead of fear mongering and slander as the race closed on monday its focus was not limited to civility with unprecedented sums being spent on both sides turnout was expected to rise beyond the norm for midterms the key battleground was moderate suburban republican leaning voters people skeptical of donald trump in what has long been a republican district ossoff pitched a message of fiscal responsibility and cutting government waste seeking to avoid coming across as too liberal and criticizing handel over her brief time with the susan komen race for the cure a charity which seeks to combat breast cancer where she led an effort to cut the organization s funding for planned parenthood after a national outcry funding was restored and handel stepped down in clipped tones ossoff said in her last significant private sector experience her performance also lacked in contrast handel condemned ossoff for not living in the district and for what she said was his support from outside the state her campaign repeatedly attacked ossoff over his support from the house minority leader nancy pelosi and his san francisco values as the us representative doug collins put it at handel s final campaign event the last thing we need in washington is another democrat from california especially coming from georgia handel 55 and a former georgia secretary of state has also repeatedly criticized her opponent over his lack of experience while the race has become a focus for national attention as a referendum on the trump presidency both candidates tried to focus on local issues at an election eve rally in a suburban restaurant handel insisted this race is not about what is going on in the rest of the country it is about you and the sixth district ossoff hit a similar note telling reporters this campaign has been focused on the daily concerns of voters here despite the temptation to wade into the national circus however much enthusiasm in the race was clearly built around feelings towards trump in a district the president barely won in 2016 at handel s election eve rally where tickets were required for admittance the president s name went unmentioned a lone attendee in a make america great again hat seemed more like a unicorn than a base republican voter ossoff also avoided trump s name at his election eve event in a strip mall office packed with hundreds of volunteers but the loud chants of hey hey ho ho donald trump has got to go before he spoke made clear the disdain ossoff s base had for the president such enthusiasm however may not be enough this is a traditionally conservative district formerly represented by the ex house speaker newt gingrich and trump s health secretary tom price one gop operative involved in the race predicted that to win ossoff would need 20 of the republican vote
