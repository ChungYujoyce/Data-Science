department since 2013 and replacing him with an ambassador with close ties to vice president mike pence mr linick who was named by president barack obama to lead the office of the inspector general at the state department will be replaced by ambassador stephen j akard the director of the office of foreign missions the state department said in a statement on friday night in a letter to speaker nancy pelosi that was obtained by the new york times mr trump wrote that it is vital that i have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general that is no longer the case with regard to this inspector general the president added the decision to remove mr linick first reported friday night by politico is the latest in a purge of inspectors general whom mr trump has deemed insufficiently loyal to his administration upending the traditional independence of the internal watchdog agencies whose missions are to conduct oversight of the nation s sprawling bureaucracy representative eliot l engel democrat of new york and the chairman of the house committee on foreign affairs called the decision to remove mr linick an outrageous act meant to protect secretary of state mike pompeo from accountability in his statement mr engel said that he had learned that mr linick s office had opened an investigation into mr pompeo mr engel said that mr linick s firing amid such a probe strongly suggests that this is an unlawful act of retaliation mr engel did not offer any more details but a democratic aide said that mr linick was looking into whether mr pompeo had misused a political appointee at the state department to perform personal tasks for himself and his wife a spokeswoman for mr pompeo did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment about the accusation the removals of the inspectors general and their replacements by allies of the president s are part of an aggressive move by mr trump and his top aides against who he considers to be deep state officials in many key agencies and who he believes are opposed to his agenda that effort accelerated in the weeks after the president was acquitted in a senate impeachment trial mr trump viewed the inquiry into his actions related to ukraine as a coup orchestrated by career officials and democratic politicians determined to bring his presidency to an early conclusion on may 1 even as the coronavirus pandemic continued to ravage the country mr trump moved to oust christi a grimm the principal deputy inspector general for the department of health and human services whose office had issued a report revealing the dire state of the nation s response to the pathogen a month earlier the president ousted michael k atkinson the inspector general of the intelligence community telling the leaders of two congressional committees that he had lost confidence in him mr atkinson had infuriated the president by insisting on telling congress about the whistle blower complaint that prompted the impeachment inquiry the president also took steps to remove glenn a fine who has been the acting inspector general for the defense department since before mr trump took office so that he could not be installed as the leader of an oversight panel intended to keep tabs on how the trump administration spends trillions of dollars in pandemic relief approved by congress under law the administration must notify congress 30 days before formally terminating an inspector general mr linick is expected to leave his post then ms pelosi who led the impeachment effort in the house condemned the move late friday to replace mr linick the late night weekend firing of state department ig steve linick is an acceleration of the president s dangerous pattern of retaliation against the patriotic public servants charged with conducting oversight on behalf of the american people she said in a statement on twitter representative joaquin castro democrat of texas and the chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee on oversight and investigations said on twitter that the move by the white house was a potential cover up by mr trump and mr pompeo and that it could result in a congressional inquiry congress houseforeign oversight subcommittee will hold the trump admin accountable for any illegal actions and corrupt conduct mr castro tweeted mr linick was a bit player in the impeachment inquiry briefly drawing attention to himself at the height of the investigation into mr trump s actions in october he hand delivered a packet of information to congressional investigators saying he thought it might help answer whether the president pressured ukraine to investigate former vice president joseph r biden jr and his son hunter biden in the end the roughly 40 pages of material turned out to be largely inconsequential a record of contacts between rudolph w giuliani the president s personal lawyer and ukrainian prosecutors as well as accounts of ukrainian law enforcement proceedings at least two investigations by mr linick s office have caused friction with senior political appointees at the state department in november the office said it had found that appointees at the agency when it was led by secretary of state rex w tillerson had retaliated against an iranian american career civil servant sahar nowrouzzadeh because of her ethnicity and a perception that she held political views different from those of top trump officials brian h hook then the head of the office of policy planning where ms nowrouzzadeh worked was scrutinized in that inquiry mr hook is now the special representative for iran and works closely with mr pompeo in august mr linick s office found that two political appointees in the bureau of international organization affairs the assistant secretary kevin e moley and his senior adviser mari stull had harassed career employees mr pompeo did not fire mr moley who announced in october he would retire later that year employees of the state department s inspector general s office have viewed mr linick as a competent nonpartisan leader mr akard by contrast has been a controversial figure since his nomination for a senior state department job when mr tillerson was secretary the white house had pushed mr akard for the job of director general of the foreign service a top management position that has traditionally gone to respected career officials with decades of experience a close associate of mr pence s mr akard had served as the director of international development at the indiana economic development corporation in the state where mr pence once was governor members of congress heard the intense grumblings of longtime state department employees and signaled to the white house in 2018 that he would not be confirmed even senior republicans had opposed the nomination in 2019 mr akard was confirmed as the department s director of the office of foreign missions a job with the rank of ambassador that top career officials do not consider meaningful compared with the director general post michael d shear reported from washington and maggie haberman from new york edward wong and catie edmondson
