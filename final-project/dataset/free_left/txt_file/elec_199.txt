boston for the formal dedication of the edward m kennedy institute for the united states senate memories of teddy will be many gauzy heartwarming and moving but the real buzz will be all about his successor elizabeth warren hero to progressives nemesis of wall street and a source of consternation to more mainstream pols of both the left and right not the least of whom is hillary clinton can elizabeth warren be the new ted kennedy wonders boston globe columnist joan vennochi in a recent column one answer is that she doesn t have to be after all ted kennedy wasn t always ted kennedy either the second answer is that she already is kennedy may have ended his 47 year career billed as the lion of the senate but he didn t start that way he was just a 28 year old kid when his brother was elected president thereby leaving an empty senate seat in massachusetts teddy wanted it but he was too young the u s constitution requires senators be at least 30 that problem was easily managed the white house successfully prevailed on massachusetts governor foster furcolo to appoint a seat warmer to the position making sure ted had a clear run when he was of age advertisement his election was a cakewalk his primary opponent edward j mccormack ruefully observed that if teddy s name were edward moore instead of edward moore kennedy his candidacy would be a joke it mattered not america and the bay state especially were in the throes of camelot kennedy won handily still no one in washington thought much of teddy his seat was a gift courtesy of his brother he had political skills to be sure he had been invaluable in john s race for the presidency but no one thought he had much gravitas warren on the other hand is steeped in gravitas she s an academic a specialist in bankruptcy law who built her career on groundbreaking research about how debt affects ordinary consumers beginning at rutgers school of law newark she hopscotched to several other law schools before finally ending up at harvard law during the 2008 economic crisis she was named one of the overseers of the emergency economic stabilization act and she was later the brains behind the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau by then she was a middle class hero too a regular on jon stewart s the daily show as well as dr phil she had also made a number of enemies on the right to the eternal regret of another massachusetts senator warren should have been named the first head of the cfpb but obama demurred thinking conservatives would scotch her confirmation at loose ends she turned her eyes toward massachusetts and sen scott brown brown a gop state senator and former cosmo centerfold had improbably won the special election held shortly after kennedy s death in 2009 brown s easygoing manner had less to do with his victory than did democrats taking the election for granted this was ted kennedy s seat after all they had thought an idea brown memorably rebutted it s the people s seat investigation by carrie levine letter from nevada by jon ralston 2016 by doug sosnik but massachusetts is massachusetts the bluest of the blue states and brown s politics made for an uncomfortable fit when the regular election came up in 2012 warren made her move with the support of seemingly the entire state democratic establishment she was unopposed for the nomination her national celebrity allowed her to easily outraise brown she took in 39 million and she defeated him with 54 percent of the vote brown s win had interrupted the narrative one liberal should have led to the next warren s win fixed it brown s clever line notwithstanding she was the rightful heir to kennedy s seat and the rightful heir as well to lead the democratic party s progressive wing kennedy struggled to define himself when he first entered the senate it was easy to paint him as a lightweight a 1964 plane crash left him with permanent injuries but also spurred him to start focusing his attention on public policy and his role in the senate over time he emerged as the liberal s liberal an unabashed proponent of government intervention typified by his most famous speech given after he lost the 1980 presidential nomination to jimmy carter for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die warren didn t have to struggle to define herself she entered the senate with instant credibility her rhetoric doesn t soar like kennedy s but its articulation of progressive values is just as unabashed as in this campaign upbraiding to go it alone conservatives there is nobody in this country who got rich on his own nobody you moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for you didn t have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory and hire someone to protect against this because of the work the rest of us did now look you built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea god bless keep a big hunk of it but part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along each seized on a central issue grounded in personal experience for kennedy it was health care the cause of my life and a topic that began to consume him after he was injured it was a lifelong quest he first introduced national health care legislation in 1970 and was defeated at every turn never giving up and ultimately realizing his dream only with the advent of obamacare legislation he never actually got to see signed into law warren s focus on finances had its genesis in her childhood her family was nearly ruined by debt the game is rigged she believes and it s rigged in favor of those who have money and who have power that was the driving force behind her push for the cfpb and her unyielding no compromises speak truth to power approach is what has won her the hearts of democratic progressives but that same unyielding approach is what in the minds of many distinguishes her from kennedy robert caro called lyndon baines johnson the master of the senate but the title could also have applied to kennedy after chappaquiddick and his loss to carter in 1980 kennedy finally committed himself wholeheartedly to the body abandoning dreams for the presidency his record of accomplishmentwas striking more than 2 500 pieces of legislation introduced and over 300 passed into law among his signature pieces were campaign finance reform cobra and no child left behind he was a man of many personal demons too much liquor and too many women but he also made friends easily and got along well with all manner of individuals he was focused on results and cajoled flattered bargained and harangued with whomever necessary to get them and warren s legislative record it s thin at best granted the comparison is unfair she s just over two years into her job still from the first she s appeared to brook no compromise late last year worried a spending bill was too lenient on big banks she threatened to stymie bipartisan efforts to avoid a government shutdown you re tired you re frustrated you re upset about a provision in the bill you don t like beratedrepublican senator lindsey graham welcome to democracy seemingly channeling senator ted cruz she later took on the obama administration shooting down its nomination of wall streeter antonio weiss to a senior treasury post and earlier this month investor superstar and democratic stalwart warren buffett rebukedwarren as well i think she would be better if she was less angry and demonized less he said on cnbc warren seems anything but kennedy esque she s a loner who goes her own way she just wants to make waves she seems not to understand or even care for the very essence of the senate and of the legislative process indeed over just the past few days jpmorgan and citigroup furious at warren s attacks have said they ll stop donating to senate democrats warren unconcerned pushed backharshly they can threaten or bully or say whatever they want but we aren t going to change our game plan would kennedy have said that probably the image of kennedy as the well regarded inside player reaching across the aisle is a bit of myth making for much of his career kennedy was a lightning rod republicans used him as a liberal punching bag caricatures of him made for reliable fundraising appeals he raised issues and pushed causes that often were before their time including gay rights and women s pay nor was kennedy unswervingly loyal to his party he broke with jimmy carter and ran against him in 1980 an ugly fight that split the party and arguably made possible ronald reagan s ultimate victory and during the reagan years he was the ardent voice of the opposition pushing back against any manner of reagan initiatives both domestic and foreign including notably aid to the contras and the buildup of weapons aimed at the ussr and then of course kennedy was the one who singlehandedly stopped the nomination of robert bork to the u s supreme court that borking was a sharp departure from traditional senate rules of decorum and arguably ushered in an era of stridency that persists to this day in fact much of what kennedy did sounds quite warren esque the centerpiece of the institute for the u s senate is a full scale reproduction of the senate chambers every day participants can play senator reenacting famous legislative battles and seeing how the complicated process of drafting negotiating and compromise can lead or not to the passage of a bill it s a good and valuable lesson about how to get things done but the lesson should not be that that s the only way to get things done kennedy s life was about public service and the senate was a means to accomplish that end legislation was one tactic but as kennedy s own career demonstrated the senate could also be a bully pulpit a platform for grand ideas and a place to be the opposition that it seems is what warren is doing someday she may use the legislative process to achieve her own goals for the moment though the tactics she s deploying are remarkably effective so much so that all manner of folks including her hometown newspaper the boston globe have urged her to jump into the presidential race she ll likely not heed their pleas happy where she is just as surely as did kennedy warren
