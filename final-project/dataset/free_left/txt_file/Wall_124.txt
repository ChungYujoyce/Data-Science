about the song my mother used to sing shake hands with your air raid warden it s about living through scary times with children and what you tell them when the world does not seem like a safe place and of course it s about my mother and maybe about her generation which certainly grew up through scary times and about thinking of our own children all of them their childhoods interrupted at any age by covid 19 and by our own scary times my mother played the bugle she grew up in the williamsburg section of brooklyn and she marched with her father s jewish war veterans band he had emigrated from hungary in time to be sent back to europe as an american soldier in the first world war when she worked as a camp counselor in the summer in the catskills she took along her bugle she played reveille in the morning taps in the evening and mess call before meals when our family lived in suburban new jersey in the late 1960s my mother would step out on the back porch and play mess call to summon us home for dinner that was back in the days before play dates when children ranged around the neighborhood and parents didn t necessarily know where they were did that actually happen very often i m not even sure the bugle on the porch was one of my mother s favorite stories about herself she loved to imagine herself scandalizing the suburban new jersey neighborhood as she blared it out soupy soupy soupy without a single bean porky porky porky without a strip of lean coffee coffee coffee the meanest ever seen surely those were not quite the lyrics when she played for the jewish war veterans i grew up in the vietnam war era and my mother was deeply opposed to the war to all wars her only brother had died in korea and she spent years writing and rewriting a novel about how this devastated her parents and left her mother willing to spend her meager savings on a fortune teller who assured her that her son was still alive but she loved the songs of the second world war praise the lord and pass the ammunition coming in on a wing and a prayer there s a star spangled banner waving somewhere over time as i grew up i tracked many of them down but there was one that i could never locate not in collections of the songs of the war not in youtube videos then last week i was talking in a properly socially distanced way of course with my children about my mother it was in fact the anniversary of her death something that i had actually forgotten in the confusion and distress and time lapse blur of the last few weeks when my children pointed out the anniversary i of course started to cry and then tried to say somewhat incoherently that my mother if she were alive would have been more up to the current crisis than i will ever be she knew the world was dangerous i tried to explain she learned it as a child and she accepted it and she never forgot it think about that song the one about the air raid warden that i could never find the one i finally decided she must have invented and of course within about 15 minutes my daughter had found a wartime radio clip in the new york public radio archives and there was the song shake hands with your air raid warden actually the clip started with a discussion of plane spotting that is how civilians could learn to recognize enemy bombers between the radio host clifton fadiman and an aircraft expert frederick hazard civilian spotters with their binoculars mr hazard said were on the first line of defense against attack from the air my mother s song as i think of it was performed by irving caesar who actually wrote it who lived a long and successful songwriting life he was born in 1895 and died in 1996 and his songs include the lyrics for tea for two with music by vincent youmans and for swanee with music by george gershwin shake hands was very much the encouraging ballad of civil obedience that the title suggests swinging along in march rhythm walk up to him and say mr warden i ll obey just tell me what to do and where to go i was overjoyed in the sense of being reduced to tears to hear this refrain from my childhood sung all the way through but i was even more affected by the song that irving caesar performed first when you hear the siren blow written specifically as a safety song for the children of america it s a much less stirring less brassy song written in a kind of nursery rhyme pitter patter the first verse told children what to listen for one long blast and one that s short which would let them know that an air raid was happening it told them what to do proceed calmly to a shelter the second verse was addressed to mothers warning them that if an air raid came by day they should stay away from the schools and let the teachers handle things at night turn off any lights that might be visible and keep food and water and a radio handy mothers although your hearts may ache and lots of courage it may take be brave it s for your children s sake your courage will see you through the song concludes as i said it doesn t take much to make me cry these days and i m not reaching for war metaphors a pandemic is a pandemic not a war or a tsunami it is its own disaster and must be met and understood as such but we can draw generational comparisons to the way the world broke apart around the families of the 1930s and 40s and no matter how frightened they might have been the children in the united states were safer than many those air raids never came what i keep thinking about is the recurring responsibility that parents face in difficult times to acknowledge to our children that no matter how much we would give to be able to do it we cannot promise them safety and we cannot promise to make the world go on working we have to be able to teach whatever safety drills go with our own uncertain times summon our own often precarious reserves of courage and find our lullabies where we can and we can hope of course for better times my mother was still singing shake hands with your air raid warden seven decades later not as a warning of danger overhead but as a signifier perhaps that troubled times can be survived and remembered and that song and story can help us through in the song you follow your air raid warden all the way to victory shake hands with your air raid warden hero without gun a loyal volunteer we need him over here until the war is won advertisement
