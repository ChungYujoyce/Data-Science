illinois zero confirmed virus cases as told to justin carissimo the first few weeks were very chaotic we ve been on lockdown since april 1 tensions are running high there s a lot of uncertainty especially being incarcerated and not knowing if your loved ones are safe and constantly not knowing from day to day whether or not the virus is going to get into our facility we spend our days trying to stay as positive as possible cleaning as much as we can with what we have and trying to uplift each other rather than tear each other down i happen to be in a unit with some really god fearing women and women who are very conscious about trying to maintain some kind of mental health and stability while we re in here every morning we wake up we work out together we spend a lot of time reading we pray that s the one thing i can say about this whole experience that i have been blessed to be with some women who really have strong faith we try to keep each other encouraged as much as possible we re human and we make mistakes and just because we make mistakes does not mean that our lives are any less valuable than the next person lives we deserve a fighting chance too we want to come home to our families healthy and not have to worry each day whether it s going to be our last i was one of the people that were called in the second round for home confinement they called us in there to let me know that i did qualify we filled out our re entry paperwork just to have new criteria released from the bop not even five days later since that point on i have not heard anything else back about home confinement i have three small kids and my babies are aways coloring these pictures and they send mail and so i hold on to those things they keep me motivated to want to come home

rooms we re stuck in kitchens we can t even get fresh air i thought doing time was hard this is hard i don t know if i m going to call home one day and one of my family members are going to be gone or if something s going to happen to them i don t know what s happening moment to moment in here being that we re so limited with communication i just want my family to keep themselves safe i get up

this moment all i have at this time i have a little bit of coffee one of the officers drops off a breakfast bag with milk and a piece of fruit and let s call it some sort of liquid eggs later from the window in the kitchen we re watching all of the men getting shackled and sent down to the men s prison or we re watching them pass by to go to medical to be quarantined on april 7 i was called into the lieutenant s office and they told me that i was accepted for home confinement they told me i have an hour to pack my stuff the next morning my case manager came in and the lieutenant came in and told me that i have to leave because i was under review because i have a violent charge they said that i have to be pulled and i m going back to the unit my freedom was pulled from me because they feel that i don t qualify i have clear conduct in seven and a half years i m an asset to society i m not a threat to society my case manager told me he doesn t have time to look at my file because he has too much casework and unfortunately i m gonna have to sit in prison until the rest of my time is finished hill is serving a 28 year sentence for conspiracy and fraud fci oakdale i louisiana 33 confirmed cases i have never been in a war zone before until now this has been a most devastating destructive thing as you can t see the enemy but you know that it is always around from every cough that you hear the sneeze that you see is like a gun firing at war you cringe and run to your bunker as we sleep 3 feet apart from each other and with our cellmate sick or our neighbor sick we are just sitting time bombs waiting for when this is going to happen to me to that point we watch our neighbors in one case literally our neighbor in the next cubicle being taken out by medical only to see on the local news a few days later that he had died seven men have died from here so far with untold numbers sick untold because there is no testing many have not complained about having been sick as they did not want to bear having to pack up and go to isolation quarantine where they would be removed from what little freedom they did have we have been on lockdown for over a month now we only get a few minutes of fresh air a day by walking up to the dining hall to pick up a clamshell hot meal and return to the unit to eat it we watch the local news to get reports of the dead and to listen for their names to see if we know them it has been truly tragic one of the dead was an older guy 57 years old who would come up to the chapel before we went on lockdown and have me pick out inspiring movies for him to watch there is no one here that was sentenced to a death sentence by their judge yet we are living as if we have a death sentence one day at a time faith over fear black is serving 32 years for bank robbery fort dix fci new jersey 23 confirmed cases as told to justin carissimo the virus has brought a lot of fear in here i m in a lower security institution and for the most part guys here have an out date it s scaring people seeing the numbers on the news about the deaths and the cases that are going up it s making guys worry if they re going to make it out of here after doing their time if it gets in here it s like a fire to dry grass we ve been cleaning up a whole lot i m an orderly in the unit and i help clean we keep spraying some disinfectant type cleaner around and wipe down the phones i m in a unit with roughly 300 people and social distancing is out the question it s gotten to the point where staff are scared they re coming to work because it s an essential job but nobody wants to get the virus people need to understand that everybody with what are called violent offenses they need steps in order to better themselves a lot of these guys that have violent offenses they need a chance as well i ve been incarcerated i haven t had any incident reports all of us don t have life sentences or death penalties we want to come home too i m a volunteer tutor i help facilitate black history classes self esteem classes and health job fairs with those things that i ve learned i tell new guys that come in the positives are far better than the negatives that you re trying to get i m making this into a positive situation certain guys call me the prototype for violent offenders in terms of what you need to do to get results inside if you or
