in the mongolian steppe hunters partner with golden eagles to catch game when lauren mcgough found out about it she said i have to see it i have to do it falconry the art of hunting with birds of prey was born in the forbidding altai mountains of central asia as we first told you last year hunters there still loft golden eagles into the sky in a partnership of man and bird that predates recorded history we say man but in truth one of the best hunters in mongolia today is a woman from oklahoma city lauren mcgough took us to one of the most remote places on earth to meet the hunters who trained her and before the next few minutes are through you will know what it s like to fly like an eagle the mongolian steppe is the greatest expanse of grassland unaltered by humankind it endures because human existence has narrow odds between the widest climate extremes on earth 104 degrees in summer 50 below in winter nomads depend on the animals that yield nearly all of their food fiber clothing and fuel and one of the oldest bonds in nature is an alliance of survival among hunters horses and golden eagles lauren mcgough this is the most ancient form of falconry in the world this is where it all began it s the cradle so several thousand years ago we don t know precisely when a man saw an eagle catch a rabbit or a fox and had the ingenious idea to hunt in partnership with it it blows my mind that it s even real it s like something out of lord of the rings but you can do it lauren mcgough was in high school when she dedicated her life to raptors she traveled with us to the place she calls the cradle 6 000 miles led us first to the mongolian capital of ulaan bataar this civilization conquered the known world in the 13th century the mongols ranged from asia to europe the largest contiguous empire of all time from here we flew another 800 miles to bayan lgii where mongolia russia china and kazakhstan meet this was the end of the road but not the end of our journey we crossed the open steppe past wild bactrian camels with two humps a vanishing species with only about 1 000 left in the world our destination was a camp of nomads people who introduced lauren mcgough to the golden eagle lauren mcgough hello they hadn t seen her in two years lauren mcgough it feels like i never left i just in a few minutes of seeing everybody such a magical place scott pelley now how did a woman from oklahoma end up out here in mongolia lauren mcgough ah well i read a book on falconry and it s like the fire was lit i just knew i had to do it and as i was researching i went to the library and i found this old book that had black and white photos of eagle hunters from mongolia so you know this beautiful shaggy horse and this man with a giant eagle and a fox pelt on his horse and it just looked like the most incredible thing and i thought i have to see it i have to do it at the age of 17 her father a former air force stealth pilot brought her to mongolia lauren returned five years later with funding from a fulbright scholarship then she earned a ph d based on her work with the eagle hunters lauren mcgough these are the people that can talk to animals because they have relationships with goats sheep horses camels eagles they have intimate knowledge of where snow leopards are and foxes are there s no agriculture here because the land s not arable so they ve ingeniously learned to domesticate animals and then build these unique relationships with wild animals it s a relationship that she learned from people who endure the life of 19th century ranchers they are kazakhs who make up just four percent of mongolians they have no running water no electricity they survive on meat and milk and burn dung as fuel the nomads live in clusters of a half dozen families or so the boys mind the flocks while the men ride in search of foxes to make furs for sub zero survival scott pelley in all the years you ve been doing this what have you learned about these animals a hunter named chukan gave us an answer we never saw coming chukan translated as they said in the old times if the horse makes your name famous in a race once a year the eagle makes your name famous a hundred times a year if i gift to people many foxes they will say it was chukan who gifted us the foxes eagle hunting is more about your name being spread far and wide among the people so if eagle hunting is about the ego of men we wondered how they saw lauren mcgough chukan translated she had her mind set on learning to hunt with the eagle her motivation came from deep in her heart we just couldn t say no when lauren first came to mongolia it took her two weeks to catch an eagle she could call her own scott pelley how do you catch a golden eagle lauren mcgough yes so you have a dead hare that you lay out with a crow or a raven steaked nearby and you encircle it in a net so the eagle on migration looks down and sees this hare that only a crow has possession of and it thinks ah i can easily bully that crow out of that rabbit and have a free meal to myself so it comes in and when it tries to grab the dead rabbit the net enfolds around the eagle the eagle is taught to feed at the hand of the hunter and as long as the meals are regular the eagles are calm content and come back for more they perch on the hunter s arm with a rawhide leash called a jess tied to their legs they train the birds with a fox pelt tugged by a rope this is what happens when the eagle zeroes in on a fox after the bird makes the kill the hunters ride in strip the pelt and give the meat to the eagle it s a technique well over a thousand years old we may not know exactly when it started but you don t have to be here in mongolia very long to figure out why it began in an area as vast as this with game so rare it helps to have a hunting partner that can see seven times better than a human and cover all of this at about 50 miles an hour what is that like the eagles were kind enough to show us we custom built a soft rubber camera harness and learned how to fly golden eagles are abundant all around the northern hemisphere in terms of survival as a species conservationists call golden eagles an animal of least concern lauren mcgough this is a ten pound bird which don t be fooled if that doesn t sound like a lot they have hollow bones and they re mostly feathers so ten pounds on a bird is an enormous bird they have a six foot wingspan they usually have lovely amber eyes and the name golden eagle derives from the beautiful golden feathers on their nape and then the rest scott pelley yes around the neck lauren mcgough they re incredibly effective at killing which is what they re built for they re a modern day velociraptor a perfect product of evolution i will never be tired of a golden eagle flying every time it thrills me the eagle s talons can close on its prey with a bone crushing force of 900 pounds per square inch a fun fact that is no fun to know scott pelley come on sweetheart lauren mcgough perfect very good and then go ahead and stand up and then to secure the eagle place your jesses between your thumb and the rest of your fingers scott pelley right here ok lauren mcgough yes the noise that the eagle recognizes is kah kah whenever you re ready just take off her hood scott pelley remove the hood lauren mcgough yes kah kah kah lauren mcgough good girl scott pelley oh god what a feeling oh notice she said good girl the only eagles worthy of partnership are female they re larger stronger better hunters ironic since the human partner is traditionally male scott pelley of all the eagle hunters you ve known how does lauren rate how good is she chukan translated she is at the same level as men she could compete with them lauren at 31 is considered one of the best falconers in the world she has brought the ancient ways to oklahoma where she rehabilitates raptors and trained with her own eagle named miles scott pelley what is the career of one of these eagles lauren mcgough so an eagle is trapped the first year second year maybe third year on its migration and then it has a time with an eagle hunter which could be as short as a year or as long as six seven eight years eventually they return that eagle back to the wild scott pelley it is part of the tradition to let them go lauren mcgough yes they firmly believe that an older eagle should be in the wild scott pelley what do you say to some people who might watch this and think that the eagles are being abused that they shouldn t be caught lauren mcgough i would encourage anybody that has doubts to go out with a falconer in this country or in the united states or anywhere we only encourage their natural instincts the only difference is you are right there you have a front row seat to see this incredibly million year old predator prey relationship scott pelley do you worry that one day there will be no more eagle hunters ouni translated no it is an essential art that kazakhs are born with since kazakhs have come to the earth they have been practicing this tradition it will not disappear also each of us has a young person that we teach like this boy it passes from generation to generation scott pelley what s at stake if this tradition is lost lauren mcgough this is where man first figured out that he could have a relationship with a raptor and what a loss would it be for humanity if it was gone we can take an individual eagle and bring it from the spectrum of wild all the way to tame and then wild again and we get to see what they re capable of up close and in person man if that understanding of eagles and animals were to leave that s not a world i want to live in the boy named bekka is the hope of his family s traditional world he s learning horsemanship and falconry and it was with bekka that we discovered the most endangered species on the steppe the nomads themselves there may be only 300 eagle hunters left a rare breed of human still speaking the
