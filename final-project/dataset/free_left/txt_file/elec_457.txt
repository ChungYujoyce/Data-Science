the democratic presidential contenders dramatically outpaced their republican counterparts in the race for campaign cash last quarter spotlighting how the parties are taking divergent paths in their pursuit of 2016 funding the emphasis by hillary rodham clinton and bernie sanders on raising money directly for their campaigns has helped them amass large donor pools critical to generating the estimated 1billion each party s candidate will need to raise by election day while gop candidates put an intense focus early in the year on raising huge sums for independent groups many have had less success in attracting smaller donations that are the lifeblood of campaign operations campaign finance reports filed thursday show the risk of the big money approach was underscored by the modest 13 4million raised over the summer by former florida governor jeb bush who earlier this year was expected to be a financial powerhouse just 877 000 came from donations of 200 or less after helping scoop up more than 100million for his allied super pac before declaring his bid bush is now struggling to explain to backers why he is not getting more traction among the party s rank and file two gop contenders former texas governor rick perry and wisconsin gov scott walker have already dropped out of the race after running low on cash you could have this big super pac but if you have limited momentum and limited money to keep the campaign going it s like the guy at the top of mount everest with two broken legs and an extra oxygen tank said republican strategist matthew dowd you re living longer but you re not going anywhere one of the challenges for bush and other gop hopefuls has been the dominance of real estate impresario donald trump who has siphoned off much of the enthusiasm in the base the businessman raised 3 8million even though he has pledged to self fund his campaign and is not soliciting contributions no more shock and awe for jeb bush donald trump has basically stultified the fundraising for these candidates said anthony scaramucci who had been walker s national finance co chair and is now backing bush he s the trump speed bump his ratcheting up in the polls has made it very difficult for more establishment republicans to get traction with donors in all six democratic candidates reported raising 123 2 million for their campaign committees so far this year while 15 gop candidates pulled in 143 5 million overall clinton and sanders together had 60 1million on hand at the end of september meanwhile the 15 republicans combined reported having 61 2million in the bank the totals raised on each side by the candidate aligned super pacs are unclear because they do not have to report their fundraising until jan 31 but by mid year gop allied groups had raised 234million and democratic groups had pulled in 17million retired neurosurgeon ben carson raised the most in the republican field last quarter scooping up 20 8million he still fell short of the totals posted by clinton 29 5million and sanders 26 2million other gop candidates trail behind sen ted cruz of texas 12 2million former hewlett packard chief executive carly fiorina 6 8million sen marco rubio of florida 5 7million ohio gov john kasich 4 4 million new jersey gov chris christie 4 2 million and sen rand paul of kentucky 2 5million one of the democrats major structural advantages is the size of their small donor bases a staggering 650 000 individuals have given sanders money already while nearly 400 000 have donated to clinton her campaign said thursday the senator from vermont spent just 11 3million last quarter ending september with almost 27 1million in the bank clinton spent at a much faster pace shelling out 25 7million as her campaign made deep investments in building its data analytics and national ground operation her biggest expense was for a staff that swelled to 511 over the summer 8 5million went to payroll and taxes she headed into october with nearly 33million on hand updated inside the 2016 money race carson and cruz appear to have built the strongest small donation operations on the gop side carson raised 60percent of his money last quarter in low dollar contributions more than 12million thanks to a donor base of 402 000 people cruz brought in 5 3million in small contributions 44percent of his total haul fiorina also saw a late burst of small donations almost half of the 6 8million she raised was in low dollar contributions with donations spiking after her two lauded debate performances low dollar contributors are key to a candidate s long term health not just because they can provide repeated injections of cash but because they bring energy that s the biggest leading indicator for us about who is hot said becki donatelli a top gop digital strategist whose firm is working for eight of the 2016 candidates these are your volunteers they ve got skin in the game that has been a weakness for bush whose small donations amounted to just 6 5 percent of his total last quarter instead his finance operation relies heavily on a network of longtime family loyalists on thursday his campaign released a list of 342 fundraisers who have bundled at least 17 600 for his bid but it did not indicate how much each person has raised more than 70 of the bundlers are from his home state of florida bush raced through 11 5million over the summer spending money at a steep burn rate of nearly 86percent he was not alone many of the candidates spent money at an intense clip in the third quarter carson s campaign spent 14million between july and september of that 9 5 million was spent on media and advertising nearly 2 7 million went to direct mail expenses and 1 4 million was allocated for payroll expenses voters are mad about mega donors and it s helping trump and sanders trump burned through 4 million in three months more than the 3 9 million his campaign took in he reported paying more than 50 consulting firms or individuals including security guards strategists communications specialists event producers video graphers photographers web designers and a host of administrative support staffers trump s biggest expenses appear to be the renting out large venues to host elaborate events that attract thousands as well as campaign swag he has thus far spent more than 800 000 on t shirts hats and other campaign branded items he also appears to have purchased radio airtime in virginia and has hired telemarketing and direct mail firms paul spent 4 5million nearly double the 2 5million he brought in an unsustainable burn rate of 186percent his biggest expenditures were for campaign consulting and online advertising louisiana gov bobby jindal r who has struggled to break out of the bottom tier of 2016 candidates since launching his bid in june raised less than 600 000 during the third fundraising quarter in 2015 he spent more than 800 000 with the bulk of those expenditures going to payroll media and campaign consulting thursday s filings shed light on the dire financial predicaments that led walker and perry to drop out perry a former texas governor raised just 252 000 in contributions during the most last recent reporting period from july 1 to sept 30 but racked up more than 1million in operating expenditures during that same time to sustain that pace the campaign relied on the 884 000 it held at the beginning of the reporting period in all the campaign paid nearly 300 000 in consulting fees on expenses ranging from finance to media specialists of that 200 000 went to abstract
