advertisement supported by on super tuesday he roared back to the front of the pack by frank bruni opinion columnist what a difference a few days make they brought joe biden back from the dead after a landslide victory in south carolina on saturday he collected a bonanza of important endorsements on sunday and monday then on super tuesday when 14 states voted he did exponentially better than almost anyone predicted he probably exceeded his own dreams bernie sanders supposedly had the momentum in the race for the democratic presidential nomination biden just stole it he s resuscitated resurrected resplendent it s some kind of miracle i am here to report we are very much alive he exulted in a victory speech and you could almost see the adrenaline pumping from his pores you could hear in his thunderous voice an amalgam of amazement and pure joy rambling bumbling biden was mostly gone in his stead was an exuberant articulate champion biden won in places where black voters make all the difference and in places where they don t he won in places massachusetts minnesota oklahoma where he hadn t even competed he won virginia by 30 points he won texas where sanders s outreach to latino voters was supposed to put him over the top he won and won and won taking the overall lead in the delegate count and his momentum may be even bigger than the super tuesday returns suggested for three reasons one early voting in some states preceded his surge and probably didn t reflect it two the coalescing of other democrats around him is so new that it may not have fully registered with voters three exit polls affirmed that democratic voters care more about choosing the fiercest adversary for president trump than about embracing a candidate whose positions they like best super tuesday cast biden as that adversary it gave him that glow so he could shine brighter still when another six states vote in a week that s especially true in light of what happened on wednesday morning michael bloomberg who had an epically disappointing and decidedly un super tuesday dropped out of the race and endorsed biden votes that would have gone to him are much more likely to go to biden than to sanders sanders could be in big trouble or not he s going to win california the state with by far the greatest trove of delegates and his impassioned supporters have already begun to portray biden s super tuesday showing as the product of some democratic establishment trickery who knows how this will play out if 2016 and 2020 so far have taught us anything it s not to get ahead of ourselves this much is safe to say the landscape of the democratic primary was messy and now it s clean so is the choice the contest for the party s presidential nomination comes down to two very distinct visions and two very different old men so much for the most crowded field of democratic aspirants in memory so much for that field s diversity for the formidable women in the hunt for the compelling candidates of color so much for the gradations of progressivism for the shades of gray biden is as smack in the middle of the party s mainstream whatever that is as they come he s also the establishment incarnate moderation made flesh sanders well he s the revolution that s his motto his mantra it might as well be his middle name biden calls for healing sanders vows to fight whose democratic party is it anyway we may need the rest of march or longer to find out but we know thanks to the clearing and clarifying function of the states that weighed in on tuesday that the party has arrived at a fork in the road much neater than many of us were expecting bloomberg is formally gone elizabeth warren who did miserably on tuesday losing even her home state is effectively out of contention too bloomberg s underperformance was especially striking and humiliating in the context of the hundreds of millions that he spent to woo voters he got a terrible return on that investment he hadn t been on the ballot in the first four states to vote but he was on the ballot everywhere on tuesday and he won the territory of american samoa break out the dom p rignon in virginia where bloomberg invested maybe 20 times the money that biden did he got less than 10 percent of the vote finishing fourth biden got more than 50 percent bloomberg did surpass the 15 percent threshold in other states but not by so much that he was positioned to catch up with biden or sanders as the race progressed there was no rationale for pressing on there was no point watching the returns i heard the voice of the playwright edward albee or rather of one of his characters in the zoo story who said i m paraphrasing liberally that sometimes you have to go a long way out of the way to come a short way back that s the story of the democratic primary rewind to the beginning of 2019 or possibly earlier and there was a supposition that the battle for the party s presidential nomination would boil down to a well known and nonthreatening moderate versus an edgier progressive while the stars of that show hadn t been chosen biden and sanders were very much in the running super tuesday brought the democratic party back to that dichotomy and back to those two it was as if the meteoric and historic rise of pete buttigieg who led in the delegate count after iowa and new hampshire had never happened it was as if the kamala harris and amy klobuchar moments not to mention the longer stretch during which warren was ascendant had been hallucinations it was almost almost as if bloomberg hadn t complicated the race with his wall to wall television commercials funded by his personal fort knox all of that receded as biden and sanders took center stage each focused on the other in dueling remarks on tuesday night sanders used his to bash biden s record portraying him as a foreign policy hawk a pawn of billionaires and a tool of the financial industry biden returned fire we want a nominee who will beat donald trump but also keep nancy pelosi as the speaker of the house and win back the united states senate biden said we ve got to beat donald trump and we will but we can t become like him he didn t mention sanders he didn t have to what in god s name happened to joe biden i wrote a few weeks ago and i could and should ask the question again but this time i m wondering about his strength not his weakness i do have preliminary answers and explanations many anxious democratic voters have been itching to unite behind a candidate so that everyone can then turn their attention and focus their energies on getting rid of trump and they needed just a few prompts to do that they got those prompts over the past 96 hours if they hadn t been rushing toward biden before they had never been running away he was always there so safe and so dear a harbor at the ready a perfectly acceptable landing the intensifying chatter about sanders as an easily caricatured radical spooked some of them giving them extra incentive to cluster around an alternative biden was waiting with characteristically open arms sanders should be concerned not just because biden has staged an extraordinary comeback or because bloomberg s exit will invariably redound to biden s benefit especially if bloomberg starts spending big on biden s behalf sanders isn t flexing the electoral muscle that he keeps claiming to have in some states on tuesday he did significantly worse than he had when he ran against hillary clinton in 2016 and this wasn t the first time that his performance this year paled next to what he achieved four years ago how can he boast of an expanding movement if by some measures he s contracting and how does that contraction square with his insistence that he s the one to vanquish trump on super tuesday biden was the superhero he could yet step on his own cape he s biden after all but until then he s soaring the times is committed to publishing a diversity of
