the following is a transcript of an interview with former vice president that aired sunday february 23 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan as the nevada caucuses were going on yesterday we sat down with former vice president joe biden he told us that he was confident about his prospects in south carolina and beyond margaret brennan our latest battleground tracker polling shows your lead with south carolina black voters is thinning out in november you were at 54 percent support it s now 35 percent that s a 19 point difference biden it s also been about margaret brennan what is happening biden what s happening is you have steyer spending hundreds of millions tens of thousands of dollars millions of dollars out campaigning there and so i think a lot is happening in terms of the amount of money being spent by the billionaires to try to cut into the african american vote i think that has a lot to do with it margaret brennan south carolina though is your firewall biden you said it my firewall margaret brennan you need biden i ve never said it margaret brennan the campaign has said it s your biden no margaret brennan firewall biden it s not fi i said i m going to do well there and i ll do well there and i ll do well beyond there as well margaret brennan what does do well mean for you biden look you guys can do all the pontificating about what it means i m not going to that s not my job my job is to go in and make the best case i can and i think we re gonna do well and i think we re going to go on to super tuesday and do very well margaret brennan your campaign manager had said second place there d be a sigh of relief in south carolina you disagree with your campaign manager biden look i am not going to do the pontificating about you know i m not a pundit i m a candidate and i just i m going to tell you i m gonna go all the way through this thing margaret brennan you mentioned on spending steyer you think the amount of money he s spending in south carolina biden a lot of money margaret brennan is is trimming away at your support biden well i i assume that s part of the reason why those numbers are down but i don t know margaret brennan what do you think is happening biden we ll see i mean look you guys love this stuff i m not into this let s just see what happens margaret brennan you re watching all of this biden i m not watching this at all i go out i m running for the same exact reason when i started to restore some dignity to the office to make sure that african americans and minorities get treated well and this time when we rebuild the middle class get brought along and to unify the country and the party nothing s changed why i m running and i m going to continue to do that margaret brennan why does joe biden want to be president what is the the key thing that s driving you that you want to achieve if you re elected biden we have to restore the integrity of this country internationally we have to get off of this god awful effort on this president s part to divide the country we have to bring the middle class back we have to have a health care policy that makes sense that is doable which i can do by and by building on obamacare and we have to have an immigration policy that in fact is rational and reasonable and represents who we are they are all the reasons why i m running among others but look the next president of the united states also is gonna have to stand on the stage on day one and lead the world they re going to have to be able to know what they re doing internationally and the other leaders are gonna have to know who that person is and know that person knows them and i m the best qualified person by a long shot of anybody running to do that that s why i m running margaret brennan bernie sanders can you stop him in terms of the momentum he has the bloomberg campaign as you know is out saying that for moderates like yourselves he s going to basically end up with an insurmountable delegate lead because of his early success biden i told you i m not going to play this game with you i don t know it s not about who i stop it s why i m running why i m telling the people that i should be the next president and why i m the best guy to beat trump all those other polls you all cite also show i m the most person i m the the person most likely to be trump i m the person that in fact in in those polls in addition to that i m the only one in terms of the russians and all these stuff you ve all been reporting the russians don t want me to be the nominee they spent a lot of money on bots on facebook and they ve been taken down saying biden is a bad guy they don t want biden running they re not no one s helping me to try to get the nomination they have good reason margaret brennan who informed you of that was it facebook or have u s intelligence officials told you about some kind of meddling with the campaign biden i have not spoken to the intelligence community but i think the intelligence community should inform the rest of us who are running what they told senator sanders margaret brennan and there s no date for that to happen biden not that i m aware of margaret brennan but you re asking for it biden i think they should margaret brennan you should whe from what you re seeing you talked about facebook and them alerting you is that am i understanding you correctly biden well i i was told that that tho there are a lot of bots on facebook and they ve been all taken down and so there were margaret brennan fake accounts being run by the russians biden attacks on me fake accounts yes and they re taken down but i i don t know who i didn t get a call from facebook but i was told by my my staff that s what happened margaret brennan because i know you ve been critical of senator sanders for not being strong enough in his condemnation of some of the vitriolic sentiment online and senator sanders has come out with a statement saying and he said it on the debate stage as well that perhaps some of this may be fueled by the russians in other words biden well margaret brennan they re not actually his supporters do you buy that biden well look the people that occupied my office maybe they were russians i don t know but they they said they were bernie supporters the people who occupied other offices and the people who did these terrible things to the culinary workers and the women who run that operation i i guess anything s possible but they re identified as bernie supporters so i i m not making any comment beyond that but there should be absolute condemnation of the conduct of these folks who are engaging in that kind of behavior and the misogynistic behavior against the culinary workers and people coming into my office the police had to this was back in in in you know the first two primaries and have to call the police to get them out of our office i mean that that s trump like stuff i mean this is not the stuff that we ve done in democratic primaries before margaret brennan when he says the ugly stuff may be because of the russians sounds like you re saying no biden i don t know i ll let you make that judgment margaret brennan well all of us would like to know a little bit more about exactly what s happening but u s intelligence hasn t made any of this public yet white house isn t shedding much light but the bottom line seems to be that biden the white house is shedding light the president is angry because the intelligence community in fact informed bernie sanders and i guess others and members of the intelligence committee that in fact the russians want to see trump reelected and they like bernie margaret brennan we spoke to the national security adviser to the president who is denying that the white house was informed of the preference for trump but but you and i both know that in 2016 that was the intelligence community s clear biden all i know is margaret brennan assessment biden what i ve read and has been reported no one has confided in me i have no inside information margaret brennan but the bottom line is doesn t all of this shake the confidence of the american people to a certain extent in the in terms of the integrity of the election itself i mean this is biden that s margaret brennan right at the heart of american democracy biden i ve been saying this for over three years the president denies they re involved they ve been involved i was deeply involved in the intelligence apparatus and how it functioned before we left the vice presidency it was clear they were involved the president continues to deny their involvement it s overwhelming and the fact is that everybody knows except when the president stands before the whole world looks at vladimir putin says why would he want to interfere in our elections well 17 intelligence agencies told me told him he did so this is all this is bizarre this is bizarre this is continuing and what s happened why in god s name haven t we hardened the electoral process provided billions hundreds of millions of dollars to states to be able to harden their voter rolls make sure they can t be attacked by cyber security as a consequence of cyber attacks why haven t we provided the capacity for them to be able to have the money to have paper ballots in addition to that i mean this is this is outrageous and it s going on look i joined with the leaders of europe when the european elections took place back before i got involved i d be before i before i decided to run and we set up an organization that in fact said every european leader running in either party in any party would take a pledge margaret brennan mmhm biden that if you got any negative information about someone else from another from a foreign source you would not use it and if you got any information that they were trying to interfere you d report it i took margaret brennan have you asked your democratic colleagues biden that pledge margaret brennan to do that biden i ve said that on on stage i i you know i think we all should take that pledge i ve taken the pledge margaret brennan you were in office obviously in 2016 biden yep margaret brennan when all of this interference was first detected biden yes margaret brennan since that time a bipartisan senate intelligence committee finding faulted the obama administration for its response and said that the actions taken undermined public confidence in the election and allowed for further russian interference do you agree with these findings biden not at all margaret brennan that the administration fell short biden not at all look we went out and went to the committee went to the republican leadership and said look this is what we have i didn t but the intelligence community did this is what we have why don t you join us in condemning what s happening and the republican leader of senate said no i want no part of it joining in what is happening and everything that came up subsequently to that reinforced what we were saying was going on now the question was should the president have come along and said by the way this is happening and then it be viewed and accused of we were somehow margaret brennan right biden we alone were doing something margaret brennan but in hindsight you know where this story ends up biden well i margaret brennan do you biden but we didn t have the margaret brennan do you think are lessons for the current administration to learn biden look this administration is incapable of learning elections they like this come on let s be fair here they ve known this for a long time for three years every intelligence agency has told them they continue to be engaged in this activity every intelligence agency told me they were engaged before there is not any question anymore there s never been a question for the last three years and what s he doing zero what is the republican leadership in the united states senate and congress doing zero end vt margaretr brennan we ll have more of our interview with the former vice president in our next half hour we ll be back in one minute with national security advisor robert o brien commercial margaret brennan we re back with more of our interview with former vice president joe biden take vt margaret brennan let me ask you a little bit about a few other matters biden sure margaret brennan afghanistan biden yes margaret brennan there is a plan in place for a deal to be signed at the end of the month after this pause in violence or reduction in violence i remember when the obama administration sought a deal with the taliban the trump administration is now on the verge of signing one biden which we know nothing about look i opposed the surge in the first place number one i didn t think we should have even the troops we sent there now it s all been made public now that we should have the troops in the first place that we sent there and i didn t think we should have had the number of troops which is considerably less than the present this this president added i think we should only have troops there to make sure that it s impossible for the taliban and excuse me for isis or al qaeda to reestablish a foothold there to be able to go from afghanistan to the united states to attack the united states that requires a much smaller footprint but as i understand it we re not drawing down to a level that was even as low as it was when we left afghanistan margaret brennan about eighty six hundred is the number of troops biden and so we ll see i mean it s a little premature to make the judgment whether or not this is a good deal or not a good deal margaret brennan but as you just said in the course of your answer there you do think there should be some u s presence that remains biden yes a very small margaret brennan in afghanistan biden presence to be able to determine whether or not i mean a small footprint margaret brennan what does that look like for american biden looks like several thousand people to make sure that we have a place from which we can operate if in fact you find that there s a re amassing of taliban capacity excuse me of al qaeda and or isis capacity to strike the united states like happened in 9 11 margaret brennan the washington post quoted you this week in a story about afghanistan saying that back in 2010 you said to richard holbrooke the then envoy i m not sending my boy back there to risk his life on behalf of women s rights it just won t work not what we re there for is that how you remember it biden yeah margaret brennan or what did you mean biden what i meant was there s a thousand places we could go to deal with injustice i can think of 10 countries where women and or children and or people are being are being persecuted or being hurt but the idea of us going to be able to use our armed forces to solve every single internal problem that exists throughout the world is not within our capacity the question is is america s vital self interest at stake or the vital self interest of one of our allies at stake and the fact that they have a system in afghanistan as they do in parts of pakistan as they do in parts of other countries that we re going to send troops to because there is not a a human rights are not being valued to the same degree that we are that s a different story about sending combat troops we should call it out we should go to the united nations we should be saying this is what s happening we should try to shame and get the world to put pressure on an economic pressure on people who engage countries who engage in that but not send troops that s what i meant it is not sufficient that was my point and the idea was and i think richard had said something like well women are being abused there i said they re being abused in a lot of places around the world are we going to send our american forces all over the world to make sure that stops margaret brennan but then don t you bear some responsibility for the outcome if the taliban ends up back in control and women end up losing the rights biden no i don t look are you telling me that we should go into china because go to war with china because what they re doing to the uyghurs a million uyghurs in the out in the west in concentration camps is that what you re saying to me margaret brennan it was your quote sir i was asking you what you meant biden no i know i gave you my i gave the answer do i bear responsibility zero responsibility the responsibility i have is to protect america s na national self interest and not put our women and men in harm s way to try to solve every single problem in the world by use of force that s my responsibility as president and that s what i ll do as president margaret brennan alright mr vice president i m told we re wrapping here end vt margaret brennan we ll be right back with our political panel watch cbs news anytime anywhere
