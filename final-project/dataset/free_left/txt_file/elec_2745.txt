 this law should be a national standard newsom wrote underscoring his long standing push to position california as a model for anti trumpism a framing that has helped elevate newsom to a national figure getty images by jeremy b white 07 30 2019 01 56 pm edt updated 07 30 2019 02 19 pm edt california gov gavin newsom embraced a politically explosive and legally dubious attempt to pry loose president donald trump s tax returns on tuesday signing legislation that would boot trump from california primary ballots if he doesn t make his filings public for democrats who wield absolute control over sacramento the measure offered a chance to directly confront a president who is deeply unpopular among most california voters and for newsom to escalate his long standing feud with the president while distinguishing himself from gov jerry brown who vetoed a similar measure in 2017 advertisement newsom rarely hesitates to throw punches at trump habitually assailing the president on twitter as the california department of justice challenges the administration over dozens of policies before becoming governor newsom regularly called out trump for not disclosing his tax returns and insinuated that trump was hiding damaging information signaling that a lawsuit was likely forthcoming counsel to the president jay sekulow said in an email that the state of california s attempt to circumvent the constitution will be answered in court trump has sued to rebuff house democrats who are subpoenaing his tax returns and challenged new york officials who enacted a law that could expose the president s financial records and newsom s signature could push his already contentious relationship with trump into volatile new territory potentially imperiling california s relationship with washington in his signing message newsom wrote that in extraordinary times state officials have a legal and moral duty to do everything in their power to ensure leaders seeking the highest offices meet minimal standards and to restore public confidence this law should be a national standard newsom wrote underscoring his long standing push to position california as a model for anti trumpism a framing that has helped elevate newsom to a national figure the logic underpinning newsom s argument was consistent with the governor s repeated comments in past years that public transparency compels trump to release his tax returns he repeatedly suggested that trump was hiding damaging information writing that trump s finances are a house of cards and by signing the bill newsom broke with his predecessor brown who vetoed a similar bill in 2017 warning then of constitutional hurdles and the risk of escalating a political conflict while brown displayed ample enmity toward trump particularly over the administration s approach to climate change he was seen as more cautious and moderate than newsom trump campaign official tim murtaugh said in an email that the law was unconstitutional and he echoed brown s warning that states could now be inspired to try and pile on additional requirements like forcing candidates to release health records the constitution is clear on the qualifications for someone to serve as president and states cannot add additional requirements on their own murtaugh said the bill also violates the first amendment right of association since california can t tell political parties which candidates their members can or cannot vote for in a primary election while the bill sailed through california s democratic dominated legislature with little friction it spurred an angry response from marginalized california republicans who accused their counterparts of ginning up conflict california republican party chairwoman jessica millan patterson excoriated newsom in a statement calling the law clearly unconstitutional trump is exceedingly unlikely to win california s 55 electoral votes regardless given his abysmal numbers here but democratic critics of the bill have warned it could galvanize republicans as they seek to reclaim some of the seven house seats democrats flipped in 2020 national republican groups quickly seized on newsom s signature tuesday governor newsom and the california state legislature will have to answer for trying to deny voting rights to the millions of californians who support president trump and wish to vote for him in the primary rnc national press secretary blair ellis said in a statement in remarks to politico last week newsom said that he had received a number of opinions saying it s absolutely constitutional nodding at the likelihood of a court fight newsom included in his signing statement quotes from legal experts constitutional scholar and uc berkeley school of law dean erwin chemerinsky opined that the measure would pass legal muster it does not keep any candidate from being on the ballot so long as he or she complies with a simple requirement that is meant to provide california voters crucial information chemerinsky said modeling the disclosure he seeks from trump and others newsom released tax information as he ran for governor last year showing more transparency than brown who rebuffed
