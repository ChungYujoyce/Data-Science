they re entitled to see any more of the special counsel s report he told cbs news chief washington correspondent major garrett in a wide ranging interview for the takeout podcast this week mulvaney also weighed in on venezuela north korea and took a jab at a recent entrant to the 2020 democratic presidential primary here are some of the highlights mulvaney said that congress will never get to see president trump s tax returns despite efforts by house democrats to subpoena the information they re not entitled to see them by law mulvaney told garrett treasury secretary steven mnuchinwrote in a lettermonday that the treasury departmentwould not release mr trump s tax returnsto house ways and means committee chairman richard neal neal citing a statute that gives the chairman of house ways and means the authority to obtain any individual s tax return had demanded six years of mr trump s taxes mulvaney called efforts to obtain the tax returns a pure show pony type of situation and said that house democrats were just trying to embarrass the president what s embarrassing about his tax records garrett pressed mulvaney that s what they want to know mulvaney said adding that he didn t know if there was any embarrassing information in mr trump s returns because he had not seen them i don t care and more importantly voters don t care keep in mind everybody knew everybody who cared knew that the president didn t produce his tax records before the election and they voted for him anyway mulvaney continued so from a political perspective this debate is over the democrats are trying to continue that political conversation and there s no reason to do it mulvaney also addressed other pressing issues like thesenate intelligence committee s subpoena of donald trump jr the committee is chaired by republican sen richard burr for the senate intelligence committee to subpoena mr trump s son and not at least get a heads up i thought was let s say bad form mulvaney said he said he did not know whether the president was also caught by surprise mulvaney said that congress is also not entitled to see the full report by special counsel robert mueller countering democrats argument that they have the right to see the unredacted report in order to conduct their constitutional duty of congressional oversight the mueller report was lightly redacted in the first place and redacted for reasons that everybody agrees are the right reasons to redact it mulvaney told cbs news chief washington correspondent major garrett on this week s episode of the takeout podcast the justice department has offered to allow a few members of congress to view a less redacted version of the report under the condition that these members do not speak with their colleagues about the report democrats consider this offer unfair i m not sure how they find it insufficient it s everything that there is mulvaney said in response to democrats complaints they are not the department of justice they do have a they do have a right by the way it s not in the constitution it s been implied in the constitution by the supreme court to have some oversight but that oversight should not be understood mulvaney argued as congress role to second guess the department of justice or supplement their decision for the decision of the attorney general he added they are not the executive branch of government they are there to make law and their oversight is supposed to be related to their process of making law and that s not what happened that s not what s happening right now mulvaney discussed foreign policy as well including american opposition to the leadership of venezuelan president nicol s maduro the u s has recognized juan guaid president of the national assembly as interim president of venezuela though maduro s government remains in place mulvaney said that the u s will not intervene to ensure that guaid becomes president i don t think we re going to take affirmative action to make him become the leader we re going to continue to back him is it moving slower than some people thought that it might perhaps but that doesn t mean that thing are over by any means down there mulvaney said mulvaney also said that despite escalating tensions between the u s and iran the two countries are not on the brink of war the u s imposed more sanctions on iran this week the department of defense also announced monday that anaircraft carrier strike group and air force bomberswould be sent to the persian gulf in response to recent and clear indications that iranian and iranian proxy forces were making preparations to possibly attack u s forces in the region we have specific interests in the region we have troops for example in iraq we have good allies in saudi arabia and the uae and bahrain we have military assets there to protect we have interests in the region mulvaney said about the strike group headed to the persian gulf we are not going to war with iran mulvaney said mulvaney said that the u s will likely impose increased tariffs on china as the two parties are at an impasse in trade negotiations the president said that there would be and we re not making enough progress we re making some but not enough mulvaney said about imposing the tariffs amid stalled negotiations the white house chief of staff also took aim at a frequent target of mr trump former vice president joe biden one of the democrats running for president mulvaney said that the presidency is a harder job than biden knows he ran for vice president i mean mike pence ll tell you there s a difference between running for vice president and running for president you sort of come in at the end and you give the big speeches after the guys are already nominated right but when you re out there on the trail every single day knocking on doors i ve done it and it is really really hard work mulvaney said for more of major s wide ranging conversation with mick mulvaney including his assertions that the white house exerted executive privilege on mueller documents because congress is not entitled to the information and that the u s will not go war with iran download the takeout
