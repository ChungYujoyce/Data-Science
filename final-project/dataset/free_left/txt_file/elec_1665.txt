advertisement supported by by amy chozick senator bernie sanders routed hillary clinton in all three democratic presidential contests on saturday infusing his underdog campaign with critical momentum and bolstering his argument that the race for the nomination is not a foregone conclusion mr sanders found a welcome tableau in the largely white and liberal electorates of the pacific northwest where just days after resoundingly beating mrs clinton in idaho he repeated the feat in the washington caucuses winning 73 percent of the vote he did even better in alaska winning 82 percent of the vote and in hawaii he had 71 percent with a few precincts still be counted according to the associated press washington the largest prize saturday with 101 delegates in play was a vital state for mr sanders whose prospects of capturing the nomination dimmed after double digit losses to mrs clinton across the south and weak showings in delegate rich ohio florida and north carolina this month as of saturday evening mrs clinton had roughly 280 more pledged delegates who are awarded based on voting and 440 more superdelegates party leaders and elected officials than mr sanders at a rally in madison wis late saturday afternoon mr sanders assured supporters that his victories had cleared a viable path to the nomination we knew from day one that politically we were going to have a hard time in the deep south mr sanders said but we knew things were going to improve when we headed west noting the huge voter turnout in washington party officials estimated more than 200 000 people participated on saturday close to the record set in 2008 he told the crowd we are making significant inroads into secretary clinton s lead the victories on saturday only slightly narrowed the gulf with mrs clinton in the quest for the 2 382 delegates needed to clinch the democratic nomination but the wins are likely to bestow on the sanders campaign a surge of online donations with which to buy advertising in the expensive media markets of new york and pennsylvania which hold primaries next month the victory will also embolden mr sanders to stay in the race and continue challenging mrs clinton on her ties to wall street and her foreign policy record republicans did not hold any contests on saturday the next nominating battle for both parties will be the april 5 primaries in wisconsin followed by the april 9 democratic caucuses in wyoming another contest that plays to mr sanders s strengths his victories on saturday were not unexpected all three states have relatively low percentages of the black and the latino voters who have bolstered mrs clinton s campaign and washington and alaska held caucuses the type of voting in which he has done well yet the results also highlighted the uphill climb mrs clinton would face in winning over the young and liberal voters who have flocked to the vermont senator and who often express concerns about her fund raising and speechmaking practices on saturday morning the auditorium at eckstein middle school in north seattle burst with more than 1 400 caucusgoers holding lattes pushing strollers and wearing h or bernie lapel pins bleachers were set up onstage to accommodate the crowd this is what democracy looks like janet miller the caucus organizer said from the auditorium s stage mr sanders won that precinct on saturday and many others i appreciate bernie s fervor and honesty said ian forrester 25 a barista and rock musician who caucused for mr sanders we ve all seen the poor and the middle class suffer during this economic downfall and we need someone who cares about them not about corporations the sanders campaign blanketed washington with 1 million in ads mr sanders found a sweet spot of support among seattle s young voters a video clip of his rally on friday just over the state line in portland ore went viral after a delicate songbird perched on his podium inspiring the twitter hashtag birdiesanders i think there may be some symbolism here mr sanders said to a roar of applause mrs clinton will have a chance to regain momentum and a wash of delegates when the democratic primary moves to her adoptive home state new york on april 19 her national campaign headquarters is in brooklyn on saturday mr sanders opened an office in the borough s gowanus neighborhood just a few miles from where he grew up lately on the campaign trail mrs clinton bracing for some losses in the caucus states seemed to have grown annoyed by the commentary from political rivals that mr sanders s campaign has drawn far more enthusiastic supporters i totally respect the passion of my opponent s supporters absolutely respect it mrs clinton said while campaigning on tuesday in washington and here s what i want you to know she continued i have as of now gotten more votes than anybody else including donald trump i have gotten 2 6 million more votes than bernie sanders and have a bigger lead in pledged delegates the ones you win from people voting than barack obama had at this time in 2008 mrs clinton has shifted her focus and her words to taking on the republicans in november but given mr sanders s influence over liberal voters she would need in a general election she has been cautious how she discusses domestic and foreign policy with mr sanders s focus on income inequality and taking on wall street mrs clinton has continued to reach out to working class voters including holding a rally on tuesday at a machinists and aerospace workers union hall at the boeing factory in everett wash i was made an honorary machinist some years ago so i feel a particular connection here to my brothers and sisters in the machinists she told the crowd i am no person new to this struggle i am not the latest flavor of the month i have been doing this work day in and day out for years she also knocked mr sanders for not supporting the export import bank the government backed agency that provides low interest loans to help companies doing international business like boeing and which mr sanders and some republicans including senator ted cruz of texas have opposed as corporate welfare and as mrs clinton sought to demonstrate her toughness and preparedness to be commander in chief in response to the terrorist attacks on tuesday in brussels she also had to avoid inflaming liberal primary voters who still associate her with her 2002 senate vote to authorize the iraq war on wednesday mrs clinton said the responses to the brussels attacks by the leading republican candidates donald j trump and mr cruz amounted to reckless actions that would alienate american allies demonize muslims and embolden russia mr sanders ran an emotional 90 second ad in hawaii called the cost of war featuring representative tulsi gabbard a veteran from hawaii who reminded viewers that mr sanders voted against the iraq war bernie sanders will defend our country and take the trillions of dollars that are spent on these interventionist regime change unnecessary wars and invest it here at home an impassioned ms gabbard said against scenic views of hawaii foreign policy was what motivated warren jones 65 a retired software engineer to caucus for mr sanders on saturday in seattle she was wrong on iraq and proved she didn t learn from that experience but was wrong on libya too mr jones said i think in large part she is responsible for isis though there s plenty of blame to go around advertisement
