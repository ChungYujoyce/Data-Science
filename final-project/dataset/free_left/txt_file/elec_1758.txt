advertisement supported by voters in the populous heavily republican suburbs west of milwaukee did not entirely embrace donald trump in 2016 they do now by sabrina tavernise waukesha wis the moment president trump was acquitted in the senate this week judy ryan was licking a blueberry ice cream cone in the brookfield square shopping mall and feeling happy ms ryan 74 a retired factory worker had followed the impeachment trial almost every day the more democrats attacked mr trump the more protective she felt and the more hopeful she was that he would be re elected they just pushed him right back into the presidency she said wiping the corner of her mouth with a napkin he should say thank you to all of them for the help the third impeachment trial in american history ended on wednesday not with a bang but with a whimper but here in waukesha county a patchwork of suburbs small cities and rural areas west of milwaukee that holds more republican votes than any other county in this crucial swing state there was a nervous excitement yard signs have been flying off the shelves in the county republican party s headquarters in a strip mall near a vegan food supply store more than 150 people showed up for a state of the union watch party on tuesday night applauding and cheering in a giant hall and volunteers like diane schlosser a 63 year old homemaker have been walking in off the street to sign up we got tired of yelling at the tv she said cleaning up plates of pretzels and bags of popcorn after tuesday s party the path to the presidency runs through wisconsin one of the three key industrial states along with pennsylvania and michigan that flipped by narrow margins and gave mr trump the presidency in 2016 mr trump won the state by fewer than 23 000 votes setting up a battle of inches in this year s presidential race suburban places like waukesha will be key this year in wisconsin and nationwide but though many are trending toward the democrats that is hardly universal these suburbs west of milwaukee are less white and more educated than they used to be but over all they have changed much more slowly than suburbs in states like virginia georgia and arizona demographically wisconsin is more like ohio and missouri whiter older and less educated than the national average and that has tended to tilt the advantage to republicans said david wasserman an editor at the cook political report still the democratic counties of milwaukee and dane which contains madison are the most densely populated in the state limp turnout for mr trump in republican counties could tip the balance for the democrats in the 2018 midterms an energized democratic base turned out in large numbers to lift tammy baldwin to victory over her pro trump republican rival for a united states senate seat and elect a democrat tony evers as governor you can t have a meeting with a group of democrats in wisconsin without someone at some point nervously joking no pressure said ben wikler chair of the democratic party of wisconsin door knocking was expected to happen in 100 places this weekend he said including 15 in the milwaukee suburbs he said impeachment never comes up republicans in wisconsin did not immediately warm to mr trump he came in a distant second behind senator ted cruz of texas in the 2016 primary he has particularly struggled in waukesha county mr trump did worse in the general election here than mitt romney in 2012 and than ron johnson wisconsin s senior senator in 2016 but in about two dozen interviews over three days many republicans said that while they voted for mr trump reluctantly in 2016 they no longer felt hesitant they pointed to the booming economy mr trump s judicial appointments and the conservative stances he has adopted on cultural issues they also brought up the actions of democrats he s from new york and i thought nothing good could come out of new york said marge ingold a retired business owner who voted for mr cruz in the primary she is now a firm trump supporter he believes what we believe she said he is standing up for the people impeachment she said was simply the most recent installment of a long effort to take down mr trump the pressure he s been under has just been horrendous she said it just made the people move cohesively behind him robert dohnal a longtime conservative activist in wisconsin compared impeachment to sports it s like if your team in football is getting bad calls from the referees and you are just getting madder and madder it puts more fight in the belly impeachment has a special meaning in wisconsin one of three states that have had recall elections for governor and the only one in which the governor was not defeated the governor at the time scott walker won the largest share of votes of any of his elections during the 2012 effort to remove him political analysts saw parallels with the 2020 vote in an odd way this helps the president at least in wisconsin said james wigderson editor of rightwisconsin a conservative website based in waukesha talking to people listening to talk radio judging from our readers this is re energizing them impeachment also seemed to help nudge moderate republicans who were never fans of mr trump in his direction this really pulled a lot of republicans off the fence mr wigderson said of moderates now it s you ve gone too far and we are going to defend this guy to the end matthew sama 27 a mortgage loan officer who grew up in the milwaukee suburbs said he disliked mr trump so much that he voted for a third party candidate in 2016 the more he started to talk the more i became repulsed by what he was turning the republican party into mr sama said since then he has shifted he likes the deregulation the tax cut and the fact that mr trump has not started a war he is still apprehensive about mr trump but he has decided to vote for him for these policies and as a way to stop the democratic party i was like come on this is ridiculous he s not smart enough to be able to collude with another country he said the democrats have gone so far from reality and they are coming across as so unreasonable that it makes it look like they are out to get him wisconsin s suburbs have grown less white and more educated but the change has been slow and at least so far less important for its politics than a stark and relatively sudden political shift among white men without a college degree said charles franklin director of the marquette law school poll in 2012 when he started polling those men were about 5 points more likely to identify as republican than democrat now they are 18 points more likely to call themselves republican while other more educated groups have not changed much that has erased the slight advantage democrats used to enjoy in the state mr franklin said making it a dead heat charlie sykes a former editor of rightwisconsin who broke with the republican party over mr trump said the question was not whether mr trump would win in waukesha county but by how much margins are incredibly close and if republican moderates fail to support mr trump here or in milwaukee county where he received his second highest vote tally among wisconsin counties in 2016 he might not have enough to counter democrats in urban areas the democratic nominee is important too if it is bernie sanders they d be saying yes donald trump is toxic but i m sorry we are out of this if you are going full socialism mr sykes said in a sign the parties are fighting over every vote the milwaukee county republican party announced thursday it was opening a field office in downtown milwaukee deep in democratic territory dissident republican voices are getting harder to find every once in a while i get an email from someone who says thank goodness you are still criticizing trump for his behavior said mr wigderson who airs views critical of mr trump on his website but those emails are coming in less and less opinions in wisconsin on impeachment have been dug in and virtually unchanged since the investigation began last fall mr franklin said the one difference is that republicans have been more unified in their opposition than democrats have been in their support by more than 10 percentage points in november and december jeremy carpenter 31 who works for a republican state lawmaker said he was so turned off by mr trump at first that he voted for evan mcmullin an independent in 2016 he said he was still not a fan of mr trump s style but he has gradually decided that many of his policies his nomination of conservative judges his support of the anti abortion movement his stance on trade and foreign policy outweigh the negatives those things were wrong they do not match up to what i believe about my christian faith mr carpenter said of mr trump s divorces and language about women but on the other hand he has done some very good things as president if you can balance those then you can accept who donald trump is without selling your soul down the river and in a side by side comparison with a democrat mr trump looks even better yes trump has glaring weaknesses mr carpenter said but bernie is a self admitted socialist and that s a huge problem in my book on balance he said donald trump checks the most boxes for me it makes sense to give him another four years updated may
