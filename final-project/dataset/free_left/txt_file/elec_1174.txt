 2016 a scare in iowa and a crushing loss in new hampshire drove her to shake up her strategy and trust her advisers by glenn thrush and annie karni 03 03 2016 05 14 am est hillary clinton arrives for a rally feb 25 2016 in myrtle beach south carolina getty on the eve of her 22 point loss to bernie sanders in new hampshire hillary clinton had been fretting about her strategy questioning her staffing choices and generally flash backing on her 2008 defeat it was at this point however that the once and future democratic front runner huddled with her aide de camp huma abedin and decided to make a statement that this time would indeed be different advertisement as her staff digested the rotten news on primary day from their digs at the ratty radisson in downtown manchester aides were told to cancel their commercial flights back to new york clinton had traded up her small corporate plane for a bigger regional jet and she was offering 25 of them a ride home misery would have company when the staff trudged up the steps in the chill they were surprised to find bill and hillary clinton tired but smiling at the hatch to offer hugs handshakes solace and offerings of i appreciate what you did according to three people who were on the night flight hillary clinton is not the most talented candidate in the 2016 race she isn t the most electrifying speaker and with bernie sanders massive online donor operation she can t even stake claim to being the best funded democrat in the field he outraised her by about 10 million last month but the past month has proved she is the toughest and most resilient candidate in the field for all her flaws clinton has overcome early stumbles to dominate sanders on super tuesday and she s started to gently ease him into the fold even as the gop descends into political mogadishu the key to clinton s resurgence and her game changing nevada and south carolina wins was the issue of race after new hampshire she embraced a crusade against racial discrimination that energized black voters unclogged the campaign s collective writer s block on messaging reconnected with black voters and reactivated the old hillaryland network of female friends many of whom are african american women big challenges loom for clinton the intensifying federal probe into her use of a private email server as secretary of state poses perhaps the most lethal threat but she s already overcome a lot in 2016 and the 30 days between new hampshire and super tuesday are likely to be remembered as a key turning point in her quest for the presidency it was a time when clinton finally learned the most important lessons of her loss in 2008 according to a dozen clinton insiders politico interviewed for this story don t panic trust your team even when you think they screwed up and stick with the plan she just got back to work says her campaign chairman john podesta who served as bill clinton s white house chief of staff in the 1990s of the candidate s post new hampshire approach the thing that sets her apart from everybody else is her capacity to just get back up after new hampshire she didn t just take the loss or get all down it s something people have always said about her but this whole experience really proved the point what grit she has it s easier to have grit when you have the electoral map in your favor as clinton does this time around and an opponent whose inspiration quotient may be high but not in barack obama s class this one is going to work out just fine for her says david plouffe obama s 2008 campaign manager who now serves as an informal adviser to campaign manager robby mook and other campaign officials by rachael bade and josh gerstein iowa a very close win bernie wins new hampshire and i think there must have been a sense of oh here we go again plouffe added but they ve stabilized i think on the morning of march 16 she will be able to look back and say you know what my team weathered the storm the strategy worked and that s how you build trust and you go through something like that you re just more likely to trust the team the next time you have a moment of trial or tribulation for clinton tribulation has never been in short supply and her 0 2 percentage point victory in iowa a month ago set off the usual internal recriminations and fingerpointing post iowa clinton expressed resentment at senior staff for failing to adequately recognize the threats posed by sanders a 74 year old democratic socialist with a negligible national following a year ago and implored her team to hit him harder why don t we have a plan she asked a friend in frustration a few days before the new hampshire wipeout and both clintons were growing increasingly anxious that the team wasn t coming up with a message to compete with sanders brutally simple crusade against economic inequality but the beginnings of her reboot began to take shape even before she left mean old manchester the first step was clearing the candidate s head knowing their friend was feeling down clinton s support network 25 to 30 women who have known her for decades sprang into action the chipper email chain had begun in iowa but really kicked into gear when it became apparent clinton would be humbled in new hampshire there was no formal effort to soothe the easily agitated front runner but her friends talk among themselves and they urged calm and reminded clinton they had her back later they even made trucker hats akin to donald trump s make america great again emblazoned with the slogan h team on them all the support in the world couldn t shield clinton from the magnitude of the dispiriting new hampshire loss and she mused about accelerating a staff review that had been planned for the spring yet when a politico story popped on the eve of the primary she ordered her staff to knock it down even though it was true and pivoted to a comprehensive rewrite of her messaging strategy according to people close to clinton to brace the troops for the carnage to come campaign manager robby mook warned his staff on a conference call to prepare for the most emotionally draining stretch of the campaign and to stay focused if possible he suggested avoid cable news completely for two days policy director jake sullivan and speechwriter dan schwerin holed up in a 12th floor room in the radisson in hopes of retooling her pragmatic populist message and give her a fresh start in nevada the vehicle for the shift was her new hampshire concession speech and it contained a gumbo of different themes including the campaign s pollster and strategist joel benenson s favorite message that clinton would crusade against corporate greed an extension of benenson s messaging against mitt romney as a top adviser to obama in 2012 at its center however was a more compact anti sanders argument that labeled him a single issue candidate so focused on wall street that he discounted the underlying impact of prejudice based on race gender class and sexual orientation by gabriel debenedetti we have to break through the barriers of bigotry clinton told her audience african american parents shouldn t have to worry that their children will be harassed humiliated even shot because of the color of their skin immigrant families shouldn t have to lie awake at night listening for a knock on the door a president has to do all parts of the job we need to break down those barriers the speech buoyed morale but the big worry that surfaced in the candidate s conversations with staff was one of momentum would sanders substantially erode her big leads in the super tuesday states the internal data showed the vermont senator making gains especially in nevada but the good news was that there seemed to be a rising tide not a wave in nevada the onetime western firewall that had begun to crumble clinton focused on hispanic voters but even here her eye was on african americans who make up 15 percent of the state s voting population and the campaign deployed surrogates like rep hakeem jeffries d n y to question sanders record on race clinton met with civil rights leaders and delivered a high impact speech in harlem on systemic racism the approach helped her in nevada but clinton factoring in a possible loss in the desert was now viewing south carolina on feb 27 as her ultimate backstop even now the clintons were nervous about their staff s performance and distrusted their own internal polling predicting a 2 to 3 point win in nevada this was the critical moment for clinton a real make or break moment and emotions ran high among local staff who felt the immense pressure of saving an entire candidacy the day before the caucuses rattled campaign operatives said they expected to pull out a victory by a hair but they also said they would not be surprised if sanders beat them by up to 5 points they weren t the only ones in limbo the campaign s brooklyn based communications director jennifer palmieri flew to las vegas in case she was needed to spin a loss to reporters on a charter plane to houston that night but here too aides say clinton exhibited a level head and made a show of confidence in her people as she had that night in new hampshire after the caucuses ended and clinton had scored a far better than expected 5 plus point victory the candidate made a point of bringing her state director emmy ruiz onstage ruiz was nervous she had never spoken in front of such a large crowd but the candidate was insistent people need to hear from my captain clinton said of ruiz an important vote of confidence to her close knit nevada team if nevada was a nail biter south carolina was all about putting a hammer to sanders who invested heavily in the state with more than 200 staffers and close to 2 million in ads despite polling that showed him losing by 20 plus points overall here was a chance not just for victory but personal redemption obama had decimated clinton in south carolina by 28 points eight years earlier and worse bill clinton who had forged a unique bond with black voters since his days of campaigning in southeast arkansas melted down when obama surrogates suggested he wasn t showing the first serious african american presidential contender adequate respect clinton s embrace of obama starting with his rousing explainer in chief speech at the 2012 democratic convention in charlotte had banished much of the bad blood and the former president who had lashed out at reporters for fanning the racial flames in 2008 kibbitzed with them on the rope lines declaring himself to be back home his wife enjoyed an even more committed support network cheryl mills a publicity shy d c power player who found herself in the middle of clinton s state department email controversy rented a chevy and took a group of the candidate s friends on a door knocking road trip around the state chowing down on chick fil a sandwiches and dunkin donuts coffee as they went cheryl was our driver said minyon moore a longtime clinton adviser and veteran democratic consultant we had just a gps and some walk sheets and no campaign staff she said of canvassing in south carolina when asked why she did it moore said we see her we identify with the fact that when you re a trailblazer it s not always fun in our own small way we are saying collectively that as women we hear her the hillaryland crew that came out to support clinton in south carolina included marva smalls a board member of clinton s super pac priorities usa and a 2008 campaign aide ann walker marchant who worked in the clinton white house and is a niece of power broker vernon jordan and a cousin of valerie jarrett alexis herman former labor secretary under bill clinton cheryl benton a longtime clinton aide who worked for her at the state department and on her 2008 campaign capricia marshall a loyal adviser since clinton s days as first lady longtime supporter judy byrd a friend and fundraiser since clinton s days in the senate andrea mccoy who works for south carolina state sen darrell jackson and has been a longtime clinton supporter and friend kiki mcclean a senior adviser to clinton s 2008 bid longtime spokeswoman karen finney who still works on the campaign and maya harris a current campaign policy adviser described as the newest member of the band by gabriel debenedetti clinton didn t know the entire group had made the trip for her at an impromptu reunion just before her victory rally in columbia attendees said she was overwhelmed by the unexpected show of support it was almost kind of breathtaking said moore who spent the rest of the night with other hillarylanders watching the election returns in clinton s hotel suite when she saw us all as a group she was like oh my god she was really happy to see us yet for all the feel good vibe in south carolina clinton s juggernaut will be remembered as one of the biggest political routs in recent history a stunning 48 point victory enabled by her campaign s steely methodical dismantling of sanders core argument to the party s base as far back as iowa clinton was looking past the caucuses to appeal to black voters homing in on issues that undermined sanders support with african americans who would play a huge role in south carolina and super tuesday initially clinton focused on sanders gun votes campaigning with the black mothers of children who had died on the streets even in predominantly white towns like iowa city it was sanders respectful but unmistakable distancing from obama and his policies that gave her the opening she needed to turn the race around though in debates and on the trail clinton portrayed his career long push for single payer government subsidized health care as an attack on obamacare the first black president s biggest achievement and she took advantage of sanders propensity for impolitic truth telling you know hillary clinton now is trying to embrace the president as closely as she possibly can everything the president does is wonderful she loves the president he loves her and all that stuff the vermont senator said mockingly in an interview with bet the day before south carolinians went to the polls and we know what that s about that s trying to win support from the african american community where the president is enormously popular there may have been some truth in that comment but it was a serious unforced error and clinton pounced saying that sanders was accusing obama of failed leadership clinton won black voters in the state by an unprecedented 86 to 14 percent margin and she won african americans in the super tuesday states of alabama georgia tennessee texas and virginia by comparable margins but her approach to beating sanders while rooted in race has a larger purpose her advisers say while clinton is still struggling mightily with younger voters she is gaining ground with white progressives her aides think it s because her barriers message which incorporates an anti wall street component appeals more broadly to progressives because it taps into democrats deeper sense of their party as bulwark against prejudice bigotry and economic unfairness winning helps too and clinton at this particular moment in an uncommonly turbulent political life is enjoying genuine momentum and with it a measure of peace how long it will last no one knows the bottom line said one longtime clinton friend is she never lost her sh and now she s going to win missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the latest news
