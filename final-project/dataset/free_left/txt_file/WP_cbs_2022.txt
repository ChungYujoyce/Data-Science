the head of the u s central banking system tells scott pelley how high he thinks unemployment will go what tools the fed still has to breathe life into the economy and what outcomes he s trying to avoid on the road to economic recovery jerome powell shook washington wall street and the world this past week when he warned the pandemic crisis threatens lasting damage to american prosperity as chairman of the federal reserve powell is among the most powerful people in the economy he acted swiftly in the sharpest collapse since the great depression but he fears congress s initial 3 trillion bailout will not be enough to save a generation from low growth and stagnant incomes we asked chairman powell how high unemployment will go and how long it will take to see a recovery he spoke to us this past wednesday after a blunt speech that gave markets a shove scott pelley mr chairman i just got a push notification on my phone dow tanks more than 500 points in wall street sell off after fed chair warns economic recovery will be prolonged and bumpy you knew that was coming jerome powell i ve been watching the markets truth is the markets have been watching him his speech wednesday was a warning and a prayer he raised the specter of a prolonged recession and weak recovery if the federal government doesn t use all its power to support business and workers jerome powell i was really calling out a risk that i think is an important one for people to be cognizant of the risk of longer run damage to the economy and really the good news is that we have the tools to limit that longer run damage by continuing to provide support to households and businesses as we get through this scott pelley what metrics are you looking at here hour by hour day to day to divine what the future is going to be jerome powell the thing that matters more than anything else is the medical metrics frankly it s the spread of the virus the real time economic data that we re seeing is just a function of how successful the social distancing measures are so the data we ll see for this quarter which ends in june will be very very bad there ll be a you know big decline in economic activity big increase in unemployment so what we re really looking at is getting the medical data which is not what we usually look at taken care of so that the economic data can start to recover congress has already spent 3 trillion on relief but another 3 trillion passed friday by house democrats is a dead letter in the senate amid a partisan debate over how much to borrow donald trump we re in no rush we re in no rush talk of slowing the economic response is among the reasons powell is speaking tonight he s a republican appointed by president trump jerome powell congress has done a great deal and done it very quickly there is no precedent in post world war ii american history that s even close to what congress has done and the question is will it be enough and i don t think we know the answer to that it may well be that the fed has to do more it may be that congress has to do more scott pelley as this period of time grows longer what begins to happen to the economy jerome powell there s a real risk that if people are out of work for long periods of time that their skills atrophy a little bit and they lose contact with the workforce longer and deeper recessions tend to leave behind damage to people s careers the small and medium size businesses that are so important to this country if they have to go through a wave of avoidable insolvencies you have you ve lost something there that s more than just a few businesses you know it s really the job creation machine keeping people and businesses out of insolvency just for maybe three or six more months while the health authorities do what they can do we can buy time with that scott pelley i was speaking to a former official of the federal reserve who said v shape recovery off the table there s no chance jerome powell well i would say the main thing is to get back on the road to recovery and i think that can happen relatively soon likely to happen in the second half of the year that s a reasonable expectation after that the path is going to depend on a range of things it s very plausible that the economy will take some time to gather momentum we spoke to powell in the federal reserve boardroom the washington headquarters was otherwise silent its staff working from home the building dedicated in 1937 by fdr was itself a depression era project to create construction jobs the fed is the source of all u s currency and it regulates the economy by setting interest rates in the depression it was given vast power to lend money in an emergency it used that authority for the first time in the 2008 collapse and for the second time nine weeks ago scott pelley has the fed done all it can do jerome powell well there is a lot more we can do we re not out of ammunition by a long shot no there s there s really no limit to what we can do with these lending programs that we have in march as the dow collapsed 8 000 points and credit markets began to freeze powell called an emergency meeting on a sunday he cut interest rates to near zero and in partnership with the treasury the federal reserve offered more than 3 trillion in lending to banks businesses cities and states with that assurance the credit markets essential to daily business began to function again scott pelley fair to say you simply flooded the system with money jerome powell yes we did that s another way to think about it we did scott pelley where does it come from do you just print it jerome powell we print it digitally so we you know we as a central bank we have the ability to create money digitally and we do that by buying treasury bills or bonds or other government guaranteed securities and that actually increases the money supply we also print actual currency and we distribute that through the federal reserve banks but by law chairman powell s federal reserve can only lend money that must be paid back congress he believes should spend money to expand its historic bailout after all he says this emergency is nothing like 2008 jerome powell this is not because there was some inherent problem a housing bubble or something like that or the financial system in trouble nothing like that the economy was fine the financial system was fine we re doing this to protect ourselves from the virus and that means that when the virus outbreak is behind us the economy should be able to recover substantially scott pelley and what sort of support in your view do you think the congress would want to consider jerome powell i don t give them advice on particular policies but i would say if i may that policies that that help businesses avoid avoidable insolvencies and that do the same for individuals keep workers in their homes keep them paying their bills keep families solvent among the options extending the increase in unemployment benefits which expires in july and supporting local governments which are struggling with a collapse in tax revenue powell believes trillions in additional federal debt could be paid down over decades jerome powell the u s has been spending more than it s been taking in for some time and that s something we re going to have to deal with the time to do that is when the economy is strong when unemployment is low when economic activity is high that s when you deal with that problem this is not the time to prioritize that concern we have the ability to borrow at low rates we have the ability to service that debt and i would say this is the time when we can use that strength to our longer run benefit scott pelley what economic reality do the american people need to be prepared for jerome powell well i would take a more optimistic cut at that if i could and that is this is a time of great suffering and difficulty and it s come on us so quickly and with such force that you really can t put into words the pain people are feeling and the uncertainty they re realizing and it s going to take a while for us to get back but i would just say this in the in the long run and even in the medium run you wouldn t want to bet against the american economy this economy will recover it may take a while it may take a period of time it could stretch through the end of next year we really don t know scott pelley can there be a recovery without a reasonably effective vaccine jerome powell assuming there s not a second wave of the coronavirus i think you ll see the economy recover steadily through the second half of this year so for the economy to fully recover people will have to be fully confident and that may have to await the arrival of a vaccine if an effective vaccine arrives millions of doses are likely well over a year away this month president trump pressed states to reopen without a vaccine or adequate testing donald trump well i feel about vaccines like i feel about tests this is going to go away without a vaccine it s going to go away and it s we re not going to see it again hopefully after a period of time chairman powell says vaccine development is highly uncertain and until then major industries will suffer jerome powell the parts that involve people being in the same place very close together those parts of the economy will be challenged until people feel really safe again scott pelley sporting events theaters jerome powell i would think those would be very difficult scott pelley airlines jerome powell it ll be quite challenging for them lots of the rest of the economy though can move can move ahead but we can t fully recover because those other parts of the economy matter we can t fully recover though until people feel confident that they re safe scott pelley you are an enormous fan of the washington capitals when do you think you re going to be comfortable going back to a game jerome powell certainly no sooner than next season generally public sporting events public concerts and things like that those will be among the last things that can be resumed most states are taking early steps to reopen even though the u s lacks the testing capacity experts say is indispensable to success scott pelley if the economy reopens and the infection rate surges what then jerome powell the government would have to reintroduce the social distancing measures and you would have another downturn and that would be bad for confidence so that s a risk we really want to avoid you know the virus hasn t gone away the reason that cases have gone down and are declining is because people have been in their homes and not in their businesses and not out among crowds powell told us the economy will shrink dramatically in the second quarter april may and june at an annualized rate of around 30 this past week the labor department reported a total of more than 35 million americans had lost their jobs so far the unemployment rate will be historic scott pelley and your people are projecting what 20 25 jerome powell there re a range of perspectives but those are those numbers sound about right for what the peak may be scott pelley 25 is the estimated height of unemployment during the great depression do you think history will look back on this time and call this the second great depression jerome powell no i don t i don t think that s a likely outcome at all we had a very healthy economy two months ago our financial system is strong you have governments around the world and central banks around the world responding with great force and very quickly and staying at it so i think all of those things point to what will be it s going to be a very sharp downturn it should be a much shorter downturn than you would associate with the 1930s scott pelley you expect the third quarter to see growth jerome powell it s a reasonable expectation that there ll be growth in the second half of the year i would say though we re not going to get back to where we were quickly we won t get back to where we were by the end of the year that s unlikely to happen scott pelley in terms of the workforce mr chairman who is getting hurt the worst by this downturn jerome powell the people who re getting hurt the worst are the most recently hired the lowest paid people it s women to an extraordinary extent of the people who were working in february who were making less than 40 000 per year almost 40 have lost their jobs in the last month or so scott pelley what gives you hope in this dark time jerome powell we have highly industrious people we have the most dynamic economy in the world and you know we re the home of so much of the great technology in the world so in the long run i would say the u s economy will recover we ll get back to the place we were in february we ll get to an even better place than that i m highly confident of that so i think we re going to need to help each other through this and we will produced by
