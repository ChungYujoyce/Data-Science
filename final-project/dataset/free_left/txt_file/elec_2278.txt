advertisement supported by by matt flegenheimer and jonathan martin madison wis senator ted cruz of texas eyeing a victory here that could reshape the race for the republican presidential nomination has appeared most vexed by a rival he views as more of a long term nuisance than a short term threat gov john kasich of ohio as mr cruz looks beyond wisconsin where he is favored to defeat donald j trump on tuesday his frustrations with mr kasich have increasingly been laid bare with activists and operatives opposed to mr trump fanning out across the electoral map in a scramble to deny him the nomination mr cruz s team has argued that it is mr kasich s quixotic bid for the white house that will prove the biggest boon to mr trump in the states to come on monday mr cruz amplified calls for mr kasich to step aside and predicted that the people would quite rightly revolt if party leaders tried to elevate anyone other than mr cruz or mr trump at a contested convention in july mr cruz has begun airing ads in wisconsin accusing mr kasich of cronyism as ohio s governor he has sent mailers attacking mr kasich s record on spending and his views on the second amendment and his team has accused mr kasich of auditioning to be mr trump s vice president with some joking that he must be receiving some sort of payment the exasperation with mr kasich has been long in the making but as mr trump stumbles and his grasp on the nomination is loosened it is reaching a boiling point at a forum with megyn kelly of fox news broadcast on monday night mr cruz strained to conceal his frustration with mr kasich s argument that only he could defeat the democrat nominee in the fall transcript na someone is not electable if he can t get elected mr cruz said of mr kasich who has won only his own state and has scarcely competed in much of the country as ms kelly pointed out mr kasich is making a version of the same argument against mr cruz casting his republican opponents as unelectable in the fall speaking to reporters on monday in long island mr kasich called mr cruz a smear artist and noted mr trump s suggestion that mr kasich was hurting his campaign too i m not getting out mr kasich said why would i get out particularly when trump s worried i m going to get his votes mr kasich s team sees opportunities for delegates in states like new york maryland and delaware often in suburban areas mr cruz s team sees any such gains as assisting mr trump particularly in new york where mr kasich s presence could ensure that mr trump receives a delegate even in congressional districts he loses to mr cruz given the state s rules though mr trump said he would automatically win if mr kasich left the race many republicans have echoed mr cruz s argument that continuing to split the non trump vote helps the front runner more than mr kasich s candidacy hurts him mr cruz also seemed to send a shot across the bow on monday at party leaders floating alternative nominees like representative paul d ryan of wisconsin the house speaker whose name has been invoked frequently as a possible consensus choice at the convention mr ryan has denied any interest with 13 more election days the primary season still has a long way to go here we answer your questions about how live election results are reported and published on the new york times website and apps if over 80 percent of delegates are cruz delegates and trump delegates under what universe do 1 000 trump delegates or 1 000 cruz delegates go vote for some uber washington lobbyist that hasn t been on the ballot mr cruz told reporters here without elaborating on whom he considered such a lobbyist that s simply not going to happen mr cruz s recent broadsides amount to a tactical shift as the primary season heads to northeastern states thought to be less amenable to his message of conservative purity and religious faith mr cruz s campaign manager jeff roe told reporters last month that it would be the wrong move to start engaging with john kasich before adding that he might send a calculator to the kasich campaign to signal the governor s delegate deficit mr cruz s allies who had long argued that he could reach a majority of delegates before the convention have acknowledged the extreme unlikelihood of accomplishing that at times adding bitterly that mr kasich has made the task all but impossible republican strategists unaffiliated with mr cruz have argued that his path has narrowed significantly anyway after underwhelming showings in several southern states still aides to mr cruz partly attribute their narrow loss to mr trump in missouri last month which cost mr cruz at least 12 delegates to mr kasich s taking 10 percent of the votes statewide and enough in the st louis area to tip the state mr cruz s backers were similarly annoyed a week later when mr kasich spent time and money in utah even though he stood little chance of winning mr cruz defeated mr kasich by a 53 point margin there exit polls from the primaries and caucuses show which issues and presidential qualities voters value or don t value even in wisconsin cruz aides contend mr kasich has done little more than siphon votes from mr cruz mr kasich left the state to campaign in new york on monday but mr kasich s advisers argue that mr cruz has no right to be upset with them because his team spurned an effort by mr kasich s top strategist to broker something of a non aggression pact between the two candidates at what may have been the final republican presidential debate in miami last month john weaver mr kasich s chief strategist broached with mr roe the possibility of the two campaigns divvying up the remaining states in a way that would play to their respective strengths to deny mr trump a majority of delegates before the convention according to a republican strategist familiar with the exchange the plan a version of which mitt romney the 2012 nominee initially suggested as well was for mr cruz to battle mr trump alone in conservative leaning states like utah and nebraska while mr kasich could have mr trump to himself in more moderate states like pennsylvania and maryland mr cruz s campaign rejected the overture because it would have meant ceding a series of high profile contests in the northeast and mid atlantic states like new york that will factor heavily in the delegate battle those primaries are also likely to draw intense news coverage that will shape perceptions of whether and how mr trump can be stopped and by whom sampling the local fare on monday during a campaign stop at the mars cheese castle in kenosha wis mr cruz suggested that a strong showing in wisconsin would bode well for him in coming states the demographics of new york and the demographics of pennsylvania certainly share a lot in common with the demographics of a place like wisconsin he said noting that wisconsin has been a blue state in recent elections mr kasich who has shed his prickly pre campaign reputation for sunniness on the trail appeared to enjoy the extra attention on monday for a guy that s not doing very well he told reporters they sure are worried about me
