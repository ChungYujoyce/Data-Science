watch cbsn live by catherine herridge april 8 2020 10 16 pm cbs news in late october 2016 less than two weeks before the presidential election a former adviser to then presidential candidate donald trump george papadopoulos denied to an fbi confidential source that the campaign was involved in the circumstances surrounding the hack of the democratic national committee s email system calling the idea illegal cbs news has now reviewed the transcript of the conversation between papadopoulos and the confidential source working for the fbi and has published key excerpts below the recorded conversation between papadopoulos and the confidential source working for the fbi was documented in the december report issued by justice department inspector general michael e horowitz into the fbi s surveillance of campaign aide carter page and other actions related to the fbi probe known as crossfire hurricane but the excerpts of the transcript published here provide new details about the interaction between papadopoulos and the fbi source in the final days of the presidential campaign his conversation with an australian diplomat in may 2016 in which he said that russia had political dirt on mr trump s rival hillary clinton spawned the two year russia investigation papadopoulos among the first trump campaign associates to face criminal charges related to the russia investigation served a brief prison sentence for lying to the fbi about his contacts with foreign nationals during the campaign the failure by government investigators to include key sections of the papadopoulos transcripts in the warrants including denials the campaign was collaborating with russia or with outside groups like wikileaks to surveil page was listed among the 17 inaccuracies and omissions documented by horowitz in his december report he described the omission this way papadopoulos s statement to an fbi chs confidential human source in late october 2016 denying that the trump campaign was involved in the circumstances of the dnc hack the transcript in which papadopulos is apparently given the code name crossfire typhoon or ct at the end of the hours long conversation shows the confidential human source questioning him about the dnc hack chs you don t think anyone from the trump campaign had anything to do with the f ing over the at the dnc papadopoulos no chs really papadopoulos no i know that for a fact chs how do you know that for a fact papadopoulos cause i go i ve been working with them for the last nine months that s unintelligible and all of this stuff has been happening what the last four months the fbi source then pressed papadopoulos on whether someone on the trump campaign might have been secretly involved chs but you don t think anyone would have done it like under undercover or anything like that papadopoulos no i don t think so there s absolutely no reason first of all it s illegal you know to do that s earlier in the profanity laced conversation which covered a wide range of topics the confidential source asked about moscow s election meddling chs you think russia s playing a big game in this election papadopoulos no chs why not papadopoulos why would they chs don t you think they have special interests papadopoulos something like that banging sound i don t think so that s all bull no one know s who s hacking them chs you don t think that they that they hacked the the dnc who hacked the f ing dnc then papadopoulos could be the chinese could be the iranians it could be some bernie uh supporters could be anonymous the conversation continued with the fbi source zeroing in on russia and then candidate trump chs do you think they have interest in trump papadopoulos they dude no one knows how a president s going to govern anyway you don t just say oh i like chs he is very limited in what he can do anyways so like laughs papadopoulos i mean the r the congress is very hostile with russia anyways so i don t know i don t know and even putin said it himself unintelligible rustling it s all it s like conspiracy theories in his december report horowitz faulted the fbi for failing to include evidence that undercut the surveillance warrant application for page and three subsequent renewals conversations involving papadopoulos were the catalyst for opening the fbi probe into any alleged coordination between trump campaign associates and russia in late july 2016 however horowitz also noted in his report that case agent 1 had said of a similar recorded conversation with papadopoulos in september 2016 the crossfire hurricane team s assessment was that the papadopoulos denial was a rehearsed response and that he did not view the information as particularly germane to the investigation of carter page case agent 1 told the oig that he and the team had discounted papadopoulos denials for a number of reasons but a footnote to the report said the agent realized in hindsight that the denials as well as the team s assessment of his denials should have been shared with justice department s office of intelligence oi in order for oi to make the determination whether those denials should be in the application horowitz noted in his report intelligence received from a friendly foreign government that papadopoulos suggested the trump team had received some kind of suggestion from russia that it could assist this process with the anonymous release of information during the campaign that would be damaging to mrs clinton faulting the fbi horowitz wrote that because the surveillance target has no defense counsel there is a special obligation on the fbi and justice department to over tell the story and include a full and accurate presentation of the facts to meet the bureau s standard of scrupulously accurate apart from the serious flaws horowitz found in the fbi investigation he said in his report that we concluded that the quantum of information articulated by the fbi to open the individual investigations on papadopoulos page flynn and manafort in august 2016 was sufficient to satisfy the low threshold established by the department and the fbi in response to the horowitz report the fbi has undertaken a broad review of the fisa process and director christopher wray ordered more than 40 corrective steps to address the report s recommendations transcript by news team on
