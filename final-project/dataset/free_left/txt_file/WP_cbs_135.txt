after a devastating april that saw over 20 million americans lose their jobs the u s economy continues to see crippling impacts from the global coronavirus pandemic with no end in sight icymi minneapolisfed s neelkashkari called for direct financial assistance checks for low income americans during covid19 pandemic money in the pockets of people who ve lost their jobs is what we need right now https t co n9ujz7pjki pic twitter com pntntztjca in a conversation with face the nation moderator margaret brennan federal reserve bank of minneapolis president and ceo neel kashkariissued a stark warning for the economic prospects of the united states we re in for a long road to recovery highlights margaret brennan it is great to have two distinguishedco panelists here and i love being able to moderate this today in our new reality via youtube and streaming i wanted to start off with you neel kashkari because we did get another snapshot of what reality is for so many americans today we learned another two three million have filed for jobless benefits it s about 36 5 million americans who have now asked for unemployment help in just the past two months from where you sit do you think we re getting an accurate sense of the amount of economic pain and the actual jobless rate neel kashkari well it s good to see you margaret the unemployment numbers today are obviously very very troubling another three million americans as you said the headline unemployment rate that came out last week said the unemployment rate s 14 7 percent we know that is understating the true damage because first of all that s a few weeks old now and 10 million plus have filed for unemployment benefits since that data was taken and then we know that you have to actively be looking for work to be counted as unemployed and we ve been telling americans stay at home so many people who lost their jobs are staying at home following the advice of health experts they re not looking for work they re not counted as unemployed and many many others said that they still have a job but they re on furlough they re home they hope only temporarily unfortunately the longer this goes on the more likely those temporary job losses become permanent job losses and so i think the real unemployment today is around 24 or 25 percent if you compare where we are today to where we were february and that s obviously devastating for so much of the country margaret brennan one of the white house advisers told me just a few days ago he thinks we will trough north of 20 percent possibly by june do you agree with that neel kashkari i think so i mean whether whether it s done by june i think the key is going to be as we talk about with with mike how the virus progresses and do these temporary furloughs become permanent layoffs and how long does that process take unfortunately there s so much that we don t know right now most of the news we ve gotten in the past couple of months has been bad news unfortunately and you know it s hard to call the bottom margaret brennan doctor there there s a lot of pressure right now on governors and local government to try to reopen the economy to address the pain that we just heard described from where you sit do you think we are in an extended plateau of this pandemic do you see any reason to believe that it is declining here in the u s dr mike osterholm well first of all margaret thank you for having me and it s great to be out with neel someone who we all on the public health side respect very much for his interface between public health and the economy let me just say right from the start we re only in the second inning of a nine inning game this is a situation that will last for many months it s not going to be over with by the beginning of the summer or the end of summer if you look at pandemics caused by respiratory pathogens primarily the ones in the influenza world we know that they will march through the world for months and months until a sufficient number of people are infected and now become immune or until we have a vaccine we know that vaccines surely would be the perfect answer but we have to be honest to tell the population out there that as much as you ve heard so much about them it s at least many months off before we have a vaccine to put this into perspective and to understand i think in context what neel was just discussing today we estimate that between five to 20 percent of the u s population has been infected with this virus the 20 percent primarily in the new york city area the vast majority of the country in the five percent area for this virus to actually develop what we call herd immunity where enough people have actually been infected and hopefully developed immunity where we can put rods in that virus transmission reaction we need to get to 60 to 70 percent so when you think about the pain the suffering the death and the economic disruption we ve had to date for five to 15 percent largely and what it s going to take to get to 60 or 70 percent you can understand why i m saying we re just in the second inning and i think that s the perspective that if we don t keep we will constantly come up short in anything we do in terms of response whether it s to try to prevent the infections or how we respond to them when they occur or how we respond to the economy margaret brennan just the second inning there s a lot riding on the idea that there could be a vaccine by 2021 but given that there is no effective vaccine really against mers or against sars why do you think that it is a real possibility one can exist in the near future for covid 19 dr mike osterholm well first of all when you think of the concept of the vaccine we obviously come at this from a traditional vaccine standpoint like childhood immunizations what we re talking about here is a vaccine that we do have evidence already that people get develop some immunity or they wouldn t get better they do survive but also we ve had several studies done in animals looking at certain kinds of macaque monkeys where they have actually been infected with the virus intentionally and then re challenged a month or more later in which they actually had full protection against re challenge two different vaccine preparations have actually been put into these same kinds of monkeys and then challenged again and they were also protected what we re really concerned about is how long is the protection what is the durability of protection is it a few months is it a few years that could have a big impact the second thing though that we have to understand is not only are we looking at how well that it protects but we re also looking at how safe they are there s actually some signals that have come forward that they actually could lead to certain kinds of immune diseases themselves if you create just a little bit of antibody with the vaccine and then you actually get infected so one of the challenges we have in getting a vaccine is making sure it s effective and it s safe and then making it so you re right we we aren t going to have a vaccine soon but i am least optimistic we have a chance margaret brennan neel you know for every parent when they hear about these new infections of things related to coronavirus get very nervous on the economic side of things is it possible to reopen the economy if you re not reopening schools and daycare centers neel kashkari it s a great question margaret you know the economic we ve seen models we ve done modelling here where schools might be a big transmission mechanism of children passing the disease to other children and then reinfecting their parents but you know how infectious children actually are it seems as though we know that young people are less vulnerable to the disease than older people but not necessarily perfectly immune there are obviously young some young people who are getting sick or we re hearing this reporting out of new york that there are other diseases that kids may be getting that are related to coronavirus ultimately the notion of reopening the economy it s up to all of us it s actually not up to the elected leaders when we reopen it s up to all of us when we feel safe when we feel safe sending my daughter back to daycare or taking my family out to a restaurant or back to a movie theater ultimately until we have confidence that the medical professionals and the medical infrastructure really has its arm around the virus with a vaccine or with massive widespread testing or an effective therapy it s hard for me to see going back to normal as we knew it in january or february and that means unfortunately the economic recovery is going to be more slow margaret brennan so doctor to that point i mean to the degree someone has a choice as to what how to you know occupy their child with childcare or school would you advise parents at this point that it is safe by the fall to send their kids to a childcare center or a school dr mike osterholm well first of all in public health we virtually never use the word safe safe is a relative term margaret brennan yeah dr mike osterholm we would say this is what we know about the risk is your risk greater of having an adverse event getting in the car driving to school today than it is being in school it s that kind of concept and so in this case here we don t have much of the information that we still are gaining and need to have to define the risk for everyone for example we know that individuals today who developed this infection are much higher at risk of developing a serious illness and dying if they have one of several different risk factors being a man being older having underlying heart disease having kidney disease having certain kinds of histories of blood cancers or lung cancers and actually being obese particularly morbidly obese that s 40 percent of our population today in this country ironically having being a child younger and otherwise not having a health problem are at the very very lowest risk but there are going to be cases that will occur 20 30 40 50 the question is what is the risk every year in this country between 80 to 120 children die from influenza we don t stop school we don t keep kids from school but yet they happen so one of the things we re going to have to do as a society is as neel just said what is our comfort level with all of this and i would just say that somewhere going to be between two guardrails the one guardrail is we can t shut down our economy our world as we know it for 18 months or more if that s what it s going to take that will destroy a society not just an economy we can t at the same time let this virus go willy nilly and transmit at an unlimited level and bring down our health care system so the question you re asking is right in the mark of how i talk about threading the rope through the needle how are we going to make these decisions how are we going to decide what s safe and not safe relative to that concept of relative safety and i think that s the discussion we ve not had and i wish we had we re far too caught up in in partisan bickering and in sound bites and press conferences when we need to be having discussions just like this neel kashkari but margaret can i follow up for just a second margaret brennan please neel kashkari just something that mike just talked about which is i think and mike correct me i think it s a key point that we don t know the answer to yet so one thing is are kids going to be safe going back to daycare or school so let s hope they are safe let s assume that they re safe for a moment but are they then still able to transmit the virus within their peers and then back to their families that s a separate also equally important question and i don t know mike if we have great insight into that dr mike osterholm the more data we ve collected says that they do get infected and they are infectious not any more not any less with the influenza world we know that kids are highly infectious they are a little walking viral reactors out there that s not the case here but nonetheless they still are infected and infectious margaret brennan and doctor what difference does it make if masks are worn does it change that calculus dr mike osterholm well this is a real challenge for us because it s as much an emotional issue as it is a science issue we have increasing data today to support that this virus is transmitted in a very big way by aerosols you and i are just talking right now in these respective rooms we are filling this room with aerosols in fact there s a paper just published today that actually really shows that very clearly these are the tiny little things that you see next time you see the light coming through the window in your home and you see all that dust floating you say oh my i have a very dusty house those are actually aerosols and so the problem is is the masks we need to stop aerosols are actually what we call the n95 respirators they re not only a material that can block the virus coming through but they re also tight face fitting so there s no leaks the surgical mask and the cloth mask we have today will surely stop you from getting big particles into your face or potentially you excreting them but they don t stop the aerosols and one of the things that we re looking at right now very carefully is the increased number of health care workers in this country and around the world who have been infected and in many cases severely impacted by this and we believe that s because they ve been wearing surgical masks and that the virus is basically going right around the sides of these open gaps in the mask they re not coming through the material and then in fact are infecting them potentially with large volumes of virus in these hospitals and so i think it s important that we not count on the masks to be the final protection it s going to be distancing i would never tell someone not to wear a mask but at the same time i would not want to promise something that i don t think is is very true and i will just close by one last comment about that very recently i had a substantial debate with a colleague of mine who insisted no that aerosols were not important and he only wore his surgical mask he went to the grocery store 3 times over the course of the last six weeks that was his primary outing today he s in a hospital in in serious condition with covid 19 infection and he in his public setting wore his mask so i think we have to be mindful of what we re telling people and say that it may help but unless you have an n95 respirator i wouldn t count on it margaret brennan do you wear a mask dr mike osterholm i don t wear a mask in terms of where i m at because i m pretty much sequestered most of the time margaret brennan okay dr mike osterholm and i have done everything to isolate myself from from public exposure margaret brennan neel i mean as an economist i have to imagine it s pretty frustrating to not be able to look at any kind of uniform data set and the the doctor just raised another sort of question in what is reliable in terms of even just one of the things some governors have have ordered their residents to do which is to wear masks in public from where you sit would it be better public policy if there were uniform guidelines across the board so that each state was going by the same set of rules and that it would allow for some kind of uniformity in data collection neel kashkari i think so i mean i think with the best expertise that we have available you know this is like we re in the equivalent of an economic war or a health war and in your world oftentimes i think you don t have the luxury of the data that you d like to have and you have to make decisions with the data that you have and i think more standardization i think would help one example the white house a few weeks ago put out guidelines to reopen different states if they can see certain thresholds i compared those guidelines to what i hear from dr osterholm and other health experts and it seemed very sensible based on the state of the science and the knowledge today you know but states are reopening not meeting the guidelines that the white house has set here in minnesota we re relaxing our social distancing we re reopening our economy and yet our cases of covid continue to climb our cases of hospitalizations continue to climb our cases going to the icu continue to climb and our cases of deaths continue to climb so one thing is to have the standards another thing is to actually follow the standards the cdc has put forward margaret brennan well that s incredibly frustrating i m sure i mean for that the data set that you are seeing you know one of the things that the federal reserve chairman said yesterday that certainly was stunning to me was that point he made that 40 percent of households making less than 40 000 a year lost a job in march i mean it just underscoring again and again that the most vulnerable during this time period when we can socially distance to have this conversation a lot of people can t if they even have a job still what can be done to offset this immediate pain is there anything the fed can do for those individuals or is that entirely in the hands of congress neel kashkari unfortunately it s in the hands of congress as the chairman said yesterday we have the ability to lend we can provide loans to financial markets we can actually what congress and i applaud them for how bold they ve already been is granting money either kept sending checks to american families or grants to small businesses to help them make ends meet they re going to need more this is a a slow recovery the way i think it is i think we re in this for months a year 18 months there are going to be a lot of families that are gonna need direct financial assistance extended unemployment benefits things like that just to help them put food on the table and make ends meet and i m hopeful given how republicans and democrats have come together so aggressively thus far i m hopeful they ll do it again and continue to provide support to american workers margaret brennan i know you don t want to be overly prescriptive but i mean just looking at what we know i mean food prices for staples eggs milk things like that that people need to put that food on the table those we saw the largest one month spike in close to 50 years last month 00 01 54 so it s getting harder and it s getting more expensive so when you re saying something needs to be done are you talking about things like increased food stamps are you talking about more checks straight to those low income americans what do you mean neel kashkari i think either of those but mostly more checks i mean people have to pay rent you know people have mortgages and this is this is directly affecting those families but it s also going to affect their communities if we end up having waves of foreclosures and waves of bankruptcies because people can t pay rent or can t pay their mortgage so whatever the assistance i mean one of the things i think i ve learned in the past two months i actually supported the paycheck protection program trying to keep small businesses whole it s not been perfect but it s put a lot of money out quickly but putting money directly in the hands of laid off americans is i think the most direct way to get assistance 00 02 44 and then they will spend the money where they need it if they need to use the money on rent or they need to use the money on food they re in the position to make that call rather than the government saying well this much for food or this much for rent i just think money in the pockets of people who ve lost their jobs is what we need right now until we can get the healthcare system to catch up and get control of this virus margaret brennan so doctor where is the state of this american healthcare system in meeting the needs of those who are most economically vulnerable right now i mean does it concern you from what you re seeing that you know this seems to be heavily concentrated or or perhaps disproportionately impacting low income americans particularly african americans and hispanics what does that say to you about what getting through this virus looks like dr mike osterholm this is what the second inning of a nine inning game looks like let me just be clear about this by the time this pandemic has run its course over the months ahead there won t be a blue state there won t be a red state there will only be a covid color state and what happened is early on in this pandemic when the virus first got here it was in a sense the transmission enhanced by the density of people all being together let me give you a case in point if one in 200 people in a community were infected with this virus you might not see much activity as such but let that one person be a long term care employee or a visitor to a long term care facility let them be a meat packing pat processor or or somebody in their family let him be somebody in a drug treatment center or a homeless shelter let them even be someone in a prison or a guard that goes to work every day in the prison and once that virus got there it was like a match in a gas can boom 40 50 60 percent of the population were infected many people are seeing this outbreak or pandemic from a worldwide perspective as just that what s going to happen over time is this virus is going to keep transmitting there are two principles acting here that we cannot deny one is what i call viral gravity it is going to keep going until it gets to that 60 or 70 percent level one way or another either by vaccine or by national infection the second thing that this virus is going to do basically to us is it s going to continue to not only just transmit but it s going to make sure that it doesn t miss anybody meaning that you re going to see more and more people who today don t even know someone who s been infected that will be infected over time what we don t know for the healthcare system is how we get there we put out a paper several weeks ago from our center in which we laid out scenarios not models i always have a challenge with models because they re all based on assumptions we just said here we are right now at this five to 20 percent level how do we get to 60 to 70 percent well if this is like an influenza pandemic every one of them had a major peak six to seven months after the introduction of the virus meaning that if you look much larger than anything that happened with the first wave like we re seeing now we could have a situation of like 1918 everything we ve seen to date will be considered minor activity imagine telling someone in new york right now you only had minor activity remember in new york we re talking no more than 20 percent of the population infected that leaves us with another 40 to 60 percent to be infected so i think the challenge to the healthcare system is it s going to be that kind of a model where suddenly one day there won t be a healthcare system and anywhere in the world capable of handling that big peak or will it be just a slow burn will we as a coronavirus we don t know will continue to just occur like it is and hopefully we can stay under what i call the case cliff where we will fight over go the capability of providing health care or will it be a series of peaks and valleys we don t know but what we have to understand whether it s from public health from medical care resources from the economy this is not going to get done soon and it s going to keep coming back and back and back i unfortunately promise you margaret you will be doing a show on face the nation a year from now on this very issue margaret brennan and no doubt we will be tracing the impact for it for years to come but just i want to understand you fully here you know in testimony today before congress the whistleblower dr rick bright who ran barda one of the agencies working on vaccines said that our country could face the darkest winter in modern history is that hyperbole is that what you re predicting dr mike osterholm i m not saying it s going to happen i m saying it could happen we don t know how we re going to get from here to that 60 to 70 percent if this was like an influenza pandemic we could very well see cases begin to actually decrease over the course of the next few weeks to months and i know people will celebrate that and say look we ve won in fact that may be mother nature playing the cruelest trick of all by saying just like it has in every previous influenza pandemic it goes away and then all of a sudden it comes back with a vengeance we don t know why we don t understand it but it happens and it has happened at least 10 times in the last 250 years so i think the challenge we have today is laying out what are the possible scenarios if i had come on your show six months ago and read you the chapter in my book it would read just like today and you would have dismissed me as a crack you would have said you know this isn t going to happen now we re here now use continue to use creative imagination to figure out how we re going to get out of this what s the endgame and again that s a possibility we could see a huge peak that could be devastating beyond anything i could otherwise imagine we could see it just continue to burn at this level like this for months but the bottom line it s going to do something and that s what we need to have a discussion of how are we preparing now what are we doing now to get ready for that and we re not we re having a debate of whether we should be opening up today or not which is not unimportant if you re one of those unemployed people it s not unimportant it s very important but we need to have a much much higher level discussion than we re having right now margaret brennan neel congress is basically arguing over the timing of trying to do something more on emergency aid phase four the white house says they can wait until june what is the cost of waiting neel kashkari well i think again the one the one program that has is working it s not perfect but the one program that really does seem to be working is the unemployment system is getting money out to people who ve lost their jobs by people filing for unemployment claims and i know there ve been some you know florida has its own unique challenges but for most of the country the unemployment system is working here in minnesota it is working checks are getting out to people who ve lost their jobs and congress provided those increased payments an extra 600 a week and that s through around july so to me when i looking at the landscape of different things congress could be doing given how painful this is for families i think the most important money that is going out is the money that is going right to laid off workers and right to families so i personally feel like congress has a little bit of time because those extra unemployment checks are still out there they re still getting processed through june and through july but we can t let there be a gap because people have rent that they need to pay they have mortgages they need to pay they have food they need to buy and as you said margaret in some cases food prices are going up because there are supply shortages across the country and so there are a lot of things i think i have not yet studied the house bill that they re that they just introduced a couple of days ago i think it s very complicated i ve understood it there s a lot in there but i m focused on what puts money in the hands of families that are most directly affected and just as you said you could not design a virus to more acutely target the most vulnerable and the lowest income americans and that s what s so devastatingly unfair about this and we need to do whatever we can to get help to them because they didn t do anything this isn t moral hazard they didn t take some foolish risk it s just a natural disaster that s unfairly targeting the lowest income part of our population margaret brennan and doctor what what is the health care solution for those individuals when there is a vaccine do we know anything about how it would be distributed how widely available it would be dr mike osterholm well one of the real challenges we re going to have is first of all doing the research and development to get a vaccine find that it works but you have put your finger on a very important issue and that is how who makes it where they make it and who gets it there are eight billion people who are gonna want this vaccine overnight there s no way with years of production and administration we can do that even just this morning one of the french vaccine manufacturers that made note that they were going to make the vaccine for americans as part of their operation here margaret brennan sanofi dr mike osterholm and as you saw the french government has already responded with some very terse language about what s going to happen we don t have a clue right now which country or countries might actually find a vaccine first it might be the chinese it might be here in the us it might be in europe and when that vaccine s available i don t think it ll be the only one that will come forward but in fact it will mean somebody going to have to make choices between who gets it and what country what are the risk factors i mean i ll just give you a case in point i would tell you right now if i had to target it to one group in the united states i would target it to healthcare workers right now they are dying working on the front lines and yet i can understand the public outcry that we re taking care of our own even though we can make the case why and we re not having those discussions right now we need those we need to understand at a time when our country is isolating itself from the rest of the world it s when we should all be having a game plan for the world by the world and with the world about what we re gonna do with vaccine so that we know middle low income countries high income countries which countries get it and that s gonna be important and let me just add one last thing we re learning about supply chains our group has been writing about this for a long time about this just in time delivery system where much of it s made in china when we talk about supplies for making vaccines vials syringes to deliver them needles all those kinds of things that s not going to happen overnight either wouldn t it be a shame if we actually had an effective vaccine that we weren t prepared to deliver or didn t have the equipment to do it that s the kind of discussion we should be having right now but instead we continue to have these one off political debates that have no relevance to any of these activities that we re talking about margaret brennan does this look like a one time vaccination or boosters dr mike osterholm we don t know this is going to be one of the questions is there durable immunity when you asked me earlier about sars and mers that s been one of the challenges is that the antibodies may actually wear off over time or the protection that we get from the vaccine we have many questions yet we could eventually manage this as a vaccine that s given yearly or every other year but then realize what that will mean in terms of trying to deliver it for the world so these are major questions that we have to answer that we don t have any answer at all for right now margaret brennan and neel i remember talking to you a few weeks ago and you were very clear that any predictions looking at all these pieces make you know a v shaped recovery a bounce back next to impossible given that each state is somewhat dependent on how aggressive their own governors are or their own mayors are in in deciding public policy around this is this just a sense of you know two steps forward one step i mean are we just getting jerked back and forth is there a recovery that looks like any kind of letter in the alphabet at this point neel kashkari you know i think a v shape recovery is off the table margaret brennan yeah neel kashkari everything that we ve learned in the past few months or in the last few weeks since you and i last spoke margaret unfortunately the job losses continue there s some of the temporary furloughs are becoming permanent job losses and as you see small businesses even here in minneapolis we ve seen restaurants who ve already announced we re not reopening that it s just too hard we re just going to close up that s what makes it a much longer harder recovery just think about the coffee shop or the restaurant that goes out of business you have a vacant storefront for six months or a year or two until another coffee shop or another restaurant forms redecorates hires new people it just becomes a much slower recovery than simply turning things off and turning things back on the way we hoped was possible a couple of months ago again who is setting the pace of this ultimately it is the virus and it is the course the virus is going to take and it is the confidence all of us end up having in going back to whatever the new normal is going back to sending our kids to school or daycare or going back to restaurants i go grocery shopping every couple of weeks i wear a mask i socially distance boy mike s story that he told about one of his colleagues is concerning to me i hope that my behavior is enough to protect me and to protect my family but until we have confidence this recovery is going to be muted and i don t think there s any way around that margaret brennan has it surprised you that there haven t been more bankruptcies at this point or are we just we haven t heard about it yet neel kashkari i think i think congress has moved very aggressively so for example the ppp program put out four or five hundred billion dollars very quickly across the country into small businesses of all shapes and sizes i think that was a very powerful bridge but it was designed to be a bridge for two months and then you go back to normal after two months i think when that two month expires and when the virus unfortunately if it s continuing to progress then i think you re going to start to see bankruptcy start to emerge at that point when that bridge expires unless congress chooses to extend it but at some point if what dr osterholm was saying is right that this is an 18 month journey that we re on at some point policymakers are going to ask the question should we just focus on the workers and not go through the through the business as a channel of getting support margaret brennan we also have some of our listeners the viewers sending in some questions this one is for you dr osterholm from stephen who works with habitat for humanity international you ve stated that approximately 60 percent of the country will be infected with the coronavirus what percentage of those who get infected will need hospitalization and icu level care dr mike osterholm it s going to change as over time relative to the risk groups that are infected so right now we re infecting a lot of high risk people almost a third of all the cases who have died have been of persons living in long term care so i pointed out earlier as we burn through those facilities a very horrible thought that s going to mean that the numbers of severe illnesses will continue to occur but they won t occur necessarily at that rate so at this point if you just did a kind of a back of the envelope estimate i m one of those people that believe all models are wrong and some just may give you useful information but if you just look at a population of the united states 330 million people if half the population gets infected you know 165 million people of that 165 million the best data we have today still supports the fact about 80 percent of them will actually have mild symptoms to asymptomatic illness won t even know that they had this unless they were tested 20 percent will seek medical care of those about 10 percent will be hospitalized of those 5 percent will actually end up likely needing intensive care medicine and about one half to 1 percent could very well die well that one half to 1 percent if you do the math back on the 165 million people you get a sense of what we re talking about 800 000 to 1 6 million people you know we re at 80 000 today with only 5 to 15 percent of the population infected so the numbers are very realistic so that s the care we re talking about if we end up hospitalizing of the 5 percent of that 165 million people we will overwhelm icu care throughout this country particularly if it occurs over a short period of time like a big peak so this is what we have to plan for now we have not had the worst of it yet potentially we have to plan for that margaret brennan and given that so many hospitals are financially stressed by having had restrictions on what are essentially profit centers for them some kind of the medical procedures does that worry you has some of the policy hurt our hospital capacity dr mike osterholm absolutely and in fact we have kind of a perfect storm occurring for many of these hospitals and healthcare facilities that were already suffering one of the bright spots were a lot of the outpatient procedures the one day surgery type operations that actually brought in a substantial source of revenue well of course those were basically postponed canceled with this to make way for potentially needing additional resources for the covid 19 infection one of the things that we haven t fully understood or equipment that we also need for our health care workers who are working in the covid units and we re already seeing clashes within organizations as to who gets the ppe whether we do the surgery or not or whether they re in the covid unit i had a conversation with one of the individuals leading one of the covid units here in the state of minnesota who just this past week made it very clear that they were running short of protective equipment and that they worried desperately about what same day surgery reestablished what it might do to that protective equipment status that s what we re up against margaret brennan wow neel this question is for you from brian at u s bank are equity markets acting rationally right now neel kashkari well i think equity markets have bounced back because in early march when this really started to break out there was risk that there would be a financial collapse and the federal reserve through our many different emergency programs acted very aggressively to provide liquidity in the financial markets and to basically say we are standing behind the financial system so i think that risk of that financial collapse has really diminished and that s why you re seeing the equity markets bounce back but i don t put any i don t draw any comfort from the stock market in terms of their ability to predict where this virus is going i mean if experts like mike have as much uncertainty as they have about the path ahead for this virus the stock stock pickers are just wildly guessing i mean i m reminded of april and may of 2008 in march of 2008 bear stearns was rescued in april and may policymakers and the equity markets all breathed a sigh of relief and said maybe that s it maybe the worst is behind us and then of course the fall of 2008 came and it made march look like a just a speed bump so you know the stock market s going to do what it s going to do the bond market is signaling they expect slow economic growth and they expect low inflation in the future i take more signal from the bond market but at this point i want to listen to health experts more than investors margaret brennan and so it sounds like what you re saying gets to this question from stephanie at alliance investment do you expect the recession to be quick or long and drawn out it sounds like long and drawn out neel kashkari long and long and drawn out and even if we return to growth in q3 or q4 which i would expect you know the the shutdown is very steep and very sharp we i would expect we ll return to some growth but we ll be nowhere near back to where we were in terms of the productivity of the economy the production of the economy as we were back in december of 2019 and the unemployment rate unfortunately i expect to only come down gradually it went up very very quickly at record speed unfortunately i expect it to come down much more slowly and that s where the real pain is for families that are directly affected by those job losses margaret brennan and doctor if the coronavirus returns in waves this gets to a question from susan at university of minnesota before a vaccine is is approved and widely available how do you return how does a society return are these actually very concentrated pockets can they be controlled can we continue as a country chugging along and just have things be walled off in one region dr mike osterholm this is a very critical question i just would say the underlying premise of it is we are not driving this tiger we are riding it and so one of the challenges we have is understanding what it is we can do where we can do it i think that in a major big peak the most important thing we re going to do is major physical distancing to keep people from spreading to each other and trying to shave off the top of that peak but we won t change the peak it will happen i think that s the challenge that we re running into right now of what can we actually do that will make this go away and i don t think there s that much i think we re constantly going to be in a sense in countries like the united states just trying to shave off the disease occurrence but not stopping it margaret brennan so what does that mean can i say would you get on a plane right now would you fly is it safe dr mike osterholm i would not right now in part because of just from the standpoint of work where we re at today i think i m one of those people who have now come to understand the power zoom how many days have i been jet lagged trying to fly to a one day meeting at some distant location so i think from a travel industry that s going to change from a risk standpoint i still do believe it s a it s a risk that i don t want to take i know too many of my friends and colleagues who have become infected you know i m a 67 year old man who basically i m not once what i once was relative to the risk pattern and so i think people ought to take that and this is an important message there are things we can do for ourselves you know we don t have to count on the government to tell us don t go into big crowds if you are somebody who is at an increased risk i think there s things we can do to help each other one of the things i put out a weekly podcast and i just think now is the time to be kind how many people in our communities need somebody to take their mail or to get the groceries or do things like that help people actually stay out of harm s way and i think that s something that we really desperately need to look at and i m one of those people that say i m not going to put myself needlessly in harm s way right now margaret brennan neel you ve talked about it s kind of all up to us as consumers and certainly they re the engine of the economy but given how many industries are reliant on that confidence being restored is it only logical to assume that we re going to have to continue to see federal bailouts of of industries or federal rescue for industries like airlines neel kashkari you know i do think it s likely i mean airlines or hotel operators if if they were to you know if this continues the way it may the way that mike has been describing the virus we re just trying to hold on if you allow a lot of industries to go through bankruptcy you end up destroying some of their productive capacity it s not simply that you re you re changing ownership there are you know people get fired expertise goes out the door when people get fired and laid off partnerships get destroyed between different businesses there actually is a destruction of the productive capacity of the u s economy if we have waves of small or large businesses going through bankruptcy now that doesn t necessarily mean you wouldn t have any right sizing i mean could one debate how many airlines the u s economy needs how much consolidation there has been there needs to be we do need to have an airline industry we are going to need to travel again is it going to look exactly like it looks like in 2019 probably not same thing with hotels and so on i mean i don t know for another example i don t know who s buying cars right now i ve got to believe the auto industry is severely hurt by this i m barely driving my car so you know we have two cars we barely take them out of the garage now so our need our use of these vehicles is dramatically diminished so it s it s affecting wide swaths of american industry but we do have to make sure we preserve the productive capacity of our economy and that s you know uniquely it s uniquely congress s ability to do that margaret brennan uniquely congress s ability so what jobs do you think exist on the other side of this i know we don t even know where the other side is at this point but you know eric schmidt said to us this week on face the nation that he thinks about 10 years of change has happened in two months neel kashkari well i think you know as as mike just said i mean i think we re all learning the power and the convenience of some of these online technologies our own bank here at the minneapolis fed we have about 1 100 employees 95 percent of us are working from home full time and we re able to do that effectively i do think things are lost that it s not the same being able to be in person with your colleagues sitting around a conference table so i do want us to get back when it s safe back to normal but i think our our minds are now open about other ways of doing work that could be effective and maybe it ends up being some kind of a hybrid just think about education how many family s lives are turned upside down because their kids are not in school and there were education disparities before this crisis and now so many families across the country don t have access to online learning and so their kids are at an enormous disadvantage and so i would imagine that the model the delivery model of education both k 12 and higher ed is probably going to change not overnight not completely but probably will become embracing of these technologies more so so i think i agree that we re going to see a lot of change in an accelerated period of time but we don t know exactly what the other side looks like margaret brennan and doctor what is this doing to healthcare and pharmaceutical the pharmaceutical industry in this country should we expect that america wins that race to be first to a treatment and vaccine dr mike osterholm well first of all the pharmaceutical industry situation right now is a very illustrative situation of our vulnerability our group began studying over 18 months ago the shortage of drugs in this country that we need right now for care and we identified 156 life saving drugs that you need within hours or people die or are seriously injured what s on the crash cart what s in the emergency room what s in intensive care of those 156 drugs all of them were generic most of them are made outside the united states and for the vast majority of them they are in very short supply sixty three of them before the outbreak ever occurred in wuhan were already in short supply imagine that most of these drugs in fact put us at great vulnerability because they re made in china and india which has a control over them and even our own defense department gets those drugs for its members from those same sources and so we have a vulnerability there and we re tracking for example in this country just let me give one example the drugs you need to put somebody on a mechanical ventilator they paralyze you in a way that allows that ventilator to be inserted and used they re in short supply we may run out of those drugs before we run out of ventilators and people haven t thought about supply chain integrity and the issues of rely of what we rely on in the pharmaceutical industry this is a huge piece hopefully this is going to cause us to have a new understanding of what is critical services and products and how do we have access to them and where they re made i would just add that ironically besides china which is the major source for these the other area in the world that we got a lot of antibiotics from for the united states was the lombardy region of italy the other area that got hit during this pandemic so it just shows you the vulnerability that we as a world have for what can be a global or even localized impact margaret brennan and what gets the industry to change that i mean can you swiftly change that supply chain dr mike osterholm well i think this is another one of those discussions that are surely a combination of public policy business economy i just would point back i was very involved with the 2003 sars outbreak that occurred around the world at that time you know what no one talked about supply chain challenges even though it was centered in china that s how much our world has changed between 2003 and today where today during that since that time supply chains manufacturing critical goods services coming out of china are absolutely critical in terms of what we do today so we ve had this rather rapid evolution of changing worlds of manufacturing that are important to us and now we re going to have to have that discussion what do we do about what s happened in those last 17 years and how do we how do we want to address that margaret brennan and neel we re running out of time here but just on a final note what is your prediction of what of where we are by november and the time of the upcoming election economically what do you see as the amount of economic pain for the average american neel kashkari i mean unfortunately margaret it s going to depend on whether we have that big spike that mike is talking about in the fall as has come with prior flu pandemics i mean i sure hope not that we re not enduring that i hope we re on the road to recovery even if it is a gradual recovery you know reflecting on the conversation we re having it sounds quite depressing i mean honestly margaret brennan yeah neel kashkari but i ll tell you the best news that i ve seen in the past couple of months is how swiftly both political parties came together and took bold action to support the american people and the american economy in what they ve done so far and that gives me great confidence i mean our chairman talked about the great fiscal power of the united states we have tremendous fiscal capacity and if our leaders our elected leaders continue to say we re going to work together to do what s necessary for the american people that gives me great optimism that as tough as this road may be we are going to get through it and we will support one another to get through it and come out and then put everybody back to work on the other side margaret brennan all right thank you so much for this conversation as you said it is a little bit depressing but i think it s it s important to have some reality check from people who know and are looking and thinking about these big issues thank you for
