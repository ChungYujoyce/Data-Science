than a decade became a bear market in less than a month the coronavirus was the catalyst but not necessarily the cause maybe no one could have seen a pandemic coming but stocks had reached valuations that suggested wall street thought nothing could ever go wrong a few weeks later the prevailing attitude seemed to be that nothing would ever be the same again at least nothing good the s p 500 fell more than 35 percent from the closing high on feb 19 to the low on march 23 it lost 20 percent in the first quarter but as the second quarter got going the mood among traders grew less gloomy as virus infections approached or passed their peaks in hot spots like new york italy and spain stocks remained well off their highs but well off their lows too after a furious recovery the s p rose more than 25 percent from that march 23 low to april 14 risk and uncertainty still abound but while the short term outlook for investments the economy and our physical and psychological well being is impossible to predict with assurance many investment advisers believe they can glimpse a clearer picture the farther ahead they look highlights of mutual fund performance in the first quarter leaders and

york times source morningstar i can t tell you where we re going to be three months from now but i m pretty confident about three years from now said simeon hyman global investment strategist at proshares he foresees the world returning to a semblance of normality by then with the stock market reflecting a recovery in physical and economic health that s why he recommends maintaining a normal precrisis approach when it comes to managing portfolios no matter how nerve racking that might be ordinary investors should stick to their discipline mr hyman said don t sell into this sit on your hands continue your systematic investing to the extent you can he advised investors to rebalance portfolios to restore whatever preferred allocation they had to stocks and bonds before the bear market set in for most people that would mean selling some government bonds which have risen in value and buying stocks which certainly have not matthew benkendorf co manager of the virtus vontobel global opportunities fund also advised rebalancing and staying the course no matter how bumpy the trip might be i wouldn t take money out of the stock market he said admonishing against the classic pitfall of capitulation looking for silver linings in an otherwise dark cloud mr benkendorf identified some good things about this one is that the government is showing up as it needs to show up he said they got the checkbook out congress appropriated 2 trillion in march for the largest economic rescue package ever the bill included cash payments to individuals enhanced unemployment benefits and loans to businesses that contain incentives to retain as many workers as possible the federal reserve has been doing its part too it cut short term interest rates to close to zero percent in march pledged to buy unlimited amounts of treasury bonds and other debt instruments and offered nearly unlimited credit to banks ordinary investors bought a fair amount of treasury bonds in the first quarter and almost nothing else long term government bond funds rose 21 9 percent according to morningstar but the average bond fund overall lost 4 8 percent mainly because of plunges in portfolios focusing on riskier issues such as high yield and emerging market debt each of which fell more than 10 percent the average domestic stock fund was off 21 5 percent in the quarter portfolios that concentrate on economically sensitive industrial companies financial services and energy did worse than most health care and technology held up better but no funds in the main sectors made money international stock funds dropped 22 1 percent with specialists in latin america india and europe performing especially poorly it may be hard to tell with the stock market rising or falling several percent on many days but luca paolini chief strategist at pictet asset management thinks wall street has reacted sensibly to covid 19 there s a feeling that the market is panicking he said the market is i m afraid behaving quite rationally there is huge joblessness the decline we ve seen peak to trough is appropriate the market is pricing in a realistic scenario for economic growth in the u s and globally mr paolini also thinks leaders in washington are being sensible in their response to the crisis the good news is the unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus a 50 percent bigger stimulus than 2008 9 during the global financial crisis he said i really think the policy response is appropriate for the decline in economic growth a dilemma for investors who sold stocks is that if they don t buy them back until the virus and an almost certain recession have been subdued they might forgo substantial gains you don t add risk to your portfolio when the economy is positive you act when it stops deteriorating mr paolini said signs of that would be positive news flow regarding the virus such as a lower infection rate more testing or the deployment of a test for antibodies to identify people who have recovered from an infection and are therefore likely immune at this point much bad news is priced into stocks he said including a 35 percent drop in dividend payments he anticipates a 30 percent decline in earnings per share which he called bad but not catastrophic analysts have been sprinting to slash their forecasts for economic and corporate performance leading indicators tracked by the organization for economic cooperation and development recorded the largest drop on record in most major economies in march the group said investment banks have continually revised their predictions for declines in second quarter economic output with those of goldman sachs and morgan stanley approaching a 40 percent annual rate as for earnings factset research foresees the companies in the s p 500 collectively experiencing a 21 7 percent decline in the second quarter compared to the same quarter of 2019 its full year forecast is for a 9 percent decline bear markets often unfold slowly because investors are unsure whether a recession is approaching james paulsen chief investment strategist at the leuthold group argues that there is no such uncertainty now so it s possible that the selling that typically occurs has already happened in this one kristina hooper chief global market strategist at invesco highlighted two aspects of the crisis with opposite potential impacts that she says have yet to be fully factored into share prices there s a potential for slightly lower infection rates than had been expected she said a development that was starting to be realized and could help account for the recovery since late march but she said wall street has been expecting a sequel to the 2 trillion appropriation and none has been announced the absence of one could be disastrous for an economic recovery she warned like mr hyman and mr benkendorf ms hooper encouraged investors to maintain the same mix of assets they aim for in more placid times as for tactical moves she would add exposure to asian emerging markets including china valuations are relatively attractive and they re on the other side of the crisis or have made it through relatively unscathed she said she also likes emerging market debt and investment grade corporate bonds but is wary of high yield debt and considers treasury issues overvalued by mr paolini s estimate the battering in stocks left them at levels that could produce long term returns of about 10 percent a year because treasury bond yields are so low the 10 year bond yielded 0 7 percent at the end of march and because all that fiscal stimulus and fed balance sheet expansion could produce inflation he expects stocks to greatly outperform bonds over the long haul which stocks he would own depends on the shape of the economic recovery a sharp v shaped one should allow cyclical sectors like industrials and energy to outperform while technology and pharmaceutical companies should do better in a slower recovery mr paolini also likes emerging markets but with trade possibly waning in the post covid 19 world he favors ones with big domestic economies like china and indonesia mr hyman suggested expanding into foreign stocks to increase diversification and he would reduce the average maturity in bond portfolios to limit risk another way to play defense he said is to own higher quality companies with long track records of growing dividends and stable earnings growth some examples in his firm s s p 500 aristocrats exchange traded fund are johnson johnson caterpillar target and procter gamble mr benkendorf recommends adding exposure to phenomenal businesses outside the u s including stocks of asian technology companies and high quality consumer staples companies in europe that are often better than u s companies examples of the first sort are alibaba and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing his preferred european consumer issues include unilever and rentokil whatever tinkering investors do with their portfolios mr benkendorf encourages them not to think too much about the stock market these days you have to practice a fair amount of benign neglect he said when investors do think about the market they should think positively you have to be a long term optimist if you re an investor he said it isn t a game for pessimists and the optimists ultimately do win you have to leverage the advantage of time and be patient advertisement
