team on twitter by nadja popovich shortly after coming into office three years ago president trump began to undo many of the major climate and environmental policies put in place by his predecessor barack obama calling them unnecessary and harmful to industry within a week his inauguration mr trump had revived a pipeline project rejected by mr obama and expedited review of another he also moved quickly to begin unwinding the obama era clean power plan which required states to cut planet warming carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and to quit the paris agreement on climate change under which nearly 200 nations pledged to significantly reduce their output of greenhouse gases the times climate team chronicled this flurry of reversals one by one and for mr trump s first 100 days in office we pulled together each of these early actions into a single list so readers could better understand the scope of the president s deregulatory agenda at the time we counted 23 rules being rolled back we ve been tracking them ever since today our tracker counts nearly 100 rules and regulations reversed or on the way out under mr trump more than 60 rules have been officially revoked or otherwise undone with an additional 34 rollbacks still in progress including rules governing clean air water and toxic chemicals you can read more about each of them on our tracking page we ll be updating it soon with several more entries that readers identified see anything we missed email climateteam nytimes com by hiroko tabuchi i ve been experimenting around the pantry during quarantine and one happy discovery i ve made is that plant based milks like soy almond or oat milk are easy to make it was happy for a couple reasons for one thing alternative milks are a lot harder to find in stores these days sales of oat milk for example recently jumped more than 350 percent as coffee shop regulars cut off from their baristas started making their brews at home and plant based milks can help you reduce your personal carbon footprint the production of dairy products including milk cheese ice cream and yogurt accounts for almost 4 percent of planet warming emissions worldwide each year soy almond and oat milks have a far lower carbon footprint overall than cow s milk and use less water yes even almond milk which has gotten a lot of bad press during california s recent droughts if you want to try making alternative milk at home follow this guide they re all pretty much made the same way and don t require any fancy equipment first soak a cup of soy almonds or oats in plenty of water overnight soy especially will grow two or three times in volume so make sure to do this in a big bowl in the morning use a colander to drain the water and rinse the soy almonds or oats this is especially important if you re using oats to prevent the milk from getting slimy and glutinous then put your soy almond or oats in a blender together with three cups of water and blend for about two minutes thorough blending will maximize how much milk you can squeeze out you can experiment with the amount of water i ve made oat milk with both 1 5 cups and 3 cups of water the cup and a half version is far richer and tastier and probably better if you re adding it to coffee but it s gone very quickly next pour out the mixture into a clean cheesecloth a dedicated nut milk bag makes this part really easy and prevents any spills and squeeze out the milk and i mean squeeze and squeeze until you get the last drops out then if you re using soy or almonds gently heat the milk but stop before it reaches a boil that s common practice in japan because people there tend not to eat raw nuts but i wouldn t heat oat milk which can easily get slimy you can add a little sugar or maple syrup to any of the milks to taste it should keep in the fridge covered for about five days you ll have some pulp left over when you re done i use it for baking i ve been making these vegan soy doughnuts though in muffin form because i don t have a doughnut pan and they ve been wonderful when i was growing up in japan my mother also used to fry up soy pulp which we call okara with vegetables it was delicious the last thing to remember dairy contains nutrients like calcium and protein that are important for bone and muscle health but missing from nut milks so take a look at your overall diet if you are going to limit or avoid dairy to make sure you re getting enough nutrients from other foods we d love your feedback on this newsletter please email thoughts and suggestions to climateteam
