presidency would have been unthinkable by laura reston september 11 2016 laura reston is the managing editor of the new republic where she writes about american politics on august 9 2004 just three weeks before the republican national convention was set to convene at madison square garden and renominate president george w bush new york magazine had a modest proposal for its namesake city secession from the united states in a country that grows ever redder it is the bluest of blue cities in one of the bluest of blue states with the eccentrics to match jennifer senior wrote psychically then new york already seems headed out of the union so why not go all the way for much of late twentieth century people in the heartland felt the same way about new york it was the city of taxi driver s travis bickle a near bankruptcy in 1975 son of sam bernie goetz the central park five looting wilding crack squeegee men 2 000 homicides a year the city senior wrote in 2004 has always felt like a nation apart advertisement for decades what we are witnessing in 2016 would have been unthinkable two new yorkers running head to head for president of the united states hillary clinton a former new york senator who lives in chappaqua and based her campaign in hipster brooklyn is competing against a fast talking real estate mogul from queens whose life is almost a parody of new york glitz and excess twenty years ago ted cruz s attempt to take down donald trump with a knock on new york values might have played well in the heartland but this year it felt like an out of touch attempt to play to someone s aging uncle what happened in many ways america has changed becoming more urban and polyglot in that sense new york now resembles the rest of the nation more than it used to but something far more important happened as well exactly 15 years ago when the planes hit the twin towers on september 11 2001 and as the nation grieved the thousands dead in lower manhattan new york city underwent a transformation both on the ground and in american eyes history dept by michael kruse it was no longer the freewheeling vaguely foreign island that conservatives had vilified for decades it was the symbol of america that enemies had chosen to attack in its response it became the home of american heroism and resilience of first responders and men and women caked in dust and ash this is one of the underappreciated changes wrought by the tragedy on that moment 15 years ago new york city became part of america again and it paved the way for a future that nobody would have imagined in which new yorkers weren t just competing in national politics but would win the white house regardless of which major political party proves victorious in november since he descended the escalator at trump tower in manhattan to announce he was running for president donald trump has embraced his new york roots queens the borough where he was raised has stayed with him the macho swagger the aggression the tabloid newspaper sensibilities the lunch pail conservatism and as he s barnstormed across the nation he has stayed firmly identified with new york whenever possible he even leaves the campaign trail to fly back to new york so he can sleep at home in his penthouse overlooking central park rather than staying overnight in some iowa fleabag as flashy as the neon facades in times square trump wears his association with new york city with pride and has for quite some time on the debut episode of the apprentice in 2004 he waxed poetic about the city borrowing some of its sheen for his comeback attempt new york he said in a voiceover my city where the wheels of the global economy never stop turning a concrete metropolis of unparalleled strength and purpose that drives the business world manhattan is a tough place this island is the real jungle he hawks the city as if he wants to adopt every stereotype about new yorkers out there casting himself as the city s personification the friday cover by garrett m graff similarly hillary clinton a new yorker by choice not by birth has made little effort to play down her own new york connections she still lives in chappaqua a tony manhattan suburb and summers in the hamptons rubbing shoulders with wall street financiers trust funders and celebrities her campaign is based out of brooklyn her husband former president bill clinton keeps a fully staffed office in harlem her daughter chelsea lives in a block long condo in the flatiron district it wasn t always like this in 1940 another republican presidential nominee understood that being from manhattan could be a liability on the campaign trail wendell willkie was the wealthy president of a large electric company based in new york and lived in a lavish mansion on fifth avenue years earlier he had begun a very public affair with a renowned new york book editor until 1939 the year before he announced he would run for president he was a registered democrat the parallels to donald trump another businessman from new york and former registered democrat whose marital infidelities were splashed across page six in the 1990s are obvious and unmistakable both willkie and trump have lived out the traits that those in the heartland long associated with manhattan loose morals liberal values and ostentatious wealth but whereas trump has doubled down on his new york identity wendell willkie made a different play in 1940 toning down his new york lifestyle to compete in national politics according to bruce dearstyne author of the spirit of new york defining events in the empire state s history willkie refashioned himself as a humble midwesterner traveling to his childhood home in rushville indiana to accept the republican nomination the makeover was of little use his attempt to transform himself from glitzy new york tycoon to grass roots indianan fell flat alice roosevelt longworth herself the daughter of a president and wife of a speaker of the house quipped that willkie came from the grass roots of 10 000 country clubs the friday cover by michael kruse after willkie lost to fdr in 1940 the republicans nominated another moderate new yorker thomas dewey in the presidential races of 1944 and 1948 twice more they lost the national election an aversion for new york city that place so out of touch with the conservative morals of the gop base would eventually become enshrined in the republican playbook we could tell new york to kiss our ass and we could really start a conservative party said arizona senator barry goldwater in 1960 four years later he would beat out nelson rockefeller a mainline conservative from new york city who proudly called himself a liberal republican for the gop presidential nomination republicans increasingly took to framing american politics as a struggle that pitted conservatives in the heartland against liberal urban elites who believed in gun control abortion rights for gays and the separation of church and state their aim thomas frank wrote in his 2004 book what s the matter with kansas was simply to bolster the stereotypes using whatever tools were at hand to cast the democrats as the party of a wealthy pampered arrogant elite that lives as far as it can from real americans and to represent republicanism as the faith of the hardworking common people of the heartland an expression of their unpretentious all american ways just like country music and nascar new york was bound up in this vilified as a symbol for liberal values historically americans from the heartland have always had this paradoxical relationship with new york city said andrew hartman the author of a war for the soul of america in an interview with politico magazine it s the quintessential american city but for religious conservatives it s all that s wrong with the united states american culture in terms of its cosmopolitanism its secularism through the 1970s 80s and 90s national politicians in both parties studiously cultivated a downhome rural patina blue blooded george h w bush a connecticut senator s son who graduated from yale and lived for a time in the lavish apartment in the waldorf astoria hotel reserved for the american ambassador to the united nations recast himself as a texan and doubled down on cultural traditionalism and while bill clinton was running for president in 1992 his campaign routed a bus tour through as many back roads and small towns in the south as possible showcasing the candidate in rural america away from cosmopolitan cities like new york though he was officially nominated at the democratic convention at madison square garden in 1992 the metropolis wasn t always kind to him clinton would have several major confrontations with hecklers and protesters that year including several widely televised encounters with aids activists new york so far to the left that it clashed with the democratic nominee primary source by susan mulcahy during the 1990s the era of clinton and giuliani new york lost some of the grittier aspects that had long made it distasteful to the rest of the country the streets were cleaned up crime rates fell in the economic boom during president bill clinton s second term new york was prospering it was territory so friendly that first lady hillary clinton chose to adopt new york citizenship and run for an open u s senate seat in 2000 the de facto readmission of new york into the union happened when the planes hit the twin towers of the world trade center on september 11 2001 there was a lot of sympathy for new york city admiration for new york city says dearstyne people realized it was special new york could no longer be treated like the plague indeed it was impossible to criticize or seem hostile toward it suddenly politicians on both sides of the aisle were incorporating haunting images of the rubble outside the world trade center into their campaign ads in one spot from 2002 senator max cleland of georgia read a poem praising the city in another ad two years later the bush campaign showed five firefighters lugging a stretcher draped in an american flag the ad was controversial democrats claimed the bush campaign was using september 11 for political gain but it and others like it aired in 17 battleground states across the country a daily reminder in the years after the september 11 attacks that new yorkers had acted bravely that year the republicans even held their convention in manhattan s madison square garden the first time the city had hosted an rnc since the party was founded 150 years earlier september 11 tilted the view away from this longstanding late twentieth century trope about new york city being the hotbed of the devil and all the things that are wrong with the country hartman says at the same time the 9 11 attacks happened as longer shifts in the political landscape were manifesting changes that made it easier for new york based candidates to compete on a national level americans were increasingly moving to and living in cities meanwhile internet access and mass media chipped away at regional divisions making the distinction between urban and rural america less contentious american political divisions have become much more nationalized says dan hopkins a political science professor at the university of pennsylvania it s less important where a candidate is from instead people care about what party they are from meanwhile public opinion shifted to the left on issues like gay marriage and gun control pulling mainstream opinion more in line with new york socially and making it harder for conservatives to suggest that manhattan was at war with the american heartland that s not to say that after september 11 social conservatives abandoned their habit of cordoning new york off from the heartland altogether have you ever tried to order grits in a fancy manhattan restaurant good luck mike huckabee wrote in his 2015 book god guns grits and gravy to borrow a phrase from the once senator and presidential candidate there really are two americas and indeed several new york politicians have tried to mount presidential campaigns since september 11 and failed rudy giuliani for example never quite connected with voters in the american heartland in his 2008 bid to earn the gop nomination but what s important is that his being from new york was no longer debilitating it no longer disqualified him right off the bat the friday cover by michael kruse september 11 has aided trump more palpably when ted cruz accused him of having new york values during a presidential debate hosted by the fox business channel in january trump parried deftly neutralizing the question in one fell swoop when the world trade center came down i saw something that no place on earth could have handled more beautifully more humanely than new york you had two 110 story buildings come crashing down thousands of people killed and the cleanup started the next day and it was the most horrific cleanup probably in the history of doing this i was down there and i ve never seen anything like it and the people in new york fought and fought and fought we rebuilt downtown manhattan and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved new york and loved new yorkers and i have to tell you that was a very insulting statement that ted made fifteen years ago before september 11 a presidential candidate would have had to answer the awkward question cruz was trying to plant head on if you grew up in new york city in a life of luxury and comfort going into bankruptcy four times how can you understand the concerns of average americans before september 11 would trump have been able to deliver an answer satisfying enough to win over 40 percent of the republican electorate maybe but back then it would ve been a whole lot harder clinton has tried to do employ the same argument that trump used to swat away an opponent s criticisms asked about her wall street contributors at a november 2015 debate in iowa she pivoted where were we attacked we were attacked in downtown manhattan where wall street is i did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild that was good for new york it was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country her pivot was awkward even tacky some said but the fact remained september 11 helped neutralize concerns about her ties to new york history dept by michael kruse the friday cover by garrett m graff now with less than two months left in the presidential race new york continues to play an outsized role in the election both campaigns are based out of the city former mayor rudy giuliani is among trump s most active surrogates while his successor michael bloomberg has endorsed clinton and is making a major play in senate and house races throughout the country come the morning of november 9 a new yorker will likely be the president elect of the united states as for the secession talk that s disappeared altogether perhaps because the city now feels like it s now more a part of the rest of the country than it was 20 years ago still that 2004 new york magazine piece proved oddly prescient even if its forecast was a bit off after seceding senior wrote all that d be left would be normalizing relations with the united states eventually we d find that special someone that perfect ambassador who both speaks the red state language but still unambiguously represents new york i m thinking the donald california by
