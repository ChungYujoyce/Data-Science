advertisement supported by in a speech on the united states china policy the vice president said companies should adhere to american values he criticized nike and the n b a by edward wong washington vice president mike pence criticized american companies on thursday for trying to silence speech that expresses support for democratic liberal values in order to maintain access to the chinese market saying the corporations should adhere to american principles while doing business with china in a wide ranging policy speech on what he called the fundamental restructuring of our relationship with china mr pence accused nike of checking its conscience at the door and owners and players in the n b a of siding with the chinese communist party by suppressing support for the pro democracy movement in hong kong he highlighted those examples to make a wider point about how american companies often make compromises with china that put them at odds with western liberal values and the long term effect this has on candid discussion of china among americans by exploiting corporate greed beijing is attempting to influence american public opinion coercing corporate america mr pence said and far too many american multinational corporations have kowtowed to the lure of china s money and markets by muzzling not only criticism of the chinese communist party but even affirmative expressions of american values the n b a this month came under widespread criticism including from american lawmakers in both parties when it initially appeared to give some support in a confusing mix of english and chinese statements to a chinese government attack on a houston rockets executive who had expressed sympathy for the pro democracy movement in hong kong in a tweet mr pence speaking at a wilson center event at the conrad hotel said that nike stores in china had removed rockets merchandise during the controversy nike did not respond to a request for comment and some of the n b a s biggest players and owners who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of the people of china he said in siding with the chinese communist party and silencing free speech the n b a is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime a progressive corporate culture that willfully ignores the abuse of human rights is not progressive it s repressive he added in an attempt to inject american partisan politics into the issue people associated with the n b a pushed back later thursday we ve adhered to our core values from the first moment adam silver the commissioner of the n b a said on the tnt show inside the nba and i ll just say once again we re going to double down on engaging with the people of china and india and throughout africa around the world regardless of their governments charles barkley the retired player who is now an analyst on the show was more blunt vice president pence needs to shut the hell up he said all american companies are doing business in china in his speech mr pence went on to say that the trump administration sought to build a new relationship with china based on mutual candor and was not seeking to decouple the economies the two largest in the world the language of mr pence s speech while still confrontational highlighted the potential for positive engagement to a larger degree than the one he delivered last october at the hudson institute washington and beijing have been struggling to settle a bitter trade war that president trump started in july 2018 the two sides are trying to complete a tentative initial deal that still does not address the major issues including access to technology administration officials are clashing with one another over the degree to which the two nations and their companies should share technology even before the start of the trade war national security officials in washington had announced that the united states was in an era of great power competition with china and russia that idea is enshrined in mr trump s national security strategy though mr trump himself rarely talks about strategic or human rights issues involving china and he has boasted that he and president xi jinping are close friends mr pence and secretary of state mike pompeo have taken a harder line on china in their public pronouncements the united states seeks engagement with china and china s engagement with the wider world but engagement in a manner consistent with fairness mutual respect and the international rules of commerce mr pence said but so far it appears the chinese communist party continues to resist a true opening or a convergence with global norms he noted that since his hawkish speech one year ago beijing has still not taken significant action to improve our economic relationship and on many other issues we ve raised beijing s behavior has become even more aggressive and destabilizing he added that appeared to be an acknowledgment that the trade talks have done little to force major structural concessions from china including getting the chinese government to reduce its subsidies to state owned enterprises mr pence listed areas of concerns including china s export of surveillance technology its militarization of the south china sea and its attempts to build infrastructure around the globe including ports that could potentially be used by the people s liberation army navy but nothing in the past year has put on display the chinese communist party s antipathy to liberty so much as the unrest in hong kong he said mr pence closed by saying america is reaching out our hand to china and we hope that soon beijing will reach back this time with deeds not words and with renewed respect for america robert daly the director of the kissinger institute on china and the united states at the wilson center said it was refreshing to hear the administration call on american corporations to represent american values nike and the n b a are no more guilty of kowtowing to beijing than other multinationals however including those in the hospitality technology and commercial aviation industries the real question is to what degree american corporations should be asked or compelled to sacrifice the american value of free markets to the american value of free speech he added combating china s worldwide promotion of illiberalism will not be cost free advocates for tougher measures on china over its repression of muslims most of whom are from the ethnic uighur minority were in the audience i m so glad to have listened said mihrigul tursun who is one of more than one million muslims who have been held in chinese internment camps he talked about the uighur issues in china i hope he takes action there hasn t been any action until now in early october the trump administration imposed some commercial restrictions on chinese technology companies and other organizations believed to be involved in the repression and it said it would impose a visa ban on officials but ms tursun said the united states should impose sanctions on specific chinese officials under the global magnitsky act i ask why america hasn t taken action she said advertisement
