advertisement supported by white house letter by michael d shear washington neither bernie sanders nor donald j trump will repeat barack obama s 2008 victory in the iowa caucuses that is the prediction from tom vilsack a former democratic governor of iowa and onetime presidential hopeful as voters in his home state gather monday to register their first in the nation choices for the presidential nominees mr vilsack who knows his state s political landscape about as well as anyone now serves as the secretary of agriculture the last remaining member of president obama s original cabinet just days before returning to iowa for the final weekend of the campaign there mr vilsack sat down to talk about his state s voters the candidates on both sides and his seven years in mr obama s administration a longtime supporter of hillary clinton who is aggressively backing her bid for the presidency mr vilsack said neither mr sanders nor mr trump both of whom have held large boisterous rallies in recent weeks had managed to electrify voters quite the way mr obama did eight years ago when he nearly doubled the usual democratic turnout in iowa the feel out there it s not the same mr vilsack said it s a version of that but it s by no means the level of intensity he continued you could go into henry county you could go into mills county and you might find a bernie sanders supporter or two but you aren t going to find that same cadre of people who were crazy about barack obama mr vilsack said polls that showed mr sanders and mr trump in front were misleading because they did not reflect the geographic distribution of their support most of the passion for both men is concentrated around iowa s cities mr vilsack said that will help them win caucus gatherings near the cities but it won t help them across the rest of rural iowa he said trump has the same challenge that sanders has i think mr vilsack said if you have a big turnout in des moines that s great but if you lose plymouth o brien cass montgomery mills counties it can overshadow the fact that you had 350 people at ward 1 in des moines you ve got to be smart about this mr vilsack once thought his smarts about iowa could catapult him to the presidency but his 2008 bid for the white house quickly fizzled and he endorsed mrs clinton his efforts to deliver his state for her failed when mrs clinton ran into mr obama s iowa juggernaut now mr vilsack is heading into his final year at the agriculture department where he helped negotiate the 2014 farm bill a nearly 1 trillion measure that had sparked four years of partisan fighting over farm subsidies and support for the food stamp program for the poor mr vilsack was also central in pushing for passage of the healthy hunger free kids act in 2010 the law mandated the use of whole grains vegetables and fruits at schools and required that students select at least one portion of fruits or vegetables at every lunch he has also pushed for the use of biofuels this past month mr vilsack joined ray mabus the secretary of the navy as the guided missile destroyer william p lawrence was filled with biofuel made from beef fat he called it an extraordinary experience and said it is an example of the series of partnerships that has extended the reach of the u s d a mr vilsack is a low key soft spoken man and his job overseeing the nation s farmers has largely kept him out of the spotlight the exception came early in his second year in the job in what he acknowledges was the low point in his career reacting to a video that showed seemingly racist comments from shirley sherrod an agriculture department official in georgia mr vilsack quickly fired her he was forced to publicly apologize to ms sherrod days later when it became clear that the video had been heavily edited by the operators of a conservative website in fact the full video showed ms sherrod offering a lesson in racial tolerance and compassion mr vilsack s apology was direct and rare for washington this is a good woman he said in february of 2010 she s been put through hell i could have done and should have done a better job six years later mr vilsack said the incident had prompted him to lead a transformation at the department after ms sherrod complained that little federal agriculture assistance was being directed to communities where extreme poverty was persistent we changed that mr vilsack said after the incident he noted he worked with ms sherrod to establish a strike force that now operates in 910 counties to direct more than 23 billion in home loans farm loans and other assistance in areas trying to overcome poverty the incident with ms sherrod generated a renewed effort at diversity in the department which now includes one of the most diverse groups of senior executives in the federal government he said and it motivated him to stay in the job throughout the president s administration a rarity in modern day washington it s been a new day he said the reputation of u s d a when i came into this job was that we were the last plantation i don t think people feel that way today mr vilsack was unanimously confirmed as secretary on jan 20 2009 he is by one measure the most loyal member of mr obama s original cabinet the only one who still remains in his original job shaun donovan joined the cabinet as the secretary of housing and urban development and now serves as the director of the office of management and budget but he is still at heart a die hard clinton supporter over the weekend mr vilsack campaigned for mrs clinton with her husband former president bill clinton at a get out the caucus event in iowa falls he dismisses concerns from some democrats that mrs clinton has failed to demonstrate the kind of passion that mr sanders has often displayed at big rallies in iowa and across the country i think there is a different kind of passion that fuels the clinton campaign mr vilsack said it s not the rah rah big rally yelling screaming type of passion it is the passion of perseverance he said iowa women in particular recognize that sense of perseverance in working for a better future for their families and he predicted that their support would help mrs clinton emerge from the caucuses victorious they are not going to be doing high fives and all that kind of stuff he said but they are going to be there on caucus night advertisement
