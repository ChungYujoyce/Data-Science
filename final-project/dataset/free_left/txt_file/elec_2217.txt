george w bush had freedom fries sarah palin had the big gulp and dan quayle had the hollywood portrayal of an unwed single mother named murphy brown for president trump it s paper straws the latest addition to an ever growing list of cultural flash points his campaign is seeking to highlight as part of a base focused reelection effort as cities and coffee chains across the country have adopted policies aimed at limiting environmental damage the president s campaign has targeted what it calls liberal paper straws it s selling a trump branded plastic version as a fundraising tool pointing to the runaway success of the straws which have earned the campaign more than 670 000 in a month communications director tim murtaugh said they represent trump s ability to make a political point using a cultural issue everyday voters can relate to with the trump straws the campaign tapped into widespread disdain for paper straws that simply don t work he said people don t like being told they can t do simple things and so the trump straws were born from straws to wind turbines to socially conservative issues trump is deliberately amplifying public tensions by seizing on divisive topics to energize his base according to campaign aides and white house advisers the president is following much the same strategy that he pursued in 2016 inserting himselfinto the issues his supporters are already discussing and using blunt us against them language without regard to nuance or political correctness as democrats debate policy trump has sought to force his potential rivals to defend the most far reachingcultural ideascirculating within their party it s part and parcel of his long running effort to energize his base at the expense of those who were not for him before and who are not for him today said whit ayres a republican pollster part of his appeal to his base is that he is famously and proudly not politically correct while trump s campaign aides have proactively pushed his politically incorrect message with creative and at times tongue in cheek marketing the president has caught some of his advisers off guard by crudely inflaming culture wars on heavier topics such as race abortion and immigration he has attacked his opponents including four minority congresswomen as un american described entire u s cities many with large minority populations as deplorable and pitted his mostly white base against an increasingly diverse democratic party the president angry at rep elijah e cummings d md for his oversight of the trump administration recently targeted baltimore tweeting that no human being would want to live there and derisively comparing the majority black city s homicide rate to afghanistan the democrat party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear trump said at an aug 1 campaign rally in cincinnati a reference to the four congresswomen he targeted last month with a racist go back to your country taunt like much of what trump does the strategy of inflaming the culture wars carries significant risks democrats say the president is writing off much of the country and giving some of the voters who stayed home in 2016 a reason to vote against him some 2020 democratic candidates have specifically sought to portray trump s constant agitation of political cultural and racial divisions as too exhausting for the country sen kamala d harris calif contrasted her presidential campaign with trump s by saying that voters want a political message about lifting people up and not beating them down people are just tired of what we ve been seeing she told reporters earlier this month in detroit it is tiring and after two mass shootings earlier this month including one authorities think may have been inspired by anti immigrant racism democrats say trump s unwillingness to play the traditional presidential role of national healer and bipartisan problem solver has been laid bare we have a president who has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation former vice president joe biden said aug 7 and that makes winning the battle for the soul of this nation that much harder trump disparaged biden on a day the president had set aside for visiting victims of the shootings that killed 31 people in el paso and dayton ohio watching sleepy joe biden making a speech trump tweeted from air force one as he traveled between the grieving communities sooo boring in recent weeks trump has attacked nike for pulling shoes with the betsy ross flag blamed wind turbines for various community ills and suggested labeling anti fascist demonstrators known as antifa as a domestic terrorist group democrats have also arguably provided trump with some of the fodder he is using in his cultural crusade as the party continues a leftward shift on both economic and social issues he has accused democrats of favoring undocumented immigrants over americans comparing downtrodden u s cities to parts of central america while trump s turn toward more overt racially offensive rhetoric surprised some campaign officials they were much more prepared to follow suit when the president began taking on liberal cities campaign manager brad parscale had already been testing one aspect of the message through the paper straw sales parscale sent out atweet last month lamenting what he characterized as excessive liberalism complete with a picture of a disintegrating paper straw smashed tight in the lid of his cup i m so over paper straws liberalprogress he wrote this is exactly what they would do to the economy as well squeeze it until it doesn t work within hours the campaign website was promoting a new product plastic red straws with trump written down the side as of last week the campaign had sold more than 44 700 packs of 10 at 15 per pack murtaugh said ralph reed chairman of the socially conservative faith and freedom coalition compared trump s ability to capture the cultural zeitgeist to another political figure who transcended politics and entered the mainstream of popular culture he recalled how former alaska governor sarah palin protested a proposed ban on large soft drinks in new york city at the 2013 conservative political action conference during her speech she reached below her podium and pulled out a big gulp taking a sip to the roar of the crowd it was for palin and similarly is for trump today a way to combine a cultural message with policy substance in a way that energizes conservatives and marginalizes the left he said republican allies of president george w bush sought to rebrand french fries as freedom fries in 2003 as part of an effort to galvanize the public and protest the french government s opposition to the iraq war in 1992 vice president dan quayle leaped into the culture wars by publicly castigating the television show murphy brown after the sitcom depicted the lead character choosing to have a baby as an unwed career woman quayle who said in a campaign speech that the show was mocking the importance of fathers later backtracked amid a backlash from critics karine jean pierre a democratic strategist and senior adviser at moveon org said democrats should ignore trump s attempts to goad them into debates over tangential social issues on his terms don t play into the labels and the silliness of where they want to take us she said adding that democrats should take trump on directly when he engages in racist behavior jean pierre said trump who won a narrow electoral college victory in 2016 amid low democratic voter turnout in key states is only energizing liberal voters with his divisive rhetoric attacking democrats over social and cultural issues comes naturally to trump who entered politics via reality television said david urban a 2016 campaign aide who advises the president what he s doing this culture war is going to just excite our base even more in particular people of color she said they re looking at this and they re thinking this is crazy this is not safe this is not okay democrats have to tap into that energy the culture wars are a byproduct of the political wars he said it s the coasts versus mid america it s people who drive teslas versus people who drive john deere tractors and it s being fanned by dueling cable networks trump and his campaign have also seized on policy issues that have emerged in the democratic presidential race including medicare for all decriminalization of unauthorized border crossings and health benefits for undocumented immigrants at the recent democratic presidential debates some candidates appeared to agree that the party should be wary of handing trump another term by embracing a left wing agenda we ve got to talk about the working class issues the people that take a shower after work rep tim ryan d ohio said at a debate last month after cautioning democrats against focusing too much on helping undocumented immigrants a clip of his comments was shared on twitter by the trump campaign ayres the pollster said a base first strategy could work for trump if democrats nominate a candidate who tries to placate democratic activists at the expense of more moderate voters if the democrats nominate someone who can consolidate the non trump majority of the country then they ll have a very good chance to win he said on the other hand if they nominate a far left winger who splits the non trump majority donald trump can be reelected with just his base trump was able to win over some traditionally democratic voters in 2016 by presenting himself as a tough political outsider who would disrupt washington his straight talking approach and with us or against us calls to patriotism are part of his appeal even as they occasionally land him in hot water politically said karl rove who worked as a political strategist for bush others may dress it up but he just goes straight there and he s an everyman so the way he phrases it is as an everyman rove said now it gets him into trouble sometimes so the go back to where you came from was not very artful trump tweeted last month that four democratic congresswomen of color three of them born in the united states the fourth a naturalized citizen should go back to other countries the campaign spent more than a week trying to make the case that the tweets were not about race polls showed that voters found the attacks to be out of bounds and a growing number of americans view the president as a racist but jim demint the chairman of the conservative partnership institute and a former republican senator from south carolina said trump is reaching beyond the traditional republican voter for new audiences by breaking from political tradition i don t know that it s strategy but it turns out to be so much more effective because i just don t think he thinks politically which is kind of refreshing in a lot ways but it gets him in trouble a lot of times he said while rove and other political strategists have long used wedge issues to press a political advantage trump has shifted the republican playbook by expanding beyond socially conservative issues such as abortion and same sex marriage said former trump white house official andy surabian it s not like plastic straws is an issue for social conservatives plastic straws are an issue that touches atheists jews catholics evangelicals surabian said it s an issue that touches pop culture david weigel and dan balz contributed to this report receive the most important pandemic developments in your inbox every
