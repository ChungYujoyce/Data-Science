the following is a transcript of the interview with white house trade adviser peter navarro that aired sunday august 18 2019 on face the nation margaret brennan we now turn to one of the president s key advisors on china white house director of the office of trade and manufacturing policy peter navarro thank you for being here peter navarro good to be with you this morning margaret margaret brennan does the u s stand with these pro democracy demonstrators navarro president has been quite clear that he hopes for a peaceful outcome he s urged people to remain calm it s gratifying today that the protests are peaceful the issue here as your viewers well know is that china promised in a treaty with great britain that the people of hong kong would be able to determine their own future until 2047 and that s an important commitment we hope they ll make that s that s all i can tell you about that margaret brennan there is this perception though that the white house is pulling punches on human rights issues because it wants this trade deal that you are working on finalized will beijing face consequences if there is any kind of crackdown navarro i can tell you that the issue of hong kong has never been part of the trade negotiations i won t speculate about what may or may not happen i think we just need to remain calm encourage the chinese to fulfill their commitments and what i worry about when i go to work every day is creating manufacturing jobs for men and women of america so i think about littoral combat ships being made in marinette wisconsin or combat vehicles in lima ohio or getting a new production line in greenville south carolina for the f 16 so that s my mission at the white house and that s my lane margaret brennan so in that vein we ve had a strong economy navarro we have a strong economy margaret brennan low employment unemployment navarro historically low margaret brennan historically low navarro for blacks women hispanics margaret brennan s p 500 up something like 15 percent on the year navarro it s a beautiful thing margaret brennan rocky week though navarro beautiful thing margaret brennan and there are now some signs emerging that perhaps there is a slowdown coming what are the odds that you see of a recession navarro so before i came to the white house i spent the better part of 20 years forecasting the business cycle and related stock market trends what i m seeing looking at all the macro tea leaves is a very strong trump economy and bullish stock markets through 2020 and beyond and the the things i m seeing now in the short run that your viewers can can watch to see if they come to fruition would be for example the federal reserve aggressively lowering rates through the end of the year the fed raised rates too far too fast they ve cost us a full point of gdp growth margaret brennan they are expected to lower them navarro they are expected to second thing the european central bank has announced a very aggressive stimulus package cutting rates and quantitative easing why does that matter for us margaret brennan central bank buying securities navarro correct and the that will lift the european economy and what that matters for us is they ll buy more of our exports there s a a likelihood that china will engage in a second round of fiscal stimulus which will help the emerging markets which deliver the commodities to the chinese manufacturing machine and and most important in the short run for america here is by early october we hope that congress rises above partisan politics and passes the us mexico canada agreement that will add several hundred thousand jobs to our economy margaret brennan has speaker pelosi agreed to do that navarro speaker pelosi is working closely with ambassador robert lighthizer and we are trying to work with the democratic side to basically address all our concerns about enforcement and other things this is no hyperbole here the biggest deal in world history but it is also in my judgment one of the smartest and best deals and what it does the central premise of the deal is to bring our manufacturing jobs back here to us soil from the giant sucking sound that was nafta margaret brennan that would be helping to settle the trade dispute with canada and mexico on the issue of china though president trump here he is earlier this week explaining why he pulled back on a pledge to roll out some tariffs related to consumer products president trump sot we re doing this for christmas season just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on us customers which so far they ve had virtually none margaret brennan so have u s retailers convinced the president that it is american importers and consumers who will pay the price for these tariffs navarro so so let s be clear we ve had tariffs on for over a year the chinese have borne the entire burden of that by slashing their prices and reducing the value of their currency by 12 percent margaret brennan the president just said there though navarro correct margaret brennan that he s doing this out navarro now well let s look margaret brennan of concern it could hurt consumers navarro let s look at why the president delayed half of the tariffs until december 15th i was there in the oval office when a group of business people came in and made the following very persuasive argument they had already bought everything that was going to be on our shelves but they d done it in dollar contracts which means they weren t able to shift the burden back to the chinese but they also told the president quite clearly that they were also moving their production sourcing and supply chain out of china as fast as possible and so beyond december 15th there will be no impacts on consumers because of all of that so it was a goodwill gesture that the president made to the chinese it was a wise decision to delay the tariffs to december 15th and in the meantime half of those tariffs are actually going on september 1st the tariffs are working they re important part of the strategy to bring the chinese to the negotiating table and i think margaret it s important whenever we talk about the tariffs we talk about what we re fighting for margaret brennan but they haven t made any concessions just yet the chinese and in fact navarro so margaret brennan they ve pulled back on some promises navarro yes but but like as i say it s important for your viewers to understand what we re fighting for and it s the hacking of our computers to see our trade secrets forced technology transfer as a condition of market access it s the intellectual property theft the dumping the state owned enterprises the currency manipulations margaret brennan and that is why so many people on wall street cheer this hard line and navarro and they they do margaret brennan so many people in middle america do too but navarro but let me give you the margaret brennan then you have farmers coming out and warning that they are losing markets that they are getting hurt navarro but margaret brennan which is why the taxpayers are bailing them out and you have concerns from wall street navarro understood margaret brennan being indicated here with pullbacks in future purchases of things like tractors navarro so let let me say two things one is the seventh act of aggression which i want to mention is the killing of americans with made in china fentanyl and opioids by the end of the day it ll be over 100 by the end of the week it ll be over a thousand and china made in china opioids are killing over fifty thousand americans a year that in and of itself is grounds for for a very tough stand against china with respect to the farmers president trump has the backs of farmers he s demonstrated that with sonny perdue the department of agriculture secretary by setting up a program where we use whatever revenues we collect from the the tariffs and whatever else we need to make sure the farmers are whole in america the farmers have their back the farmers know that they re they re in the target of the bully china but we re not going to let that buckle the president s knees he is committed to this fight he has the backing of the public margaret brennan but you do not naravvo he has the backing margaret brennan but you do accept navarro of people like joe manchin and other democrats on capitol hill margaret brennan a lot of people like this navarro we are aligned margaret brennan but they don t like the tools navarro yea margaret brennan like tariffs and so navarro well margaret brennan how can you navarro i understand margaret brennan promise the american public that they will not feel the impact of these tariffs backfire to them if the people who sell them goods like retailers convinced the president that they would navarro so let me say two things we ve had tariffs on for over a year 250 billion dollars worth and we haven t seen a thing in terms of inflation we ve seen the the chinese margaret brennan economic indicators navarro devalue margaret brennan are backward looking navarro devalue margaret brennan versus the market which is forward looking navarro devalue their currency and and slash their prices going forward what we re seeing is the fleeing of the supply chain what s happening is retailers are finding other sources of supply and we re getting investment back here in america and by the way consumers spend 14 trillion dollars a year if we have 10 percent tariffs on 300 billion dollars worth of goods margaret brennan yea navarro that s 30 billion dollars even if all of that were passed on to consumers you know what that would be that would be one fifth of one percent on the consumer price index margaret brennan alright navarro it s nothing margaret brennan we have to leave it there navarro thank you margaret brennan peter navarro thank you for joining us navarro nice nice to be with you on face the nation watch cbs news
