advertisement supported by for most of his life michael flynn has swung from being a good soldier to an agent of disruption by sharon lafraniere and julian e barnes washington there have always been two sides to michael t flynn there was the rebellious teenager who surfed during hurricanes and spent a night in juvenile reformatory then there was the adult who buckled down joined the army and rose to become a three star general mr flynn was a lifelong democrat who served president barack obama as a top intelligence officer he also called mr obama a liar after being forced out of the job and reinvented himself as a republican foreign policy adviser mr flynn criticized retired generals who used their stars for themselves for their businesses he appeared to do the same thing as a consultant but the two sides of mr flynn were perhaps never so stark as in the criminal case against him that ended abruptly on thursday to the astonishment of much of official washington after pleading guilty in 2017 to lying to federal investigators about his contacts with a russian diplomat mr flynn cooperated with the special counsel saying he was being a good soldier and earning prosecutors praise then he recanted his confession and began what some allies saw as a reckless gamble to recast himself as an innocent victim of a justice system run amok that gamble paid off this week when in an extraordinary reversal the justice department abandoned his prosecution saying he never should have been charged current and former federal law enforcement officials expressed disbelief and dismay calling the move an unprecedented blow to the justice department s integrity and independence former president barack obama in remarks to former members of his administration said he feared that not just institutional norms but our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk mr flynn transformed his case into a political cause that resonated in the conservative echo chamber led by his lawyer sidney powell and representative devin nunes republican of california and a close ally of the president s mr flynn s backers worked to wipe away the mistrust of some republicans over his cooperation with law enforcement and turn him into a right wing hero ms powell dug up documents she insisted showed that her client was as much of a victim of malfeasance by the f b i as mr trump had been ultimately attorney general william p barr joined the battle granting mr flynn another turnabout in a life filled with them michael t flynn 61 grew up in middletown r i the sixth of nine children his father was an army sergeant who became a banker his mother ran a secretarial school before earning a law degree at age 63 the family was squeezed into a three bedroom one bathroom oceanfront cottage finances were tight i was one of those nasty tough kids hellbent on breaking rules for the adrenaline high and hard wired just enough not to care about the consequences mr flynn wrote in his 2016 book the field of fight some serious and unlawful activity he wrote led to his arrest he nearly flunked out of his freshman year at the university of rhode island earning a 1 2 grade point average but the r o t c awarded him a three year scholarship and he found his calling in the military for much of mr flynn s career former colleagues said his mentors and superior officers let his talents flourish and kept his disruptive tendencies in check in his book he described himself as a rebel at heart i m a maverick an atypical square peg in a round hole he wrote as a young officer in 1983 he talked his way onto the military force that invaded grenada there he dove off a 40 foot cliff to rescue two soldiers foundering in waters off the coast he was scolded for the unauthorized rescue but also earned respect his boldness later translated into strategies that seemed fresh and welcome when the military was mired in wars in afghanistan and iraq in afghanistan he championed new ways to fuse intelligence gathering and military operations his partnership with gen stanley a mcchrystal the commander of american led forces in afghanistan at the time shielded him from critics general mcchrystal also acted as a brake ensuring that mr flynn s most outlandish ideas were confined to brainstorming sessions by the time mr flynn arrived at the defense intelligence agency as a three star general in 2012 cracks were beginning to show mr obama had fired general mcchrystal a move that deeply distressed mr flynn he executed a reorganization of the agency that is still in effect but his chaotic management style and increasingly hard edged views about counterterrorism gave colleagues pause and his superiors viewed him as insubordinate former pentagon officials said his defenders said the obama administration bristled at his tough line on iran his two year term was not extended thrusting him into the civilian world at age 55 an embittered man mr flynn had flourished with the special operation forces in iraq where his colleagues could tolerate adjust and manage what was functional and dysfunctional with mike flynn said douglas h wise a former c i a officer who became mr flynn s deputy at the defense intelligence agency in the political arena mr wise said he no longer had this kind of adult supervision as a military man mr flynn seemed oblivious to wealth un self consciously parking his 1986 buick park avenue in a pentagon parking lot dotted with cadillacs and lexuses but as a civilian he founded a consulting firm flynn intel group that attracted high paying clients in a decision that appalled some friends he agreed to give a speech in 2015 to rt russia s state controlled television network for about 45 000 he was seated at the head table next to president vladimir v putin of russia the next year he pulled in at least 1 8 million from private intelligence and security services consulting and speeches about 530 000 came for work to discredit an enemy of president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey mr flynn did not register with the justice department as a foreign agent as required under lobbying disclosure laws until the following spring when he was under federal scrutiny mr flynn s politics seemed to shift even more than his finances he heavily criticized the obama administration especially over iran policy his pragmatic approach of old gave way in private conversations with reporters and students to almost hostile views to islam in his book he called for the destruction of the iranian government publicly he sneered at mr obama for avoiding the term radical islam and implied that mr obama was a secret muslim i m not going to sit here and say he s islamic he told one of the country s largest anti muslim groups act for america in 2016 but he said the president didn t grow up as an american kid and held values totally different than mine colin powell the former secretary of state called mr flynn right wing nutty but his views resonated with mr trump their initial mid 2015 meeting scheduled for a half hour lasted 90 minutes and prompted mr flynn to begin advising the campaign he enthralled conservatives at the republican national convention in july 2016 when he led a chorus of lock her up chants against hillary clinton within weeks mr flynn became the subject of an f b i counterintelligence inquiry into the trump campaign s links to russia his code name was razor by january 2017 with mr trump s inauguration imminent the f b i had decided that insufficient evidence existed that mr flynn conspired with the russians wittingly or unwittingly but the f b i s interest was rekindled when agents learned that in late december during the presidential transition mr flynn had advised the russian ambassador sergey i kislyak that the kremlin refrain from reacting to the obama administration s imposition of sanctions for russia s election interference mr flynn also asked that russia delay or defeat an upcoming united nations security council resolution condemning israel those phone calls were problematic because mr flynn was attempting to intervene in foreign policy as a private citizen a potential violation of a federal law albeit one rarely enforced mr flynn also told the incoming vice president mike pence that he had not discussed sanctions with russia mr pence repeated that assertion on television raising concerns at the justice department that mr flynn had lied to him and that the russians could use the truth to blackmail mr flynn at the f b i his file had lingered in abeyance not yet formally closed our utter incompetence actually helps us peter strzok an f b i counterintelligence agent texted a bureau lawyer because of a bureaucratic oversight agents would not have to justify a reopening of the inquiry four days after the inauguration the f b i sent two agents to question mr flynn at the white house caught off guard justice department officials hit the roof when they found out one said mr flynn told the agents he had not asked russia to act in any specific way in response to the u n resolution or the imposition of sanctions those denials did not save his job he was soon forced to resign even then mr trump tried to protect him from further investigation i hope you can see your way clear to letting this go to letting flynn go he told james b comey then the f b i director whom mr trump later fired that december mr flynn pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his conversations with the russian official and pledged to cooperate with the inquiry by the special counsel robert s mueller iii into russia s 2016 election interference about a year later mr flynn had second thoughts after a federal judge warned that he might not be sentenced to probation he fired his legal team his legal bills had amounted to nearly 3 million forcing him to sell his alexandria va house and move to his rhode island home in a court filing mr flynn said he had only pleaded guilty because his lawyers advised him to one of the ways a person becomes a three star general is by being a good soldier taking orders being part of a team and trusting people who provide information and support he wrote even before she formally took over mr flynn s defense last june ms powell put together a public relations and legal campaign to exonerate him making the case on capitol hill and in conservative media in appearances on fox news ms powell linked her client s plight to other examples of what she saw as government overreach she also stitched mr flynn s story to conspiracy theories about career government officials efforts to undermine mr trump both in court filings and conversations with journalists mr nunes a longtime friend of mr flynn and close ally of mr trump joined ms powell in a full throated defense together they reoriented the view of mr flynn on the right from an object of suspicion for cooperating with the special counsel into a conservative cause sidney powell brilliantly shifted the narrative and shrewdly found new allies in the house freedom caucus and fox news commentators said michael pillsbury an informal adviser to mr trump and a scholar at the hudson institute in a letter to mr barr ms powell accused prosecutors and investigators of withholding documents improperly leaking to the media and seeking to entrap her client her evidence included what mr flynn s backers called a smoking gun handwritten notes from bill priestap then the head of f b i counterintelligence what is our goal he asked before the white house interview truth admission or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired the bureau s defenders said the notes proved the f b i s impartiality not its bias but they provoked a fresh wave of indignation from the right the campaign shifted mr trump s thinking as well initially he seemed inclined to believe that mr flynn had done something wrong at least by lying to mr pence more recently he has privately voiced regrets about firing him by the time the justice department dropped the charges against mr flynn on thursday mr trump was calling the investigators who pursued mr flynn human scum the next day he praised mr nunes s relentless efforts to take them on devin nunes he wouldn t stop mr trump said he saw it before anybody the president has begun musing about rehiring mr flynn but some advisers to mr trump said they viewed mr flynn as too much of a loose cannon for the campaign trail or the white house in the end that side of mr flynn may prevent him from finding that final bit of redemption adam goldman contributed reporting from washington and maggie haberman and jeremy w peters from new york advertisement
