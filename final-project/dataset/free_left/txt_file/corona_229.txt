written by eric kleefeld published 03 11 20 12 34 pm edt share comment this past friday president donald trump expressed surprise upon learning that people die from seasonal flu in fact it killed his grandfather fox news figures have similarly downplayedthe dangers of coronavirus by comparing it to the deaths that occur from the flu the problem with that comparison is coronavirus is much more deadly to those infected than the seasonal flu and they will spread it to more people because the new disease is also more contagious there is also an extra layer of uncertainty as mortality estimates still vary because of uncertainties about the number of people tested for covid 19 and the population who might have had mild cases but were never tested all told the united states could be looking at a genuine epidemic on the scale of what is now going on in italy on march 6 fox news chief medical correspondent dr marc siegel told sean hannity that at worst at worst worst case scenario it couldbe the flu on saturday night fox news host jeanine pirro boldly declared that all the talk about coronavirus being so much more deadly doesn t reflect reality citation from the march 7 2020 edition of fox news justice with judge jeanine jeanine pirro host now they say the mortality rate for coronavirus is higher than a flu but consider though that we have a flu vaccine and yet in 2019 16 000 americans died from the flu imagine if we did not have the flu vaccine the flu would be a pandemic so all the talk about coronavirus being so much more deadly doesn t reflect reality without a vaccine the flu would be far more deadly of course there are flu vaccines every year while there is no coronavirus vaccine yet available to the public which could take over a year to be tested for safety before it is released on a wide scale trump dug in on monday with a tweet seeming to bemoan a double standard that the country doesn t shut down over the flu compared to what is going on now with the coronavirus interestingly trump s tweet came just six minutes after his own secretary of health and human services alex azar appeared on fox and publicly declared this is a very serious health problem nobody is trying to minimize that on monday s edition of america s newsroom fox business anchor david asman said there was nothing you can argue with about trump s tweet and praised his leadership on the economy as having created a strong foundation for the country to pull through calling it a rainy day fund citation from the march 9 2020 edition of fox news america s newsroom and during his tuesday night show sean hannity downplayed coronavirus fatalities compared to gun violence in chicago and also invoked mortality statistics for the seasonal flu in on screen graphics but noted that by the way still any deaths are tragic later in the segment he decried the politicization of coronavirus and asked for viewers to consider their perspective on the potential pandemic citation from the march 10 2020 edition of fox news hannity sean hannity host now again perspective the standard flu every single year kills tens of thousands of americans now does truth matter does perspective matter well i wish nobody died from the flu i hope nobody else dies from corona we don t want any people dying i lost my parents it sucks but during an appearance later on hannity s show the renowned virologist and head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases dr anthony fauci explained why the fox prime time host was wrong citation from the march 10 2020 edition of fox news hannity dr anthony fauci white house coronavirus task force but sean to make sure your viewers get an accurate idea about what goes on you mentioned seasonal flu the mortality for seasonal flu is 0 1 the mortality for this is about 2 2 5 it s probably lower than that it s probably closer to 1 but even if it s 1 it s 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu you ve got to make sure that people understand that fittingly enough hannity had earlier referred to fauci as the adult in the room while promoting his appearance on the show and speaking of an adult in a room on wednesday morning samerica s newsroom co anchor sandra smith conducted an interview via skype with american conservative union head matt schlapp who has been staying at home since his exposure to an unnamed individual at the group s recent conservative political action conference who later tested positive for covid 19 and with that organization now working to contain the political fallout schlapp s pronouncements clearly crossed the line between cautious optimism and vigilance on one sideand pollyanaism on the other contradicting the express warnings of medical experts citation from the march 11 2020 edition of fox news america s newsroom sandra smith co anchor some republicans are now taking extra precaution after coming in contact with someone at cpac who later tested positive for the coronavirus those same republicans are now under self quarantine after also interacting with the president himself my next guest is one of them matt schlapp chairman of the american conservative union he joins us now by skype how are you feeling matt schlapp great never had a symptom we have no health problems in the schlapp family thank god i m glad the president is completely healthy and i m glad the cpac community is healthy so i think coming out of cpac one thing we ve learned is even when there is an infected person amongst thousands and thousands in our case over 10 000 people it is very very difficult to contract this virus this is particularly dangerous misinformation to be spreading given the lack of testing in the united states thus far article 05 26 20 1 24 pm edt video audio 05 26 20
