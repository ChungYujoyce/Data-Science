whether you are conservative or liberal let me try to make you feel better it might not work but it s worth a shot americans are still on the whole an uncommonly decent people and that includes people of all parties trump supporters and trump haters over the past 60 years our country has undergone massive shifts in technology in economic arrangements in values and in demography we ve doubled in population entered the information age expanded the frontiers of civil rights and seen whites go from 90 percent to 72 percent of americans for all the massiveness of these changes we remain overall peaceful and law abiding and well meaning we drive soberly we watch sports matches civilly we support a massive nonprofit sector when we head to our local school gym or retirement home lounge to cast a ballot in an election all sides operate with a basic sense of trust perhaps in your darker contemplations of the united states you ve wondered if oliver stone or alex jones is right that our democracy is a sham a rigged system controlled by hidden interests certainly there is much that is corrupt revolving doors in government financial rules written by wall street fines for law breaking seen as a cost of doing business and many unpopular donor class policies supported by both parties but bad laws and greed are the primary basis of much of this not outright murderousness some of those living large on our current injustices might be unsavory but collectively they are not monsters they ll put thumbs on the scale when possible but they will not blow up the scale and steal elections they will not launch south american style coups they will not assassinate elected officials when donald trump a man the establishment hates vowed to torpedo much of the current system he did so with the protection of the secret service when voters decided to upend the republican establishment the republican establishment meekly submitted our corruption is still gentle our revolutions still bloodless voters have been ill served by the two parties because the areas of washington consensus did not reflect a popular consensus both parties favor globalism free trade and loosened borders but millions of americans favor nationalism isolationism and nativism the latter terms are customarily used as ones of abuse but the simple fact is that some people want to connect more with the outer world while others want to keep their environments more stable and enclosed a decent political system takes both desires into account and looks for compromise not winner takes all people on the left often speak of leaders who can be a voice for the voiceless trump whether you like him or not is that his manner of delivery may not be defensible but he s the first to channel something that had to come out eventually he sets the stage for others to set up political choices more in tune with the splits of americans which won t resolve our differences but will make some of them less bitter if trump wins he might threaten to deport 11 million people but he will not do it no one will but if trump gets a border fence built i predict it would not bother most people there is already a wall south of san diego do you wish to see it torn down or do you not much care either way my guess is you do not much care either way if a wall causes most of the illegal migration across the southern border to be stopped then much of the bitterness surrounding the issue will fade away amnesty will become easier not harder many of the worst erosions of our liberties and checks and balances have occurred in a slow and creeping manner thanks to a court decision here an executive action there or a law with unintended consequences republicans failed miserably to keep the power grabs of the george w bush white house in check but democrats have hardly been models of self policing when it comes to the barack obama white house either with trump all sides would be so vigilant and frightened that the threats to the rule of law might be less not more with his presidency to put it another way trump might be less of a threat to democracy than say marco rubio i can t promise this but it s not an outlandish possibility trump will win only if he can prove himself capable of impulse control and the demands of the presidency if he continues to go mad with his pronouncements if he makes a hash of his debates if he fails to act as a statesmen would he will lose decisively he could rely upon the issue of immigration as a flotation device in the primaries he can t do that in the general election yes americans are fed up with many things and they are readier for risk than normal but they are not suicidal if you trust in their judgment we will be o k i think you should and i think we
