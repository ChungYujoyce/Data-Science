advertisement supported by ms reade a former senate aide has accused mr biden of assaulting her in 1993 and says she told others about it a biden spokeswoman said the allegation is false and former senate office staff members do not recall such an incident by lisa lerer and sydney ember washington a former senate aide who last year accused joseph r biden jr of inappropriate touching has made an allegation of sexual assault against the former vice president the democratic party s presumptive presidential nominee this fall the former aide tara reade who briefly worked as a staff assistant in mr biden s senate office told the new york times that in 1993 mr biden pinned her to a wall in a senate building reached under her clothing and penetrated her with his fingers a friend said that ms reade told her the details of the allegation at the time another friend and a brother of ms reade s said she told them over the years about a traumatic sexual incident involving mr biden a spokeswoman for mr biden said the allegation was false in interviews several people who worked in the senate office with ms reade said they did not recall any talk of such an incident or similar behavior by mr biden toward her or any women two office interns who worked directly with ms reade said they were unaware of the allegation or any treatment that troubled her last year ms reade and seven other women came forward to accuse mr biden of kissing hugging or touching them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable ms reade told the times then that mr biden had publicly stroked her neck wrapped his fingers in her hair and touched her in ways that made her uncomfortable soon after ms reade made the new allegation in a podcast interview released on march 25 the times began reporting on her account and seeking corroboration through interviews documents and other sources the times interviewed ms reade on multiple days over hours as well as those she told about mr biden s behavior and other friends the times has also interviewed lawyers who spoke to ms reade about her allegation nearly two dozen people who worked with mr biden during the early 1990s including many who worked with ms reade and the other seven women who criticized mr biden last year to discuss their experiences with him no other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting nor did any former biden staff members corroborate any details of ms reade s allegation the times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by mr biden on thursday ms reade filed a report with the washington d c police saying she was the victim of a sexual assault in 1993 the public incident report provided to the times by ms reade and the police does not mention mr biden by name but she said the complaint was about him ms reade said she filed the report to give herself an additional degree of safety from potential threats filing a false police report may be punishable by a fine and imprisonment ms reade who worked as a staff assistant helping manage the office interns said she also filed a complaint with the senate in 1993 about mr biden she said she did not have a copy of it and such paperwork has not been located the biden campaign said it did not have a complaint the times reviewed an official copy of her employment history from the senate that she provided showing she was hired in december 1992 and paid by mr biden s office until august 1993 the seven other women who had complained about mr biden told the times this month that they did not have any new information about their experiences to add but several said they believed ms reade s account last year mr biden 77 acknowledged the women s complaints about his conduct saying his intentions were benign and promising to be more mindful and respectful of people s personal space in response to ms reade s allegation kate bedingfield a deputy biden campaign manager said in a statement vice president biden has dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around violence against women he authored and fought for the passage and reauthorization of the landmark violence against women act he firmly believes that women have a right to be heard and heard respectfully such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press what is clear about this claim it is untrue this absolutely did not happen ms reade made her new allegation public as mr biden was closing in on the democratic presidential nomination after winning a string of primaries against his chief rival senator bernie sanders ms reade who describes herself as a third generation democrat said she originally favored marianne williamson and senator elizabeth warren in the race but voted for mr sanders in the california primary last month she said her decision to come forward had nothing to do with politics or helping mr sanders and said neither his campaign nor the trump campaign had encouraged her to make her allegation president trump has been accused of sexual assault and misconduct by more than a dozen women who have described a pattern of behavior that went far beyond the accusations against mr biden the president also directed illegal payments including 130 000 to a pornographic film actress stormy daniels before the 2016 election to silence women about alleged affairs with mr trump according to federal prosecutors mr trump has even boasted about his mistreatment of women in a 2005 recording he described pushing himself on women and said he would grab them by the pussy bragging that he could get away with anything because of his celebrity even so mr trump has at times attacked opponents over their treatment of women the president has not mentioned ms reade s allegation which has circulated on social media and in liberal and conservative news outlets ms reade 56 told the times that the assault happened in the spring of 1993 she said she had tracked down mr biden to deliver an athletic bag when he pushed her against a cold wall started kissing her neck and hair and propositioned her he slid his hand up her cream colored blouse she said and used his knee to part her bare legs before reaching under her skirt it happened at once he s talking to me and his hands are everywhere and everything is happening very quickly she recalled he was kissing me and he said very low do you want to go somewhere else ms reade said she pulled away and mr biden stopped he looked at me kind of almost puzzled or shocked she said he said come on man i heard you liked me at the time ms reade said she worried whether she had done something wrong to encourage his advances he pointed his finger at me and he just goes you re nothing to me nothing she said then he took my shoulders and said you re ok you re fine mr biden walked down the hallway ms reade said and she cleaned up in a restroom made her way home and sobbing called her mother who encouraged her to immediately file a police report instead ms reade said she complained to marianne baker mr biden s executive assistant as well as to two top aides dennis toner and ted kaufman about harassment by mr biden not mentioning the alleged assault the staff declined to take action ms reade said after which she filed a written complaint with a senate personnel office she said office staff took away most of her duties including supervising the interns assigned her a windowless office and made the work environment uncomfortable for her she said mr kaufman later told her she was not a good fit in the office giving her a month to look for a job ms reade never secured another position in washington in an interview mr kaufman a longtime friend of mr biden s who was his chief of staff at the time said i did not know her she did not come to me if she had i would have remembered her mr toner who worked for mr biden for over three decades said the allegation was out of character for mr biden other senators and office staffs had reputations for harassing women at work and partying after hours according to those who worked in the office at the time mr biden was known for racing to catch the train to get home to wilmington del every night it s just so preposterous that senator biden would be faced with these allegations said mr toner who was deputy chief of staff when ms reade worked in the office i don t remember her i don t remember this conversation and i would remember this conversation the biden campaign issued a statement from ms baker mr biden s executive assistant from 1982 to 2000 i never once witnessed or heard of or received any reports of inappropriate conduct period not from ms reade not from anyone she said i have absolutely no knowledge or memory of ms reade s accounting of events which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional and as a manager melissa lefko a former staff assistant for mr biden from 1992 to 1993 said she did not remember ms reade but she recalled that mr biden s office was a very supportive environment for women and said she had never experienced any kind of harassment there when you work on the hill everyone knows who the good guys are and who the bad guys are and biden was a good guy she said ms reade said that she could not remember the exact time date or location of the assault but that it occurred in a semiprivate place in the senate office complex a friend said that ms reade told her about the alleged assault at the time in 1993 a second friend recalled ms reade telling her in 2008 that mr biden had touched her inappropriately and that she d had a traumatic experience while working in his office both friends agreed to speak to the times on the condition of anonymity to protect the privacy of their families and their self owned businesses ms reade said she also told her brother who has confirmed parts of her account publicly but who did not speak to the times and her mother who has since died at the time of the alleged assault ms reade said she was responsible for coordinating the interns in the office two former interns who worked with her said they never heard her describe any inappropriate conduct by mr biden or saw her directly interact with him in any capacity but recalled that she abruptly stopped supervising them in april before the end of their internship others who worked in the office at the time said they remembered ms reade but not any inappropriate behavior friends and former co workers describe ms reade as friendly caring compassionate and trustworthy though perhaps a bit na ve a single mother she changed her name for protection after leaving an abusive marriage in the late 1990s and put herself through law school in seattle after leaving mr biden s office she eventually returned to the west coast where she worked for a state senator as an advocate for domestic violence survivors testifying as an expert witness in court and for animal rescue organizations during her time in mr biden s office he was working to pass the violence against women act which mr biden has described as his proudest legislative accomplishment in 2017 ms reade retweeted praise for mr biden and his work combating sexual assault in more recent months her feed has featured support for mr sanders and criticism of mr biden ms reade said she did not disclose the sexual assault allegation last year when she spoke out because she was scared after her initial complaints were reported last year by a local california newspaper ms reade said she faced a wave of criticism and death threats as well as accusations that she was a russian agent because of medium posts and tweets several of which are now deleted she had written praising president vladimir putin ms reade said that she was not working for russia and did not support mr putin and that her comments were pulled out of context from a novel she was writing at the time it was trying to smear me and distract from what happened but it won t change the facts of what happened in 1993 she said she called her praise for mr putin misguided ms reade tried to get legal and public relations support from the time s up legal defense fund an initiative established by prominent women in hollywood to fight sexual harassment her outreach to the group was first reported by the intercept as it has for thousands of people who have contacted the group the time s up legal defense fund which does not represent clients gave her a list of lawyers with expertise in such cases she said she contacted every single one but none took her case two lawyers confirmed speaking to ms reade but declined to comment on the record about her or the allegation skdknickerbocker the political consulting firm where mr biden s chief strategist anita dunn works as a managing director has a contract with the time s up legal defense fund ms dunn has never worked with the fund and her firm was not told of ms reade s request according to officials at the fund ms reade also contacted at least one of the women who spoke out along with her last year about mr biden s penchant for physical contact lucy flores a former nevada state assemblywoman who accused mr biden of making her uncomfortable by kissing and touching her during a 2014 campaign event exchanged a few emails last year with ms reade but said ms reade did not share her full story biden is not just a hugger ms flores said biden very clearly was invading women s spaces without their consent in a way that made them feel uncomfortable does he potentially have the capacity to go beyond that that s the answer everyone is trying to get at transcript from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily today a former senate aide to joe biden has accused him of assaulting her in 1993 my colleague lisa lerer examines the allegation it s tuesday april 14 lisa when did you begin reporting this story so about a year ago we were reporting on allegations from a number of women who came out and said that joe biden had touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable tonight joe biden is facing troubling accusations nevada democrat lucy flores claims the former vice president inappropriately touched and kissed her head before a rally in 2014 maybe it was a squeeze on the shoulder maybe he smelled their hair out of nowhere i feel joe biden put his hands on my shoulders get up very close to me from behind lean in smell my hair and then plant a slow kiss on the top of my head but this was all happening in public at campaign rallies at fund raisers he put his hands around my head and pulled me in former congressional aide amy lappos told cbs news tonight that joe biden reached for her face and rubbed noses with her during a fundraiser in greenwich connecticut in 2009 and we in the newsroom and in the media we re really grappling with how to think and talk about this behavior this wasn t anything like what had normally come up in a lot of these discussions around metoo like harvey weinstein or any of that and for the record i don t believe that it was a bad intention i m not in any way suggesting that i felt sexually assaulted or sexually harassed i felt invaded i felt that there was a violation of my personal space there was no the women talking about these allegations weren t quite sure what to call it some of them said quite vehemently that they didn t consider it sexual harassment but they wanted the former vice president to be aware of his behavior and how it could make people feel others had a slightly different perspective they thought it was something closer to sexual harassment so this goes on for really a couple weeks and in the end biden he doesn t quite apologize today i want to talk about gestures of support and encouragement that i ve made to women and some men and it made them uncomfortable but he comes out and he makes an online video where he says that he has a very touchy feely kind of political style in my career i ve always tried to make a human connection that s my responsibility i think i shake hands i hug people i grab men and women by the shoulders and say you can do this but he recognizes that times have changed and perhaps he needs to change with them and be more respectful of people s space you know social norms have begun to change they ve shifted and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset and i get it i get it i hear what they re saying i understand it and i ll be much more mindful that s my responsibility my responsibility and i ll meet it and then i met tara reade and she had called me with sort of similar kind of story joe biden had touched her he d put his hands in her hair he touched her shoulders all in public in ways that really made her feel uncomfortable but her story had a little bit of a different twist so she at the time had been working in his senate office and this was about i think december 1992 to august 1993 she was a low level staffer a staff assistant and she said that the touching had gone beyond just hands in the hair and squeezes of the shoulder that there had been harassment hm she says he had asked her to serve drinks at a cocktail party he had commented on her looks in the office in front of other people and that she felt that he had cultivated a culture in his office that fostered and permitted this kind of sexual harassment and what did you do with reade s story with that reporting well i talked to her i talked to her friend who corroborated a lot of what she was telling me we did use her allegations to call a whole bunch of people who had worked in joe biden s office in the 1990s particularly the early 1990s which was the period that tara reade was working there to see if they remembered any kind of harassment what the environment of the office was at the time but we didn t really come up with anything all that surprising or explosive nobody really confirmed her account at that time so we actually didn t end up reporting them in the paper we had already reported on a number of allegations from these women who said that they were uncomfortable with joe biden s touching and we just sort of moved on and the political world did too everyone moved on to the next battle there was the mueller report to contend with and then a really competitive primary presidential debates started so this issue of the unwanted touching and tara s story just never came back up mm hmm and lisa do you think that has something to do with the fact that biden confronted this talked about it and said he was learning from it oh for sure but he was really forced into confronting it i mean this was a period in march in april before biden had formally announced his presidential bid where he was going through the process of reconciling a lot of his record with the current mores of the democratic party he was dealing with his criminal justice record he was dealing with his positions on abortion and sort of moving to the left with the party and so i think that quasi apology video was part of that process you have a democratic party that s acutely aware of issues of racial and gender bias and biden had to eventually reconcile those criticisms whether he felt they were fair or not with where the party was but ultimately he didn t pay much of a price for it he announced his campaign a couple three or so weeks later his opponents never made an issue of this and everything sort of moved on ok so what happens next well you have the primary race so biden as we all know nosedives then he comes back up he becomes the front runner and around that time hello and welcome to the katie halper show a woman goes on a podcast where would you like to start where does the story start for you well the story starts when i went to work for joe biden and levels a really serious serious accusation against joe biden which is basically that he sexually assaulted her and my body i was shaking everywhere because it was cold all of a sudden and i was i don t know i feel like i was shaking just everywhere and i was trying to grasp what had just happened and what i should do and that woman who tells her story in great detail on this podcast is tara reade so what are you thinking at this point because you had already talked to this woman and she had not mentioned this kind of accusation right well i must admit i m a little confused because it didn t come up at all and so the first thing i did was pull up my notes and when i look over my notes and i read the story she had told me a year ago there s some holes in that story she told me things i remember thinking that her reaction was maybe a bit extreme for what she said she was experiencing in the office at the time that maybe make a little more sense if this other thing had in fact happened this sexual assault so i wondered first of all had she been truthful the first time around was she being truthful now and also whether i had asked the right questions did i miss something because i hadn t called back because i got caught up with the dynamics of this primary so at this point after tara reade has gone on this podcast she has made this claim and you re trying to figure out why she didn t first tell you that same information how are you now approaching this story journalistically so i think we all quickly agreed that it wasn t a question of whether we would approach the story but how this was a woman who was making very serious allegations of sexual assault with her name attached publicly against the man who is more than likely to become the democratic nominee for president so we had to grapple with these claims the question was how and i think the natural thing to do really the human thing to do is to go into a story like this and say do you believe or not believe the person who s making the accusation but that s not the journalistic thing to do we re not judges we re not the jury we re not the police department i was really focused on what we could show to be true and what we could show to not be true what we had corroboration on and what we didn t have corroboration on and what kind of facts we could give voters and the american public about this whole incident that s already out in the world and being passed around quite actively on social media people knew about it mm hmm but they didn t know the details and they didn t really know what was true or not and so where do you begin as you re trying to figure this all out well so the main thing i needed to do was get tara reade back on the phone so that s where i began we ll be right back so lisa tell me about this i guess second round of communications that you have with tara reade after she claims that joe biden has assaulted her so i call her and we start talking every day and the obvious first question i ask her is why she didn t tell me about these allegations when we talked a year ago and she tells me that even though they weren t published in the new york times they were published in a local paper and the feedback she got from that being out there the kind of death threats and harassment online made her reluctant to tell the rest of her story so we talk through all that and then eventually i say to her that i need her to tell me the story that she told on that podcast in a way that we can use on the record and i start recording her hello can you hear me yeah i hear you yep i got you and what does she say so where do you want to start ok so let s start with the assault so the story that i m about to tell you is all according to tara reade so it s 1993 in the spring some time and she s working as a staff assistant in joe biden s senate office and one day she s at work and her supervisor comes up to her and has this athletic bag this gym bag and asks her if she would find the senator and bring him his gym bag she just said take him his gym bag hurry and she was like he ll meet you he s down towards the capitol so she heads down and finds him somewhere in the capitol complex of offices and i ran into him like i saw him and i he acknowledged me he was talking to someone they walked away and then he said come here tara and then he smiled at me greeted me and she says hello senator i called him senator i didn t call him joe and i handed him the bag with my right hand i remember that and the next thing she remembers he s pinned her up against a wall which she remembers as being very very cold and he s kissing her it happened at once and that s what s so hard about telling this story like he s talking to me and his hands are everywhere and everything s happening at once very quickly this happened like in under two minutes and according to tara he reaches his hand under her shirt she remembers she was wearing a cream colored blouse grabs her left breast he used his knee to part my knees because my legs went together and he went kind of down my skirt and then as he s parting my legs with his knee he like went up and then just went under and then of course yeah he was able to do what he did which was he took it felt like one or two fingers and inserted them in my vagina and at that point he s kissing her and he says to her she says do you want to go somewhere else and he tried she said to kiss her on the mouth but she moves her head and then he pulled back because i wasn t responding to him i wasn t kissing him back i completely froze up and he had kind of lifted me up so i was like up on my tippy toes almost and then he looked back and he looked at me and he looks at her and he says according to her come on man i heard you liked me then he smiled but then when i looked at his eyes he was angry like there and she said she remembers standing there just kind of frozen and she felt almost a little bad like she had put him in a bad position and she was wondering what she did to make him think that she would be interested in this and according to tara he looked her and he said he pointed his finger at me and he just goes you re you re nothing to me and then he looked at me and he goes nothing you re nothing to me nothing and she thinks she must have looked a certain way or had a certain expression in her eye because then he kind of took her by the shoulders and patted her shoulders and said you re ok you re fine and he kind of almost set her down she said and then he walked off and walked down the hall i know i went to the restroom i know i did to clean up but i don t remember which restroom i went to in the russell building or there i don t know but i know i did but my vivid memory next is sitting i was trying to pull myself together in the back stairs at the russell building with those big windows i remember just sitting on the stairs and nobody was there and just like my whole body was literally i couldn t control my shaking i remember just being so cold so cold and then she headed home she doesn t remember how she got there she doesn t remember whether she went back into the office and got her bag or talked to anybody but she made it home to her apartment the next thing i remember is being on the phone with my mom and crying and then arguing with her and her mother tells her in fairly firm language that she needs to immediately file a police report you know she even swore at me she was not being gentle and supportive and i understand because she wanted me to have evidence and now i understand what she was trying to do and i didn t then but tara doesn t do that and does she say why she did not go to the police well what she says is that she basically just wanted the whole thing to go away is what she told me that after it happened she took a shower she says she threw out all her clothes that she was wearing at the time i threw everything out even the shoes everything like i just that s how i felt about it really what kind of she tells me that she called in sick to work that she was sobbing uncontrollably it s like i just didn t want it to have happened it just didn t happen and what does she say happens in the days and maybe even weeks after this alleged incident so she tells me eventually she does go back to work and when she does she says that she tells her immediate supervisor who s biden s personal secretary as well as two top staffers in the office the deputy chief of staff and the chief of staff that she feels uncomfortable around joe biden she never mentions the alleged assault but she talks more about feeling uncomfortable with him touching her shoulders or tangling his hands in her hair and in her telling the staff don t really do anything about that in fact she feels that they kind of penalize her for bringing that forward she says they strip her of one of her duties which is supervising the interns she says they put her in a windowless office far from the rest of the staff so at some point she says that she goes to a senate personnel office and files a formal complaint and what does she say was in this complaint she said that complaint really detailed the harassment and what she saw as retaliation in the office but she believes that that forum eventually was returned to biden s office which would have been a flouting of what the official protocol was at that time and once that complaint was returned to biden s office she says she was given a month to find a new job and basically eased out of her position and so she started looking for another position on capitol hill she says and never ended up getting hired or finding anything so lisa once tara reade has given you this account of an alleged attack what do you do next so at this point she s told me a lot of information and some really detailed information too so i start thinking about what can be corroborated what we can show to be true and what we can show to be not true and one thing that tara mentions to me is that at the time she had called a friend and told her the whole story so i tracked down the friend mm hmm and in large part she corroborates the story that tara had told me tara tells me she also told her mother her mother is deceased so she can t be called and she told a version of her story to her brother though not all the details so i start trying to track down her brother and she tells me she told a friend in 2008 after joe biden had been picked as barack obama s vice president she had told a version of this story to that friend without all the details but that something had happened to her so i tracked down that friend and she confirms that account and some of the things that tara tells me where does that leave you so it leaves us with something but certainly not enough to corroborate this entire story we really only have the one friend with the full story and everyone else is just giving us bits and pieces so that s not the kind of full corroboration that you re looking for as a journalist when you re trying to confirm really serious allegations and also really politically explosive allegations but at this point it s time to turn to the biden side of things so along with my colleague sydney ember we start looking at who we can talk to and we start by calling the three top staffers in the office at the time that tara had mentioned she had spoken with and she had raised those complaints of harassment to all three of them say that a woman named tara reade never approached them with these kind of allegations and two of them said they didn t remember her at all even working in the office so just to be clear the three people that tara reade said she went to and told of biden s behavior that made her uncomfortable pretty senior people in his office they say they have no recollection of that ever happening exactly they have no recollection and a lot of the former staffers are mystified by her account too they don t remember anything like this or even the hint of anything like this so they when sydney and i call them they re trying to reconcile themselves her story with what they remember from working in that office a lot of them didn t want to talk on the record one who did said that at the time you knew who the good guys and bad guys were on the senate the places where offices where women would and would not want to work and she described biden as one of the good guys mm hmm so after that we reached out to another group of people which is the interns and that s because tara had told me that she supervised the interns and that she shared an office with these interns so i reached two of them and they both tell me that they d never heard of anything never saw anything like the kind of harassment and assault tara had been alleging but that they did remember midway through their internship sometime in april she had been suddenly removed as their boss and they never knew why and they never saw her again so amid all this confusion i remember that there s one thing that really could cut through all this and clarify exactly what did or did not happen mm hmm and that s this complaint that tara had told me she filed in 1993 with the senate office right and that someone had written down so we start trying to track down that complaint and we call the federal office of personnel management and they tell us to file a freedom of information request which would take months if not years and anyhow we don t really know exactly what we re asking for because she doesn t remember the name of the office where she filed this complaint right we call over to the senate and we re able to get some employment records but not this complaint so we basically look for this document and come up empty it s unfindable in the end what about other aspects of reade s life that might feel relevant i mean possible political affiliations or motivations how do you begin to think and report on those well so one thing that we want to be really sure of is that she is who she says she is and that this isn t someone in the midst of a heated presidential campaign that s only of course going to get more heated by all expectations that is trying to push an agenda or possibly pull a fast one on the media to try to get claims that are untrue out there in the public so i really talked to her a lot about her political affiliation she describes herself as a third generation democrat but walks me through the fact that she liked marianne williamson she really liked elizabeth warren and when california voted in the primary over super tuesday she backed bernie sanders but she insists that her motivation for this is not political even though i had watched as supporters of sanders and supporters of president trump really are the ones pushing this allegation out there on social media and really keeping the drumbeat up for people to investigate it so that s one concern and there is this other unusual detail which is what well she had written a fair amount in medium posts and on twitter about her support for russia and her respect for vladimir putin and so we read through all those medium posts some of them had been pulled down off the internet but we found them we looked through those old twitter posts and we really tried to investigate whether there could be some kind of nefarious agenda there and she says that she was misguided tara reade says that she had been working on a novel she s not anymore about russia and this was all part of her research and she says that she doesn t have any respect for vladimir putin now has never been to russia so we decide that that s not so disqualifying that it prevents us from putting a version of her story in the paper so how are you thinking about everything that you have reported at this point and i assume in consultation with your editors how are you planning to proceed well one thing we know is that we can t corroborate her story beyond the two friends and her brother mm hmm we know we can t find any documents and we know that everyone who worked for joe biden is denying that anything like this ever happened or could have happened mm hmm and we also know one other thing and this is really important as far as we ve learned in our reporting there is no pattern of this kind of behavior from joe biden what we had seen a year ago was a very different thing it was touching in public rubbing of shoulders or maybe touching of hair that made some women feel uncomfortable this is an allegation of a sexual assault those things are not at all similar and in fact what tara reade is alleging is a fairly singular act as far as we know but the democratic party they ve really set a very high standard for taking these cases seriously for taking allegations of sexual abuse seriously even joe biden has taken a strong position on this and it s worth remembering the kavanaugh hearings and one thing that joe biden said when that was all going on was this he said for a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus nationally you ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she s talking about is real whether or not she forgets facts whether or not it s been made worse or better over time but nobody fails to understand that this is like jumping into a cauldron so it s biden himself saying essentially believe women that s exactly right biden essentially saying believe women and i think that explains part of the approach to these allegations that you ve seen from his campaign joe biden himself has not spoken about them at all and i don t think he s been asked directly although i suppose that could come but his campaign has been very careful in all their public statements to say that they believe women that they think coming out like this is a credible thing to do but in this case they say the allegations are false but they re really walking a tightrope when they talk about this politically with many in the base of the democratic party well help me understand that i mean with all that history in mind that you just described of the democratic party setting such a high standard for itself and biden himself the presumptive democratic nominee saying believe women how is the democratic establishment how is the democratic party responding to what tara reade has alleged happened to her they re not responding nobody in the democratic establishment elected officials party leaders has discussed this at all why do you think that is i mean is that a function of the conflicting information here is that party loyalty to the de facto nominee is that about the fact that there is just one of these accusations not a pattern as you just said how do you explain that well honestly i think it s some of all of that when i talk to people who are close to joe biden and i ve now talked to quite a lot of them they say that this is something that s just so completely out of character for him they describe a man who s fiercely devoted to his wife and his kids that he would spend a lot of time focusing on when he could get the quickest train the soonest train home to delaware so he could see them and they just cannot reconcile these allegations that are out with the guy that they have known for all these decades so they say they can t believe it s true but when you look at the political calendar we re in the spring of an election year joe biden is going to be the democratic nominee so you have to figure that many many democrats also just don t want this to be true lisa thank you very much thanks for having me so today i am asking all americans i m asking every democrat i m asking every independent i m asking a lot of republicans to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy which i endorse on monday joe biden was endorsed by his former rival senator bernie sanders well bernie i want to thank you for that it s a big deal i think that your endorsement means a great deal it means a great deal to me we ll be right back here s what else you need to know today speaking french on monday france said it would extend a nationwide lockdown until the middle of may britain was expected to extend its lockdown and russia s president offered his darkest assessment yet of the virus s impact there speaking russian during a meeting with his advisors vladimir putin said quote we see the situation changing daily and unfortunately not for the better thank you very much good afternoon to everyone let me welcome my fellow governors who are on the telephone who you ll hear from in a moment in the u s two groups of governors one on the east coast the other on the west coast said they would decide regionally when and how to reopen their state s economies and emphasized that they would not do so until experts and data showed that it would be safe again we anticipate different facts different circumstances for different states different parts of states but let s be smart and let s be cooperative and let s learn from one another during a conference call the governors including tom wolfe of pennsylvania said that it was their role not the federal government s to make that decision well seeing as how had the responsibility for closing the state down i think we probably have the primary responsibility for opening it up a few hours later president trump was asked about the governor s announcement just to clarify your understanding of your authority vis vis governors if a governor issued a stay at home you say my authority the president s authority not mine because it s not me this is when somebody is the president of the united states the authority is total and that s the way it s got to be the president insisted that the decision was his your authority s total it s total it s total and the governors know that so if a the governors know that you know you have a couple of bands of excuse me excuse me that s it for the daily i m michael barbaro see you
