the following is a transcript of an interview with gary cohn the former director of the national economic council that aired sunday january 19 2020 on face the nation face the nation moderator margaret brennan we re back with gary cohn he is the former director of the national economic council under president trump he s back in the private sector these days thank you for being here former national economic council director gary cohn thank you for having me margaret brennan so the economy is going to be front and center in this election many economists say we re overdue for a recession do you think we re on the brink of one cohn margaret first of all it s great to be here i know a lot of people have been talking about a recession i do not see a recession on the horizon here the u s economy is strong and continues to be very strong the u s consumer is very strong if you look at what s happened in the last couple of years with tax reform we have put more disposable income in the hands of the u s consumer and the u s consumer is out spending it margaret brennan so then why is the president and his the man currently in the job you once held larry kudlow continuing to criticize the fed chairman cohn i m not worried about interest rates right now i think our interest rate policy is in a good place i think the consumer is in a good place and i think the u s economy is in a good place we actually have interest rates at a level right now where activity is growing i think that you know fourth quarter gdp will come in around two 2 5 percent margaret brennan so you cohn probably 2 5 percent margaret brennan you differ from the president on that quibble about interest rates currently cohn i don t think i differ from the president on the economy being strong margaret brennan right cohn i think we agree completely about the economy being strong margaret brennan but on interest rates cohn yeah i agree that i i think the fed is in a good place on interest rate policy margaret brennan i want to ask you about trade this week the united states and china the two largest economies in the world signed this phase one trade deal there s like 200 billion in promised purchases but there are still like 300 billion dollars worth of goods under tariff so what does this actually accomplish what what do you see it cohn so first of all anytime the united states and china get together and sign an agreement i think we should applaud that i mean the mere fact that we got a 90 plus page agreement signed between between the two countries is very good relative to where we were months ago when everyone thought we were going to continue to feud with china so we ve got some trade agreement in place the chinese are going to buy some more goods from the united states which has to be a good thing but there s also in that agreement there are some provisions that free up trademarks and trade patents and trade secrets which is very very good no this didn t margaret brennan i thought this was about intellectual property cohn this didn t i said margaret brennan and theft and all of those things cohn this didn t address look this margaret brennan yeah cohn did not address the big issue the big issue the president and i agreed upon is that the chinese had been stealing our intellectual property they ve been infringing on our our trademarks they ve been infringing on our copyrights it has not addressed that and we still have to continue to address that margaret brennan do you think that china is going to hold up its end of the deal and actually enact some of the reforms they say they re going to carry out cohn i i think they re going to i think they re going to open up their markets i think the chinese have been close to opening up their markets for the for the industries that were listed in there so i m cautiously optimistic that the chinese are going to start reforming and opening up their markets margaret brennan so you resigned over a difference about tariffs or at least that was a cohn yeah i don t think that s actua accurate but go ahead margaret brennan well then why did you resign cohn well look i i i left the administration for a variety of different reasons and and the president and i had very open conversations about my policy views and his policy views we d accomplished a lot and at the end of the day he was going a different direction on some of the trade negotiations than i would have gone i agreed fundamentally on what the issue was i just didn t agree on how to solve the issue margaret brennan so the steel and aluminum tariffs was what many thought was the impetus for your resignation cohn well i didn t think margaret brennan you re saying it s not cohn i didn t think the steel and aluminum tariffs were helpful to our economy margaret brennan but when it comes to the tariffs that were used to get to the the negotiating table with china on this deal or where ultimately they ended up with the free trade deal the new nafta so to speak usmca can the president say look people may not like my tactics but i got this done was he ultimately right were you wrong cohn they they can say that i don t think we would have gotten to a different outcome i don t think the tariffs helped us get to any different outcome margaret brennan did it hurt the u s cohn i think it has hurt the u s i think it s totally hurt the united states look the u s economy is very strong very solid employment growth is great but we re missing a big component we re missing the capital expenditures from companies in the united states that was a key component to tax reform it was a key component to what we thought would help drive the economy in 2018 2019 2020 and on we put some very stimulative measures into the tax reform margaret brennan lowering the corporate tax rate is what you thought was going to get companies cohn not margaret brennan to spend more cohn not lowering we actually gave them expensing of capex for the first five years they can 100 percent expense their capex but the minute you turn around and put steel and aluminum tariffs on them the minute a company is thinking about spending capital what do you go out and buy you go out and buy steel and aluminum that s how you build factories that s how you build property plant equipment so all of the sudden the advantages that we were trying to give companies to help stimulate the economy to build facilities to go out and hire people to drive wages we took away that advantage by taxing the input that they needed to build margaret brennan you re saying the president got in his own way cohn i m saying the policies collided with each other margaret brennan gary cohn stay with us and we will be right back in a moment commercial break margaret brennan welcome back to face the nation we continue our conversation with former director of the national economic council gary cohn so at this signing ceremony the president did this week with china he said begin videotape president donald trump i made a lot of bankers look very good end videotape margaret brennan the top six u s banks saved about 32 billion dollars because of the tax cuts that you helped craft this is analysis according to to bloomberg news the the hit on the tax law is that it is good for corporations it s good for business it s not good for the little guy why do you think this analysis is wrong the president seems to be saying and applauding that he s helping out big banks cohn well our our tax bill s clearly working which is great we ve made u s businesses competitive again with the rest of the world we lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent so we now have a corporate tax rate that is competitive with the rest of the world yes we lowered corporate tax rates and that in itself cost less than a hundred billion dollars a year to do that but it stimulates huge economic growth the businesses in the united states now can thrive which means that they can grow they can go out and hire people which we ve seen we ve seen record unemployment we ve seen record unemployment rates down to 3 5 percent we ve seen wage growth we ve seen 3 percent plus wage growth and most importantly margaret brennan you put this all on the tax law cohn we ve seen a lot of it has to do with tax law it has to we ve seen higher end wage growth at the bottom pay scale than we have at the top so we re seeing the incentives that we created in the tax law by lowering the corporate rate we re seeing that happen and that is happening in the last couple of years margaret brennan there s a whole debate about the contribution to the deficit but i want to put that aside here because i want to focus in on something cohn oh please don t margaret brennan i want to focus in on something though that that is really resonating politically and it is this broader argument that this country somehow is rigged to benefit the wealthy and disadvantage the poor and you ve even had jamie dimon the ceo of jp morgan you ve had hank paulson former treasury secretary former head of goldman sachs i know you know him they ve said that they re all concerned about income inequality growing in this country are you concerned cohn of course i m concerned margaret brennan but you but you don t cohn we re all concerned margaret brennan think in any way that there have been contributions to that through the tax law you helped write cohn i i think there s been contributions for the positive i think if you look at the data you ll see that we have grown wages at the bottom end of the pay cycle scale i m sorry pay scale faster than we ve grown them at the top that s exactly what we re trying to do we re trying to attract more jobs back to the united states put more people to work and that s what we re seeing happening margaret brennan michael bloomberg says about this tax law nearly all the money goes to people like me who don t need it this is a guy who knows wall street who is a billionaire he s saying that the tax law is is only advantaging people like him cohn i d love to know how it s advantaging him i d love to see that because at the end of the day we have lowered rates i ll agree that we ve lowered rates we have broadened the base meaning that we make more of your income taxable that s basic tax policy lower rates broaden base meaning you get rid of more of the loopholes that people have used to deduct from their income what they pay taxes on we got rid of a lot of the loopholes so people are having to pay more taxes they re having to pay tax on more of their income yes they re paying it at a little lower rate margaret brennan are you going to endorse michael bloomberg whose board i believe you sit on cohn i do not i do not margaret brennan as part of one of his bloomberg entities cohn i sit on one of his his emerging market boards i guess it s a board margaret brennan but that doesn t mean you re necessarily going to be voting for him cohn it does not margaret brennan two of the candidates who are also vying for the democratic nomination bernie sanders elizabeth warren constantly come back to this idea of income inequality they have proposed taxes on billionaires taxes on financial transactions elizabeth warren has specifically referred to that people making over 50 million dollars having an additional 2 percent tax what would the impact of those policies be from your perspective cohn look our tax system in the united states is very very progressive we have over 50 percent of the population today of workers do not pay a dollar of federal income tax so if you re going to collect more revenue which i m not against we have to collect more revenue it s going to come from the top half of workers and in fact it s going to come from the top 10 percent of workers that s where that s where you can find the taxable income i think that we will end up doing that we will potentially need to do that but these fangled plans that they re coming up with we don t need to do things like that to collect more income from people we have a basic tax system that works and we can do some basic fundamental things if we need to collect more money the question is do we need to collect more money you know we look at spending and we look at revenue and we don t talk about them in the same sentence we we collect taxes and then we spend and congress never thinks about how much money they have to spend they just go spend and so you wouldn t run your household like that i wouldn t run my household like that i would decide how much revenue i have and then how much i could spend margaret brennan but you re you re a democrat cohn yes i am margaret brennan is there a single democrat that you would consider voting for cohn there there i i ll consider voting for anyone i vote on policy margaret brennan even elizabeth warren whose policy you just tried to gary cohn i would consider voting for anyone i said i didn t say i would i said i d consider voting for them margaret brennan well that s evasive cohn yeah margaret brennan in pulling apart some of her proposals you seem to be reflecting a lot of what wall street says which is that there is deep concern over this focus on the financial community on corporations etc in this environment is this enough that you see some of the people you know on wall street continuing to vote along lines of whatever the president is putting forward even if they don t like some of his behavior vote for him because of what he s doing for cohn that s a margaret brennan banks cohn that s a hypothetical question i don t know what i do know margaret brennan you don t know who you re voting for cohn what i do know is the economy is really strong and the democrats haven t really come up with an idea of how to help the economy get even stronger so it s probably easier to talk about corporate greed and talk about wall street and talk about technology companies because they don t really have an answer for an economy that s growing 2 5 percent with 3 5 percent unemployment and 3 percent wage growth i haven t heard their answer on that except let s tax it to death margaret brennan so as you said you identify as a democrat you did have disagreements with the president on a number of things i was there in trump tower the day of the charlottesville reference fine people on both sides i remember your face that day and you were very public about some of your differences with the president will you vote for him cohn look i m very supportive of the president s economic policy i m very supportive of what he s done on deregulation i haven t heard anyone who s come up with a better policy yet now i just don t vote on the economy i vote on a lot of the social issues as well so you know in many respects i ve got to balance both sides of that equation before i figure out who i m gonna vote for margaret brennan so you re leaving the door open cohn i m leaving the door open but at this point i don t have any intention not to vote for the president margaret brennan you are a frank guy you re usually pretty direct cohn yeah margaret brennan is there anyone around the president who can be direct with him right now is there anyone doing what you said you did when guiding him on some of these economic policies cohn i don t know i ve been gone a year and a half i am sure there are people when talking to the president margaret brennan but when the president can say look i ve gotten these tariffs that have helped me get this free trade deal with north america these tariffs have helped me get this phase 1 deal with china doesn t that encourage the president s approach one that you have said you have differed with him on cohn it may encourage his approach but he he s also got advisors in there that i m sure are telling him differences i know that there are people in there you know secretary mnuchin and i had a lot of conversations where we agreed on tariffs and i m sure the secretary is talking to the president about tariffs and what effect they re having and what effect they re not having margaret brennan lastly i want to ask you about a new book i know you haven t read it it s coming out and there ve been excerpts released that directly reference you which is why i want to give you a chance to respond he s called the president is is in this meeting accused of calling advisers dopes and babies and the like is the the description of the president and his management style matching your experience cohn i don t know what book you re referring to as you said i haven t read it so i i i wouldn t know margaret brennan the management style of berating advisors cohn look the president is what you see on tv is exactly what you get in private with the president the president is the same person behind closed doors as he is out in public which is which is a unique feature you know it s not like he turns it on or turns it off when he walks outside so you ve seen everything the president has that s exactly what you see when you re in a private meeting with him margaret brennan all right gary cohn thank
