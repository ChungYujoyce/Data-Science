if you haven t heard that there s another game changing republican debate tonight you ve either been in a coma or have sworn off cable news for the holidays it s all they were able to talk about yesterday sitting outside uncle sheldon adelson s venetian hotel lacquered hair whipping in the cold las vegas winter wind every talking head in the land was on hand to predict lay odds and prophesize what was going to happen today it s a very good thing that absolutely nothing else happened in the world yesterday with all that prognosticating going on some obvious themes emerged first and foremost according to these pundits the entire country is in a full fledged panic over the violence that s tearing our society apart they are not referring to the daily bloodletting we face day in and day out from uncontrolled firearms killing people by the tens of thousands of course that s just the natural price citizens pay for someone else s freedom to carry lethal weapons no according to these commentators americans are hysterical over the extremely remote possibility that the bullet that might kill them could come from a gunfired by a muslim evidently the unique awfulness of that possibility has the whole country hysterical with fear so tonight s debate is now advertised as a wing nut schtick measuring contest for which warmongering demagogue can be the most bellicose the bar has been set rather high as you know with donald trump recently proposing torture mass deportation of any foreigners he thinks are a threat and banning all muslims from entry to the us the rest of the pack is going to have to really use their imaginations to beat that carly fiorina ben carson and rick santorum may have gotten some ideas from their attendance at thenational security action summit held yesterday in las vegaswhich was sponsored by none other than donald trump s islamophobic pollster and adviser frank gaffney the conference attendees were convinced that president obama is a secret muslim running the country on behalf of the muslim brotherhood there s no word on whether the three presidential hopefuls agree but they should be reminded that trump was way out ahead on that one too going back to 2012 when he anointed himself as king of the birthers chris christie is out with ablistering web adcriticizing president obama for giving away the store to the iranians and claiming it was terribly negotiated he says he would have walked away from the table this might be a way to establish his foreign policy belligerentbona fidesbut again trump got there first saying it was negotiated by stupid incompetent people there is something wrong with them in fact trump appeared with ted cruz at astop the iran deal rallyat the capitol last summer wherecruzlaid down the gauntlet by calling president obama the leading financier of radical islamic terrorism christie s little web ad is a baby slap by comparison he s going to have to reach deeper into his bag of nasty and that bagis well stocked to compete with thisone alleged establishment frontrunner marco rubio startedrunning an ad in new hampshirethis week and he sounds downright depressed it s him looking in the camera saying this election is about the essence of america about all of us who feel out of place in our own country a government incredibly out of touch and millions with traditional values branded bigots and haters this is about wages growing slower than the cost of living a generation drowning in debt and a president humiliated by putin iran and islamic jihadists i m marco rubio i approve this message because this is about the greatest country in the world and acting like it it s hard to know what he s trying to achieve there other than driving people to even deeper despair but you ll notice that he s also taking the line that the president has been humiliated by putin iran and jihadists it would be interesting to hear him explain what he means by that one assumes the iran comment is about the nuclear non proliferation deal which he like all the others on the stage are against the humiliation by jihadis probably refers to san bernardino and as for putin well who knows the right has formed an affection for putin whom they see as a much more manly leader they could really get behind if he weren t such a foreigner and a commie and all but again trump s already been there on all three rubio can try to be tough but the donald s muslim bashing is unparalleled andhe s on recordcalling putin a thug and a gangster he could get along with we can probably dispense with bush who will try to sound angry but will come off as a bespectacled muppet rand paul may make a point or two about the inefficacy of the patriot act before he once againdeclaresthat we should close all of our borders to half the world s population kasich will say trump is crazy andfrank luntz s focus group will hate him more than anyone else on the stage that leaves senator ted cruz the man of the hour he entersthis debate with the wind at his back havingpassed trump in iowaand coming on strong in the national polls he s benefitted mostly by scooping up the ben carson supporters as they inevitably dropped the kindly befuddled neurosurgeon for a full fledged right wing evangelical warrior and as has been noted by absolutely everyone cruz has been very reluctant to attack trump hoping to attract his voters when trump falters his very mild criticism of trump and carson recorded on the slygave the donald an excuse to attack the man who s breathing down his neck in iowa and he did calling hima maniac who doesn t have the temperamentto be president as donald does he has a great temperament afantastictemperament that goes without saying cruz is assumed to be a bit vulnerable on national security because marco rubio hashit him for his vote to slightly limit one of the government s programsthat spy on its own citizens without a warrant there was a brief moment when a few conservatives mistakenly thought their small government principles extended to police and military activities but they ve since pulled themselves together it s likely this will come up in the debate and it s also likely that cruz will have a good answer for it but he s already signaled that he s not going to allow any daylight between himself and trump when asked if he agreed with trump s proposal to deny muslims entry to the united states cruz said it wasn t his policy but he declined to disavow the plan saying that there were enough people in this world criticising trump andhe didn t need to add to the chorus yesterday he implicitly endorsed it by appearing by video at that national security summit and drooling all over frank gaffneysaying frank is a patriot he loves this country and he s clear eyed about radical islamic terrorism if he sought to assure the far right that he is one of them when it comes to islamophobia he couldn t have chosen a better way tonight will be a battle for who can be the most bloody minded they ll all shake their fists and declare their intention to beat isis and any other tin horned terrorists with their bare hands if that s what it takes but the winner will be the one who can convince the republican base that he or she is committed to all out war with islam trump s certainly in the lead on that one but hehas also said that it shighly unlikelythat he would use nuclear weapons whilecruz boldly declared we will utterly destroy isis we will carpet bomb them into oblivion i don t know if sand can glow in the dark but we re going to find out he s giving trump a run for his money in more ways than one it s hard to imagine how either of these fellows can be any more rhetorically brutal than they already have been but it s a fair bet they re going to give it a try tonight one thing to keep in mind however for all their bluster aside from the daft notions of a ban on muslims or nuking syria none of these candidates has even one new idea about how to deal with isis heather digby parton also known as digby is a contributing writer to salon she was the winner of the 2014 hillman prize for opinion and analysis journalism
