eight years ago katie couric conducted a series of interviews with the republican vice presidential candidate alaska governor sarah palin which marked the beginning of the end for the gop ticket it s painful to look back at these chats but it s also instructive because in the end it was palin who revealed herself to the electorate based on her own testimony she was a stunningly ignorant candidate whose intellect appeared as garbled as her syntax what made palin such a liability was that she didn t seem to recognize her deficiencies she was shallow and misinformed and lacked the humility to address these flaws what you saw was what you got in this sense palin is the fairy godmother of donald trump whose central appeal to voters resides not in his economic populism or his wolf whistled nativism but the proud bluster of his pronouncements what democrats and the media are finally starting to recognize is that trump is not going to be defeated by appeals to truth or decency or ideological consistency his rhetoric is all pathos and no logos as with palin the candidate s greatest liability is the candidate as mark bowden has deftly observed trump s essential nature is adolescent beneath his glib persona he s vain defensive and terrified of being unmanned the way to take him down is not to debate him or fact check him but to rattle that fragile ego of his to goad him and do so specifically in response to his greatest rhetorical vulnerability which isn t his exhaustively documented passion for prevarication but his eagerness to traffic in vagary and insinuation consider what chris matthews did to trump during a town hall interview in march he was probing trump about his position on abortion which used to be very pro choice but was now staunchly pro life if trump believed abortion should be illegal matthews said then how should it be punished he asked trump this question twice and got the standard conservative doubletalk but then matthews patiently circled back to the issue and pressed harder matthews churches make their moral judgments but you running for president of the united states will be chief executive of the united states do you believe trump no but matthews do you believe in punishment for abortion yes or no as a principle trump the answer is that there has to be some form of punishment matthews for the woman trump yes there has to be some form trump went on to note that the men who impregnate these women shouldn t be punished he also admitted that outlawing abortion would lead to women seeking illegal procedures these are all politically disastrous statements that even gop freshman lawmakers know to avoid but trump has no such internal editor when aggressively questioned particularly in a public venue his inner adolescent takes over as this clip demonstrates when matthews challenges him to provide a specific answer to man up when it comes to his convictions trump can t resist blurting out an answer this is how trump s personality functions if an interviewer implies that he s dumb or timid or worst of all politically correct his ego demands that he double down on whatever lunatic notion he s defending matthews however is one of the few pundits outside the conservative media who is pugnacious enough to get under trump s skin more often trump treats his interlocutors like reality tv contestants or press agents he interrupts them he talks over them he filibusters he berates he veers into non sequiturs take a look at how he ran roughshod over cnn s jake tapper a few weeks ago tapper tries to press him on his statement that judge gonzalo curiel isn t fit to preside over the trump university fraud lawsuit because of his mexican heritage he s a mexican are trump s exact words about the jurist who was born in indiana tapper gets a few words in edgewise but for the most part he s completely flummoxed given what trump did say imagine what trump might have said if tapper refused to be silenced if instead he goaded trump by accusing him of racism mocking his bald faced lies and confronting trump with the most galling aspects of his fraudulent university rather than allowing the candidate to prattle on about all his satisfied customers as the election progresses the press will probably get less and less access to trump that s certainly what his gop minders will seek to insure those who do get to interview him can t waste the opportunity they have to come prepared to challenge trump about specific policy issues and the increasingly unhinged nature of his rants last week the day after the massacre that left 49 people dead in orlando trump phoned his fans at fox friends and said the following look we re led by a man that either is not tough not smart or he s got something else in mind and the something else in mind you know people can t believe it people cannot believe that president obama is acting the way he acts and can t even mention the words radical islamic terrorism there s something going on it s inconceivable there s something going on the next television reporter given the chance to interview trump would do well to force him to explain what precisely he means by something else in mind is he saying the president of the united states is in cahoots with islamic radicals if so why doesn t he have the guts to say so directly why play word games is he scared is he being politically correct because this is a big part of trump s whole game in the absence of any coherent set of policies or legislative agenda he floats vague conspiracy theories about his enemies he did it in the primaries as well implying for instance that ted cruz s father played a role in john f kennedy s assassination i mean what was he doing with lee harvey oswald shortly before the death before the shooting it s horrible this kind of paranoid style has a long and ignominious history in american politics it is not only enabled but also emboldened by a cowardly press corp those reporters afforded the chance to interview trump need to recognize that they are not dealing with a traditional politician nor are they dealing with a glib lightweight like palin they are dealing with a kind of shape shifting demagogue who learned his stagecraft under the tutelage of roy cohn joseph mccarthy s right hand man the deferential protocol that has traditionally prevailed when dealing with a presidential candidate will no longer do the job trump has to be handled like the reckless brawler he is not for the sake of tripping him into a gaffe but simply so he is forced to reveal to the american people what he actually believes voters will then be able to judge fairly whether these beliefs bear any relationship to their own beliefs or to reality steve almond s new book is against
