advertisement supported by after a disappointing fifth place finish in the iowa caucuses the minnesota senator made a series of bets in the granite state by nick corasaniti concord n h senator amy klobuchar knew she might have an opportunity in new hampshire s presidential primary as a fiscally moderate democrat who opposes the medicare for all and free four year college plans of her liberal rivals ms klobuchar was in sync with the smaller government tilt of plenty of democrats in the state her emphasis on bipartisanship and pragmatism was a fit with new hampshire s large number of unaffiliated voters or independents who could participate in the democratic primary and she often mentioned her support for new hampshire s two centrist female senators jeanne shaheen and maggie hassan so in the aftermath of the chaotic iowa caucuses where her fifth place finish might have derailed other candidates ms klobuchar placed a series of bets on new hampshire that paid off big on tuesday night with her surprise third place finish in the primary while she now has a huge challenge ahead competing for support from hispanic voters in nevada and black voters in south carolina where she is far behind in polls the fact that ms klobuchar has a shot is because of an 11th hour surge here that is usually the stuff of dreams for candidates the first bet came last week with ms klobuchar running just three percentage points behind former vice president joseph r biden jr in the iowa caucus results her campaign saw room to grow with moderate voters and decided to charter a plane to bring more than 20 staff members from the iowa campaign to new hampshire to mount a furious six day sprint transcript so we finally have actual election results from the state of new hampshire they are clear and they are authoritative and they are a little bit complicated hello america we are here to stay our campaign is built for the long haul we re going to nevada we re going to south carolina we re going to win those states as well bernie sanders has won the state by a little bit two other candidates who had quite a strong night pete buttigieg and amy klobuchar not such a good night for joe biden or for elizabeth warren or for anybody else new hampshire new hampshire new hampshire we re here together new hampshire you all up here in new hampshire after the debacle in iowa national attention has focused even more intensely on new hampshire as the first real clean test of political momentum in this race people are still undecided uh bernie bernie sanders all the way mayor pete amy klobuchar oh joe biden i ll just probably decide tuesday five minutes before i go in to vote new hampshire is a classic swing state ronald reagan is the winner in the state of new hampshire bill clinton won it it s neck and neck new hampshire goes to obama in 2016 hillary clinton prevailed over donald trump but by a tiny margin it s a state that s very much in play for 2020 four more trump four more years new hampshire might gauge whether a candidate is able to appeal to certain other constituencies they will need in the general election we have seen over the last week a real rivalry emerge between bernie sanders and pete buttigieg hot fresh and vegan get your bernie on a stick new hampshire is really home turf for bernie sanders he comes from right next door in vermont and he also drew strong support as he did in 2016 from younger voters and more liberal voters young voters want bernie because he s fighting for their future he s not fighting for his future he s in his future cheering bernie sanders came into new hampshire claiming momentum out of iowa based on his lead in the popular vote finally the votes were counted in iowa took them a little while we won the vote by 6 000 votes he has been somewhat more aggressive with his primary opponents here we don t have a super pac talking about the difference between himself we don t want billionaires money and candidates in the race like pete buttigieg who take money from billionaires and other big donors we are running a campaign for working people funded by working people and that is why we are going to win here in new hampshire and all over this country cheering the biggest thing this might mean for bernie sanders is that he has clearly reasserted himself as the dominant leader on the left wing of the democratic party and then there s pete buttigieg back in the obama campaign we called it no drama obama and i haven t come up with the right rhyme for buttigieg cheering pete buttigieg has claimed among the moderate candidates a sense of momentum in new hampshire that other folks were not able to take we can t risk dividing americans further the idea that you ve either got to be for a revolution or you got to be for the status quo leaves most of us out his message here has been pretty similar to his message in iowa but really focused on the idea that he s the candidate who can win crossover support in the general election we need a politics that brings all of us in because all of us need a new and better president after finishing at the top in both iowa and new hampshire buttigieg now has a tremendous opportunity to put himself forward at the national level as the leader of moderate democrats announcer senator amy klobuchar the word that amy klobuchar supporters are using to describe what happened here is klomentum she came to new hampshire after a fifth place finish in iowa without a whole lot of wind in her sails it s been funny suddenly seeing media come to all of our events laughter things just turned around for her dramatically if klobuchar had not finished so strong in new hampshire it might have been the end of her campaign if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense you have a home with me she gets the chance to fight onward to nevada and south carolina and super tuesday i would not make any plans that are based on knowing a democratic nominee anytime soon well i am going to las vegas next so i probably would have a chance to do that that move nearly doubled ms klobuchar s team on the ground in new hampshire a relatively small operation but still a campaign that had organizational capacity to capitalize politically if the candidate had a breakthrough with voters then came friday night s debate with roughly eight million people watching ms klobuchar challenged rivals like pete buttigieg a cool newcomer and drew contrasts with her more progressive rivals as the marathon debate came to a close her voice steady yet infused with the strained exhaustion of a democrat in the trump era ms klobuchar promised to bring compassion to the white house there is a complete lack of empathy in this guy in the white house right now and i will bring that to you she said onstage in manchester if you have trouble stretching your paycheck to pay for that rent i know you and i will fight for you it was a verifiable moment with many political analysts calling it one of the most memorable deliveries of the debate the campaign pounced moving quickly on friday night to turn the debate line into ms klobuchar s final ad in new hampshire in less than 24 hours after an overnight effort to cut together the ad her closing statement was on air in new hampshire hours later the campaign put nearly 250 000 into the cluttered new hampshire television market for the final two days more than any other candidate except mr buttigieg money began to flow in more than 5 million in the four days after the debate crowds swelled well beyond expectation and venue capacity overflow rooms became a standard good problem to have for the advance staff and volunteers who were once an infrequent trickle at field offices around the state turned into a veritable army of door knockers and canvassers while there are still ballots left to count we have beaten the odds every step of the way ms klobuchar said late tuesday as her primary night party speech teemed with the optimism often enjoyed only by a primary winner on wednesday ms klobuchar traveled to new york city for a fund raiser and a scheduled appearance on rachel maddow s show on msnbc with yet another small dollar infusion coming overnight 2 5 million in the final four hours of tuesday 60 percent from new donors ms klobuchar s campaign also began making plans to buy television ads in south carolina on thursday she will head to nevada speaking at the league of united latin american citizens forum and then a campaign town hall in las vegas though ms klobuchar spent months tailoring her presidential bid to iowa caucusgoers a rural midwestern neighbor whose entire stump speech is littered with appeals to the heartland new hampshire may have always been more ripe for a successful rise for the minnesota senator the state s primaries are somewhat open independents can vote and the state allows same day registration even as her fortunes remained tethered to iowa top klobuchar aides began to eye new hampshire as a potential bright spot the endorsements of three of the state s four largest newspapers showed establishment approval so ms klobuchar s campaign began diverting her to new hampshire after nearly every debate she did a 10 county tour in 36 hours after the november debate in atlanta though her debate performances were often well reviewed she rarely received a national bump but her aides pointed to hints that voters in new hampshire were taking notice events with 40 r s v p s ended up with roughly 100 attendees we first saw her in july and we liked her very much and around september we were heavily leaning that way said mark hodgdon 60 who lives in epsom n h but drove a half hour to attend an afternoon event at state headquarters in manchester on tuesday she cares about all the liberal issues that i care about including campaign finance reform but her approaches are more practical in her closing message as she barnstormed the state ms klobuchar began to make more direct appeals to moderates and even some republicans her campaign began targeting towns in new hampshire that flipped from president barack obama to donald j trump she sat for an interview with bret baier of fox news on monday night after speaking to a luncheon of nashua rotary club members earlier in the day i ve also seen a lot of anger from people who stayed home in 2016 or independents or republicans that maybe voted for the president and are now stepping back and thinking i don t know if i did the right thing ms klobuchar said at the luncheon more often a campaign trail stop for republican candidates than democrats my campaign has always been about reaching out and not shutting people out but bringing them with me ms klobuchar s distinct and deliberate appeal to the centrist spirit caught fire with some late breaking activists joanne st john an influential democratic activist in nashua who had long backed senator cory booker of new jersey was still adrift and without a candidate heading into the final weekend i went to a buttigieg rally and at the end of that i said i think i m going to support him she said in an interview on tuesday but i had almost begrudgingly promised some of my very proficient democrats here in nashua that i would go see amy at 3 o clock and i did and i m glad i did i saw a woman with power i ve seen her many times before but she has developed her style i just looked at that woman onstage and i thought she can do this ms st john voted for ms klobuchar on tuesday and spent most of her day encouraging others to do the same on the campaign trail ms klobuchar credited signs of growing support in new hampshire to the fact that she actually had a chance to talk to voters here rather than be stuck in the senate for an impeachment trial which kept her away from iowa for weeks i am finally unleashed she told supporters in salem on sunday i went to four diners this morning she also added local touches on election day she bought a special wrap of the new hampshire union leader highlighting its endorsement of her at a rally in nashua the biggest of her candidacy volunteers had printed out copies of the endorsements from local papers and in her speeches she referred to local matters that had flown under the radar of other candidates she mentioned the importance of rail to southern new hampshire in nashua she gave a shout out to ms shaheen in salem though her third place finish in new hampshire was pitched as victory her campaign faces an immediate uphill battle the next two states nevada and south carolina are far more diverse and ms klobuchar has shown little strength in polling with black and latino voters the super tuesday map is not much kinder big expensive states like texas and california and an array of southern states will all be voting and it will be tougher for ms klobuchar to break through there but her campaign is aggressively expanding it currently has 50 staff members on the ground in nevada and plans to have campaign workers in multiple super tuesday states by saturday the campaign is also starting a seven figure ad buy in nevada and she has events lined up in reno and las vegas before she left the stage at her party on tuesday night ms klobuchar saw a future opened by new hampshire we are so excited we are going to take this show on the road with all of this new hampshire good will ms klobuchar said the best is yet to come shane goldmacher and lisa lerer contributed reporting from
