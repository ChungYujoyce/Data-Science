california governor gavin newsom said it was unrealistic to think life as we knew it before the coronavirus pandemic would be back to normal anytime soon he empathized with the frustration of state residents who are protesting his stay at home orders but urged them to think of their loved ones and others amid their fatigue with the precautions newsom told cbs this morning co host tony dokoupil in an exclusive interview that he feared the worst might not be over for california if the state s residents did not comply with social distancing and other restrictions read a portion of their conversation below tony dokoupil governor the last time you were on our air you said you worried people would become fatigued with the social distancing guidelines and the restrictions it seems that fatigue has set in if judged by the protests what s your message to those protesters gavin newsom stay safe stay healthy not only for yourselves but your loved ones and when you come home if you haven t practiced physical distancing be careful when you see grandma and grandpa and focus again on the fact that we re all in this together dokoupil president trump has expressed sympathy with the protesters even cheering them on in some respects do you share that sympathy if not exactly the president s language newsom well i share the empathy of frustration that we re all living through something we ve never lived through in our lifetime and the need and desire for all of us to get back to work and to some semblance of normalcy dokoupil can you say from where you re sitting at this moment that the worst is over in california newsom no because if we all pull back we could see a second wave that makes this pale in comparison i can t say that honestly that s determined by the act of 40 million californians stepping in continuing to meet this moment icu numbers are beginning to flatten but we re not seeing yet the significant decline that we need to see ultimately to toggle back but we are committed to a process we ve socialized that process and we are leaning in working with 58 counties across the state to make sure that we do it together in a thoughtful and strategic way dokoupil i understand the timeline for easing restrictions is still a work in progress it s a little bit hazy it s dependent on what people do today but from where you re sitting with the data you have can you say today that baseball is possible in july school will be back in session in september and it s possible that elections will happen as normal in november newsom yeah i don t know as normal and none of the above as normal i think that would be unrealistic to assert you have to radically change the floor plans in the schools in businesses private public institutions large and small we re gonna have new protocols and procedures temperature checks people wearing face coverings across the spectrum but the idea of tens of thousands of fans coming together across their differences high fiving one another hugging each other after a base hit or a strikeout is not something i m anticipating any time soon dokoupil it sounds like what you re saying is life as we knew it is gone until such a time when there s a vaccine or herd immunity newsom you got it i mean it s not that complicated or incredibly successful and viably distributed treatments i don t anticipate that normalcy that many of us wish for happening any time soon but we will begin to toggle back to put a little dimmer switch up and begin to change the way we currently are conducting ourselves from a full lockdown stay at home order to one that is more prescriptive targeted and strategized dokoupil here you are preparing people for profound changes i don t hear the same message from washington d c from president trump do you think he has a responsibility at this point to start preparing america for the very same changes you ve described newsom i think we all have a responsibility to use the information that we have the data we have and process it in a way that s open and honest with the american people look i don t think there s anything wrong with being optimistic and hopeful i m optimistic i m hopeful this is not the new normalcy in perpetuity we re gonna come back we just need to temper the enthusiasm on when and how and once we get herd immunity and once we get a vaccine then we could come back and flourish and thrive watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
