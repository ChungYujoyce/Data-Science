advertisement supported by the attorney general misstated key facts in explaining the dismissed official s handling of the whistle blower complaint that prompted impeachment by charlie savage washington attorney general william p barr endorsed and defended president trump s firing of michael k atkinson the intelligence community inspector general in an interview with fox news but in making the case that mr atkinson committed a firing offense in his handling of a whistle blower complaint last year that led to the impeachment battle mr barr made several claims that are subject to scrutiny mr atkinson pushed the trump administration in september to tell congress about the whistle blower complaint accusing mr trump of abusing his power to try to coerce ukraine into announcing investigations that could deliver him personal political benefits the complaint touched off mr trump s impeachment by the democratic controlled house since the republican controlled senate acquitted the president he has been purging officials who cooperated with the house inquiry on april 3 mr trump fired mr atkinson the next day the president made clear at a news briefing that he did so because he remained angry that the inspector general wanted to disclose the complaint to congress he did a terrible job absolutely terrible mr trump said adding he took a fake report and he brought it to congress with an emergency ok not a big trump fan that i can tell you he endorsed mr trump s move while putting forth a dubious account of what happened this is mr barr s statement the president did the right thing in removing atkinson from the vantage point of the department of justice he had interpreted his statute which is a fairly narrow statute gave him jurisdiction over wrongdoing by intelligence people and tried to turn it in to a commission to explore anything in the government and immediately report it to congress without letting the executive branch look at it and determine whether there was any problem he was told this in a letter from the department of justice and he is obliged to follow the interpretation of the department of justice and he ignored it so i think the president was correct in firing him no not when it came to an executive branch review mr atkinson tried to follow the procedures laid out in the intelligence community whistleblower protection act which requires that the office of the director of national intelligence review the complaint then report it to congress after determining that the complaint was credible and raised an urgent concern mr atkinson provided it on aug 26 to the acting director of national intelligence at the time joseph maguire mr atkinson believed that under the whistle blower protection law mr maguire would have seven days to review the materials and append any comments before passing on the complaint to congress a senior justice department official speaking on the condition of anonymity defended mr barr s claim that mr atkinson instead thought he could immediately report it to congress without letting the executive branch look at it arguing that a week was insufficient for the department to conduct its own review of the complaint but it was congress not mr atkinson that set the review period at one week for complaints covered by the whistle blower law in addition officials at the white house and the justice department already knew that an intelligence official had raised concerns about mr trump s ukraine dealings even before he filed the complaint on aug 12 the department ultimately decided not to open any criminal investigation no while mr atkinson disagreed with it he considered himself bound by it after mr atkinson gave the complaint to mr maguire steven e engel the head of the justice department s office of legal counsel opined that the whistle blower law did not apply because the complaint was not about an intelligence activity so the administration could lawfully withhold it from congress on sept 9 about a week after the deadline mr atkinson wrote to the intelligence oversight committees with the approval of mr maguire notifying them that a dispute had arisen over how the law applied to a whistle blower complaint without disclosing its subject mr atkinson also wrote in a follow up letter to congress i understand that i am bound by the determination of the justice department and will continue to abide by that determination the senior department official defending mr barr s claim that mr atkinson instead ignored the justice department s interpretation argued that if he had truly respected the office of legal counsel s role he would not have told the oversight committees anything yes he claimed that the f b i had opened its investigation into whether trump campaign officials were coordinating with russia s election interference without any basis but the official who decided to open the investigation bill priestap then the assistant director of the f b i s counterintelligence division did so on the basis of certain facts specifically after wikileaks started dumping out stolen democratic emails believed to have been hacked by russia and timed to disrupt the 2016 democratic national convention australia told the united states that two months earlier a trump campaign official george papadopoulos had told one of its diplomats that russia had offered to help the trump campaign by anonymously disclosing dirt on hillary clinton defending mr barr s claim that the f b i did not have any basis to open an investigation the department official pointed to the apparent opinion of john h durham a prosecutor whom mr barr has assigned to reinvestigate the russia investigators that the f b i should have opened a preliminary investigation rather than a full investigation the justice department inspector general michael e horowitz concluded that the facts available to mr priestap were an adequate basis for a full investigation but said in testimony last year that mr durham had disagreed with him and believed the factual basis for the inquiry only rose to the standard for a preliminary one yes he has repeatedly come under fire for misleading the public about the findings and analysis of the special counsel who eventually took over the case robert s mueller iii last month reggie b walton a federal judge appointed by a republican president declared in a ruling that mr barr s initial account of the then still secret mueller report was so distorted and misleading that the court could not trust him judge walton also suggested that the attorney general had made a calculated attempt to influence public discourse about the mueller report in favor of president trump the justice department has said it stands by mr barr s statements without addressing the substance of the judge s critique eric schmitt contributed reporting advertisement
