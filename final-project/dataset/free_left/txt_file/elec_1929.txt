with breanne deppisch the big idea salt lake city the revelations of recent days about donald trump s lascivious and predatory attitudes toward women have hurt him in utah perhaps more than any other state julie de azevedo hanks a psychotherapist with a blog that is widely read in the mormon community is an independent who voted for mitt romney four years ago she planned to keep her preference for hillary clinton quiet until she saw the 2005 video of the republican nominee boasting to billy bush about pursuing married women and using his celebrity to make unwanted advances that tape put the final nail in the coffin hanks said a year ago i never would have thought i d be voting for her i know she s not flawless i don t idolize her i don t have rose colored glasses we may not get everything we value with hillary but she aligns more closely with what we do value than trump hanks posted on her blog about how dangerous she thinks trump would be as president she said her husband a rock ribbed republican may just not vote at all now last night she was one of nearly 70 volunteers who showed up to phone bank at clinton s utah headquarters on the outskirts of the capital of one of the country s reddest states the parking lot overflowed volunteers many who identify as independent or even republican parked down nearby residential streets and walked they ate little caesar s pizza as they made the case on cell phones to their utah neighbors to back a democrat for president for the first time since 1964 the clinton team has a full time staffer on the ground to organize the phone banks and canvassing they ve even launched a mormons for hillary effort the influential deseret news which is owned by the mormon church has stayed out of presidential politics for 80 years but the editorial board urged all of its readers over the weekend not to vote for trump for context more than six in 10 voters in next month s election will be members of the flock what oozes from this audio is evil the editorial said trump s banter belies a willingness to use and discard other human beings at will that characteristic is the essence of a despot republican gov gary herbert and rep jason chaffetz both mormons withdrew their support last friday just hours after the post published the video sen mike lee who is up for reelection also called for the reality tv star to drop out prompting an avalanche of colleagues to follow a former miss teen utah is one of the women who has come forward to accuse trump of boorish behavior in the days since trump denies any wrongdoing romney who is mormon got 73 percent of the vote here four years ago trump got just 34 percent of the vote in a monmouth university poll published yesterday he leads clinton by only 6 points she pulled 28 percent another 20 percent back independent evan mcmullin who joined the race at the urging of never trump conservatives and 9 percent support libertarian gary johnson the survey was in the field after the emergence of the 2005 tape but before numerous additional women came forward to accuse trump of misconduct just 19 percent of likely voters view trump favorably seven in 10 do not believe he has the temperament to be president six in 10 republicans and three in four mormons say he does not share their values i interviewed more than 30 voters on the ground over the past two days and it feels like he has not yet hit bottom the alternatives to trump are racing to capitalize on his collapse in the beehive state both mcmullin and johnson are running their national campaigns out of salt lake city trying to become the first non major party candidate since 1968 to win any state s electoral votes mcmullin who is focusing more on utah than any other state is a 40 year old mormon who spent a decade at the cia and later became the policy director for the house republican conference people are finally realizing the truth about trump he said during an interview at his campaign headquarters yesterday afternoon i imagine there are dozens more of these women out there sadly the first time candidate presents himself as the antithesis of trump he talked about the positives of immigration he said he really wants to win over muslims he decried stop and frisk policing as based on racism and he heavily criticized both major party nominees both of these candidates under other circumstances might find themselves in jail mcmullin said taking a sip of a diet coke either donald trump for sexual assault or hillary clinton for violating our laws on protecting classified information so the debate is about who has abused women more and who is more corrupt it is horrible that we find ourselves in this position mcmullin last week tapped mindy finn a d c based digital media strategist to be his running mate we hear from a lot of our supporters that we are an answer to their prayers she said they can walk out of the polling booth with their head held high the republican party has lost its way it s eating itself alive by normalizing the behavior of trump what exists here is a lifeboat utah was always a bad fit for trump most mormons spend two years overseas as missionaries which gives them a more internationalist outlook because the early church faced so much persecution trump s support for religious tests cause visceral disgust the state welcomes refugees with open arms in contrast to the rust belt there are vastly more opportunities for upward mobility and the unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the country boyd matheson who runs a local conservative think tank called the sutherland institute believes mcmullin can win utahns are not an angry people he said the hunker down protectionism that trump is offering just doesn t ring true here for a lot of people who were never excited about trump the video locked it in but mcmullin s immediate problem is that two thirds of utahns have still not heard of him we want to prevail in utah but we have a lot of work to do he said at a sparsely decorated campaign office that is next door to a thai restaurant and across from a credit union without much fundraising he s focusing on free media coverage and digital efforts he said there has been a 1 600 percent increase in online engagement over the past four days we saw a marked shift with the tape he said the other big issue is that if the anti trump vote is divided like it was throughout the gop nominating contest the reality tv star could eke out a narrow win johnson has campaigned hard in utah he was back in the state wednesday night and has come at least once every few weeks since the start of the year during the interview mcmullin sought to dismiss johnson as a spoiler of sorts he has some impact but this is a three way race johnson s communications director joe hunter responded that the former new mexico governor will appear on the ballot in all 50 states while mcmullin has only qualified to appear in 11 states he s kind of running for president of utah and that s legit hunter who lives up the road in park city said of mcmullin there s nothing wrong with that strategy but we re more confident in ours we re ultimately the best option for the never trump republicans in utah everyone says a late endorsement from someone like romney might help voters coalesce behind either mcmullin or johnson and put them over the top all the people you would wonder about i m talking to most of them mcmullin said when asked if he s in touch with the 2012 gop nominee who is legendary here because he turned around salt lake city s failing 2002 olympics to be sure clinton has a very narrow path to victory in such a conservative state she s viewed unfavorably by almost the same percentage of voters as trump only 25 percent said they like her in the monmouth poll and she lost the caucuses here this spring to bernie sanders but peter corroon the chairman of the utah democratic party said his team is mobilizing a bigger get out the vote operation than ever before knocking on hundreds of thousands of doors and making hundreds of thousands of phone calls it probably won t be over 30 percent of the vote but i think she ll get the plurality said corroon the former mayor of salt lake city every time trump opens his mouth it gets worse for him here some will move to hillary and mcmullin and johnson are splitting the third party votes republicans like to point out that in 1992 bill clinton finished in third place with 25 percent of the vote behind george h w bush and ross perot mike lee says he still has not made up his mind about who to vote for but it will not be trump or clinton when i asked him if there s any way she could prevail he did not hesitate no he said it s not going to happen but it s also true that third party candidates typically underperform how they do in pre election polling because they do not have the same kind of organization to get out the vote the clinton outreach also extends to utah s growing hispanic population especially those living in the state s 4th congressional district represented by rep mia love r statewide hispanics comprise about 8 percent of eligible voters but in love s district they account for about 25 percent that was enough to prompt lorella praeli the campaign s latino voter outreach director to travel here last month to meet with local volunteers and activists as in other states with smaller but growing hispanic populations like north carolina and pennsylvania the clinton campaign thinks running up the score with this constituency could wind up being decisive clinton campaign strategists freely acknowledge that utah is a reach and that it is easier to pick off states like arizona or georgia first both sides agree that if trump loses here the election nationally will probably be a blowout but if for some reason it is close and the divided third party votes allow her to win in a squeaker utah s six electoral votes the same number as iowa has could cut off several other paths trump has to get to 270 welcome to the daily 202 powerpost s morning newsletter with contributions from elise viebeck eliseviebeck sign up to receive the

democrats in statewide elections divisions within the state republican party over trump clinton s selection of sen tim kaine a well liked former virginia governor as her running mate and vigorous support from gov terry mcauliffe d a close clinton friend we got so far ahead here that we are no longer considered a swing state in clinton world mcauliffe told the post in an interview last week before the release of a tape of trump bragging about groping women paul ryan is attempting to move past his week long battle with trump today by delivering a fresh policy speech and announcing that he helped raise an additional 15 4 million to defend the house gop majority kelsey snell has early excerpts ryan will argue for the value of conservative leadership in congress in a mid day address to college republicans in his home state of wisconsin the speech aims to refocus the political discussion on the same traditional republican themes like small government and freedom that ryan has seen as key to maintaining a gop majority as support for trump has been sinking it is important that we take a step back and reflect on what this election is ultimately about ryan will say beneath all the ugliness lies a long running debate between two governing philosophies one that is in keeping with our nation s founding principles like freedom and equality and another that seeks to replace them the rnc raised 39 4 million in september and has transferred 6 35 million of that to fund down ballot races from bloomberg s kevin cirilli the reallocation of 6 35 million 4 5 million of which went to the national republican senatorial committee and 1 85 million to the national republican congressional committee was made with the encouragement of the trump campaign the rnc s press release stated elsewhere a group of the republican party s most generous donors are calling on the rnc to disavow trump saying the latest allegations about his sexual misconduct are grounds for the committee to cut ties finally and fully from the new york times jonathan martin alexander burns and maggie haberman the republican financial apparatus under mr priebus sputtering since mr trump claimed the presidential nomination is wheezing painfully in the final weeks of the race the committee s fund raising officials now quietly acknowledge that mr trump is a thoroughly compromised candidate party donors said but implore potential contributors to give anyway stressing graver concerns like control of the supreme court many donors have stopped giving though and some have deserted the party including two major donors who confirmed on thursday that they were supporting gary johnson even some of mr priebus s allies believe that mr trump is certain to be defeated and that it is time for the party to protect its image by disavowing him thosewho know him best are not giving him money trump s missing donors the people who work for him by michelle conlin and grant smith at reuters kerry woolard the 37 year old manager of trump winery in charlottesville virginia went online in june and made her first political contribution a 250 donation to the campaign of her boss republican presidential nominee donald trump woolard s donation was unusual only a dozen of an estimated 22 450 people employed at trump s companies have donated more than 200 to the celebrity businessman s bid for the u s presidency according to a reuters review the contributors have given a total amount of 5 298 to trump s campaign a fraction of the 112 million trump s political operation has received this year this stands in stark contrast to the 2012 election when employees at the private equity firm mitt romney led until 1999 bain capital and a separate company for which he worked bain company donated nearly 375 000 bain capital employees gave an additional 1 125 million to romney s super pac how toxic is trump floridagoprep david jolly who represents an area around tampa is threatening to

accusers were instead conspiring against him fromphilip rucker and sean sullivan scrambling to turn around his floundering campaign trump declared war on the media and multinational corporations alleging they are colluding with clinton to orchestrate the single greatest pile on in history the clinton machine is at the center of this power structure he said at a palm beach rally anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist a racist a xenophobe and morally deformed this is part of a pattern when he gets desperate trump spins conspiracy theories fromsean sullivan this time there was a bigger baddervillain a global power structure of corporate interests the media and clinton engaging in subterfuge this time it was about him trump said thursday that the world had reached a moment of reckoning he told his backers that his campaign is not about me it s about all of you and it s about our country he portrayed the powers he says have banded together to rally against him and his advocates as ruthless and cunning they will attack you they will slander you they will seek to destroy your career and your family they will seek to destroy everything about you including your reputation trump said they will lie lie lie and then again they will do worse than that they will do whatever is necessary his speech came just minutes after michelle obama delivered a scathing impassioned repudiation of trump s behavior saying the groping allegations have shaken her to her core the dueling speeches made for a remarkable moment in a roiling presidential campaign and signaled that the final 25 days would focus not on policy or ideology but on character two speeches two americas a pair of apocalyptic arguments and one call to burn down the house that s the summation from just two remarkable hours thursday that crystallized the final month of campaign 2016 dan balz writes in back to back appearances in what might be the two most compelling hours of the entire election michelle obama in new hampshire and donald trump in florida delivered the fiercest most provocative and hardest hitting speeches of an election cycle that has been without precedent in hot rhetoric the presidential campaign has been building toward all this day after day after day the rhetoric has intensified the charges and countercharges have escalated the issues have been reduced to asterisks and the gulf between the trump and clinton coalitions has widened sunday s debate in st louis foreshadowed what was to come now there will be no turning back trump today will broaden his attack against the media to hit globalism and the clinton foundation by charging that mexican billionaire carlos slim is part of the biased coalition working in collusion with the clinton campaign thewall street journal s monica langleyreports as early as friday mr trump is planning to claim that mr slim as a shareholder of new york times co and donor to the clinton foundation has an interest in helping clinton s campaign the slim family held about 17 of the new york times class a shares as of march making them the largest individual shareholder mr slim and his foundation have given between 250 000 and 500 000 to the clinton foundation since its founding attacking the mexican billionaire would allow mr trump to hit several targets he could slam the failing new york times which he says had to be rescued by a foreigner mr slim a trump adviser said slim and the times pushed back quickly this is totally false said arturo elias slim s spokesman of course we aren t interfering in the u s election we aren t even active in mexican politics he said the contributions by slim to the clinton foundation were a matter of public record carlos slim is an excellent shareholder who fully respects boundaries regarding the independence of our journalism said times publisher arthursulzbergerjr he has never sought to influence what we report die hard trumpsupportershave becomeangrier than ever crowds that once booed and shouted at the press mainly at trump s prompting have now begun spontaneously targeting the press on their own at a scale not yet seen in this campaign or any in memory on american soil says politico s ben schreckinger who has covered the campaign for more than a year chants of cnn sucks have become commonplace at trump s rallies this week and members of the traveling press were called whores and press titutes as they filed out of a thursday afternoon rally in west palm beach this week trump has begun claiming that mainstream media outlets no longer conduct journalism reporters who work for these outlets like washington post or the new york times may think of themselves as journalists but they re actually just cogs in a corporate political machine he said in panama city predator in chief one woman told huffpost that she witnessed trump looking up model s skirts and commenting on their underwear at a 1996 dinner with mutual friends their group was seated at a semi circular table lisa boyne recounted and the women couldn t get up without trump and his friend getting up which they refused to do instead boyne said trump insisted that the women walk across the table allowing him to peer up their skirts while they did so trump stuck his head right underneath their skirts boyne said and commented on whether they were wearing underwear and what their genitalia looked like three longtime apprentice staffers told the daily beast that trump repeatedly called deaf actress marlee matlin retarded saying he regularly disrespected her and treated her as if she was mentally disabled he would make fun of her voice it actually sounded a lot like what he did to the new york times guy said a former apprentice employee in another incident trump scribbled in the margins of a note on set marlee is she retarded creepy in 1992 trump spotted a pair of girls singing christmas carols at the plaza hotel and askedthem how old they were when they said 14 trump then 46 replied wow just think in a couple of years i ll be dating you la times trump canceleda sean hannity interview that was scheduled for fox news last night perhaps to avoid having to answer for the latest allegations a spokesman said it would be rescheduled politico these women plan to vote for trump despite his lewd comments by mary jordan in north carolina if clinton becomes the first female president of the united states a lot of women at granny s country kitchen will be upset they know trump has said crude things about women he may even have behaved like a lout but when forced to weigh trump s behavior against their disdain for clinton the women at granny s say it s not even close a growing gender gap is marking the 2016 campaign not since cbs news exit polls were first taken in 1972 has there been such a divide in how men and women view candidates but perhaps more unexpected than women abandoning trump are those who still enthusiastically support him is it offensive yes can we forgive it yes debbie meadows wife of rep mark meadows n c said of trump s remarks rep ted yoho s wife agreed when i found out i had a few moments of righteous indignation she said then i got some perspective the times responded to a letterfrom trump s lawyers that called their sexual assault story libelous and threatened a lawsuit the essence of a libel claim of course is the protection of one s reputation times lawyer david mccraw wrote mr trump has bragged about his non consensual sexual touching of women he has bragged about intruding on beauty pageant contestants in their dressing rooms he acquiesced to a radio hosts request to discuss mr trump s own daughter as a piece of ass multiple women not mentioned in our article have publicly come forward to report on mr trump s unwanted advances nothing in our article has the slightest effect on the reputation that mr trump through his own words and actions has already created for himself melania trump s lawyers also threatened to sue people magazine over the first person accountwritten by trump accuser natasha stoynoff demanding a retraction and saying thatportions of the story are completely fictionalized people editor in chief jess cagle posted a lengthy defense of stoynoff and the story ms stoynoff is a remarkable ethical honest and patriotic woman we stand steadfastly by her and are proud to publish her clear credible account of what happened clinton allies david brock and gloria allred both offered to help coverlegal fees for and otherwise represent trump s accusers we would pay for the legal defense of trump accusers said brock a democratic operative and allred a civil rights lawyer also signaled openness if any women who are making allegations of inappropriate conduct contact me i would be happy to speak to them and then decide if i would be able to represent them she said politico donald trump jr defended his father asked about the two women who talked with the times he said during a radio interview come on guys it s so ridiculous i ve never heard anything dumber in my life i think it makes him a human i think it makes him a normal person not a political robot cnn in another radio interview from2013 don jr actually suggested that women who cannot tolerate harassment don t belong in the workforce if you can t handle some of the basic stuff that s become a problem in the workforce today then you don t belong in the workforce the younger trump said like you should go maybe teach kindergarten i think it s a respectable position the hosts then joked about hypothetically pullingup pictures of naked women on their computer screens i d feel harassed trump jr joked this is my get rich quick scheme i m now suing you guys because i feel uncomfortable and by the way that s what happens in the world i can play along i can be fine and then i can decide randomly uh oh you now have crossed the line even though i ve been going with it buzzfeed ivanka trump stumping for her father in the philadelphia suburbs avoided any talk of the groping allegations ivanka perpetually on point stayed on message nbc s leigh ann caldwell reports so much so that some of the same questions were repeated in each of the events including what it was like to work with her dad and brothers what she likes about pennsylvania and why she thinks her dad would be a good president why didn t trump s people see any ofthis coming because the candidaterebuffed political aides requests to provide standard fare opposition research that is traditional for any public figure and the decision ultimately contributed to his campaign being caught off guard this week both corey lewandowski and paul manafort made these requests when they took the reins of trump s campaign and it became a point of contention among his top political advisers bloomberg s kevin cirilli a review of previously sealed new york records showsthat neither trump nor the trump foundation actually gave the 10 000 that they pledged to a 9 11 charity organization in the months following the attack from the new york daily news the review conducted by city comptrollerscott stringer appears to contradict trump s prior boasts of spontaneous generosity made as his hometown reeled from the worst terrorist attack on u s soil in history the records show that through mid 2002 there is no evidence that trump personally or through the trump foundation gave to either group the only recorded major donation to 9 11 causes that trump has made was 100 000 from his foundation which has been bankrolled by others without any money from trump for years to the 9 11 museum in april 2016 as he sought to generate headlines after cruz attacked him for his new york values during the primary election ten former nuclear launch control officers signed an open letter saying that trump should not have his finger on the button the letter says the decision to use nuclear weapons requires composure judgment restraint and diplomatic skill all qualities that the former air force officers who signed it said trump lacks carol morello a group of former reagan administration alumni have formed a group called reaganites opposing trump in a post on medium former george w bush national intelligence director john d negroponte writes ronald reagan was a man of wisdom humor unfailing courtesy and measured temperament i personally observed these traits during daily meetings in the oval office meetings with foreign leaders and in the situation room he would have been appalled by donald trump s utterances and behavior mr trump has no claim whatsoever to the mantle of ronald reagan what happened to america s mayor how rudy giuliani became trump s attack dog by paul schwartzman and ben terris a year ago former mayor rudolph w giuliani read an editorial in his hometown newspaper mocking him as a shill for endorsing a little known republican district attorney candidate angry giuliani phoned the editorial page editor arthur browne to defend his endorsement but the point that appeared to wound giuliani the most browne recalled was the editorial s assertion that the former mayor resides today beyond political relevance i am relevant he insisted because all these people want my endorsement the former mayor has no such worries these days eight years after his own presidential bid failed giuliani has emerged as trump s unflinching chief apologist cheerleader and rhetorical rottweiler it s a role that confounds allies and admirers who remember giuliani s rise as a law and order republican twice elected in the country s largest bastion of liberalism from his days as u s attorney he was at the top of the organizational chart a former adviser said now he s staff he carries bags he walks behind trump it s just amazing to see the daily hillary clinton submitted formal answers under penalty of perjury over her use of a private email server at the state department declaring 20 times that she did not recall requested information and discussions and asserting she was never warned that the practice could run afoul of laws on preserving federal records from politico s josh gerstein clinton also said she could not recall ever being warned about any hacking or attempted hacking of her private account or server clinton s answers generally track with her public statements on the issue and with fbi reports about what she said during an interview conducted in july clinton decided to use a clintonemail com account for the purpose of convenience her lawyers said asked what other reasons she may have had for doing so she gave no ground clinton advisers pressed her to apologize more explicitly for her use of a private email server while at the state department according to emails obtained in the wikileaks hacking from the wall street journal after clinton addressed the issue in a september 2015 tv interview top aides discussed what they deemed a positive showing but longtime clinton confidante neera tanden wrote everyone wants her to apologize and she should apologies are like her achilles heel tanden added but she didn t seem like a b tch in the interview and she said the word sorry president obama launched a two day campaign swing for clinton in ohio seeking to boost turnout for the democratic nominee among african american and millennial voters that helped him win the state in 2008 and 2012 david nakamura and krissah thompson the idaho statesman endorses clinton today we recognize a lot of you are not going to like our choice of a democrat in this republican state the editorial board writes but our hope is that you will consider our reasoning before critiquing our conclusion at this critical time in our nation s history we need more than ever to listen to each other with respect looking past november this week s economist cover is on the debasing of american politics in a more fragile democracy trump s rhetoric would foreshadow post election violence mercifully america is not about to riot on november 9th but the reasons have less to do with the state s power to enforce the letter of the law than with the unwritten rules that american democracy thrives on it is these that mr trump is trampling over and which americans need to defend daniel patrick moynihan wrote that when many bad things happen at once societies define deviancy down until the list of what is unacceptable is short enough to be manageable when parents wonder if a presidential debate is suitable for their children to watch mr trump s promise to build a wall on the mexican border no longer seems quite so shocking healthy politics is not gang warfare it involves compromise because to yield in some areas is to move forward in others it requires the insight that your opponent can be honourable and principled however strongly you disagree the 2016 election campaign has poured scorn on such ideas all americans are worse off as a result conservativecommentator erick erickson writeson the path forward forthe post trump gop in november when mr trump s meteor enters the atmosphere of the voting booth americans will be treated to a spectacular flameout as late night comedians and professional twitter warriors rush to tweet you re fired but when the russians go home the pastors repent and riot police disperse white nationalist protests the republicans will need fresh ideas and most importantly the republican party must recommit to a basic principle character counts the party that once impeached bill clinton for lying about an affair has defended a man who bragged about sexual assault character cannot be wedded to party politics and the republicans will have to make amends for defining deviancy down to defend the indefensible donald trump wall street journal voters education level a driving force this election by aaron zitner and dante chinni the clearest dividing line in this year s presidential election now falls along educational lines whites without a college degree have consolidated behind trump and those with a four year degree are tending to back clinton the divide helps explain why mr trump pulled his field staff wednesday from virginia essentially ceding a state where polling shows he has been largely abandoned by suburban voters with higher education levels and why he remains competitive in the swing states of iowa and ohio which have large shares of noncollege whites mrs clinton meanwhile is ahead in new hampshire and colorado home to larger shares of whites with college degrees the widening education gap if it holds would stand as a landmark in the repositioning of the nation s two main political parties former boston globe d c bureau chief david shribman grapples with the idea that democrats are becoming the new professional party american political parties are always in transition this year trump has revealed deep cracks in the traditional republican coalition and gone to war with party leaders yet while the democrats are more united behind their 2016 nominee they re arguably more divided over their party s vision and future for politicians and campaign operatives who for a generation or more have been working for the democrats or against them the party s growing dependence on the prosperous and well educated is disorienting are the democrats the party of working people anymore or is their future with college educated professionals does a party that draws its strength from the richest and the poorest places in america have any logical rationale hence this question perhaps the most devastating one of all have the democrats replaced the republicans as the party of the social cultural and economic elite a wounded bear is a dangerous thing detested and defeated trump is now in a tear the country down rage the new york times timothy egan writes day after day he rips at the last remaining threads of decency holding this nation together his opponent is the devil he says hate her with all your heart forget about the rule of law lock her up here s his lesson for young minds if you re rich and boorish enough you can get away with anything get away with sexual assault get away with not paying taxes get away with never telling the truth you know this by now all the sordid details for much of the last year the republican presidential nominee has been a freak show an oh my god

secretary of state john husted ohio has purged nearly 2 million voters from its rolls some of them were legitimately removed because they died or left the state but many had only committed the sin of
