advertisement supported by she wants the democrats to reach a different kind of swing voter those who otherwise stay home and she says she can help joe biden do it by elaina plott the clapping hands appeared on the screen one two a flurry of emojis flashing under the facebook live feed of the former minority leader of the georgia house of representatives stacey abrams it was the socially distanced derivative of the applause she has often encountered in the past year or so since her narrow loss in the race for governor of georgia in 2018 ms abrams was addressing the virtual audience of the new hampshire democratic party convention she was there last saturday to talk voter suppression the focal point of her work since 2018 and by the looks of the comments had found a receptive crowd go stacey popped one then 13 seconds later stacy for vp this of course was the subtext of ms abrams s appearance saturday and again thursday night when she appeared with joseph r biden jr on msnbc to talk about voting rights in early april on a call with georgians to discuss her work on ballot access in the pandemic ms abrams said you don t do these things for the title but in her recent run of appearances and interviews she has nevertheless been open about the title she wants vice president and what she thinks her name on the ticket would mean for the future of the democratic electorate with mr biden the presumptive democratic presidential nominee nearing 78 the question of his running mate has largely been one of experience who is capable of stepping into the top job on day 1 it is not a standard that favors the chances of someone with the limited national political r sum of ms abrams which for some democrats has made her candid ambition for the nomination off putting yet to ms abrams 46 the value of whomever mr biden chooses is not just about experience it is about signaling which voters the party wants to cultivate both ahead of november and beyond traditionally democrats have sought a vice presidential pick that appeals to swing voters those suburban whites whose operative variable is not whether they show up to the polls but whether they go blue or red upon arrival such a priority this year would elevate the appeal of a running mate like senator amy klobuchar of minnesota or gov gretchen whitmer of michigan but there is another oft overlooked slice of the electorate that ms abrams argues is equally crucial to the party s success voters who grapple with a different binary voting democratic or not voting at all the focus on persuasion has often been trying to persuade someone to shift from their conservative ideology to a more moderate or liberal ideology ms abrams said in an interview but for voters of color it isn t about shifting ideology it s persuading them that voting actually will have an effect these other swing voters oscillating between voting democratic or not at all are the americans largely racial minorities and young people whom ms abrams has devoted her career to reaching as she explains it there are overt voter suppression tactics and then there is this more insidious thread often unwittingly perpetuated by her own party that tells this segment of swing voters that they are less worthy of courting melanye price a professor of african american studies and political science at prairie view a m university said what was striking was not so much that ms abrams views these unreliable voters as essential to the democratic playbook but that so few party leaders recognize their own role in alienating them it s the biggest failure of the democratic party of the last decade she said i don t think it s malicious i think it s just benign neglect as the first black woman to run as either major party s candidate for governor in any state ms abrams became the face of the issue of voting rights in 2018 after narrowly losing her race to brian kemp a republican she argued that racially motivated voter suppression had sealed mr kemp s victory and shortly after launched fair fight a pac dedicated to expanding voter education and ballot access across the united states she still lived in her atlanta townhouse still read as many as three books at a time for fun on rotation now a biography of huey long a novel called a place for us and the latest from the sci fi writer n k jemisin but she committed herself to the question of civic participation broadly and intensely crisscrossing the country to raise money and give speeches and starting another organization to educate voters on the importance of the census since 2018 fair fight along with its nonprofit arm fair fight action has raised millions of dollars and funded teams at state democratic parties across the country in 2019 for example fair fight helped kentucky democrats file a lawsuit that restored to the rolls some 175 000 voters who had been purged by the republican governor and amid the pandemic the organization has shifted its focus to the expansion of voting by mail ms abrams stressed that these efforts can matter little if citizens do not buy into the act of voting itself in other words if the barrier to participation is not so much a law or policy but a belief that the system has never valued one s voice to begin with for americans of color it is often impossible to believe that there are any leaders who want more for them ms abrams said it is critical then for democrats to commit to persuading these communities that voting is still worth it that more and better is possible allowing disenchantment to fester unchecked she reiterated is its own blemish on the party few elections underscored the consequences better than in 2016 when black turnout dropped and in many regions plummeted contributing to hillary clinton s losses in states like michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin as lauren groh wargo fair fight s chief executive and ms abrams s former campaign manager explained it campaigns often don t turn to black voters until after labor day sending a cursory crush of mailers following a summer of intensive and individualized outreach to white so called persuadables and then we wonder why come election day we don t see the type of african american enthusiasm and engagement and support levels that we want to win she said for ms abrams the issues of access to the vote and african american political engagement are intensely personal storytime for ms abrams and her five siblings growing up in mississippi and georgia included the day their father was arrested while trying to register older black voters in hattiesburg miss he was around 14 or 15 years old far too young himself to register but he knew the fact that he could not even imagine voting was wrong ms abrams said they learned about the dogs the police officers the time that either a cop or an angry segregationist she can t remember which shot at her father and clipped his heel my mom was different ms abrams said she was also involved in activism we just like to joke she was smart enough not to get caught ms abrams remembered jumping up the morning of her 18th birthday to register to vote herself feeling grown up using her spelman college p o box in atlanta as her address she set out a table on campus clipboard and pen in hand helping other people register as bill clinton ran his first campaign for president the story of voter suppression today is no longer the stuff of billy clubs and hoses that ms abrams heard about as a child but what was once a very clear bright line where the government said you cannot ms abrams said has been replaced with labyrinthine rules and invisible barriers as dr price sees it such issues are rarely discussed at the national level in part because voter suppression can be incorrectly viewed as a uniquely southern menace and because they don t think they can win there she argued democrats don t take the south seriously the question then is at what point democratic leaders start to incorporate voices like ms abrams s into the party s identity regardless of immediate electoral prospects i know what stacey abrams feels said representative james e clyburn democrat of south carolina and the house majority whip i know what it is to operate in washington d c with people looking upon southerners as being sort of outside the mainstream and black southerners he added my god mr clyburn whose endorsement before the south carolina primary in february helped propel mr biden to the nomination said ms abrams was among the 10 or 12 people he thinks would be highly qualified to be mr biden s running mate though in a financial times interview in late march he questioned whether she had the requisite experience qualifications are not the problem he said in a recent interview with the new york times it s the chemistry that s got to be there mr clyburn said that as the father of three black women he thought it would be great if mr biden picked a black woman but he did not see it as a must certainly not a political necessity in the same way that he believed mr biden s pledge to pick a female running mate was but he argued that his party should heed ms abrams s message about the kind of voter it can no longer take for granted the south has given too much not to get the respect in return he said this is in some ways the crux of ms abrams s case for vice president in her 2018 campaign for governor in which she achieved record turnout among african americans latinos asian americans and pacific islanders and young people ms abrams showed how an investment in such voters those least likely to show up to the polls and thus most likely to be ignored could make the democratic party competitive even in a state as conservative as georgia she struggled however to pick up votes in rural areas all of which may bolster ms abrams s claim that she knows how to translate progressive to southern nevertheless close as that race may have been ms abrams lost meaning her highest profile political experience remains leading democrats in the georgia state legislature donald trump of course upended any traditional notion of what constitutes experience when he won the presidency in 2016 but what democrats were looking for this year is the anti trump said alan abramowitz a political science professor at emory university in atlanta that was always biden s appeal someone with a lot of national political experience a sharp contrast to trump if anything that criterion is even more important for vice president because that person has to be someone who s ready to serve as president ms abrams he said is just not strong in that area but ms abrams says her qualifications if not her experience in the strictest sense stack up with anyone else s she s not worried about surviving a full political vetting arguing that things like her debt which she paid off in full last year are not red flags but evidence she has lived a real life on foreign policy she stressed that she had traveled to over a dozen countries not on vacation but learning and asked if she was prepared to be president on day 1 if needed amid a pandemic no less she answered with an unequivocal yes beyond her r sum critics have questioned ms abrams s unwillingness to play the game to act as though her ambition is an afterthought a candor some democrats have objected to especially in light of reports that mr biden does not view her as a top contender representative william lacy clay a missouri democrat said in april he found ms abrams s lobbying for the job offensive and inappropriate but as ms abrams sees it campaigning on questions of who has a voice and whose voice is heard means she is speaking for far more than just herself we know extrapolations are made from single moments she said part of my directness in answering the question about v p is that i don t want anyone whether a southerner an african american a woman or all of the above to ever look at my answer and say well if she can t say it then i can t think it updated may 25 2020 advertisement
