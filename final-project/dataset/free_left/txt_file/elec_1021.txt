advertisement supported by by jonathan martin and ashley parker ankeny iowa at a recent ice cream social here jim hallihan liked what he heard from senator marco rubio he praised the florida senator s youthful optimism and his eloquent testimony to the opportunities america offered but there was something larger that drew mr hallihan a former iowa state basketball coach to mr rubio 43 the son of poor cuban immigrants the day of the older white guy is kind of out said mr hallihan a 70 year old white guy as mr rubio has introduced himself to curious and overwhelmingly caucasian republican audiences from iowa to new hampshire he has vaulted to the front ranks of the early pack of likely presidential candidates partly because of his natural political talent but it may owe just as much to the combination of his personal story and the balm it offers to a party that has been repeatedly scalded by accusations of prejudice he says he is highlighting his background only to share his own twist on the american dream not out of any desire to make history on behalf of hispanics but mr rubio and those around him are also acutely aware of the sometimes raw tensions in his party between those unsettled by an increasingly diverse society and those who say republicans must embrace the multihued america of 2015 to the party operatives and donors who have placed long bets on him and to the rank and file primary voters he has impressed mr rubio s candidacy seems to affirm the idea that in a free market anyone can rise without the benefit of connections or wealth that he did so as the child of latin american parents who fled an autocratic government and toiled in the humblest of jobs maid and bartender has sent some republicans swooning donald j trump officially accepted the republican party s nomination on july 22 hillary clinton was officially nominated on july 26 at the democratic convention the identity politics people in the party want a champion who looks like him to mitigate accusations of racism said ben domenech a conservative writer and the classical conservatives look at him and say this is somebody who can sell our ideas to the public conservatives have long had a philosophical contempt for politics driven by gender racial or class designations but those sentiments are giving way as the party tries to compete with democrats who galvanized support among targeted demographics to decisively win consecutive presidential elections republican voters are overwhelmingly white the composition of the electorate in almost every contested state during the 2012 party primary was about 90 percent or more non hispanic white according to exit polls a new york times cbs poll this week found that 68 percent of republicans think america is ready to elect a hispanic president and after nearly eight years in which republicans have angrily disputed charges that their opposition to president obama is rooted in racial animus mr rubio could serve as an unspoken but forceful rebuttal the same things that ignited democrats about obama are what will ignite republicans for rubio said ed failor jr an iowa republican strategist or as mr domenech put it if we look to politicians to make us feel good about ourselves do you want to go with just another republican caricature or somebody who has this unique appeal andrea szewczyk 51 a republican and a schoolteacher in romeo mich who was surveyed in the times poll said she believed that mr rubio s ethnicity could excite the electorate much as she said mr obama s identity did we d get some democrats voting republican because of it she said indeed much as many white liberals treasured the opportunity to support mr obama white conservatives may welcome a bible quoting handsome hispanic capable of evangelizing the gospel of american exceptionalism in two languages mr rubio disputes suggestions that he is capitalizing on the history making potential of becoming his party s first minority nominee the presidency is too important to say we re going to share it among ethnicities he said in an interview much as mr obama avoided running expressly as a black candidate mr rubio is uneasy about explicitly invoking his ethnicity in the primary of a party that can seem split between tapping into and trying to overcome white resentment politics instead just as mr obama s talk of hope and change in 2008 allowed voters to project their own vision onto the candidate mr rubio s campaign is its own rorschach test his advisers assert that mr rubio s background is compelling to voters across racial lines many of whom are themselves only a few generations removed from ellis island narratives but they have also studied the voter rolls to see how mr rubio might spur hispanic turnout in some heavily white states say by delivering as few as 5 000 hispanic votes in iowa still if some republicans love the idea of what mr rubio s ethnicity represents others are wary wayne r lapierre chief executive of the national rifle association said at its annual conference last month eight years of one demographically symbolic president is enough referring to mr obama and hillary rodham clinton who if elected would be the first female president the republican field includes another latino senator ted cruz of texas whose father emigrated from cuba but mr rubio seems mindful of the risks of confronting the most conservative elements of his party over delicate racial issues at a candidate forum in new hampshire last month he passed up the chance to offer even a gentle reproach to a woman who citing bilingual store signs and automated phone lines complained that immigrants were not coming here and learning english well here s the bottom line mr rubio told her if you don t speak english you re not going to prosper economically in america at a similar gathering recently in iowa mr rubio recounted vowing to his dying grandfather in spanish that he would study hard and not squander opportunities but mr rubio told the story in english asked if he was comfortable speaking spanish on the campaign trail mr rubio seemed to grow momentarily defensive sure he said adding i don t want to make spanish illegal i m ultimately saying that you have to have a unifying language where your schools are taught what your laws are written in and how others communicate with each other he continued every nation needs a unifying language our unifying language is english as for those with dial 1 for english gripes mr rubio said i know hispanics that complain about that especially people in the second or third generation mr rubio has met with some pushback in his party from people who see the country changing and want to stop placating those who are unhappy about it you can t allow yourself to be pushed back into english only english only said former representative henry bonilla of texas a republican and mexican american this is the u s our language is english but we re in a global economy now so why wouldn t you want to know more than one language mr rubio does not entirely avoid speaking spanish he frequently gives interviews to spanish language journalists especially in florida and in his announcement speech in miami last month he shared a saying from his late father en este pa s ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos mr rubio said then he translated it in this country you will achieve all the things we never could but he is careful about how he presents his dual identity in a video his campaign released shortly after he entered the race mr rubio was shown answering the questions about him posed in frequent google searches what nationality is marco rubio he said reading one i m an american of hispanic descent by contrast jeb bush whose wife is mexican and who often refers to their bicultural children is not so torn he delights in opportunities to demonstrate his fluent spanish and last week he courted voters in puerto rico i know the power of the immigrant experience because i live it each and every day he said there the legislative embodiment of the conflicting forces tugging at mr rubio was the effort to overhaul american immigration laws he helped write a comprehensive bill including a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country but it died in the republican controlled house and provoked outrage from the party s most reliable primary voters last month when mr rubio made his first trip to iowa after announcing his campaign he was confronted at a closed door meeting by mariannette miller meeks a former congressional candidate who pointedly urged him not to retreat from an immigration overhaul my advice to senator rubio was to be honest with people be yourself ms miller meeks said afterward because that will carry a lot of weight advertisement
