six years ago the apparel manufacturer eagle sportswear in rural middlesex north carolina was ready to close until bayard winthrop helped buy the knitwear plant we ve spent nationally much of the last 40 years moving manufacturing overseas to chase cheap labor and lower environment standards and lower regulations winthrop said in 1980 almost 80 of clothing bought in the u s was made in america today it s around 3 winthrop says while globalization and trade deals made goods cheaper they also brought decades of lay offs and plant closures i m a free trade person winthrop said but i also am a believer in saying wait a second you cannot gut a bunch of communities in the u s and move to bangladesh and then import all those goods back again and sell them at the local dollar store to all these people that now no longer have jobs president donald trump s answer to the loss of manufacturing jobs has been tariffs and trade wars but back in 2012 in san francisco winthrop set about bringing back manufacturing jobs the old fashioned way by creating them winthrop s previous experience had been on wall street and in silicon valley but he started his own clothing company with a big name american giant and an even bigger goal making everything from start to finish in the united states like a few other clothing companies trying to manufacture in the u s american giant faced a big challenge all those closed factories have left a threadbare infrastructure for actually making apparel like the company s flannel shirt so this was an art that had almost died in america asked correspondent john blackstone well it had effectively died winthrop said we actually had to bring one of the great yarn dyers effectively out of retirement to come back and help deliver this program creating work meant creating a supply chain involving multiple steps blackstone followed the chain for american giant s hoodie and learned the jobs are not what they used to be the seeds of winthrop s big idea are found on farms like jerry hamill s in enfield north carolina where cotton is planted in the spring hamill is looking for help but says few are up to the job the labor force here the ones that will work are working he said and some are not gonna work it makes no difference what they are offered what kind of money what kind of benefits they just are not going to work so each season hamill hires men from mexico on temporary worker visas come fall they ll pick the cotton and transfer it to the local gin which removes the seeds the next stop is parkdale mills in gaffney south carolina where raw cotton is cleaned and spun into yarn parkdale mills has more in common with silicon valley than it does with the mill seen in the 1979 movie norma rae blackstone said i come into your mill i expect to see sally field and i see robots instead to stay in business today you have to automate said parkdale ceo andy warlick and we couldn t survive competing against the world if we weren t automated probably have more robots here than we have employees but the employees are well trained to operate those robots and it s been the key to our survival in the 1960s a mill like this would have employed 2 000 workers today about 125 work here producing about 2 million pounds of yarn a week it s then knitted into fabric and sent a few miles away to carolina cotton works where it s dyed and dried founder page ashby and sons hunter and bryan started working with winthrop in 2013 after realizing he wasn t the typical client it contradicted the conventional thinking of taking cost out and offering something cheaper than everybody else said bryan and on top of everything else he s going to make it a couple hundred miles from here in north carolina my response was this is the guy we ve been dreaming about where s he been for the past 15 years for the final stop the finished fabric goes to the knitwear plant winthrop helped buy eagle sportswear where it s cut and sewn into actual clothing winthrop said the sweatshirt is so complicated there are so many parts that each modular line is only making a part of the sweatshirt to improve productivity winthrop replaced the traditional assembly lines with groups of sewers working in teams they get extra pay for exceeding daily quotas thelma agular who has worked here for 21 years is part of a three woman modular sew line who are exceeding their expected output of units by 123 yeah they changed everything agular said of the process and you can make more money so you try to be very efficient all day asked blackstone yeah we try every day yeah we try yeah so i m holding you up from meeting your goal there yeah a little while blackstone asked winthrop you have to pay these people a good deal more than you would if they were sewing in china or vietnam yeah i would just argue that s a good thing right he replied keeping this final step here in the u s winthrop says adds as much as 17 to the total cost of the hoodie to reduce overhead american giant sells almost entirely online with only two brick and mortar stores so the final price tag for the hoodie blackstone followed from the cotton fields to the gin to the mill to the dyer to the knitwear plant to the store is no bargain 108 winthrop justified the expense what we really want to do with this particular item is make something that you are going to have for decades in this era of fast fashion winthrop may seem out of step but despite its lofty price tag his hoodie has been selling well ever since the digital magazine slate called it the greatest hoodie ever made the article came out and within 24 hours we d sold everything we d ever made he said bayard winthrop wants to inspire other companies to manufacture here for him the made in u s a label creates both jobs and pride blackstone asked so are you selling an idea an image as much as clothing i think we re selling a value system winthrop said stand for some things that matter stand for american manufacturing stand for the people that are making stuff and when we buy things when we do it consciously when we do it with an eye towards understanding how these little votes that we make have an impact attached to them we ll be better off for more info story produced by dustin stephens watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand
