advertisement supported by by alexander burns summerville s c republicans in south carolina have in recent years raced ahead of the national party in presenting an inclusive face to voters since 2010 the state has elected an indian american governor and the country s only black republican senator and its republican controlled legislature voted last summer to remove the confederate battle flag from the grounds of the capitol so for party leaders and mainstream voters here it may come as a kind of deflating climax if as is widely expected donald j trump wins the state s presidential primary on saturday with a campaign message about cracking down on illegal immigration and fighting middle eastern terrorism with methods including torture mr trump has built a commanding lead in most south carolina polls though there have been some indications of a tightening race his results in the two early states so far have alarmed more traditional republicans who fear that a trump nomination would solidify for nonwhite voters an image of republicans as an angry and intolerant party if mr trump s candidacy carries high stakes for conservatives everywhere the implications of his campaign may be especially weighty in the south where politics has long been polarized along racial lines and where a handful of republicans have striven to broaden the party s appeal to black hispanic and asian american voters in south carolina gov nikki r haley the state s first nonwhite governor and senator tim scott the first black senator elected from the south since reconstruction have both backed senator marco rubio of florida as an alternative to mr trump the picture of the three of them campaigning together says a lot about the republican party mr rubio who is of cuban descent said in an appearance on cnn on wednesday the fear among republican leaders here is that a smashing victory for mr trump would say more about the party and about the state potentially undermining south carolina s image as a more welcoming place that is no longer defined by figures like strom thurmond the former segregationist presidential candidate who served in the senate until 2003 former gov david m beasley a republican who sought unsuccessfully to bring down the confederate flag during his single term in office said mr trump s campaign had given voice to a serious sense of frustration in the state but he said the trump message was not a fair approximation of south carolina values it does not reflect south carolina said mr beasley who has not endorsed a candidate in the race he added trump has been very divisive and it s a strategy that he has taken to be clearly a non establishment candidate a look at the latest results for iowa and new hampshire and how this year compares to previous election seasons ted pitts the president of the south carolina chamber of commerce said it would be inappropriate to judge the state based on a republican primary winner who didn t get a majority of the vote i don t think that s at all indicative of where the majority is mr pitts said without mentioning mr trump by name he said that person s not going to get even a majority of the republican primary voters better representations of south carolina mr pitts said were ms haley s and mr scott s huge election margins in 2014 mr trump s opponents have tried to tap into the impulse toward inclusiveness among some republicans here particularly in the comparatively affluent retirement havens along the coast and in areas around major cities like charleston and columbia even before her endorsement of mr rubio ms haley repeatedly criticized mr trump as an angry and divisive figure senator lindsey graham of south carolina a mainstream republican who supported an immigration overhaul has castigated mr trump as a racial divider who would doom the republican party as its nominee transcript soundbite english founder of mt pleasant flight training joe bustos saying the economy is still important we re seeing some ups and downs and of course in a business like this that depends on people s disposable incomes it s really something we have to watch so i m looking for those that are going to have policies that will keep the economy healthy 14 soundbite english college of charleston political science department chairman dr gibbs knotts saying the republican voters and the republican party in south carolina has taken a lot of pride in not only being the first in the south but picking the winner picking the people who will win the republican primary in between 1980 which was the first first in the south primary in south carolina up to 2008 they had always picked a winner 21 soundbite english production design associates founder jeff nickles saying we d like some change and i d like to have some relief for small businesses small business is the backbone of our country and it s getting harder and harder to do business with taxes and health care regulations and all the things that the government puts down on us it s really hard to make a living when you re having to deal with all this interference from the government the government should really build an environment where business can flourish and not be meddling in every aspect of the business jeb bush the former florida governor has rebuked mr trump insistently in his speeches for denigrating hispanics and women and his brother former president george w bush said at a campaign rally on monday that he had been moved by south carolina s response to the mass shooting at the emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston in june the shooting which a young white supremacist is accused of carrying out prompted ms haley and state lawmakers to endorse the removal of the confederate battle flag from the state house but the powerful advantage mr trump holds here has remained a source of angst for republicans the primary race defined by his attacks has presented an uncomfortable contrast with the democratic side of the presidential race in which hillary clinton and senator bernie sanders of vermont have emphasized themes of racial justice in a fierce competition for black votes mr trump has spoken dismissively about politically correct language and has called for a ban on muslim immigration and for the deportations of millions of people who entered the country illegally in south carolina his campaign is running a provocative commercial describing a murder in california committed by an illegal immigrant and vowing to crack down on the country s southern border according to the associated press donald j trump and hillary clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party s nomination for president he has responded with contempt to ms haley s criticism and dismissed her as very very weak on illegal immigration after she endorsed mr rubio and mr trump s campaign has drawn admiration from some unexpected quarters state representative jenny horne a republican who drew attention last summer with an impassioned speech urging the confederate flag s removal said in an interview that she admired mr trump s outsider campaign and that he was among the candidates she might support on saturday nothing he s said is offensive to me said ms horne who is running for congress this year the trump phenomenon is a byproduct of many years of establishment candidates who no 1 don t tell the american people the truth and no 2 are totally disconnected from what americans really care about at mr rubio s and mr bush s midweek events in summerville there was considerably deeper unease about mr trump s position in the state and even voters who described themselves as sympathetic to his message said they ultimately recoiled from his slash and burn approach to politics in some ways he comes across as being very redneck said margaret o brien a charleston retiree suppose he started talking like that to foreign leaders she added i don t think that it helps bring the country together to say bad things about anybody in the country andres torres a national guard member studying at the citadel said mr trump s campaign clashed with the progress south carolina had made toward racial reconciliation now you can look at our senators look at our governor and see how much we ve come along as a state said mr torres 29 a native of mount pleasant still he acknowledged looking outside of the big cities it s trump supporters advertisement
