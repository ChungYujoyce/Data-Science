by eli stokols and shane goldmacher march 15 2016 eli stokols is a national politics reporter shane goldmacher is a political reporter covering the 2016 presidential race three days before florida s climactic primary marco rubio sank deep into a black leather armchair on his campaign bus he had just spent 25 minutes smiling wide for supporters at a high end boutique selling 150 candles don t forget to vote on tuesday he shouted from the third step of a wood paneled staircase now on his parked bus the afternoon sunlight shut out by drawn blinds the smile was gone the candidate knew it was already over there will be a reckoning he warned advertisement there will be a reckoning in the mainstream media where all these networks and cable networks are going to have to ask themselves why did they give so much coverage for the sake of ratings he said there will be a reckoning in the conservative movement where a lot of people who for a long time have espoused conservative principles seem to not care about those anymore in rallying around donald trump because they like his attitude i think there are a lot of people in the conservative movement who are going to spend years and years explaining to people how they fell into this and how they allowed this to happen for now though it is rubio s reckoning that s at hand and not just because of trump or cable television networks rubio s strategy was always an inside straight overly reliant on a candidate s ability to dominate free national media in order to outperform outwit and eventually outlast a wide field of rivals it was sketched out by an inner circle of advisers who believed they could eschew the very fundamentals of presidential campaigning because they had a candidate who transcended that s exactly what happened in 2016 it just turned out rubio wasn t the one transcending even before his picturesque launch at symbolic freedom tower in miami last spring rubio s aides were hardly the only ones who saw in rubio an answer to the republican party s prayers a young charismatic and hispanic conservative the son of a bartender and a maid with remarkably broad appeal across a gop spectrum riven by ideological and stylistic divisions he d been plastered on the cover of time as the republican savior rubio was the kind of rare talent who could win a primary and then articulate a conservative message that resonated in a fast changing country in the general they didn t need a particular political base they didn t need to talk process they didn t need a ground game all they needed was marco and he scared the daylights out of the democrats so while other campaigns touted shock and awe fundraising networks and precise psychographic analytics and voter targeting operations rubio s tight knit group of mostly 40 something bros believed wholeheartedly that they didn t need a specific early state win they didn t need a particular political base they didn t need to talk process they didn t need a ground game they didn t need to be the immediate front runner all they needed was marco their confidence bordered on arrogance sure his closest advisers campaign manager terry sullivan and media strategists todd harris and heath thompson were right that their candidate was likable he began the race as the second choice of many republican primary voters they just never figured out how to make voters embrace him as their first trump was drawing away the cameras they had banked on lifting their rising star sucking up all the media attention as he dominated media cycle after media cycle setting the parameters of the 2016 debate day after day suddenly their telegenic candidate couldn t get on tv and when rubio stumbled as all candidates do there was no infrastructure to catch him no field program to lift his support no base to fall back upon all they had was marco as jeb bush was quickly beset by leaks backbiting and inflated expectations rubio s campaign more closely resembled the barack obama model of 2008 from the start it was a close knit group led by sullivan thompson and harris with alex conant rubio s communications director since 2011 rich beeson the deputy campaign manager pollster whit ayers and a few others in the innermost circle they held conference calls three times a week to stay on the same page and based their headquarters only a few blocks from capitol hill to better coordinate with rubio when the senate was in session sullivan ran a tight ship in the early months of the campaign he insisted on personally signing off on every expense above 500 the limit was later relaxed but symbolic of a campaign that knew it had to scrimp to compete with bush whose super pac hauled in 100 million in the first half of 2015 the campaign spared no expense in setting up events to be television friendly there were invariably press risers tidy backdrops and television lighting to portray rubio quite literally in the best imaginable light but one of the things sullivan seemed least interested in was field offices the campaign would force volunteers and supporters to pay for their own yard signs posters and bumper stickers rubio arrives to address supporters at a caucus night party on february 1 2016 in des moines iowa getty rubio seemed to agree in august he was due to open his iowa state headquarters the morning after flipping pork chops at the state fair but he bailed at the last minute the reason heading back to florida for his children s start of school the grand opening would be delayed for 10 days and it would occur without rubio he wouldn t announce a state director to run operations in the crucial caucuses for another month it was a fitting episode for a campaign that had bragged about how staff could work just as well out of a starbucks with a laptop the campaign wouldn t announce supporters in iowa s various regions until january 2016 and only then under intensifying pressure from allies and when campaign officials announced their field offices they wouldn t say exactly where they actually were making it all but impossible for volunteers to volunteer it s not that rubio s team didn t know the data science that powered obama s two campaigns or that studies showed that door knocks and personal phone calls are among the most effective means to get out the vote it s that they re expensive and time consuming and rubio s team thought they had figured out a better way targeting exactly their voters with pinpoint precision online on tv and in the mail it s almost like they wanted to prove they could win without doing some of the stuff people have to do to win said one rubio supporter very familiar with the campaign s planning were they just fucking lazy or arrogant in fact they had designed a campaign to fit neatly with rubio s own conception of himself as master political communicator marco is convinced and perhaps rightly so that he has the skills to convince anyone said dan gelber who served for eight years in the florida legislature with rubio including two as the democratic counterpart when rubio was gop speaker he really believes that if you give him an audience he can turn them to his way of thinking donors were unnerved by it though so terry sullivan outlined the plans to some of rubio s supporters at a closed door strategy session at the bellagio hotel in las vegas in october the campaign s goal sullivan explained was simply to put rubio in front of as many voters as possible as often as possible according to an attendee and that meant getting free media coverage and buying paid television ads so the campaign had locked in ad rates early paying as little as 10 cents for every dollar spent by bush s super pac at times they d spend far less than bush s allies and still out advertise them the team wanted marco to sell himself on tv not rely on second rate surrogates or volunteers and that meant less focus on door knocking or volunteer phone calling it s almost like they wanted to prove they could win without doing some of the stuff people have to do to win donors and early state supporters who had grown accustomed to presidential level coddling and attention pushed back and by december optimus the firm paid nearly 900 000 to run rubio s analytics operation prepared a public memo to quiet the critics the memo described a hypothetical midwestern state with 150 000 likely voters roughly the expected iowa turnout at the time and one candidate at 20 percent trailing another at 30 percent it was clear to everyone it was about rubio and iowa in it optimus made the case that running a ground game missed the elephant in the room as it nudged support up less than 1 percentage point you ve got a 10 point gap you need to close the memo read all this is not to say that door knocking doesn t work we know it does the memo concluded sullivan put it most succinctly to the new york times in december more people in iowa see marco on fox and friends than see marco when he is in iowa the ground free strategy surprised democrats and even some of rubio s rivals this isn t even a question in the mind of anyone who s worked on presidential campaigns dan pfieffer a former senior adviser to president obama told politico earlier this year you have to build an extensive and aggressive ground operation to win the weirdest thing is that we re debating this pfieffer added ted cruz had invested more in ground operations than any other republican and his campaign manager jeff roe told politico he was surprised how few ground troops any of his opponents were mobilizing it s a huge investment it s a huge investment of resources when a lot of people might not know how many resources they have so i understand why they don t do it roe said but there s an advantage the ground game just never goes away roe estimated that a total of 4 5 percent of the vote can be swung through field operations often divided among the various candidates i ve been surprised that we ve been the beneficiary of nearly all of that 4 5 percent for the lack of other campaigns he said rubio s strategy worked just fine in iowa he surged through the finish line there topping pre caucus polls and expectations to finish a strong third powered by his glowing media coverage and onslaught of paid advertising although it didn t hurt that every other establishment rival from bush to chris christie and john kasich faded there down the stretch that night he scored the largest televised audience by jumping ahead of his rivals to deliver the first victory speech of the night so this is the moment they said would never happen he began rubio arrived in new hampshire off a red eye flight a renewed candidate his campaign and his opponents began to see it in their tracking internal polls day by day rubio ticked up rubio began to pull away from his establishment rivals kasich and bush and stand alone in second place one rival s polling had rubio at 12 3 percent in new hampshire on the eve of the iowa caucuses and then jumping to 16 4 percent the day before the pre primary debate another rival had a single night sample before the debate admittedly a small statistical sampling showing rubio moving within striking distance of trump after his infamous repetitive debate performance before the new hampshire primary rubio antagonists in manchester started to dress up as robots to substantiate the marcobot meme getty it made sense that christie dead in the water in a state where he d invested more time than any other candidate tried to take the paint off rubio that saturday night but what no one expected was that rubio as strong and consistent a debater as there was in the field would fall apart under christie s cross examining when rubio got stuck repeating a point about obama knowing exactly what he s doing christie pounced there it is folks he said pointing out the robotic recitation of a talking point one rubio adviser said rubio was second in new hampshire when that moment happens he ends up taking fifth rubio took just 10 6 percent of the vote a candidate whose campaign had bet it all on his ability to perform had just made a critical mistake and there was no organization to provide a safety net every time there was a failure from the candidate he didn t have the underlying structure to back him up said a senior adviser to a rival campaign perhaps more importantly the two rivals he d been about to knock out stayed in the race because of that fifth place finish jeb goes on to south carolina and kasich is still alive today said a rubio adviser it really caused this chain reaction rubio managed to rebound he owned the new hampshire disaster and closed a strong second in south carolina his margin of victory proved to be enough to finally drive bush out suddenly in a race that began with 17 candidates rubio despite not having won a single state was in the final four but trump remained in his way and with his other rivals gone rubio s advisers decided it was time for their candidate to take the gloves off it was a high risk move for a risk averse campaign but the rubio team knew it needed to jolt the race after going 0 for february and heading into the single most delegate rich day on the calendar march 1 there were only two ways to reset the media storyline the rubio campaign believed one was winning states which hadn t happened the other was through brute force to set a two man narrative under the bright lights on a houston debate stage rubio proved to be pretty good at throwing haymakers and his performance drew rave reviews from conservative pundits and establishment republicans increasingly desperate for someone to take on trump the next morning in dallas rubio pushed it even further cloaking his critique of the businessman s record in the humor of a junior high schooler joking that trump may have needed a full length mirror in a debate commercial break to make sure his pants weren t wet the next day standing on the sidelines of a high school football field rubio mocked trump s spray tan before a crowd of 7 000 people before long he was joking about the businessman s small hands suddenly the cable networks that had been obsessively fixated on trump s every move for months were giving the newly pugnacious rubio equal time when he started trading these juvenile insults with trump it hardened people s perceptions that he s not ready or not serious enough and that was it the rubio campaign knew in detail the value of such airtime in mid february optimus partners brian stobie and scott tranter had sought to quantify the value of a 40 minute trump news conference held on february 15 that was carried live in whole or in part by cnn fox news and msnbc optimus estimated it netted trump the equivalent of 2 8 million in free tv coverage without question donald trump s single biggest contributors to his presidential aspirations are fox news cnn and msnbc the report concluded from texas rubio boarded the campaign s private plane and flew east toward sec country where he would offer repeat performances over the weekend thinking he was doing real and lasting damage to trump if he was hurting any campaign it was his own you don t ever want to exacerbate a candidate s weaknesses said one rubio donor who spoke privately rubio is articulate and engaging but he seems young when he started trading these juvenile insults with trump it hardened people s perceptions that he s not ready or not serious enough and that was it rubio watched his electability numbers plummet in exit polls from super tuesday and contests the following saturday in mississippi maine louisiana and kansas suddenly the voters who d felt warmly toward rubio were strongly considering kasich a man the campaign had largely ignored the ohio governor s rivals knew his embrace of obamacare could be enough to do him in but they didn t take his candidacy seriously enough to spend money highlighting it in television ads so when super tuesday rolled around it was kasich who was still alive and able to capitalize on rubio s slip up eating up enough support in several states to keep rubio from meeting the delegate threshold and playing spoiler in virginia where the florida senator might otherwise have notched his first win if you just look at what kasich got you take him out and his race is a whole different place said one rubio senior staffer all of these states are much different we just didn t see kasich coming if the pendulum of american politics typically swings from extremes from the misunderestimated texan george w bush to the cool harvard educated barack obama then perhaps a smooth talking first term senator never had a chance the man many viewed as the republican savior just a few years ago has become the road kill of the activist base that got him elected the grievance fueled tea party movement rubio shrewdly aligned himself with in 2010 is now propelling trump the tea party movement was ideological rubio said aboard his bus it was about the direction of our country it was about policy about liberalism versus conservatism this is all about anger he knows there are people out there who are angry and frustrated because they re hurting and instead of saying i know you re angry here s how we re going to fix it he says i know you re angry let s get even angrier so you ll vote for me and then we ll take it out on whoever you re going to take it out on it s a hijacking of the movement not an evolution of it the tension between rubio and trump was apparent early and often yet it wasn t until the march 3rd gop debate in detroit that rubio tried to offer trump some of his own medicine backing up vulgar jokes he debuted on the trail and trying to dismiss him as a con man getty in a way rubio s daring presidential run was just another establishment candidate s misread of a republican base that in fact wasn t looking for someone to save the party so much as someone who would set the whole thing aflame and an hour before the polls closed in florida on tuesday night rubio s team was finally willing to acknowledge what their candidate hinted at on his bus 2016 wasn t going to be their year they were already looking ahead toward 2020 their optimistic message they said didn t match the angry mood of the gop base this year but rubio s team predicted that when the republican party emerges from the rubble of this election cycle he would be well positioned to unify and lead it we re all looking for that little sliver that could have made the difference i don t think there is one said john rakolta a michigan based rubio bundler and supporter would more organization have made a difference yeah but maybe 3 points not 21 there s a phenomenon going on here that s unbelievable could he have won my answer is he couldn t have the public just wasn t buying what we were selling of course losing campaigns often take solace in believing there was nothing more that could have been done in rubio s case there was marco did well at all the stuff he was supposed to do well at except one debate said a rubio supporter if the principal did at every turn as well as he was supposed to do well he can t do everything california by jeremy b white updated 05 08 20 09 44 pm edt by sam sutton and carly sitrin by bill mahoney and josh gerstein updated 03 29 20 02 48 pm
