advertisement supported by he will use deception to keep his bungled response to covid 19 from ruining his re election chances by charles m blow opinion columnist after donald trump s ridiculous and dangerous suggestion last week that household disinfectants injected into people s bodies might be a treatment for covid 19 republicans intensified their hand wringing over whether his daily briefings were doing more harm to his political fortunes and theirs than good the coronavirus has completely reshaped the coming election the economy is in dire straits trump s polls have taken a dip people are anxious and afraid the outlook isn t good at the moment as the new york times reported last week some in the republican party see similarities to 2006 in 2006 anger at president george w bush and unease with the iraq war propelled democrats to reclaim congress two years later they captured the presidency thanks to the same anti incumbent themes and an unexpected crisis that accelerated their advantage the economic collapse of 2008 the two elections were effectively a single continuous rejection of republican rule as some in the g o p fear 2018 and 2020 could become in a worst case scenario but i would caution all those who take this fear as encouragement that trump is weakened and vulnerable trump is not george w bush this is not the republican party of 2006 this is not a cultural environment in which social media is in its infancy trump as a person and politician is riddled with flaws but he also has an ignominious super power he is completely unencumbered by the truth the need to tell it or accept it he will do and say anything that he believes will help him he has no greater guiding principles he is not bound by ethics or morals his only alliances are to those who would support and further his devotion to self promotion i don t look back to the 2008 campaign for parallels but to the 2016 one when the access hollywood tape on which trump bragged about groping and sexually assaulting women came out republicans were worried they began to openly reject him some called for him to drop out of the race as this newspaper reported at the time but the image of republicans running for the exits a month before a presidential election is as extraordinary as a party s nominee using vulgar violent language that seemed to reduce an entire gender to sexual anatomy and this time no amount of spin seems sufficient to control the damage mr trump has wrought but as we now know that damage was short lived the republican party would rally to trump s side indeed the party would be completely remade by him and become loyal to only him before a debate with hillary clinton and just two days after the release of the tape trump invited a panel of women who had accused bill clinton of sexually inappropriate behavior and one whose rapist was defended by hillary clinton as his guests for the event no one is as shameless a showman as trump he was in survival mode nothing was too far nothing was too crass at that debate trump dismissed his comments as locker room talk and denied that he had ever done the things he himself boasted about doing on the tape as trump said on the debate stage nobody has more respect for women than i do another lie this says nothing of the fact that within hours of the access hollywood tape being made public the first of clinton campaign chairman john podesta s stolen emails began to be released by wikileaks after the tape s release trump saw a dip in some polls but not all his base is religiously loyal a politico morning consult poll at the time showed only a one percentage point drop as morning consult s meghan mccarthy wrote at the time trump s numbers remained stable thanks to the loyalty of the republican base a fact that could give pause to party leaders considering publicly abandoning the nominee to state the obvious trump would go on to win the election i say all this to say don t fall prey to false hope that defeating trump will be easy that his horrifically incompetent response to the coronavirus has doomed him it hasn t trump will fight with everything he has to the bitter end to stay in power he will never admit any fault he will lie and lie and lie and lie some more and the people who support him will stick with him every step of the way joe biden even believes trump will try to alter the election calendar saying mark my words i think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow come up with some rationale why it can t be held i put nothing past trump absolutely nothing and neither should you be prepared for trump to do anything and everything to win re election in november a man who can dismiss a recording of his own voice bragging about assaulting women is
