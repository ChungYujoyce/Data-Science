 first read is a morning briefing from meet the press and the nbc political unit on the day s most important political stories and why they matter hempstead ny well we re finally here hillary clinton and donald trump tonight square off in their first presidential debate at hofstra university making it arguably the most consequential night so far of the 2016 election the stakes are enormous with recent polls showing the national race ranges from a six point lead for clinton in the nbc wsj to a dead even tie in bloomberg s there are five storylines we re watching heading into the debate which donald trump shows up after observing him over the last 15 months including during the gop debate season we re pretty confident who trump is he s aggressive loaded with zingers and oppo hits and shaky on policy but there the possibility that a different trump could show up tonight but if we were in las vegas we d bet heavily on the trump we know showing up just see trump s gennifer flowers tweet from over the weekend which hillary clinton comes to play meanwhile we ve spent the last eight years watching clinton at presidential debates and she s good remember she s a former lawyer clinton was at her absolutely best last october in that first democratic debate where she ran circles around bernie sanders and her other opponents but clinton also has had some uneven performances think of that democratic debate in iowa right after the paris terrorist attacks and there was her game changing rough moment when tim russert asked her about drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants in oct 2008 how does trump fare in his first one on one debate that s right tonight will be the first time that trump has ever debated an opponent one on one indeed he thrived and sometimes simply survived during the gop debate season with as many as eight to 10 other republicans on the stage so even though he was always in the spotlight he only had to speak 12 18 minutes in a two hour debate tonight will be different how does clinton fare in facing off against the ultimate alpha male in his preview of tonight s debate the atlantic s james fallows interviewed the famous anthropologist jane goodall in many ways the performances of donald trump remind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance rituals goodall said in order to impress rivals males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays stamping slapping the ground dragging branches throwing rocks the more vigorous and imaginative the display the faster the individual is likely to rise in the hierarchy and the longer he is likely to maintain that position how clinton responds could be one of the most important parts to tonight s debate this site is protected by recaptchaprivacy policy terms of service what happens in the first 30 40 minutes as politico s shane goldmacher observes history has shown that most memorable moments of a debate typically happen early that s when al gore first sighed mitt romney knocked president obama on his heels and marco rubio earlier this year glitched in repeating the same talking point over and over and over it s when gore tried unsuccessfully to invade george w bush s space richard nixon was first caught wiping away sweat with a handkerchief during the moderators introductions and gerald ford in 1976 made the ill advised declaration that there is no soviet domination of eastern europe do the debates really matter that s the fascinating question our colleague dante chinni asks and his answer not really looking at pre debate nbc news wall street journal presidential polls and the final election results since 1992 there is only one campaign where the debate may have made a serious difference 2000 in every other case the candidate that led going into the debates wound up winning on election day and to be fair about 2000 democrat al gore actually did get more votes than republican george w bush but lost the electoral college so technically where the popular vote is concerned the numbers above show a perfect 6 for 6 the candidate that led in the poll going into the debate period won the election on the other hand 34 of voters in our new nbc wsj poll said that debates will be either extremely important or quite important in deciding their vote also don t be surprised if the third party vote in polls starts to drop after tonight and how that vote gets distributed in the post debate polls will be important to watch playing the expectations game nbc s alex seitz wald and benjy sarlin tee up tonight s debate the good news for trump republicans say is that the expectations for his performance are about at rock bottom while he s been more a more disciplined campaigner in recent weeks he s struggled to stay on message and answer substantive policy questions he also has never faced the bright spotlight of a one on one debate his campaign looking to reinforce his underdog image claims he s eschewing typical debate preparations clinton meanwhile faces sky high expectations she s an experienced debater having participated in nearly 40 debates since her first campaign for senate in new york 16 years ago and has been holding marathon prep sessions at a debate camp set up in a hotel near her chappaqua home the skinny on tonight s debate the debate starts at 9 00 pm et and it lasts 90 minutes divided into six 15 minute
