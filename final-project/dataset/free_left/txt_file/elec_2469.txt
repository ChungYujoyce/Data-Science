granting recognition to same sex couples the congratulations poured in as the two men appeared at a joyous ceremony at windsor guildhall amid a crush of paparazzi donald j trump who had known the couple for years took to his blog to express his excitement i know both of them and they get along wonderfully it s a marriage that s going to work mr trump wrote adding i m very happy for them if two people dig each other they dig each other mr trump is now the leading candidate for president in the republican primary which has traditionally been dominated by hopefuls eager to show how deeply conservative they are on social issues like gay rights and marriage but mr trump is far more accepting of sexual minorities than his party s leaders have been on thursday he startled some republicans by saying on nbc s today show that he opposed a recently passed north carolina law that prohibits people from using public bathrooms that do not correspond to the gender they were born with striking down a charlotte ordinance transgender people should use the bathroom they feel is appropriate mr trump said putting him at odds with a majority of republicans in north carolina an interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 republican nomination process could unfold but it is his views on gay rights and gay people that most distinguish mr trump from previous republican standard bearers he has nurtured long friendships with gay people employed gay workers in prominent positions and moved with ease in industries where gays have long exerted influence like entertainment he will be the most gay friendly republican nominee for president ever said gregory t angelo the president of the log cabin republicans a group that supports gay rights of course mr trump is not as embracing of gay rights as the democratic candidates are he said during this campaign that he believes that marriage is between a man and a woman a position he has held since at least 2000 when he briefly flirted with a bid for the presidency but he does not emphasize marriage as an issue and he makes no mention of it for example on his campaign website which focuses on issues like immigration and trade and mr trump who has inflamed tensions with almost every group from hispanics to women to african americans has avoided attacking or offending gay men and lesbians during the campaign his history with the gay community is a long one he donated to charities focused on the aids crisis in the late 1980s and early 90s in 2000 when he briefly considered running for president he gave an interview to the advocate a gay magazine in which he supported amending the 1964 civil rights act to include a ban of discrimination based on sexual orientation it would be simple it would be straightforward mr trump said in the interview adding it s only fair sixteen years later gay rights advocates are still trying to persuade congress to pass a similar measure but they have struggled to win support especially from republicans the last republican nominee mitt romney opposed similar legislation in 2012 mr trump declined to be interviewed for this article his ease with gay people does not seem to be the result of deep soul searching but rather the product of the manhattan social and political world he has inhabited the past five decades i live in new york i know many many gay people tremendous people mr trump said in an interview in 2011 he has been playful at times such as in 2000 when he and mayor rudolph w giuliani appeared in a skit for a political roast during which mr trump nuzzled and caressed the mayor who was dressed in drag friends say he also views gay rights through the lens of a bottom line minded businessman his key concern is are you capable and able to do the job i hired you for and if you are very little else matters said abe wallach an openly gay executive at the trump organization in the 1990s very little on a social level will make donald excited if it was money or something else he might get excited mr trump was believed to be the first private club owner in palm beach fla to admit an openly gay couple according to laurence leamer the author of madness under the royal palms a book about palm beach society mr trump made his club mar a lago more open partly out of disdain for the restrictions that barred jews and african americans from joining exclusive clubs in palm beach it s one of the best things he s done in my view in his life mr leamer said he really changed the nature of palm beach rand hoch a gay activist who founded the palm beach county human rights council in 1988 recalled bringing dates to mar a lago on two occasions both times he said mr trump who loves to play the role of greeter as guests arrive at his club was pleasant and approached the two for chitchat he treated us no differently than everyone else who was going through that door mr hoch said adding that it was not possible that mr trump was unaware they were gay he s perceptive so i m pretty sure he didn t think we were brothers mr wallach said that he and his husband would fly on mr trump s jet to florida or atlantic city on weekends i found him to be very friendly to my spouse he said he would often ask about my spouse how his dental practice was doing mr trump s foundation has given over the years to groups like the aids service center and the elton john aids foundation some of those donations came more recently in connection with his reality television show the celebrity apprentice whose winners got to select the recipient charities but as early as 1987 mr trump made a 25 000 contribution to the gay men s health crisis from profits generated by his company s operation of the wollman memorial rink in central park and in 1992 the trump taj mahal held an event that raised 60 000 for aids research mr trump s recent alliances with social conservatives such as jerry falwell jr and pat robertson have alarmed people like mr angelo whose group the log cabin republicans is eager to meet with the real estate mogul to discuss his positions in detail and some gay acquaintances of mr trump find it puzzling that he cannot support same sex marriage given his comfort with gay relationships in 2012 mr trump attended the wedding of jordan roth a broadway producer and richie jackson in a ceremony at the al hirschfeld theater months later mr trump went to lunch with the actor george takei who is openly gay and was fired by mr trump from the celebrity apprentice mr takei approached mr trump at a news conference for the show saying he would like to try to change his views on letting gay people marry he said george maybe i could learn something from you mr takei said in a telephone interview this week from his home in california the lunch at trump tower opened with mr trump mentioning the wedding he had attended which mr takei later learned was that of mr roth and mr jackson mr takei walked mr trump through the benefits of supporting same sex marriage particularly for a business owner gay couples would celebrate in his hotels and their guests would dine in his restaurants mr takei said mr trump agreed with that view mr takei said but he would not budge saying he supported traditional marriage i was tempted to say marrying multiple times is not traditional marriage mr takei said of mr trump who has been married three times advertisement
