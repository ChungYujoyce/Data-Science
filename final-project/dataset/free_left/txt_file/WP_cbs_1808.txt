eddie huang is a restaurateur a streetwear designer a tv show host and most famously the author of fresh off the boat his 2013 memoir of growing up the eldest of three sons of chinese immigrants the book spawned a hit abc sitcom in most everything he s done huang said his aim has been to smash the so called model minority myth about asian americans which he describes this way you re obedient you re docile you re the model minority you come here you do your work you re quiet and you go home you don t cause no trouble and that s one of those things that you see in movies all the time is the asian shopkeeper i don t want no trouble i don t want no trouble correspondent mo rocca asked but in confucianism humility and modesty are virtues how much of this is coming from actual cultural traits and how much of this is coming from an imposition by society i really think that it s an imposition huang replied if you look at fifth century greece and you look at socrates and you look at plato they really are proponents of order and balance as well even jesus sermon on the mount like a lot of the things that jesus says a lot of the things that muhammad says turn the other cheek yeah i think that it s in america there is a desire to identify to describe and then categorize people in huang s battle to define himself food was his beachhead when he heard pork buns a savory chinese snack of pork nestled in the bread known as bao being described as new american cuisine he was well steamed this is a dish from the night market in taiwan since the 50s he said it really upset me no one even knows where taiwan is like when i was growing up people thought we were from thailand you know i just wanted to put it out and say hey this is our dish and so he opened baohaus in new york city s east village sampling some of huang s pork buns rocca said oh man oh this tastes like saturday night or early sunday morning baohaus has a vibe that s all huang who said i spent a lotta my time hanging out with other kids at gas stations video stores record shops comic book shops so i wanted to create a restaurant that had that feel of a skate shop or a record shop when he was 31 fresh off the boat was published in it huang described his upbringing first in washington d c then in florida where his father became a successful restaurant owner rocca asked eddie s father louis huang when friends or relatives say to you what does eddie do how do you describe it what do you say of course first i would say well he has a law degree he laughed he was a lawyer in new york yes eddie is also a lawyer but his parents louis and jessica and his brother evan say they re proud of all he s done eddie has lived his dream his goal as an individual that i m so proud of jessica said and he wants to do business and he likes to raise the awareness of a different culture huang also wrote about the alienation he felt of often being the only asian american in his class including a fight he had in the third grade with the only african american kid in his class which was depicted in the sitcom he tells me chinks get to the back and pushes me down on the lunch line but even as a third grader i recognized i was like dude you re just picking on me cause i m the only person below you on the totem pole but the whole time i was not mad at the kid because i knew where it came from that kid edgar was picked on all the time and so was eddie when i grew up i was just told you re short no one s gonna want you you re ugly you re gonna have a mole with a hair growth comin out like that old cantonese guy over there rocca asked you were told that by whom there s so many people the reason i m pausing is cause i m trying to remember the first one but like i can t and then there were the cruel jokes about his manhood warning huang s recounting of this memory may be too candid for some i remember reading this maxim magazine article in i think ninth or tenth grade he said and it showed around the world six inches is the global average and i immediately went to my desk and i remember there was a washington mutual ruler cause i had just opened like a kids bank account right i put it and i was like six inches i m good i m good and from that point on i was just like i m okay i m average like i just wanted to be average i just wanted to be normal but normal doesn t describe his home life huang says his parents were harsh sometimes violent disciplinarians when i got bs i got hit real bad he said front of the hands then back of the hands front of the hands back of the hands rocca asked eddie s parents was it hard for you to read the parts of the book where he described physical punishment at home not at all not at all said louis that s a different culture you know punishment discipline it s very important fundamental for leadership and i want them to be leaders eddie said in his mind he was making us stronger men but we got no room to make mistakes it was any little thing we were gonna get hit and i think that was unfair eddie s brother evan noted my parents my mom especially will still yell at us all the time yes i have to said jessica you re my kid one day you re my kid forever no matter what age and it s not always funny even now right asked rocca no she sends threats all the time like that long on text evan laughed it s very entertaining it s okay we need to communicate jessica said i feel being polite is also a sign of distance you know you just have to do it right hold each other together and support each other at the ripe old age of 37 eddie huang says he s mellowed when he hosted an episode of his viceland cable show from mainland china eating red braised pork a dish that for huang means family became an emotional experience it s really powerful to come home he noted when he made his own version of the dish at a dinner in manhattan it hit the spot with his most important audience it melts in your mouth jessica said his dad louis added it tastes awesome most of people don t understand it but i know where it comes from this is eddie s version it s the one and only eddie huang s red braised pork oh and did we mention in addition to all his other endeavors the one and only eddie huang has also modeled underwear i was like i don t think anyone is ever gonna ask a short fat chinese dude to model their underwear so i was like i gotta do it
