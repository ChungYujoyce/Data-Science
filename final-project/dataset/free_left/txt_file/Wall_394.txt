advertisement supported by the party needs to figure out how to adapt to post coronavirus politics to hold on to the seats that it flipped in 2018 by miriam pawel contributing opinion writer before the pandemic visitors to the ronald reagan library were greeted by a hologram of the 40th president speaking one day from his ranch and the next from the oval office on tuesday the simi valley hilltop overlooking the pacific ocean drew visitors for a different reason curbside voting at a makeshift polling place outside the shuttered museum masked voters cast ballots in a special election to fill a vacancy in california s 25th congressional district you can only imagine the gipper was pleased with the result for the first time in more than two decades republicans in california wrested a seat from democrats mike garcia a political novice running as a supporter of president trump defeated assemblywoman christy smith a centrist democrat by around 10 percentage points the outcome was neither an earth shattering victory that presages a red wave in the bluest state nor an entirely predictable result of low turnout in a special election destined to be reversed when the two candidates face off again in november as always there were circumstances peculiar to the local contest but there are also larger portents about the perils of electoral politics in the post coronavirus world and the democrats challenge in holding on to the seats they flipped in the 2018 midterm election for decades the district that stretches northeast from the reagan library across the high desert suburbs of los angeles county sent republicans to congress representative steve knight was re elected in 2016 even as hillary clinton comfortably carried the district her margin made the 25th district a target for democrats in the 2018 midterm when katie hill unseated mr knight in an expensive high profile campaign ms hill s resignation amid a sex scandal less than a year into her term led to the special election on paper democrats hold a six point registration edge built up over the past four years largely because republican defectors switched to no party preference the numbers mask a still conservative electorate especially among the most reliable voters gov gavin newsom coasted to victory statewide in 2018 over a little known republican but carried the 25th district by only two points mr garcia a former navy pilot and son of a mexican immigrant campaigned on a traditional republican platform against high taxes overregulation and democratic control unlike mr knight who had cast unpopular votes on issues like health care mr garcia had no record to attack he embraced president trump and in a low turnout election conducted almost entirely by mail that helped motivate his base while mr garcia will have the advantage of incumbency in november he will also have a record that may make his ties to president trump more of a liability in a general election that might draw twice as many voters the key question of turnout will depend on whether democrats devise a successful post pandemic strategy to replace the armies of volunteers who went door to door canvassing swing districts in 2018 for the foreseeable future campaign and get out the vote operations accustomed to relying on face to face contact will have to make radical shifts democrats particularly progressive candidates have eked out wins in recent contests by knocking on doors taking voters to the polls for same day registration and collecting mail in ballots up to the last minute all that will change mr garcia s surprisingly wide margin of victory in a race democrats had expected to be close illustrates the challenge every registered voter in the district received a postage paid mail in ballot as will be the case statewide in november voters who returned the simple ballot skewed overwhelmingly old white and republican an analysis by the firm political data inc which tracks ballots returned showed the younger the voter the less likely to vote fewer than 20 percent of 18 to 34 year olds cast ballots twice as many voted who were between 50 and 65 and only among the oldest voters did turnout exceed 50 percent latinos were least likely to vote 21 percent while 40 percent of whites cast ballots to win back the seat in november democrats will need to motivate younger voters and latinos mirroring the challenge nationally for a party with a presidential candidate who has not generated enthusiasm among either constituency yes turn out latinos but you need to persuade us too especially if the g o p candidate is latino antonio de loera brust a californian who worked on the policy staff of the elizabeth warren and juli n castro campaigns tweeted in response to the election result he pointed to one of several recent analyses warning that latinos disproportionately hit by the health and economic consequences of covid 19 might just stay home in november in recent elections last minute votes by mail and in person have skewed heavily for democrats not this time voters who showed up at the handful of outdoor pop up polling places voted for the republican two to one some told reporters they voted in person because they did not trust the postal service republicans have not won a statewide election in california since 2006 democrats hold veto proof majorities in both houses of the state legislature the california of ronald reagan ruled by republican governors for all but 21 years of the past century is gone yet donald trump raised more than 30 million in california outstripping all of his democratic challengers during the height of the primary campaign in 2016 even as he lost the state two to one he won more than four million votes the governor predicts a quarter of all workers in california may soon be unemployed revenues are plummeting at a time of staggering need it is impossible to know whether the impending depression will foster
