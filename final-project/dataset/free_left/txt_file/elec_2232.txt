advertisement supported by op ed contributor by norman eisen and richard w painter as ethics counsel to the current president and his predecessor we scrutinized their tax returns before they were released every year we also worked with our colleagues to review many tax returns of presidential nominees for cabinet and other positions based on the few pages of donald j trump s 1995 tax returns that have become public we have come to the conclusion that no one in his position would have been nominated much less confirmed by the senate during either of the administrations we served the same is true of any modern administration of a president from either party if a presidential candidate cannot meet that standard then we question his qualifications for the highest office in the land in both the bush and obama administrations a bad attitude about paying taxes was a deal killer both of us saw instances of nominations that were doomed by the arguably legal but unsavory use of tax loopholes as well as by the failure to pay social security taxes the taking of excessive deductions for home offices or the sidestepping of sales taxes on out of state purchases explaining to the senate and to the american people how a billionaire could have a 916 million loss carry forward that potentially allowed him to not pay taxes for over a decade perhaps for as long as 18 years would have been far too difficult for the white house when many hard working americans turn a third or more of their earnings over to the government any nominee who had told either of us that he had a fiduciary responsibility as a businessman or to his family to pay as little tax as possible as mr trump put it would have been told to stop wasting the president s time people who believe they have a legal duty to put self interest before the public interest don t belong in public service besides these are personal tax returns we are talking about there is no such thing as a fiduciary duty as a businessman to oneself that as we ve said before is called greed there is also no fiduciary duty to one s family to minimize taxes by taking advantage of loopholes quite to the contrary many of us want to set an example that teaches our children the responsibilities as well as the enormous benefits of being an american even in large public companies the argument that there is a fiduciary duty to shareholders to structure deals to minimize taxes is false the law does not require corporate officers and directors to avoid taxes much less to aggressively take advantage of strategies to eliminate them for years to come some corporate directors and chief executives make this bogus fiduciary duty argument to justify selfish decisions to use loopholes such as the infamous tax inversion tactic of moving a corporate headquarters to ireland or some other tax haven sending revenue and jobs out of the united states we now know that when mr trump complains about such legal but unpatriotic tax avoidance tactics he in effect is complaining about himself the final deal killer here is mr trump s objection to the release of even the limited information that has come out and his refusal to disclose more at the white house we asked nominees for senate confirmed positions to sign a waiver so we could get tax information from the i r s and we also asked nominees to be ready to provide their tax returns to the senate upon request several of the committees most important to national security and the economy such as the armed services committee and the committee on finance routinely insist on receiving tax returns neither of us can recall a single nominee who refused and with good reason if the white house were to so much as delay in disclosing the tax returns of a nominee much less tell the senate that a nominee did not want to disclose them the nomination would be dead on arrival scrutiny of nominees returns is exacting george w bush s first treasury secretary paul o neill made headlines when the senate s review of his returns resulted in his amending them to correct errors for three years and pay a nominal sum in back taxes president obama s current treasury secretary jacob j lew was required to provide a full six years of returns before he was confirmed no presidential nominee with mr trump s tax situation his years of undisclosed tax returns and his attitude toward paying taxes could have been approved by the senate indeed no president would have dared nominate him all of us should weigh that heavily in assessing mr trump s fitness for the oval office advertisement
