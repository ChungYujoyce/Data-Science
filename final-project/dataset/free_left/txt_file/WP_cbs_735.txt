recently in the chinese city of wuhan all but two of the fatalities from the virus have been in mainland china with 99 of cases in china this remains very much an emergency for that country but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world tedros adhanom ghebreyesus director general of the world health organization warned tuesday urging health officials and governments to use the window of opportunity that we have now the who has grown increasingly concerned about the virus being transmitted from people with no recent history of travel to china to others in their home countries tedros said monday that this community spread which has been seen now in the u k and spain at least could be the spark that lights a bigger fire chinese officials reported 94 new deaths and 2 015 new cases of the novel coronavirus on wednesday that brings the global death toll to at least 1 115 and the number of confirmed cases to more than 45 000 an additional 39 people on board the

covid 19 at a press briefing on tuesday the world health organization said it had decided on the name after consulting with the food and agriculture organization and the world organization for animal health we had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location an animal an individual or group of people said who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus the group also wanted a name that was pronounceable and related to the disease he said the new name comes from the type of virus that causes the disease coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause the common cold and some more serious diseases including sars which killed 800 between 2002 and 2003 tedros said having a name for the new disease is important to prevent the use of other names that might be stigmatizing it also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks he said associated press some of the 195 evacuees who completed their 14 day quarantine east of los angeles on tuesday threw their masks in the air like graduation caps before leaving march air reserve base officials gave each a final health screening and deemed them coronavirus free many boarded buses to take them to airports and eventually home about 80 miles south at a military base in san diego the centers for disease control and prevention said an evacuee there is the 13th confirmed case in the u s that person has been isolated and hospitalized the federal health agency said the risk to americans remains low and recent research shows in many cases the virus is on par with the flu or cold in terms of severity the 13 individuals in the united states have not yet had very severe illness the agency s dr anne schuchat told reporters in washington in fact most have had very mild courses danya bacchus cdc principal deputy director dr anne schuchat said the 195 americans quarantined for two weeks at the march air reserve base in california were currently being assessed to make sure they remain symptom free and then we hope that they ll be released to travel on to their homes today all those people were on the first government chartered flight back to the u s from wuhan china none of them have tested positive for the new coronavirus but at least one person who was on a later evacuation flight was confirmed to have the disease in san diego on monday schuchat stressed that of the 13 confirmed cases in the u s 11 had been in china s central hubei province where the outbreak is centered and the other two had very close household contact with someone who had been there we do not have widespread transmission here in the united states she said adding that the 13 u s patients have not yet had very severe illness she said the government was focused on trying to delay the arrival of suspected cases through careful screening at the borders and then meticulous tracing of patients contacts to prevent any spread schuchat said the cdc had at least 200 staff deployed across the country helping with surveillance lab testing supporting quarantine operations for the roughly 800 americans being monitored at five military bases and at 11 airports where flights were arriving with passengers from china the principal deputy director of the centers for disease control and prevention tried to tamp down rumors suggesting the new coronavirus outbreak could be the result of a man made illness being leaked or deliberately spread from a chinese lab a reporter asked dr anne schuchat about the reports during a news conference in washington d c on tuesday based on everything i know the pattern that we re seeing is quite consistent with animal to human acquisition she said backing the widely held belief that the virus jumped from a wild animal into the human population in central china other epidemiologists have said the virus likely made that jump in the context of markets still popular in southern china that put wild animals domestic animals food and humans all in very close proximity in the midst of new infections it is very common for rumors to emerge that can take on a life of their own schuchat said again referencing the suggestions that the new virus could have come from a chinese government lab in hubei province dr anne schuchat principal deputy director of the centers for disease control and prevention said tuesday that the u s government s efforts to prevent an outbreak of the new coronavirus in the country thus far appeared to be working but she warned it was a dynamic situation and u s experts don t have as much information as we would like about the severity of this virus schuchat said officials were learning more and more each day about the new illness which she said was spreading much faster than the sars virus that came from china but still appeared to be far less lethal she urged u s health care institutions to open up your pandemic plans and review them to prepare for any hypothetical outbreak in the u s right now the coronavirus is classed by the world health organization as an epidemic in china if there are significant outbreaks in other countries that classification could change to pandemic the u s situation is very different from what we re seeing in china right now she stressed as fears mounted that the new coronavirus was spreading from person to person in the semi autonomous chinese city of hong kong the u s government gave non emergency staff at america s consulate in the metropolis permission to leave a state department spokesperson said the government had authorized the voluntary departure of non emergency u s government employees and their family members at the u s consulate general in hong kong china it was not an evacuation and the spokesperson said departure is not required the department of state authorized the voluntary departure out of an abundance of caution related to uncertainties associated with the 2019 ncov outbreak and to ensure the safety and security of u s government personnel and family members according to the spokesperson the consulate was to remain open and fully operational earlier tuesday a hong kong apartment building was evacuated after at a cluster of cases of the new virus was confirmed an apparent example of the flu like illness spreading between people who had no direct contact with individuals from central china where the outbreak is focused federal reserve chairman jerome powell said tuesday that the u s economy appeared durable with steady growth and unemployment near a half century low but it faces risks from the deadly virus in china giving the fed s semiannual monetary report to congress powell said tuesday that the fed was content with where interest rates were suggesting that no further rate cuts were being contemplated unless economic conditions were to change significantly powell said the fed was monitoring developments stemming from the coronavirus which he said could lead to disruptions in china that spill over to the rest of the global economy his comments came in prepared testimony to the house financial services committee before he speaks to the committee later tuesday on wednesday powell will testify to the senate

researchers at imperial college london said their goal was to have an effective and safe way of halting the strain s spread by the end of the year at the moment we have just put the vaccine that we ve generated from these bacteria into mice imperial college london researcher paul mckay told afp in an interview on monday coming up with a vaccine is a laborious process that usually involves years of animal testing and clinical trials on humans but imperial college hopes research on the sars coronavirus nearly two decades ago can speed things up we re hoping to be the first to get this particular vaccine into human clinical trials mckay said once the phase one trial is complete which can take a few months to complete it can be immediately started into an efficacy trial in people which will also take a few months to complete so perhaps by the end of this year there will be a viable tested vaccine that would be suitable for use in people cbs afp the world health organization kicked off a
