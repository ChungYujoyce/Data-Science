advertisement supported by by amy chozick with advice from more than 200 policy experts hillary rodham clinton is trying to answer what has emerged as a central question of her early presidential campaign strategy how to address the anger about income inequality without overly vilifying the wealthy mrs clinton has not had to wade into domestic policy since before she became secretary of state in 2009 and she has spent the past few months engaged in policy discussions with economists on the left and closer to the democratic party s center who are grappling with the discontent set off by the gap between rich and poor sorting through the often divergent advice to develop an economic plan could affect the timing and planning of the official announcement of her campaign although people close to mrs clinton say she has not yet settled on a specific platform she is expected to embrace several principles they include standard democratic initiatives like raising the minimum wage investing in infrastructure closing corporate tax loopholes and cutting taxes for the middle class other ideas are newer such as providing incentives to corporations to increase profit sharing with employees and changing labor laws to give workers more collective bargaining power behind many of these proposals is a philosophy endorsed by mrs clinton s closest economic advisers and often referred to as inclusive capitalism that contends that a majority of americans do not want to punish the rich they just want to feel that they too have a chance to succeed it also calls for corporations to put less emphasis on short term profits that increase shareholder value and to invest more in employees the environment and communities whether mrs clinton s approach will be enough to satisfy the unease over growing economic disparity is unclear in a gallup poll conducted last month 67 percent of americans said they were dissatisfied with the way income and wealth are distributed in the united states in the 2008 democratic presidential primary mrs clinton s economic message summed up by a frequent refrain if you work hard you play by the rules you ought to be able to get ahead resonated with white working class voters who overwhelmingly supported her over barack obama but in the years since mrs clinton has come under criticism for delivering speeches to wall street banks at more than 200 000 each roughly four times the median annual household income in the united states and for comments she made about her family s financial situation including a lament about being dead broke after leaving the white house and she must convince a middle class that feels frustrated and left behind that she understands its struggles even as she relies heavily on the financial industry and corporate interests to fund her candidacy nick merrill a spokesman for mrs clinton said she had a record of bringing people together to solve big problems while also putting a real premium on accountability asked whether creating an economic message could affect the timeline for her presidential campaign mr merrill said there s no red x on a calendar somewhere but make no mistake if she runs she will present solutions to our toughest challenges mrs clinton s economic plan would be more populist and reliant on the government than the centrist approach of trade agreements welfare reform and deficit reduction associated with her husband former president bill clinton it s not enough to address upward mobility without addressing inequality said lawrence h summers a treasury secretary in the clinton administration who is among those talking with mrs clinton the challenge though is to address inequality without embracing a politics of envy the debate is extending beyond the democratic party as republicans wade into the issues if americans are working harder than ever earning less than they once did our government and our leaders should step up offer a plan fix what s wrong former gov jeb bush of florida said in a speech in detroit last week as he laid the groundwork for his potential 2016 candidacy mrs clinton was secretary of state when some major economic debates took hold on capitol hill and as a result her economic views are still not broadly known her approach to poverty was forged in the 1970s when she went door to door while working for the children s defense fund leaving her a committed advocate for early childhood education equal pay for women and paid leave but later experiences complicated her worldview many of the advocates who knew mrs clinton as a champion for the poor and working class women felt betrayed in 1996 when as first lady she supported mr clinton s overhaul of the welfare system which gave states more power to remove people from welfare rolls and pledged to cut federal spending on assistance for the poor by nearly 55 billion over six years she was more skeptical about the north american free trade agreement which mr clinton signed into law in 1993 and which has also been accused of hurting american workers after being elected in new york to the united states senate in 2000 mrs clinton had another constituency to represent wall street in 2001 she supported bankruptcy legislation that some democrats most notably elizabeth warren now senator from massachusetts argued hurt working families and single mothers and they accused her of doing the bidding of the financial industry mrs clinton has said she worked to improve the bill as a presidential candidate in 2008 mrs clinton angered some of her wall street donors when she came out early in support of the regulation of derivatives and other complicated financial products and called for eliminating the carried interest loophole that allowed some financiers to avoid paying millions in income taxes she also said that as president she would create a cabinet level position to fight poverty when the housing market collapsed mrs clinton who had returned to the senate full time after mr obama defeated her proposed legislation similar to a new deal era program that would allow the government to help homeowners refinance their mortgages she voted in favor of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 which led to the troubled asset relief program and the multibillion dollar bailout for automakers last month mrs clinton reiterated her support for the 2010 dodd frank financial regulation law attacking financial reform is risky and wrong she wrote on twitter as she dives back into domestic policy mrs clinton faces an economy in which even amid steady job growth weekly earnings for low and middle income workers have remained virtually unchanged for 15 years where has the money gone asked robert b reich a secretary of labor during the clinton administration that is the topic that is embarrassing for people to talk about particularly in washington because even mentioning it creates the potential charge of class warfare mr reich who recently sent mrs clinton a five page memo laying out his ideas said candidates in both parties needed to abandon the politically safe discussion of upward mobility for the poor and middle class that dominated the 1990s and instead take on the stickier issue of income distribution upward mobility equal opportunity those are safe phrases and safe aspirations he said in an interview i don t want to minimize their importance but they obscure the real issue mr reich is one of some 200 economists and academics who have offered mrs clinton ideas and guidance as she settles on an economic doctrine several of mr clinton s former advisers including alan s blinder robert e rubin and mr summers maintain influence but mrs clinton has cast a wide net that also includes joseph e stiglitz a nobel laureate in economics who has written extensively about inequality alan b krueger a professor at princeton and co author of inequality in america and peter r orszag a former director of the office of management and budget under president obama teresa ghilarducci a labor economist who focuses on retirement issues is also playing a prominent role last month in washington a 17 person commission convened by the center for american progress a liberal think tank with close ties to mrs clinton presented a 166 page report on inclusive prosperity which is among the numerous economic blueprints mrs clinton has reviewed for some the solutions proposed by the committee of which mr summers was co chairman did not go far enough dean baker an economist and co director of the center for economic and policy research has pushed the idea of a government fee on the sale or purchase of certain financial assets which he believes could hold wall street accountable while funding social services clinton people didn t want to go near it mr baker said mrs clinton has not commented on the financial transaction tax or on profit sharing she has expressed support for many of the proposals mr obama laid out in his state of the union address last month signaling that they could help shape her agenda in a post on twitter she said the speech had pointed way to an economy that works for all now we need to step up deliver for the middle class mrs clinton frequently talks about the economic success of the clinton administration under which median family income adjusted for inflation increased to 56 080 in 1999 from 48 884 in 1993 compared with a decline to 51 017 in 2012 from 55 987 in 2000 according to census data but she has acknowledged that a globalized economy calls for new ideas and many are urging her to go beyond her comfort zone and address the deeper frustrations of those who have not shared in that economy s benefits long term answers about education and skills that help change mobility don t get at the current frustrations and aggravations said austan d goolsbee an economic adviser to mr obama and a professor at the university of chicago people want to answer the question are we going to be o k mr goolsbee said and then the natural question is whose fault was that and let s go find those people advertisement
