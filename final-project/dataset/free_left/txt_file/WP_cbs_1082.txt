watch cbsn live by jeff berardelli march 18 2020 7 08 am cbs news the novel coronavirus has brought life to a standstill around the world and left millions of people wondering when things will return to some semblance of normal one hope is that the virus could perhaps behave somewhat like the seasonal flu taking a breakduring the warmer summer months lessening the threat and giving society time to mount a systemic response but there are many unanswered questions to find out more about how the change of seasons might affect the spread of the virus cbs news spoke with dr jeffrey shaman an expert on infectious disease transmission and director of the climate and health program at columbia university the following is an abbreviated version of the conversation cbs news is coronavirus less likely to spread at warmer temperatures and will spring or summer slow the spread of the disease dr shaman that is one of the critical questions we would like to answer and i would love to see some virus survival experiments that elucidate and show evidence one way or another there are four endemic coronaviruses a family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses that circulate within humans studies and data i have seen show three or even all four of them circulating seasonally peaking during the wintertime and pretty much disappearing during the summer months and it s an even more marked seasonality than we see for flu which also in temperate regions is like that now there s reasonable evidence with the flu that it s not actually linked to temperature but rather linked to humidity levels and that these viruses thrive in conditions that are very dry which is what we get in the wintertime why that is for flu we don t know and if that is the mechanism that extends to coronavirus we don t know either either way it leads to the enticing possibility that maybe this novel coronavirus will also be affected by ambient conditions which lead to it dissipating during summertime now i have to caution that although seasonal flu peaks during the winter and it peters out in spring when we have a pandemic influenza outbreak such as what happened in 2009 it can penetrate farther into the summer the reason for this is there is heightened susceptibility in the human population that allows for transmission even as humidity conditions rise the pandemic flu doesn t disappear until june and then resurges again in late august and september as humidity starts to drop so if this novel emergent coronavirus were to follow this pattern then it would probably continue circulating until may or june then we d get a break and then we might get a second wave of it in september if it doesn t have this characteristic then none of this will happen also this novel coronavirus appears to be more transmissible than influenza which might preclude any disappearance during summer while there s been some limited study of the survival of this virus both aerosolized in the air or on a surface which has shown the virus remains viable for hours and that airborne transmission is certainly possible its survival has not been tested under diverse climate conditions consequently its sensitivity to temperature and humidity conditions aren t known it would be great to see these experiments repeated under different temperature and humidity conditions cbs news the largest concentration of cases appears to be in the colder mid latitude areas of china and europe and in the united states like seattle and new york city but not as large a number in the south is it possible that the virus is following colder and not warmer climates dr shaman there s something to that that might be intriguing if you look at southeast asia the countries that have cases of covid 19 but have not gone out of control are singapore vietnam thailand and taiwan they have kept the growth of the virus linear korea and china on the other hand are further north and more temperate and have had bigger outbreaks to deal with this could be a manifestation of differing climates but it s pure speculation this may much more reflect that they singapore vietnam thailand taiwan have engaged in much more proactive control of the virus and are successful at it the japanese have also kept the growth of cases linear even though they have had a substantial number of cases they have managed to control it even though they are a temperate colder and less humid country so although there is this tantalizing possibility that the virus spreads less in warmer or more humid climates it could also be linked to a country s response to the outbreak if you look at it right now you are seeing outbreaks in the northern hemisphere countries which is not unexpected you are seeing it in europe and iran which are colder but you are not yet seeing large numbers in australia which is in summer right now and you are not seeing it in the deep tropics where it s warm all year round this suggests that maybe this coronavirus has some temperature or humidity sensitivity that limits its circulation when conditions are warmer or more humid however there may be considerable reporting discrepancies among countries many countries in the deep tropics have less developed medical and public health infrastructure and may be less able to test and report infections in some of these countries many infections may go undocumented cbs news is it possible that people being in more confined spaces and packed closer together in winter is more of a factor in the spread of the virus than the actual effect of climate dr shaman without a doubt you see evidence of this when you put people in isolation or quarantine you can slow the spread of virus because the virus thrives on contact and if people are running into each other because they are on subways buses in stores and banks in the urban environment you have hundreds of contacts per day then the virus will spread faster in the winter people tend to be in closer quarters now in the 2009 flu pandemic the only occasions we documented outbreaks in the summertime were in places where there was close contact such as military ships and dorms so contact is obviously a very important issue but there may be this overlying effect of the environment like the climate of a place that acts as an upper boundary as to how much virus activity there can be cbs news do you know of any ongoing or proposed research on this that would be helpful in determining the impact of climate on the coronavirus dr shaman like i said i d really like to see laboratory experiments on coronavirus survival repeated but this time with different temperature and humidity conditions that would be much more compelling to me than any other studies done so far which try to tease apart various effects from population scale data there are a number of studies posted onmedrxiv related to this which can provide some perspective first published on march 18 2020 7 08 am 2020 cbs
