advertisement supported by op ed contributor by richard l hasen studio city calif has the tide against restrictive voting laws turned in the last few weeks voting rights groups in some instances working with the department of justice have posted a series of victories that seemed unlikely when their cases against these laws were first brought the rights of hundreds of thousands of voters are at stake the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit perhaps the most conservative federal appeals court ruled 9 6 last month that texas strict voter identification law had a racially discriminatory effect on african american and latino voters not only did the fifth circuit send the case back to the trial court to establish a procedure to make it easier for those who lacked one of the narrow forms of identification to be able to vote but also to decide if texas had acted with racially discriminatory intent such a finding could lead the courts to put texas back under direct federal supervision last friday a fourth circuit panel ruled that a north carolina voting law possibly the largest rollback of voting rights since the 1965 voting rights act was enacted with racially discriminatory intent the court threw out not only the state s strict voter id law but also other voting restrictions that could make it especially hard for minorities to vote in the seventh circuit a panel of conservative judges gave a trial court permission to soften wisconsin s strict voter identification law in response the trial court recently issued an order giving people who lacked one of the few ids accepted for voting in wisconsin the chance to vote by filling out an affidavit of identity then last week another federal court threw out more of wisconsin s strict voting laws on monday a federal court told north dakota to soften its id law which adversely affected native americans meanwhile over in the sixth circuit two federal judges have held that ohio s rollbacks of early voting violate the constitution and the voting rights act by making it harder for african americans and others to vote another case on appeal challenges ohio s planned voter purge in michigan a district court judge rejected the state s elimination of straight ticket voting finally in kansas federal and state courts have beaten back numerous attempts by secretary of state kris kobach to make voter registration harder in the name of preventing noncitizen voting a minor problem in kansas to say the least these battles are not over and further appeals could still lead to reversals but there are two reasons to be optimistic that we are nearing the end of an era of increasingly restrictive voting rules imposed just about exclusively by republican legislators and election officials over the objections of democrats and voting rights groups first the changing composition of the supreme court and the lower courts makes sustaining such rules less likely if the conservative supreme court justice antonin scalia were still alive texas would have raced to the supreme court with an emergency petition but there are no longer five justices willing to uphold restrictive voting laws the lower courts are also changing a few years ago if north carolina had appealed the decision to the full fourth circuit the state probably would have won but retirements and new judges have turned the fourth circuit into a much more liberal court second republican legislatures overplayed their hand after the supreme court gave the green light in 2008 to indiana s strict voter identification law in crawford v marion county election board and effectively gutted preclearance in shelby county v holder in 2013 republican legislatures offering ever flimsier justifications made laws even stricter that s why even the conservative fifth circuit thought texas had gone too far it is heartening and astonishing given the court s conservative reputation that a majority of these judges are willing to have the district court take a second look at whether texas engaged in intentional racial discrimination judge richard a posner of the seventh circuit and the retired supreme court justice john paul stevens both of whom voted to uphold indiana s voter identification law in the crawford case have since expressed misgivings about their decisions and now see identification laws as a means of voter suppression but this turning tide could easily turn back a donald trump presidency could lead to the appointment of more justices in the model of justice scalia as mr trump has promised reversing these gains states and localities will continue to look for ever new and creative ways to disenfranchise minorities voting rights groups will have to fight each change individually without the benefits of a preclearance system that the supreme court wrongly eliminated in shelby this drive to limit the franchise and the findings of the fourth circuit in the north carolina case show the fallacy of chief justice john g roberts jr s contention in shelby that intentional racial discrimination in voting is a thing of the past the struggle is not over but this wave of court decisions means that more eligible voters should get a chance to register to vote and cast a ballot in november these votes will help elect a president whose choices for judges and justices will very likely seal the fate of voting rights and much more for a generation advertisement
