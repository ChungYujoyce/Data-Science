coronavirus is another blow to farmers who have already seen their paychecks dwindle because of the trade war with china washington is providing multibillion dollar bailouts for both crises but is the money going to the right people over the coming months the government will disburse a 19 billion bailout package for farmers hurt by the coronavirus pandemic to understand who would benefit from this new bailout we took a close look at another recent bailout for farmers the 28 billion program administered without congressional oversight over the last two years and meant to offset damages from president trump s trade war with china we wanted to know where did the money go as it turns out most of it bypassed the country s traditional small and medium sized farms that were battered by the loss of their export market and which are now being hit with severe losses from the coronavirus pandemic south dakota is soybean corn and wheat country and right now it s reeling bob kuylen if people are are really wanting to jump off a building about what the stock market is doing we ve been doing that for three years now we did everything right we raised great crops but we re still losing our rear ends because uh because of what s happening with with the sanctions and now with the coronavirus it s gonna be another hit without a doubt doug sombke so imagine three years ago you lost 30 of your paycheck and then the next year you lost another 30 i mean that s the pain we re feeling doug sombke and bob kuylen oversee the farmers unions in north and south dakota with more than 50 000 farmers and livestock producers the average farm here is less than 1 500 acres we interviewed them remotely lesley stahl what is happening to your farmers with this virus doug sombke it s just accelerating the problem and we are um not being able to sell because everyone s worried if the plants are gonna stay open lesley stahl and restaurants closing and doug sombke yeah yeah the food is starting to back up uh the freezers are getting full restaurants aren t buying so yeah it s really becoming a huge issue for us with restaurants and schools closed across the country their markets are shrinking it s adding to already rising debt and farm bankruptcies aggravated by the trade war with china they told us the bailout called the market facilitation program that began in 2018 helped them survive the last two years but didn t come close to covering most of their members losses or their own lesley stahl how did the tariffs the sanctions affect you bob kuylen about 70 000 a year i lost in the last couple of years doug sombke on our farm we ve lost in the last uh three years roughly 125 000 to 200 000 a year lesley stahl but what about the bailouts you had two rounds this was supposed to tide you over doug sombke yeah lesley stahl did it doug sombke well it made the banker happy it didn t do anything for me lesley stahl we ve seen reports of suicides going up among farmers bob kuylen oh yeah i know personally families that are suffering through that the the stresses out there now it s just they re out there for four or five generations of their family and they re the ones that lost the farm what do you think that s gonna do to their their mind doug sombke yeah a lot of depression and just this past year in my hometown we ve we ve lost three young men to suicide it s it s just hard lesley because you see these young guys coming up and you know and and you ve coached them in baseball you you you have had hopes that you re glad they stayed in the community and then you end up seeing this happen and none of their fault not any of their fault and it s hard and i worry about my kids my my sons are on the farm and i worry about them all the time after president trump imposed the stringent tariffs in 2018 china struck back hard here in the farm belt imposing its own steep tariffs especially impacting soybeans our largest agricultural export to china and sending commodity prices into a freefall the administration tapped a depression era fund for agriculture and provided 28 billion for farmers almost 3 billion to purchase surpluses for food banks and other nutrition programs and more than 24 billion in direct aid to farmers president trump we will ensure the farmers get the relief they need and very very quickly it s a good time to be a farmer we re going to make sure of that but so far most of the money has gone to the biggest farms one third of it to just 4 of them even farm owners who personally report nearly 1 million in income per year are eligible we spoke to agriculture secretary sonny perdue in march in the early days of the pandemic before social distancing was the norm he defended the trade war bailout and the payments to farmers that were based on the amount of crops produced in 2018 and by planted acreage in 2019 sonny perdue it s not a welfare program it s not a subsidy it s not a price support system it is a market damage system a disruption there lesley stahl these payments are disproportionately going to the big wealthy farms at the expense of the smaller farms where the suffering is sonny perdue the fact is lesley most of our production in america is done by large farmers that s just the way it happens these are these are awards based on the production and but we did try we ve got payment limits that cut people off but the payment limits don t always cut people off the limit or the cap designed specifically for the biggest operators used to be 125 000 per person or legal entity but that was raised last year to 250 000 lesley stahl but why did you double the cap the limit sonny perdue we saw the amount of trade damage that was happening here the need was out there in order to keep these farmers where they could continue not be made whole but to continue to survive to farm again the next year ken cook they made changes for the very largest farmers if you re a small farmer you don t have to worry about the limits you re gonna not come close to hitting them but large farmers they changed it so that a husband could get 250 000 his wife could get 250 000 ken cook is the president of the environmental working group that s been tracking farm subsidies for decades and now the direct payments to farmers under the trump administration s bailout the usda data cook obtained through a search of public records show farms are actually collecting millions of dollars way over the cap they do it by exploiting permissive eligibility rules that the administration adopted from congress farm bills those rules allow big farms to collect maximum payments on behalf of not just the farmer but many others ken cook cousins uncles aunts lesley stahl so let s say i have a cousin who s a farmer and i m a reporter in new york i sit here i don t do any farming but i m a cousin ken cook that s right lesley stahl i can get money ken cook you can get money maybe you have to make a phone call a couple times a year to find out what lesley stahl but i don t have to even go there ken cook no you don t have to live on the farm or visit the farm these payments aren t just going to farmers who are out there climbing up on a tractor every morning these payments are going to people who are living in the middle of new york city because they happen to have an ownership interest in the farm many farms today have investors call them absentee owners who also collect bailout money when we checked we found hundreds of recipients living in big cities including new york city miami san francisco among them a banker an architect a composer a classical musician not south dakota s doug sombke s idea of a farmer doug sombke i mean my sons are the ones out here working they re the ones that should get the money if you ve got dirt under your fingernails you re the ones that should be getting the money nobody else lesley stahl but doesn t the money come to the farm doug sombke no it can go anywhere they can distribute it as the corporation sees fit right ken cook if you re a very large farm operation and you re eligible for these payments the most important tool as a farmer is not what s in your machine shed it s the lawyer you hire to set up a paper farm that s designed to absorb as much federal money as much trump payment as possible lesley stahl and there are lawyers who are documenting these family owners ken cook there are lawyers who specialize in helping big farms maximize their payments from the department of agriculture it s an industry in and of itself and they do very well lawyers like robert serio who for years have been making the most of the loopholes in farm subsidy policy and now the trump administration s bailout lesley stahl do you know the nickname that you have robert serio uh not really lesley stahl it s loophole they call you loophole robert serio somebody else called me the cap doctor lesley stahl oh the cap doctor robert serio the cap doctor serio is based here in clarendon arkansas a tiny town with one sit down restaurant where he knows everybody he has more than 250 clients in 25 states that he says are all actively engaged in farming serio represents the deline farming operations they include three partnerships that usda data show are registered to the same address in missouri which in total collected more than 5 million in the bailout so far way more than the cap robert serio these are not loopholes they are designed regulations all i did was follow a trail that the government laid out for me lesley stahl well no one is saying it s illegal nobody robert serio no lesley stahl if that farm is a partnership how much can they get if there are 20 people in the partnership do they still only get 250 000 robert serio no ma am lesley stahl they get 250 000 times 20 right robert serio if if they earn it if that land that they re farming earns that money lesley stahl let s say it earned the money but there s only one person and he they then get robert serio i would say to that one person he needs to come and see me because he s not running a very economical farming operation lesley stahl so i ve come to you what are you what do you do what do you advise me to do robert serio first thing i would do ask you if you were married and if your answer is yes i would say then you need to form a husband and wife partnership that would be my first advice secondly if you re even bigger than that i might ask you do you have any children who are working on the farm and if that answer is yes then i would tell them how to be able to use that child to enhance that the cash flow for that partnership i m going to form and your farming operation will be have more eligibility and en enhance your cash flow make you more profitable everybody ll benefit from that lesley stahl what s the largest partnership you ever formed robert serio 66 partners lesley stahl 66 robert serio yeah lesley stahl that s a lot remember this is taxpayer money secretary perdue said if farmers are exploiting weak subsidy laws to get money they shouldn t it s congress fault sonny perdue what i m telling you lesley is that we use the same criteria as congress passed in the farm bill to determine who is eligible to receive money and who is not that that s the facts lesley stahl ok sonny perdue we we are administrators of the law passed by congress lesley stahl but let me ask you as the secretary of agriculture if you think that s a good idea to have those allow those partnerships to exist sonny perdue i think again it really is the responsibility to congress to determine this from my perspective as an administrator my job is to follow the law produced by sarah koch associate producer chrissy jones broadcast associates maria
