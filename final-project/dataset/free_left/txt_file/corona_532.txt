commit to substantive improvements within the next 30 days according to a copy of a letter he posted to twitter late monday night mr trump also wrote that the united states would reconsider its membership in the w h o because it was so clearly not serving america s interests it is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world the president wrote in a four page letter outlining his grievances against the organization and its leader dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus mr trump had halted the united states contributions to the w h o last month accusing it of promoting disinformation from china about the outbreak the organization has denied the claims and insisted that it was transparent and open last

happen to be taking it reporter hydroxychloroquine i m taking it hydroxychloroquine reporter when right now yeah a couple of weeks ago i started taking it reporter why sir because i think it s good i

workers take it a lot of doctors take it excuse me lot of doctors take it i take it now i hope to not be able to take it soon because you know i hope they come up with some answer but i think people should be allowed to president trump said on monday that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine an antimalarial drug whose effectiveness against the coronavirus is unproven for about a week and a half as a preventive measure all i can tell you is so far i seem to be ok he said explaining that he takes a daily pill the white house physician said later that mr trump had no symptoms and had regularly tested negative for the virus the food and drug administration issued a safety warning in april about hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine malaria prevention drugs that have been repeatedly promoted by mr trump and widely used to treat virus patients despite the lack of evidence that they work the drugs can cause dangerous abnormalities in heart rhythm in virus patients the f d a warned saying they should be used only in clinical trials or hospitals where patients can be closely monitored for heart problems several doctors said they were alarmed that mr trump was using the bully pulpit of the presidency to tell the public he takes a drug that has not been proven to be effective against the coronavirus but which does have known risks dr steven e nissen the chief academic officer of the miller family heart vascular thoracic institute at the cleveland clinic said he had treated patients who developed a life threatening arrhythmia this disorder can be lethal dr nissen said my concern would be that the public not hear comments about the use of hydroxychloroquine and believe that taking this drug to prevent covid 19 infection is without hazards in fact there are serious hazards dr nissen noted that hydroxychloroquine had stayed on the market because it treated serious conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis other drugs with the same dangerous side effect have been withdrawn because they treated less serious ailments mr trump has in recent weeks stopped talking about the drug that he had been touting as a possible miracle cure but on monday he appeared to relish telling reporters that he was taking it with approval from the white house physician dr sean p conley after numerous discussions he and i had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks dr conley said in a statement on monday night early studies of hydroxychloroquine in the laboratory showed that the drug could block the virus from attacking cells prompted enthusiasm but the studies of the drug in humans have largely proved disappointing and some have pointed to serious side effects in people with heart problems i m not going to get hurt by it said mr trump 73 explaining that he was making the disclosure in order to be transparent with americans it has been around for 40 years for malaria for lupus for other things i take it front line workers take it a lot of doctors take it a detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak with tables of the number

authority meshes president trump s america first economic promises with concerns that coronavirus treatments be manufactured in the united states it may be extended for a total of 812 million over 10 years making it one of the largest awards in the authority s history this is an historic turning point in america s efforts to onshore its pharmaceutical production and supply chains peter navarro mr trump s trade adviser whose white house portfolio includes the global supply chain said in a brief interview on monday evening the project he told sheryl gay stolberg of the new york times will not only help bring our essential medicines home but actually do so in a way that is cost competitive with the sweatshops and pollution havens of the world manufacturers that operate in the united states generally make finished products using raw ingredients imported from elsewhere eric edwards an entrepreneur and physician who founded phlow said the company intended to create a stockpile for pharmaceutical ingredients to be used in the event of drug shortages or an emergency there are not a lot of people wanting to bring back generic medicine manufacturing to the united states that has been lost to india and china over decades he said you need someone like the federal government saying this is too important for us not to focus on the drugmaker moderna said on monday that the first coronavirus vaccine to be tested in people appeared to be safe and able to stimulate an immune response against the virus the findings which helped give wall street its best day in about six weeks are based on results from the first eight people who each received two doses of the experimental vaccine starting in march those people healthy volunteers ages 18 to 55 made antibodies that were then tested in human cells in the lab and were able to stop the virus from replicating the key requirement for an effective vaccine the levels of those so called neutralizing antibodies matched the levels found in patients who had recovered after contracting the virus in the community two more age groups 55 to 70 and 71 and over are now being enrolled to test the vaccine though encouraging the findings do not prove the vaccine works only larger longer studies can determine whether it can prevent people from getting sick moderna s technology involving genetic material from the virus called mrna is relatively new and has yet to produce any approved vaccine moderna s announcement came just a few days after mr trump named leaders for the federal government s effort to speed up development of a vaccine the company has said that it is proceeding on an accelerated timetable if its next trials go well a vaccine could become available for widespread use by the end of this year or early 2021 dr tal zaks moderna s chief medical officer said in an interview the company s announcement rapidly encouraged investors who also welcomed a pledge from the federal reserve chairman that there was really

58 deaths between wednesday and thursday and recorded 1 801 new infections on saturday the highest single day increase the state has seen mayor eric johnson of dallas said he believed that the increase was connected to mr abbott s earlier lifting of constraints telling cnn that he thought it was more than likely connected in some way to the opening of restaurants and movie theaters and retail and our malls up to 25 percent occupancy a couple weeks ago mr abbott attributed the higher number to increased testing in hot spots including in the amarillo area which he said would not reopen as fast as the rest of the state in michigan where thousands of autoworkers began returning to work on monday for the first time in weeks gov gretchen whitmer a democrat announced that retail businesses bars and restaurants with limited seating could reopen with restrictions in the traverse city area and in the upper peninsula two regions hit less hard than other parts of the state keep your wits about you she urged let s not all go rushing out and force a closure eventually what we want to do is keep moving forward the order is especially important for the tourist hub of northwest michigan which has already canceled the popular national cherry festival and traverse city film festival in july we want to be measured about how we invite people back and how we reopen our businesses mayor jim carruthers of traverse city said it s been horrible to see all the shops and restaurants closed in massachusetts another hard hit state gov charlie baker a republican on monday presented a four phased strategy to gingerly resume public life replacing his stay at home advisory with a new one safer at home the four stages which begin on monday and last for three weeks each are known as start cautious vigilant and new normal with each new phase replacing the previous guidelines with slightly looser ones progress from one stage to the next is contingent on a continuing decline in the spread of the virus mr baker said if we don t keep up the fight and don t do the things that we all know we have to do and know we can do we run the risk of creating a second spike in the fall he said across the country governors are weighing the risks of reopening their states with the need to minimize economic harm the pendulum will move further toward the economy this week when several more states including connecticut kentucky and minnesota move to reopen if current trends hold new york city is expected to meet the state s criteria to begin reopening in the first half of june the mayor said more than two thirds of states have relaxed restrictions in some significant way or begun a regional reopening the shift has come as reported cases of the virus have declined nationally in recent

restrictions saying on monday that gov kate brown did not have the authority to keep orders in place for more than 28 days ms brown s office immediately escalated the decision to the oregon supreme court days after the wisconsin supreme court rejected that state s extended stay at home order late monday night the oregon supreme court halted the effect of the ruling by judge matthew shirtcliff of the baker county circuit court until the full court had a chance to settle the matter the case was brought by a group of churches that contended that oregon law prohibited the governor from issuing long term mandates the governor s office has argued that ms brown s orders were issued under a different part of the law with no such limitations oregon has some of the lowest numbers of coronavirus cases per capita in the nation in recent days ms brown allowed most counties to begin the process of reopening but she cautioned on monday that abandoning the state s strategies to combat the virus would leave it at risk of an outbreak reopening the state too quickly and without ongoing physical distancing will jeopardize public health and cost lives she said on the eve of a hearing to assess federal relief measures a group of democrats on the senate banking committee wrote a letter to jerome h powell the chairman of the federal reserve and steven mnuchin the treasury secretary urging them to take greater risks in a lending program meant to keep credit flowing to midsize businesses the so called main street lending program unveiled on march 23 has yet to get up and running when it does it will be backed by 75 billion of the 454 billion that congress gave the treasury department as part of the cares relief law to support the fed s emergency loan efforts senator mark warner of virginia a democrat has expressed concern that the program is taking too long to get started and that its terms are too cautious limiting the chances that it will lose taxpayer money but also potentially curbing its effectiveness the vast majority of these firms are not seeking public assistance due to risky behavior the senators wrote adding that should firms fail to receive affordable financing terms under these facilities many will be left with a choice between declaring bankruptcy posing long term risks to the economy or opening up too quickly they wrote the letter as a new congressional oversight commission raised questions about how the federal reserve and treasury department were administering emergency bailout funds in its inaugural assessment of the 500 billion program the report is the first in what will be a monthly review of how the funds are being used the money which was allocated as part of the 2 trillion cares act is being used to provide grants and loans to airlines and companies that are vital to national security and to backstop lending programs designed by the fed the report said that treasury had yet to disburse the 46 billion in grant and loan money to airlines or businesses critical to national security thus far it has used only 37 5 billion for the fed s secondary market corporate credit facility which purchases outstanding corporate

a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic

trump said on monday that he was open to relaxing the terms of a federal program to help distressed small businesses weather the crisis even as new questions arose about who is able to benefit from the program during a round table at the white house restaurant executives pressed mr trump to extend the forgiveness period for loans under the paycheck protections program from eight weeks to 24 weeks a change the president said should be easy treasury secretary steven mnuchin who oversees the program with the small business administration said he believed there was bipartisan support for such a change for the loans to be forgiven businesses must show they kept their workers on payroll and used three quarters of the money on employment costs monday was the deadline for businesses that got money from the program which was designed to help mom and pop shops struggling during the pandemic to return it under tightened eligibility rules that the administration imposed after several big
