wtf just happened it s been almost three weeks now the news cycle has moved on but i for one have not fully processed the news that donald j trump is going to be president those words still sound like nonsense to me i can t shake the sense of surreality and i know i m not alone before we re entirely swept up in the trump outrage of the day i want to at least pause take stock and attempt to answer a simple question what the fuck just happened to begin i should acknowledge just how wrong i was about this election i never once questioned my confident prediction that donald trump would never become president just because trump makes no sense doesn t mean common sense has become worthless i wrote after trump won some early primaries one black swan does not foretell a flock of black swans yeah about that i was overconfident even more so than most in media us political and media institutions were just as unprepared for this result as uk elites were for the brexit vote but at least uk elites hadn t already witnessed the brexit vote almost no one really thought it could happen here even after we watched it happen there the consequences of that overconfidence are only now coming into view given the evidence thus far trump s administration promises a reactionary lurch in policy accompanied by historic corruption and incompetence that s the median probability with trump at the helm of foreign policy temperamental and easily provoked the only world leader who denies the threat of climate change there are long tail risks almost too terrible to contemplate like many others i didn t take this election as seriously as it warranted until the day it was over i should have done better in that spirit i m going to attempt here to puzzle it all out piece by piece what happened what it meant what there is to learn from it join me if you will on this dystopian voyage of discovery hillary clinton is going to win the popular vote by a sizable margin as of this writing she s at 64 9 million to trump s 62 5 million a 2 4 million vote lead that puts her up by a margin of 1 8 percent update 12 1 16 clinton is now at 65 2 million trump at 62 7 a 1 9 percent margin there are still some outstanding votes to be counted ultimately it looks like she ll net around 65 million votes maybe a little more david wasserman an editor at cook political report maintains an up to date spreadsheet of the popular vote tally if you want to follow along these numbers indicate that the story of the election was not primarily about turnout as many exit poll based hot takes claimed in the days after overall turnout is up 5 percent so far over 2012 but shifts within that turnout were significant my latest chart on popular vote clinton lead 2 2 millionrelative to 2012 gop votes up 1 5mdems down 1 3m3rd party up 5 3m pic twitter com fudxl8xdpt the numbers in that tweet aren t current any more but they re close it seems the dem vote declined slightly a million or less while the growth in turnout benefited republicans and third party candidates in 2012 obama got 65 9 million votes and won the popular vote by a 4 percent margin in 2016 clinton will get about 65 million votes and win the popular vote by a 1 9 percent margin give or take clinton s popular vote margin is smaller than those of recent democrats but it s bigger than those of many past winners bigger than bush s in 2000 carter s in 1976 nixon s in 1968 or kennedy s in 1960 if clinton s 65 million votes had been properly distributed according to the ageless geographical wisdom of america s electoral college she would have won but they were not more on that later clinton lost the electoral college mainly due to whisker thin losses in wisconsin pennsylvania and michigan as john mccormack points out the cumulative difference in those states was 107 330 votes update 12 2 16 the cumulative difference is now just under 80 000 votes just under 80 000 votes less than the capacity of a football stadium in a country where more than 135 million votes were cast roughly 0 06 percent of the national vote let that marinate a while clinton got the second highest number of votes of any presidential candidate in history trump who got 2 5 million fewer votes won the 44th biggest electoral college victory in history out of 54 elections but he s president life is funny lots of people on the left have been gripped by existential angst in the wake of the election convinced that they fundamentally misread their country that they don t know america at all in one sense that s legitimate i didn t think my country would elect a crass xenophobic accused sexual abuser and scam artist for president either in another sense though it s overblown though the transition from obama s america to trump s is vertiginous and understandably baffling to casual much less foreign observers it doesn t reflect some huge sudden shift in the country when a country is divided in half by a deep partisan split elections are bound to be close they can fall one way or the other with very small perturbations as we just saw democrats have more people though they didn t win more votes for house candidates like they did in 2012 they did get more votes for their senate candidates and their presidential candidate republicans have lost the popular vote in six out of the past seven presidential elections but republicans are spread out more evenly over a wider geographical area dominating great swaths of suburban exurban rural america here s a county level voting map with shades of red and blue to show partisan intensity all those puddles of blue are cities the urban archipelago of course acres don t vote people do here s the same map weighted by population turns out those cities have lots of people in them nonetheless due to institutional inertia us politics still gives geographical spread enormous weight so despite getting fewer votes republicans now control every branch of government trump will almost certainly attempt to govern as though he has a mandate one of the more meaningless notions in politics governing institutions and policy are sure to make a sharp turn to the right but america today is still the america we all knew on november 7 a nation almost evenly divided with a slight popular vote lean toward democrats and a somewhat heavier geographic lean toward republicans for years the left has been foretelling a coming triumph based on ideas best laid out in the emerging democratic majority by john judis and ruy teixeira the story is familiar by now older white men are dying off the country is rapidly becoming more urban and diverse dems have captured the hearts of minorities single women and other growing demographics sooner or later demographics will carry democrats to victory in broad strokes over some time horizon this story is probably true but the road to that victory is a lot longer and rougher than the left has been telling itself and the vaunted blue wall is a fairy tale in the short term demographic shifts are actually screwing the dems at the presidential level as liam donovan explains according to exit polls trump only got 1 percent more of the white vote than romney got but there was a big shift in which whites he got relative to romney trump was down 10 points among whites with college degrees but up 14 points among non college whites the stand in for the myth encrusted white working class or wwc as it happens those new non college white votes some combination of first time voters and voters switching from obama to trump though we don t yet know how many of each are clustered right up there in the upper midwest where republicans need them meanwhile as my colleague matt yglesias explained clinton largely made up in new asian and latino voters what she lost in wwc and black voters who perhaps predictably did not match their obama numbers but the distribution is all wrong a little tour of recent electoral history in maps 1 x first the shift from 2012 2016 blue dem improvement red gop pic twitter com fwokmrlbgv latino voters are clustered in texas and california there aren t enough to put texas in play yet though clinton beat obama s 2012 performance by 6 7 percent there and california is already in the bag so more votes there clinton beat obama by 6 percent are useless for democrats same with new mexico already blue and arizona not close to blue though getting closer asians are clustered in california washington and other already won states clinton s coalition seems likely to triumph in the long term teixeira has claimed that because of demographic changes alone if democrats in 2020 garner the exact same share of every racial group that they got in 2016 they will win michigan wisconsin pennsylvania and florida and come close in arizona but as fivethirtyeight s harry enten argues if republicans can keep increasing their vote share among whites get 90 percent of white voters in the upper midwest like they do in the south say they can hang on to their geographical advantage for a long ass time it s a delicate dance as two demographic ships pass in the night republicans will eventually need more minorities to win but dems needed a few more whites to win this november one thing is clear america s archaic unjust racist electoral college belongs on the ash heap of history because it turned on such subtle demographic shifts and small absolute numbers it is possible to find evidence for almost any story about clinton s loss combined with the pathos surrounding the election this creates an ideal habitat for confirmation bias and sure enough post election analysis is filled with people confident that this outcome which neither they nor anyone else predicted proves they were right all along here are just a few of the stories one might tell like everyone i buy some of these more than others but there are bits and pieces of evidence for all of them some of them don t hold up on their own voter suppression probably didn t swing the election nor did third party candidates but all of them plausibly played a role or have some grain of truth given the difficulty of picking apart causal threads around complex sociopolitical events our inability to run counterfactuals imperfect hindsight and the strong temptation to motivated reasoning on all sides the truth is that we ll never know exactly which factors made the difference or which narrative is correct the best we can probably do is echo alex pareene fuck everything and blame everyone the most agonizing implication of the narrow loss is that everything mattered every decision to hype clinton s emails comey s extraordinary violation of precedent wikileaks clinton s goldman sachs speeches her refusal to dissociate from the clinton foundation her poor retail politics trump not releasing his tax returns mitch mcconnell and paul ryan hiding out sanders tarnishing clinton s image among young people institutions standing by and doing nothing as trump shredded democratic norms the gamble that trump s misogyny and racism would render him unacceptable fake news on facebook epistemological bubbles elite self absorption hot take after hot take delivered to the choir americans making the contest into a crass reality tv show fueled by facebook memes the press refusing to cover policy and whatever else you can name the electoral college turned on an 80 000 vote margin all of it mattered if you re prone to haunting crippling regret luckily i don t know anyone like that that s where you should focus your energy as political scientist john sides notes the outcome of the election was after all the sturm und drang roughly what the pre election models predicted those models are based on the much bruited fundamentals things like the rate of economic growth the president s approval rating and the generally grim prospects of a party that s been in office for two terms desire for change it was based on models like these that vox built its trump tax calculator which purported to show how far trump was trailing what would be expected of a generic republican in the end though there was virtually no vote splitting about 90 percent of self identified republicans voted for trump 89 percent of dems voted for clinton he did roughly as well as a generic republican the gop came home what should we make of this trump is obviously not a generic anything he said or did things almost every day on the campaign trail that would have disqualified any previous presidential candidate see james fallows s invaluable trump time capsule series he had no real campaign beyond rallies bought very few ads did no fancy polling or data analysis had no ground game to speak of and ran a campaign staff of feuding amateurs by all rights he shouldn t have been a generic republican candidate he should have been a very bad one and lots of people still believe he was they think other democrats could have won the race that s one way of looking at it another is that the american chattering classes have once again underestimated the sheer tidal force of polarization or more accurately negative partisanship a loathing of the other side in american life many people assumed that certain norms and standards still transcend the partisan divide surely being accused of and admitting on tape to serial sexual assault surely swindling poor people with a fake university surely crude racial stereotypes surely running a charitable foundation as a slush fund surely encouraging violence at rallies or threatening to reject unwelcome election results surely celebrating torture or vowing war crimes clinton bet most of her chips on there being some floor some violation of norms too low even for today s radicalized republican party she thought responsible republican officeholders would rally she thought at least well off well educated republican women would recoil in horror she was wrong there is no floor partisanship has been revealed as the strongest force in us public life stronger than any norms independent of any facts ezra klein sums it up political scientist julia azari has written the single most important sentence for understanding both trump s rise and this dangerous era in american politics the defining characteristic of our moment is that parties are weak while partisanship is strong here is the problem in short parties and particularly the republican party can no longer control whom they nominate but once they nominate someone once they nominate anyone that person is guaranteed the support of both the party s elites and its voters lots of people particularly white male pundits have reacted to this unprecedented and bizarre election by reaching for familiar story lines one of the most popular and most familiar is the heartland versus elite narrative you ve heard it before the democratic party has been captured by decadent coastal elites and wall street muting its economic populism instead it spends its time appealing to urban special interest groups with identity politics such politically correct fripperies as multigender bathrooms and microaggressions meanwhile it has lost touch with salt of the earth real americans in the working class the ones that make our eyes mist up when we watch those chevy commercials because democrats are offering those left behind working class folk nothing they are turning to republicans who are at least acknowledging their problems and offering them easy scapegoats this narrative has been common on the right and among centrist pundits for ages it dominated the 90s and persisted well into the 2000s it was the main argument democrats had after john kerry lost in 2004 oddly this cycle it has gripped the left as well i come from the white working class and i am deeply humiliated that the democratic party cannot talk to the people where i came from sanders like many of the people rehashing this narrative means well they want dems to offer the wwc better economic policies they believe that doing so will bring at least some of the wwc back into the fold and they may be right but we ve seen this dynamic play out before remember when howard dean said i still want to be the candidate for guys with confederate flags in their pickup trucks whenever washington pundits and politicians start talking about dems appealing to the wwc the result is demonizing minorities see sister souljah passing punitive law and order policies see 1994 crime bill supporting fossil fuels see joe manchin literally shooting cap and trade and making a big show of say hunting see john kerry 2004 it has never in my memory led to more social democratic welfare policies 1 ppl worry the concern with working class whites will lead to poc being marginalized for good reason it s happened so many times before https t co owpcgbxagd there isn t a ton of evidence that an economically populist message divorced of appeals to xenophobia or white resentment moves the wwc in fact as andrew prokop notes in two of those crucial midwestern states that flipped to trump democratic senate candidates russ feingold and ted strickland campaigned on economically populist platforms but they did notably worse than hillary clinton why is that perhaps because politicians know though won t say that appeals to xenophobia and white resentment work if i may coin a phrase it s the white resentment stupid on that subject i recommend this piece from zack beauchamp and this tweetstorm from t r ramachandran 1 these sanders tweets on wwc are what happens when good intentions meet high school term papers that get a d let me tweetsplain why pic twitter com 4ldkf1pqq0 many narratives about the working class that still dominate american life are premised on the unspoken presumption that the working class is white specifically a manly white man working in manufacturing or manual labor living in a small town and driving a pickup truck this cultural paradigm is what fuels the notion that dems are distracted by identity politics which is what white male pundits call the particular interests of groups that aren t the wwc from the left see mark lilla from the right see marc thiessen and ed rogers from mansplainia see bill maher but it writes huge swaths of the working class out of the picture members of today s working class are just as likely to be urban minorities in service jobs who vote democrat despite being by most objective measures worse off than the wwc so trump did not appeal to the working class even among the white working class he only really dominated in the south his appeal was to low education whites not to any particular economic class if you acknowledge urban minorities as part of the working class you have to acknowledge that they face unique barriers to prosperity being harassed and shot by police is not some boutique issue it s a huge drag on workforce participation among minorities for a transgender employee being able to use the restroom in peace is very much an economic issue for a latino immigrant the threat of deportation is an economic issue for gay and lesbian voters the ability to marry and have children is an economic issue these are economic issues facing the working class they are about giving every american full and equal participation in american cultural and economic life read jamelle bouie on this calls for the democrats to turn away from identity politics amount to demands that the interests of rural white voters be recentered and that the interests and votes of other demographics be viewed as vaguely suspect as matt yglesias keeps writing all politics is identity politics as other groups have risen in visibility and influence in america non urban white men have become more aware of themselves as a tribe fun fact white people in the us used to identify as poles germans russians etc not white people they ve begun to feel group threat the more the country urbanizes and the white share of the vote shrinks the more non urban white becomes a distinct identity and all evidence points to the fact that voters do not make decisions based on issues or ideology but on identity we are tribal creatures trump s campaign was pure identity politics white non urban male identity politics as michelle goldberg wrote in a righteous piece on this subject we should pay trump voters the courtesy of assuming that at least some of them knew what they were doing when they opted for the politics of cultural revenge delivered by a billionaire in a gold plated airplane of course clinton spoke to the economic insecurities of working class whites she ran on the most progressive economic platform in a half century she wanted to raise the minimum wage offer paid family and medical leave create universal pre k and subsidized day care expand social security accelerate state medicaid expansion offer tuition free college and create an infrastructure bank all paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy all those things would help working class americans including the white ones she even had a 30 billion plan specifically targeted at hard hit appalachian communities voters never heard about it here according to gallup is what voters heard about the candidates almost all the information that reached voters about clinton was about scandal emails the foundation pneumonia etc the three big nightly network newscasts spent three times as many minutes on clinton s emails as they did on all policy issues combined it s pretty silly to say that the wwc chose trump over clinton on policy grounds when they never heard a thing about her policies and very little about his the source of his appeal lay elsewhere hmm why be coy or euphemistic about this study after study after study came to the same conclusion what most distinguished trump voters was not their economic status but their attitudes on race gender and immigration trump ran on white male resentment and won because white male resentment appeals to a lot of white people including a lot of white women some have asked how racial resentment could be to blame when many trump voters are former obama voters but that mistakes how race works precisely because he was black obama could run a mostly nonracial campaign when he did remind voters he was black as in the trayvon martin eulogy he came in for relentless criticism on the right it s called priming when you remind white people that they are white people by drawing attention to other groups their racial consciousness rises they become more sensitive to in group out group dynamics clinton s problem is that she couldn t rely on her identity to tell the story of intersectionality so she had to tell it out loud paying rhetorical fealty to all the subaltern groups the democratic party represents and trump reminded his non urban white voters again and again that he was with them against all the threats indifferent elites murderous illegal immigrants pollution regulations violent urban gangs terrorists they faced from outside the trump clinton race was an extended exercise in priming predictably after the nation s white people elected a man who campaigned on race based appeals and promised race based policies the top priority of many white pundits was to defend their honor there is nothing more maddening and counterproductive to me than saying that trump s 59 million votes were all racist ridiculous not the election of a xenophobic klepto fascist not the surge of race based hate crimes after the election not the appointment of steve bannon who has spent years mainstreaming white nationalism to a key position in the next administration nothing is more maddening than having the innocence of white americans besmirched there have been dozens of notalltrumpsupporters tweets and posts and videos flying around since the election urging us not to make the terrible mistake of holding trump voters responsible for damage he will do to vulnerable lives he might be a racist they say but his voters aren t this is how discussions of racism in america get derailed you start by conceiving of racist as a binary category something one is or isn t then you define racism as explicit belief that one race is superior to another only a small fringe has those self identified racist beliefs so voila there are hardly any racists you can play the same game with sexist meanwhile studies show that implicit bias subconscious negative stereotypes about particular races and genders is ubiquitous even among people who would never consciously espouse discrimination and statistics show that outcomes are systematically biased against women and minorities whether it s housing income or the criminal justice system so racist and sexist biases are rampant in america racist and sexist outcomes are rampant in america but apparently there are very few racists or sexists in america we just perpetuate systemic racism and sexism by accident oops women and minorities in america will find this a familiar story somehow vouchsafing the innocence of white people takes precedence over holding them responsible or protecting those who will suffer as a result of their choices systemic discrimination becomes a crime with no criminals tressie mcmillan cottom has a good piece on this put it this way if you can elect an authoritarian who ran on racial resentment and have the nation s elites respond with gushing displays of empathy you may be white much was made in this election and is still being made about how out of touch media and political elites are with the kind of people who voted for trump elites cluster in cities tapping on their laptops and sipping their lattes while out in the hinterlands people are suffering there is truth to this the two biggest dividing lines between clinton and trump voters were urban versus rural and college educated versus not virtually everyone in political media or national politics is on the former side of both those divides however many people in still overwhelmingly white political and media circles come from trump country they have family and friends there people who watch fox news and voted for trump those connections are a source of both anguish and fascination how can people they know to be good believe such terrible things yes this familiarity can often breed disdain and unproductive facebook battles city folks have been looking down on the country folks they left behind or at least have been suspected of doing so for as long as there have been cities but it also generates empathy which has resulted in some truly spectacular journalism on rural and small town whites there s arlie russell hochschild s book of course and j d vance s i love reading chris arnade see here and here and david wong here and here i even took a turn myself at this point the genre of talking to trump voters to find out why they re so angry has become so common the awl spoofed it what i haven t seen are nearly as many tender profiles of working class black families in cities i didn t read as much about second generation latinos struggling to pay for college there weren t a ton of thumbsuckers on single mothers in the atlanta suburbs muslim families in dearborn michigan or seasonal farm workers in california this stellar new york times piece on latina hotel workers was a welcome exception america is full of different kinds of people many of whom are suffering all of whom face difficult challenges they all deserve empathy they all deserve a living wage and decent public services and fair treatment under the law they all deserve every consideration as real americans the problem is that us politics and media tend to draw from a very narrow strip of that american tapestry still disproportionately white male educated at ivy league schools cosmopolitan in outlook and if it s not redundant to add privileged as shit the media political bubble is real this leads to a lack of empathy in all directions but the direction that should alarm us most is downward the lack of empathy for many of the lowest and most vulnerable what american mainstream pundits often cannot see is that the latitude they extend white voters they know not what they do they re good people at heart they re just hurting is the essence of white privilege such latitude is not offered to other groups black people protesting police violence are offered no forgiveness from pundits because they re just hurting the occasional violence or extremism at those protests is never waved away as an accidental byproduct of good intentions the us media did not parse the words of black lives matter seeking the most charitable interpretation but they ll do a fawning profile of angry white racists if they so much as put on a suit yes america s elites especially in journalism could badly use more empathy that doesn t mean hiring a token conservative columnist it doesn t mean more profiles of the folks back home it means more diversity across the board education class race religion gender and sexuality the most terrifyingly prescient piece i read this year was amanda taub on the rise of american authoritarianism whatever the disputes among factions on the left whatever the intentions of trump voters the fact is that an unprepared wildly corrupt authoritarian is headed for the white house drawing his support from authoritarian leaning voters along the way trump has managed to revive or energize almost every sour has been and soon to be has been in american life newt gingrich rudy giuliani chris christie ted nugent michael flynn sarah palin myron f ing ebell he s empowered the worst sort of racists and loons like steve bannon and alex jones he s gathered up the worst of the media hannity and limbaugh and the breitbart crew now he s sifting through the republican party establishment roster looking for diamonds in the rough like jeff sessions in retrospect the 2016 election has rendered every venal norm breaking move by republicans under obama from obstructionism during the economic recovery to government shutdowns to refusing to confirm merrick garland politically astute it turns out mitch mcconnell and paul ryan played it exactly right by hiding in a bunker while trump insulted gold star families trump s bullying misogyny his mendacity his contempt for the free press his disregard for policy or preparation all of it we are now forced to admit was brilliant he won on it when everyone said he couldn t and so every ugly impulse every broken norm every fetid alliance has now been ratified affirmed as good politics other politicians will learn these lessons the press will set about normalizing them the damage trump has already done to the american democratic process is not inconsiderable but it is only the beginning every unpleasant american political memory is about to return to haunt us unleashed under an unstable man child president and a congress controlled by republicans who make george w bush s gop look like obama democrats at long last let s return to the original question what did i learn from being so damn wrong my basic political weltanschauung has not changed i still think the american ideal of multiethnic social democracy is worth pursuing and worth defending from illiberalism in all its guises i still think the primary problem in american politics today is the intersection of three trends 1 rural and suburban white men resent recent economic and demographic changes 2 their rebellion against those changes combined with political institutions distorted to favor rural and suburban voters has created a dangerously radical major party mixing xenophobic authoritarianism and libertarianism and 3 trust in american institutions from media to political parties to academia has declined for decades and is now in the dirt there are no longer mediating institutions capable of slowing our headlong descent into epistemological relativism and partisan nihilism or so it seems i d say the election has changed three things for me though i m still processing it like everyone else and its meaning will only become clear with some distance first it seems i ll need to develop a much deeper appreciation of historical contingency the vulnerability of institutions and for lack of a better word tragedy shit as they say happens the arc of the moral universe is long indeed it bends toward justice then it bends back this feels like a black swan event to me an unlikely concatenation of circumstances that offers a last gasp to forces in american life that are inexorably fading but that feeling that gut sense that it s going to be okay i no longer trust that feeling at all it s possible that white nationalism is an ineradicable element of american life it s possible american institutions have failed so thoroughly that some sort of illiberal strongman is inevitable it s possible that further republican gains could give them control of enough states to start passing constitutional amendments returning the us to the 19th century it s possible that a terrorist attack under the coming administration could cause panic and backlash that leads to a police state it s possible something as bad as or worse than internment camps will come along or widespread racial violence i don t expect that stuff to happen and i m certainly not predicting it but you can damn well believe i will never again take those possibilities lightly there are no guarantees america will be okay second it s clear democrats need to focus on doing identity politics right rather than waiting for demographics to do the work for them that means developing identities that cut across demographic barriers sensitive to difference but rooted in inclusive values and broad based economic prosperity again read bouie the way to do that is not primarily with messaging but with institution building from the ground up democrats have to get into communities across the country in every state and organize people around a common vision not just once every four years but continually the kind of work unions and churches used to do and still do though not in the places or at the scale necessary third when it comes to writing about politics i m going to make an effort to do less prognosticating and more first order analysis what matters is what politicians do and how it affects people covering politics like a theater critic speculating whether this or that move will play well with this or that group has never seemed more inadequate core american democratic values are being called into question the political press is better off elucidating and defending those values than speculating about whether trashing them yields a bump in the polls what the fuck just happened things got very very real it s time for everyone to do better
