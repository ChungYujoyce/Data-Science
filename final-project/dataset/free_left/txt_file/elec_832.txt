schreckinger 10 24 2016 04 59 am edt with two weeks to go donald trump s path to an election night win is almost entirely closed hillary clinton enters the final 15 days of the race safely ahead in states worth more than 270 electoral votes indeed the suspense of this final stretch is less about whether trump can turn it around than how many down ballot republicans he will drag down with him advertisement trump is done said republican operative jim dornan who advised the new york businessman in the preparatory stages of his campaign last year barring something completely out of the blue like hillary being involved in a murder i don t see how he wins short of that or some sort of putin ex machina there is little trump can do to put himself back into contention after 5 months of missteps and missed opportunities the race is over said conservative iowa radio host steve deace who backed ted cruz in the primary there is nothing trump can do he helped the democrats convince people he s crazy and they ll always choose corrupt over crazy trump cucked himself deace added throwing an alt right term of derision for soft conservatives back onto the republican who has so enthused that white nationalist crowd by elena schneider no presidential candidate since the advent of modern polling has overcome the sort of deficits trump faces nationally where he trails clinton by an average of 5 9 points and in swing states with two weeks to go in an election in utah among the most reliably republican states in any other cycle trump is locked in a tight race with independent evan mcmullin a conservative mormon with debate season over and the clock running out for significant swings in public opinion to materialize the baton now goes to the get out the vote operations where clinton enjoys an overwhelming advantage on sunday with early voting numbers in arizona showing encouraging signs for clinton the associated press moved the state which has voted for a democrat only once since 1948 into its toss up column the ap currently counts 272 electoral votes enough to win the presidency as solidly in clinton s column or leaning that way in florida republicans narrow advantage in mail in early voting has shrunk slightly from 2012 and in north carolina that advantage has shrunk dramatically from 2012 according to the latest analysis from nbc news in ohio trump has been unable to win the support of popular republican gov john kasich and his campaign has feuded with state party chairman matt borges portending a weak mobilization effort in general trump has failed to invest seriously in a competitive ground game and instead relied on the republican national committee by shane goldmacher the biggest risk the clinton campaign now faces is prematurely resting on its laurels but south carolina democratic party chairman jaime harrison said his conversations with party leaders across the country have assured him that they are not taking the outcome for granted everybody s busting their butts right now said harrison a leading contender to succeed donna brazile at the helm of the democratic national committee nobody s thinking oh we ve got this in the bag in this regard trump has proven to be the gift that keeps on giving to democrats the new york businessman s base has led the field in enthusiasm since he entered the race in the summer of 2015 but his refusal to pledge to accept the voting results and his remark at wednesday night s debate that clinton is a nasty woman have delivered clinton s supporters a burst of enthusiasm as they enter the home stretch i see a lot more people saying i was going to vote for hillary but now i m upset and now i m going to go knock doors so i think it s really served to galvanize the get out the vote operation for the last few weeks said tyler olson former chairman of the democratic party of iowa the swing state trump is most likely to win on the trail trump appears to have largely given up on persuading voters in favor of settling scores on friday in north carolina he swiped at first lady michelle obama who has criticized him in harsh terms and is roughly twice as popular as he is he has also begun blaming the failures of his campaign on a globalist conspiracy of bankers and journalists in cahoots with the clintons claiming that the presidential election is rigged against him asked by moderator chris wallace at wednesday s debate whether he would accept the results trump said he would keep the country in suspense such talk has leaders of both parties worried about the long term damage he could to the public s faith in the integrity of the election system if he fails to graciously accept the outcome congress by burgess everett harrison said trump was playing a very dangerous game and pointed to the statements of republican leaders like his south carolina counterpart matt moore the vast majority of battleground states have republicans overseeing their election systems moore told politico last week it s safe to assume they re not rigging the process either against donald trump or for anyone else meanwhile trump s downward spiral has forced house republicans to scramble to secure their once safe majority and the difficult balancing act between trump s die hard supporters and moderate independents has begun to take its toll on vulnerable senate candidates like new hampshire s kelly ayotte she trailed by 8 points in a poll released on thursday after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat for the party that put trump forward the race has become less of a suspenseful thriller and more to use a favorite trump term of a horror show republicans said harrison are really scared missing out on the latest scoops sign up for politico playbook and get the
