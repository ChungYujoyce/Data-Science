filed under there s no way around it this administration s lack of preparedness and in some cases willful denial of facts has cost american lives in the movies this all goes very differently in hollywood s version of events the federal government had been building a secret bunker in the limestone cliffs of missouri to house a million people in the expectation of an extinction level event or the entire executive and legislative branches were relocated to an underground facility in virginia where continuity of government could be preserved and i suppose lawmakers weren t still using the public gym during a pandemic even in the all too real scripted version of coronavirus the movie contagion the cdc has identified a stadium that can be turned into a triage facility on day 12 of the outbreak if only this were one of those movies in depth political coverage sports analysis entertainment reviews and cultural commentary as we try to adjust to a total stoppage of life as we know it due to the spread of covid 19 the lack of preparedness by the federal government is utterly and indefensibly unfathomable we ve watched the president of the united states first dismissing the severity of the crisis his own experts contradicting him publicly confusion over the responsibilities of the federal government versus individual states governors fighting with the white house for supplies a shortage of personal protective equipment for our doctors on the front lines hospitals overwhelmed with patients congress playing politics with relief funding how could one of the wealthiest and most powerful countries on the planet be this behind the curve from the simplest of tools like a disaster supply chain org chart to the most complex and sophisticated pandemic readiness plans it seems as though the united states had next to nothing in place and even more galling there were too many warnings to count starting way back in 2005 the george w bush administration published a pandemic plan which said that medical supplies should be distributed from the strategic national stockpile in the event of an outbreak in 2009 a federal task force recommended that the obama administration replenish that stockpile of n95 protective face masks which had been depleted during that year s swine flu outbreak it did not flash forward to 2017 seven days before donald trump took office obama administration officials simulated an influenza pandemic with the incoming trump administration in may the following year trump s biodefense preparedness adviser luciana borio warned that a flu pandemic was the country s top health security threat we know that it cannot be stopped at the border she said that same month the top official responsible for leading the u s response to a pandemic like covid 19 left the administration and the health security team he ran was disbanded by national security adviser john bolton at the time a former obama administration official warned the move seems to actively unlearn the lessons we learned through very hard experience over the last 15 years these moves make us materially less safe it s inexplicable and just last year from january to august the department of health and human services simulated a pandemic scenario code named crimson contagion which revealed how incredibly underfunded and underprepared the federal government was for a viral outbreak like this very one what good are all these simulations if they do not spur the government into action with all of these failings coming to light and surely there are more to come trump has tried to dodge accountability at every turn first he said i don t take responsibility at all for testing lags he s blamed obama democrats even journalists for his administration s failures at one time saying the only thing we weren t prepared for was the media he s said he didn t know anything about dismantling the pandemic response team despite a video of him explaining that decision shows that to be a lie i m a businessperson he said during a press briefing in february i don t like having thousands of people around when you don t need them he s alternately dismissed the pandemic as nothing more than the flu and now he is saying coronavirus is far worse than the flu there s simply no way around it this administration s lack of preparedness and in some cases willful denial of facts has cost american lives and while we re still coping with the current pandemic it s not too early to think about the next one and ask ourselves is this president capable of learning from mistakes when he refuses to admit he s made any the answer is both obvious and terrifying s e cupp is the host of s e cupp unfiltered on cnn send letters to letters suntimes com know about breaking
