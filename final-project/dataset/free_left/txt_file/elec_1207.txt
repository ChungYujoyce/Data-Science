with breanne deppisch and joanie greve the big idea with all the ballots counted republican karen handel won the most expensive house race in u s history by 3 8 percentage points that s a larger margin of victory than the 1 5 points that donald trump carried georgia s 6th congressional district by last november handel even wound up winning by a greater margin than the gop candidate in an unexpectedly close special election to replace omb director mick mulvaney in south carolina that had not been on the national radar the suburban district north of atlanta is ruby red and has been in gop hands since newt gingrich won it in 1979 but that does not make jon ossoff s defeat any less devastating for democrats struggling to find their way in the trump era dem member of congress eyeing results texts to ask q on many dem minds lots of moral victories but when do we get actual victories last night was a wake up call for democrats that they still need to home in on an effective anti trump message seth moulton the democratic congressman from massachusetts who has been flirting with a longshot 2020 presidential bid seized on the results ossof race better be a wake up call for democrats business as usual isn t working time to stop rehashing 2016 and talk about the future we need a genuinely new message a serious jobs plan that reaches all americans and a bigger tent not a smaller one focus on the future the results are already prompting democratic recriminations as the bernie sanders wing of the party pushes the establishment to get behind more liberal candidates initially ossoff s mantra was make trump furious but he rarely talked about the president toward the end of the contest because he needed to win over moderate republicans and didn t want to motivate low propensity trump voters to turn out against him he modulated his rhetoric calling for fiscal conservatism in his ads and focusing on jobs he avoided hot button issues and called for civility liberal activists and their allied outside groups are grumbling that ossoff moderated too much and they ve been complaining for weeks that the national party apparatus invested more to help him than outspokenly liberal candidates in montana and kansas special elections the best way for democrats to maximize gains in 2018 especially in purple and red districts is to harness the power of the resistance and field candidates who proudly challenge power said adam green co founder of the progressive change campaign committee from the executive director of the national nurses union and a prominent bernie supporter dear democrats can we talk georgia on my mind pic twitter com iokfp9cyer ossoff chose the high priest route instead of the fierce warrior it was civil disobedience rather than civil unrest and he still lost paul kane writes in a dispatch from sandy springs ga privately democratic strategists said even before the votes were counted tuesday that ossoff s civility campaign would be mirrored only in more republican leaning districts and that a more aggressive anti trump campaign would be waged by candidates in longtime swing districts the outcome demonstrated that two political fundamentals remain true attack ads work and candidates matter democrats pinned their hopes on a 30 year old who had never run for office before and didn t even live in the district ossoff became more dynamic on the stump as the race dragged on but his lack of a record made it easy to caricature him he was a vessel through which democrats channeled their hopes but he lacked charisma as a former cnn reporter who now runs snapchat s news division memorably put it jon ossoff there hasn t been this much grassroots excitement for an unexciting candidate since ned lamont was marching around connecticut handel 55 has been a fixture of local politics for 15 years she chaired the fulton county board of commissioners served as georgia secretary of state and narrowly lost gop primaries to become governor in 2010 and then senator in 2014 she had the baggage that comes with being a career politician but her deep roots and relationships certainly helped far more than they hurt she was a known commodity who came into the race with high name identification in conceding ossoff stressed that winning was always against the odds we showed the world that in places no one even thought it was possible to fight we can fight and we will fight total spending in the race topped 50 million national republican groups poured resources into the race to offset ossoff s impressive online fundraising in the end from the april primary through yesterday s election both sides were equally matched on the airwaves republicans spent 12 million and democrats spent 12 2 million according to sources tracking the air war nancy pelosi was a huge drag on ossoff the most prominent and effective hit on the democratic candidate was to tie him to the congresswoman from san francisco republican operatives say that 98 percent of voters in the 6th district already had an impression of pelosi when they conducted their first internal poll and she was 35 points underwater when presented with the choice of whether they wanted a representative who would work with paul ryan or pelosi six in 10 picked the speaker and three in 10 picked the minority leader the congressional leadership fund a super pac aligned closely with ryan spent more than 7 million in georgia clf tied ossoff to pelosi and her liberal agenda early and often echoing the message on television digital and radio advertising as well as campaign literature and direct mail corry bliss executive director of the group writes in an after action report that will be widely distributed later today other outside groups and handel also focused on this theme dave weigel obtained the mailers that the group sent into the district and pelosi is dominant in each here are three examples of how they used her some democrats expressed concern last night that pelosi will be a drag on their hopes of winning the house next year one liberal writer for vox suggested last night that it is time for her to go her four years as speaker were a heroic triumph but after tonight i think house democrats need to think hard about the pelosi question pelosi s deputy chief of staff fired back right let s abandon the party s best raiser consensus builder cause rs don t like a democratic woman that gets things done https t co fkmgduukgx republican operatives including the executive director of the nrsc trolled hammill by saying that they want pelosi to stay on as leader forever just so everybody knows and i really want to be clear here we ve all endorsed nancypelosi as minority leader for life leave nancy alone pic twitter com 5tc8kn627o pelosi s job is secure but insiders say to expect a raucous house democratic caucus meeting today when the results are discussed the results will embolden trump and may convince him that he doesn t need to course correct a cbs news poll published yesterday showed that the president s national job approval rating has slipped to 36 percent even among republicans his approval rating is 72 percent down 11 points since april yet as far as trump s concerned he keeps winning even when the polls and the pundits forecast doom the gop base clearly rallied behind handel and she closed strong in the final days of the campaign rightly or wrongly the president perceives her victory as a mandate trump stayed up late watching the returns come in and began live tweeting as soon as it became clear that handel would prevail things are looking great for karen h thank you foxnews huge win for president trump and gop in georgia congressional special election

ed rogers argues on the postpartisan blog this race proves republicans have no reason to be defensive as a result of obamacare s demise it shows republicans have nothing to hide from in the age of

yemen get smart fast there s a bear in the woods even though top u s officials were convinced in january that incoming national security adviser michael flynn was vulnerable to blackmail and was an urgent problem he continued to receive briefings from cia director mike pompeo for three weeks where he was read in on some of the nation s most sensitive intelligence on a near daily basis the new york times matthew rosenberg and adam goldman report concerns across the government about mr flynn were so great after mr trump took office that six days after the inauguration former deputy attorney general sally yates warned the white house that mr flynn had been compromised mr trump waited 18 days from that warning before firing mr flynn a period in which mr pompeo continued to brief mr flynn and the president a warning from mr pompeo may have persuaded the white house to take ms yates s concerns more seriously mr pompeo was sworn in three days before ms yates went to the white house and testified last month that he did not know what was said in that meeting by that time c i a officials had attended meetings with f b i agents about mr flynn and reviewed the transcripts of his conversations with the russian ambassador separately intelligence agencies were aware that russian operatives had discussed ways to use their relationship with mr flynn to influence mr trump and mr pompeo who briefs the president nearly every day had frequent opportunities to raise the issue with mr trump special counsel robert mueller s investigation of possible financial ties between russia and trump associates may include probing a real estate development firm called the bayrock group bloomberg s timothy l o brien writes bayrock partnered with the future president and his two eldest children donald jr and ivanka on a series of real estate deals between 2002 and about 2011 the most prominent being the troubled trump soho hotel and condominium in manhattan during the years that bayrock and trump did deals together the company was also a bridge between murky european funding and a number of projects in the u s to which the president once leant his name in exchange for handsome fees icelandic banks that dealt with bayrock for example were easy marks for money launderers and foreign influence the attorney general is now lawyering up jeff sessions has hired d c litigator and longtime friend charles cooper as his personal attorney the move comes after several other white house officials including mike pence have sought outside counsel to protect their personal interests in mueller s probe sari horwitz reports cooper was seen sitting behind sessions when he testified last week before the senate intelligence committee about trump and russia i do represent the attorney general but as with all clients do not comment on confidential client matters cooper said in an email cooper a partner with his own firm cooper kirk would not say when he was retained by sessions or whether he is representing sessions in the special counsel s investigation into trump and russia meanwhile sean spicer said during a white house press briefing tuesday that he did not know whether trump believes russia interfered in the 2016 elections despite the conclusion of 16 u s intelligence agencies that it did philip rucker reports spicer was asked a yes or no question near the end of a briefing does trump believe the russian government interfered in the 2016 election i have not sat down and talked to him about that specific thing spicer said after he was reminded that 16 u s intelligence agencies had concluded that russia did engage in cyber attacks to influence the election spicer said i understand i ve seen the reports but when reporters pressed him on whether the president shares in that conclusion spicer said i have not sat down and asked him about his specific reaction to them both the senate and house intelligence committees will hold public hearings today focused on the effects of russian election interference at the state level the wall street journal s rebecca ballhaus and erica orden report the hearings represent the most robust effort to date to elicit public testimony from state election officials concerning what federal officials have described as an aggressive and sustained effort by russia to interfere with the 2016 election sen mark warner d va the vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee on tuesday sent a letter to homeland security secretary john kelly pressing him to publicly disclose which states were targeted to ensure that they are fully aware of the threat and to make certain that their cyber defenses are able to neutralize this danger mueller met with house intelligence committee leaders k michael conaway r tex and adam b schiff d calif on tuesday evening the lawmakers confirmed in a statement the meeting comes as the two parties work to ensure mueller s workdoes not conflict with their probe heis slated to meet today with leading members of the senate judiciary committee as well as sens lindsey o graham r s c and sheldon whitehouse d r i abc news a cbs news poll found that a full 56 percent of voters believe mueller sinvestigation which trump has decried as a witch hunt will be impartial while more than 80 percent said trump should not attempt to stop the special counsel s investigation meanwhile a third of voters now say trump sapproach to the russia issue has made their opinion of him worse contributing to the president s sky high57 percent disapproval rate meanwhile on capitol hill a bill extending financial sanctions on russia which overwhelmingly passed the senate last week in a 98 to 2 vote has hit a major procedural snag in the house mike debonis and karoun demirjian report this week house staff flagged the bill for violating the constitutional provision that only the house can originate bills raising revenue for the government creating what is known on capitol hill as a blue slip violation fixing the issue might not be a simple matter with unanimous consent required to expedite any senate legislation and republicans preparing to bring complex health care legislation to the senate floor sen bob corker r tenn the bill s sponsor said tuesday that he had not been informed of the issue you re sharing something with me i m not aware of he said we felt like we had adequately dealt with the blue slip issue i look forward to seeing what the complaint might be but the holdup comes amid a push by the trump administration to delay or water down sanctions and senators fear that the white house sees the house as a bottleneck where it can block the broader sanctions bill damn the torpedoes senate republicans expect to release a discussion draft of their health care bill on thursday and hold a vote next week but the intense secrecy surrounding the negotiations has angered colleagues on both sides of the aisle sean sullivan juliet eilperin and kelsey snell report mcconnell s desire to wrap up before the fourth of july recess reflects the sense of urgency among republicans including president trump to show progress on health care after years of vowing to repeal and replace the affordable care act but even among republicans competing ideological goals have complicated senate negotiations among the challenges in a messy drafting process how to lower insurance premium costs and eliminate what some view as burdensome coverage mandates without increasing the number of uninsured americans senate leaders hope to start debate by tuesday or wednesday of next week yet it remains unclear whether mcconnell has the 50 votes he needs to pass the bill the clandestine nature of the health care talks as well as the shortened timeline between the bill s introduction and the vote are key parts of mcconnell s strategy after watching the house struggle to pass its version of the ahca amber phillips writes republicans might not be able to defend keeping their health care bill secret until the last minute but they have a reason for doing it they re calculating that the blowback for keeping it secret is a lesser evil than the blowback for negotiating it in public and opposition probably won t have time to coalesce there will be about a week between the bill s introduction and a vote the contents of the bill remain unclear but the legislationwill likely include deeper cuts to medicaid than the house bill and a more gradual phaseout of the aca s medicaid expansion my colleaguepaige winfield cunningham reported in thethe health 202 the bill s 50 vote pathway to passage is most likely to circumvent sens susan collins r maine and rand paul r ky the medicaid expansion also included substance abuse treatment which could be gutted just as states face an opioid drug crisis senators like portman and capito have proposed a 45 billion fund to fill the gap but conservatives oppose that as well the new york times robert pear and jennifer steinhauer report another republican who may be on the fence lisa murkowski of alaska she has voted against her party on occasion since trump took office and she has voiced concern over the cutting medicaid and planned parenthood funding the wall street journal s kristina peterson and stephanie armour report even if senate republicans can pass a bill the white house has indicated they won t necessarily receive much cover from the president asked about a report that trump said the senate bill needed more heart sean spicer replied the president clearly wants a bill that has heart in it he believes health care is something that is near and dear to so many families and individuals he made it clear from the beginning that it was one of his priorities palace intrigue the search is on for sean spicer s replacement as white house press secretary butthere may be few takers the new york times s maggie haberman and glenn thrush report most republicans in washington said it would be among the hardest jobs to fill in the trump administration among the candidates laura ingraham the conservative radio host about whom trump advisers remain iffy kimberly guilfoyle the fox

that the national parks would lose in fiscal 2018 republicans on the other hand applauded the trump administration s proposals to invest in energy exploration on public lands one of the most pointed

qatar over its alleged support for terrorism saudi arabia and the uae have not publicly detailed their complaints the more that time goes by the more doubt is raised about the actions taken by saudi arabia and the uae nauert said at this point we are left with one simple question were the actions really about their concerns about qatar s alleged support for terrorism or were they about the long simmering grievances between and among the gcc countries the diplomatic crisis has been a test of the new u s administration s pull with arab allies and has pitted trump s public support for the saudi
