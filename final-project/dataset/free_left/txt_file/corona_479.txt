coronavirus crisis is impacting our journalism and why we need to raise 400 000 to help cover all of the reporting we plan to do if you re able to please support mother jones nonprofit journalism today donate patrick semansky ap that didn t take long donald trump already seems to be growing tired and frustrated with doing the right thing after about two months of deadly delays and denials trump a week ago finally began pushing a public health initiative to counter the coronavirus pandemic promoting the white house s 15 days to slow the spread campaign which called for social distancing teleworking and limiting social gatherings to 10 or fewer people this was not as aggressive a stance as some public health experts urged but it was far better than the message trump conveyed on march 4 when he told sean hannity you know we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by you know sitting around and even going to work yet now it appears that trump is considering pivoting from the expert driven plan of containing the virus by minimizing social interactions on sunday night he tweeted we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself at the end of the 15 day period we will make a decision as to which way we want to go this seemed to suggest trump worried that the strict measures taken to counter the pandemic and save lives might be causing too much economic pain soon after trump retweeted a number of conservative activists who explicitly made this troubling point one declared correct 15 days then we keep the high risk groups protected as necessary and the rest of us go back to work another railed that the current measures were leading to the destruction of the economy a third said flatten the curve not the economy and trump also retweeted an unverified account apparently belonging to a southern california sex counselor who proclaimed the fear of the virus cannot collapse our economy that president trump has built up we the people are smart enough to keep away from others if we know that we are sick or they are sick after 15 days are over the world can begin to heal here was trump promoting the position that come next week those damn annoying and inconvenient social distancing practices should be dropped and the nation should just depend on citizens being able to sort out on their own how to avoid sharing the virus meanwhile thenew york times reported that at the white house in recent days there has been a growing sentiment that medical experts were allowed to set policy that hashurt the economy and there has been a push to find ways to let people start returning to work the story noted trump has become frustrated with dr anthony fauci s blunt approach at the briefing lectern which often contradicts things the president has just said according to two people familiar with the dynamic fauci has been saying that severe social distancing measures will likely be required for weeks to come longer than those 15 days trump initially called for that s not going over well with the boss and on monday thewall street journalreported the white house is discussing easing social distancing guidelines as early as next week as advisers and business leaders push president trump to boost an economy beset by deepening job losses nationwide put all this together and a clear and harsh impression emerges trump is willing to weaken public health measures in order to try to prevent further economic damage to put it crassly he seems to care more about economic metrics than preventing the death of americans why would that be it was no secret that until the coronavirus crisis hit trump s primary argument for reelection was based on the economy which at that point according to conventional measurements the stock market the unemployment rate was performing well the pandemic has blasted away this reason for reelection the current forecasts up to 30 percent unemployment gdp contraction by 20 percent are a nightmare for the nation and for a president facing voters in several months and the ongoing economic calamity has had a devastating impact on trump s own businesses trump in a way feared this possibility from the start as the killer virus was gaining a foothold in the united states he reportedly opposed aggressive testing because that would show higher numbers of infections and larger numbers were bad for his political prospects that is he placed his own personal interests ahead of those of the nation trump is a numbers guy when they work for him and in the early weeks of the epidemic he tried to deploy statistics to downplay the threat on march 9 long after experts in and out of government were citing the immediate need for widespread and comprehensive action trump zapped out a tweet suggesting the coronavirus was no big deal because the flu caused the death of 37 000 americans in 2019 and the new virus had so far only claimed 22 think about that he declared so last year 37 000 americans died from the common flu it averages between 27 000 and 70 000 per year nothing is shut down life the economy go on at this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of coronavirus with 22 deaths think about that donald j trump realdonaldtrump march 9 2020 see numbers said it wasn t so bad but now trump has two sets of numbers to confront the horrifying daily stats on the spread of covid 19 including the rising death tally and the terrifying measurements of the free falling economy a narcissist trump is more fearful of the second category which affects his future in a manner he can fully comprehend with this latest spout of tweets trump is signaling that he s eager to shout enough already regarding the restrictive measures designed to impede the transmission of the virus he is drawn to the idea of soon easing up and encouraging folks without symptoms to head back into the world if this occurs infected people without symptoms will fill streets offices shops mass transportation schools churches restaurants and other public places but because there is still no nationwide comprehensive testing system most of these infected persons will have no idea they are transmitting the virus trump s endorsement of the magical thinking that americans can return to work without infecting others is unsettling and alarming this would place millions of americans in danger particularly the most vulnerable the elderly the already sick and those with limited access to health care it would mean more death and such a move would further increase the pressure on the nation s buckling health care system that too would mean more death trump s tweets and retweets are a sign he believes the cost to the economy of an effective containment policy is too high perhaps partly or wholly because that cost also threatens his reelection yet health care experts are adamantly saying the current policies need to remain in place for some time and probably should be tighter so trump faces a serious tradeoff does he want to follow scientific expertise and do all that is necessary to safeguard americans or does he want to relax restraints in an effort to limit the harm to the economy even if doing so might allow the pandemic to burn wider and hotter and further threaten the economy it s true that most americans do not face a lethal risk from the coronavirus but many do this group is mostly older americans but younger citizens are not entirely safe from covid 19 how much does trump care about these people is he willing to sacrifice thousands of them or a lot more in a probably misguided bid to restart the economy because that s what he deems is best for his reelection campaign this is a helluva calculation for a politician to make but trump s latest noises are those of a man who believes more deaths are not as bad as more economic hardship and someone who gives the appearance he is willing to pave the way to electoral victory with the bodies of fallen
