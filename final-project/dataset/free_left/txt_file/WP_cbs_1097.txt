the following is a transcript of an interview with dr anthony fauci that aired sunday march 22 2020 on face the nation margaret brennan doctor anthony fauci is the director at the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at nih and that is where he joins us from this morning dr fauci thank you for making time for us dr anthony fauci good to be with you margaret brennan you just you just heard that report from our liz palmer about italy are we on the same trajectory as italy dr fauci no not necessarily at all i mean obviously things are unpredictable you can t make any definitive statement but if you look at the dynamics of the outbreak in italy we don t know why they are suffering so terribly but there is a possibility and many of us believe that early on they did not shut out as well the input of infections that originated in china and came to different parts of the world one of the things that we did very early and very aggressively the president you know had put the travel restriction coming from from china to the united states and most recently from europe to the united states because europe is really the new china again i don t know why this is happening there to such an extent but it is conceivable that once you get so many of these spreads out they spread exponentially and you can never keep up with this tsunami and i think that s what unfortunately our colleagues and our dear friends in italy are facing they are very competent it isn t that they don t know what they re doing margaret brennan yeah dr fauci i think they have a situation in which they ve been so overwhelmed from the beginning that they can t play catch up and in direct answer to your question margaret it is may be and i hope and i think it will be the case that we will not be that way because we have from the beginning been able to put a bit of a clamp on it we re going to get hit there s no doubt about it we see it in new york new york is ter is terribly suffering but the kinds of mitigation issues that are going on right now the things that we re seeing in this country this physical separation at the same time as we re preventing an influx of cases coming in i think that s gonna go a long way to preventing us from becoming in italy margaret brennan this was an animal virus that jumped to a human dr fauci correct margaret brennan then it started spreading human to human is the virus mutating is it changing dr fauci well this is an rna virus margaret and it always will mutate the real question is so that people don t get confused viruses commute mutate with no substantial impact on its function so i have no doubt it s mutating as all rna viruses mutate we have not seen thus far any type of change in the way it s acting but we are keeping a very close eye on it because it is conceivable that it could mutate and change some of the ways that it performs but we have not seen that yet but we re not going to just not pay attention to it we re going to follow it closely margaret brennan that s very important to highlight there you know one of the things that stood out this week in some of the briefings we heard from the white house was this mentioned particularly from your colleague ambassador birx that young people in europe seemed to be affected in a way that was unexpected dr fauci right margaret brennan and we heard from the cdc this week 20 percent of the hospitalizations in this country were between the ages of 20 and 44 why dr fauci you re absolutely margaret brennan are young people getting affected this way when it wasn t expected dr fauci you re absolutely correct and you just nailed the very important critical issue that we re looking very closely at you know it looks like there s a big difference between that demography as we call it from china and what we re seeing in europe now we have to look at the young people who are getting seriously ill from the european cohort and make sure it isn t just driven by the fact that they have underlying conditions because we know that underlying conditions all bets are off no matter how young you are if you have an underlying serious medical condition you re going to potentially get into trouble but if they don t have underlying conditions that will be something we have to really examine as to why we re seeing it here but we didn t see it in china so we re going to look at that very closely margaret brennan you mentioned in particular new york and what may be coming there the president has tweeted this morning that ford gm and tesla have been given the go ahead to make ventilators there s been this back and forth over whether the president actually has ordered companies or not to produce needed medical equipment what have these companies agreed to do and when will medical professionals have what they need dr fauci well i mean as yesterday in the press conference that that i m sure you heard what the president was saying is that these companies are coming forth on their own and i think that s an extraordinary spirit of the american spirit of not needing to be coaxed they re stepping forward they re making not only masks but ppes and now ventilators so what we re going to be seeing and and we re seeing it already in the beginning obviously there was an issue with testing the testing now a large number of tests are available now out there because the private companies have gotten involved the margaret brennan but like the mayor of new york has said this week that he was going to run out of medical equipment dr fauci right margaret brennan in a matter of two weeks dr fauci that s true margaret brennan so when will medical it is true he will run out dr fauci no no margaret brennan will the federal government get him what he needs dr fauci true true to both of them let me explain margaret brennan ok dr fauci we were at at the task force meeting yesterday and it was very clear that the issue in new york was right on the front burner and the situation is now that the resources that are being marshaled are going to be clearly directed to those hotspots that need it most and clearly that s california washington state and obviously new york is the most hard hit so not only is new york trying to get resources themselves but we re going to be pouring it in from the federal government so it would be a combination of local and federal but it s very very clear that they are a very high priority margaret brennan you are the leading infectious disease expert in the u s government you said this week that you differed from the president in his assessment that a combination of two drugs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combined could have the outcome that he described to the public they possibly could where who is the president listening to and do you see a concern here that those drugs could become you know basically oversubscribed and there could be a shortage that could impact people who have persistent medical issues like lupus and need those dr fauci ok so margaret there s an issue here of where we re coming from the president as heard as we all have heard what are what i call anecdotal reports that certain drugs work so what he was trying to do and express was the hope that if they might work let s try and push their usage i on the other side have said i m not disagreeing with the fact anecdotally they might work but my job is to prove definitively from a scientific standpoint that they do work so i was taking a purely medical scientific standpoint and the president was trying to bring hope to the people i think there s this issue of trying to separate the two of us there isn t fundamentally a difference there he s coming from it from a hope layperson standpoint margaret brennan ok dr fauci i m coming from it from a scientific standpoint margaret brennan and we wish you the best thank you very much doctor dr fauci good to be with you watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news
