 it s clear there s been a sea change over the past three years in how democratic senators view their independent colleague from vermont bernie sanders drew angerer getty images 2020 elections democratic senators are surprisingly open to the vermont independent as the nominee if he manages to emerge from the crowded primary by burgess everett and marianne levine 03 10 2019 06 55 am edt updated 03 10 2019 08 40 am edt the last time bernie sanders ran for president he was treated like a pariah within the senate democratic caucus his colleagues thought his campaign was a liberal fantasy that served only to damage hillary clinton this time though the vermont independent is getting a warmer reception from the senators who constitute much of the democratic establishment he s railed against advertisement senate democrats say they re open to getting behind sanders if he appears the strongest candidate a year from now and there s no whiff of an effort to deny him the nomination according to interviews with more than 20 democratic senators it s not that the democratic caucus is rallying behind him most of its members would prefer a more mainstream nominee even if they re unwilling to say it at this point but they re giving sanders props for what he s accomplished and say if he s able to win the nomination more power to him there was a question in my mind of whether he could get back up on the bicycle after four years but he s off to a solid start said sen dick durbin of illinois the second ranking democrat and a staunch clinton supporter in 2016 i know bernie i ve worked with bernie i understand him people have images of him which may be different than mine but if you re asking me about bernie sanders vs donald trump no problem the race for 2020

leahy said sanders didn t bother to ask him for his support four years ago because leahy was already with clinton sanders has reciprocated playing nice with the party after lambasting it for being in cahoots with clinton in 2016 he signed a loyalty pledge with the democratic national committee and said he won t go negative in the primary and his team sees a democratic party that s no longer hostile to the liberal ideals he s long pushed on minimum wage health care and foreign policy as well as a dnc that s truly committed to a wide open primary i don t want to speak for bernie but my sense is that he s comfortable that it s a level playing field said sen brian schatz d hawaii and that even if he doesn t succeed that his views are being well represented in the democratic party sanders was added to the senate leadership team after his 2016 loss putting him in close proximity to democratic leaders he had little to do with before the exposure pushed bernie to reach out more to inside the party said larry cohen chairman of pro sanders group our revolution democratic leader chuck schumer is remaining neutral in the crowded primary as are a majority of senate democrats caught in awkward positions between the half dozen senators running generally senators avoid talking about a single candidate out of fear they would offend someone in the caucus 2020 by sam sanders yet it s clear there s been a sea change over the past three years in how democratic senators view sanders they said they respect the movement he s built and its potential to help the party defeat trump whether or not sanders is the nominee many democrats insisted on anonymity to speak candidly about the primary but they acknowledged sanders is no longer persona non grata i certainly hear out in the political world a lot of concern about sanders i don t hear a lot of that internally one democratic senator said democrats look at him differently because he s not running against hillary clinton he s a major player in the party in a way that he wasn t in 2016 he looked like a quixotic candidate it s not like people are sitting around thinking about how to keep the nomination from him this time there are a few reasons for that democrats believe there s a decent chance sanders could peter out on his own and that going after him would only give him and his followers ammunition to attack washington insiders but there s also a feeling that if sanders can come out on top of a level playing field in 2020 then he s earned it worst thing you can do is push somebody out they just dig in harder added a second senate democrat my guess right now is if you re to do a straw poll he s the favorite to win sen sherrod brown d ohio experienced the sanders phenomenon firsthand in the waning days of his deliberations over whether to run for president as he flew with sanders and sen cory booker d n j to selma ala this month there were a lot of people that wanted selfies with bernie a lot more than wanted selfies with me he said there s a lot of affection for him but it s not just selfies it s money and organization too sanders raised 6 million the day he launched his campaign and in early polls is the clear second choice after former vice president joe biden who has not entered the race he also hired faiz shakir a former top aide to harry reid as his campaign manager a fresh approach from the insular 2016 campaign that raged against the democratic establishment 2020 elections by christopher cadelago and daniel strauss and the 77 year old brooklynite has a diverse group of campaign co chairs including rep ro khanna d calif former ohio state sen nina turner and san juan puerto rico mayor carmen yul n cruz he s demonstrated that he is a serious formidable candidate and i think that the field will narrow very quickly said sen richard blumenthal d conn predicting sanders would survive the first culling of candidates and saying that he d be comfortable with sanders as the nominee sanders has taken note of the change in tone there is respect now within the democratic caucus for the movement that bernie has built and sustained over the past four years shakir said in a statement as a result the ideas bernie pushed in 2016 have become mainstream in the democratic caucus and leadership has embraced his message of taking on the wealthy and powerful corporations in the 2016 campaign much of the focus was on bernie sanders as underdog and outsider shakir added that sanders has been encouraged by his colleagues willingness to collaborate and noted that a record number of people have co sponsored bills like medicare for all that s not to say sanders doesn t have his democratic detractors the most conservative senate democrat joe manchin of west virginia declined to commit to supporting sanders over trump if the vermont senator wins the nomination manchin and sanders have long had a frosty relationship whoever the democrats put up is a person i m going to look at very hard and maybe even work for manchin said all other democrats interviewed for this story said they would support sanders if he becomes the nominee sen jeff merkley d ore however is not ready to endorse anyone after being sanders lone senate supporter in 2016 several senators said privately that trump would be able to more easily defeat sanders than any other democrat that s an echo of republicans view that a sanders nomination would be a gift to the incumbent president as sen john cornyn r texas put it but most democrats expressed confidence that the president would be out of office come 2021 we re going to beat trump regardless of who the nominee is brown said a handful of democratic senators are openly questioning sanders agenda sen robert menendez d n j said it was unimaginable that sanders wouldn t call venezuelan leader nicol s maduro a dictator picking at sanders foreign policy acumen if you want to be president you deal with domestic policy and you deal with foreign policy and i don t understand how one cannot simply recognize a dictator for being a dictator menendez who backs booker said and sen chris coons d del who is pressing biden to enter the race questioned how sanders would actually come up with a policy agenda that could become law this year s different and there s a much higher expectation for sanders added sen tom carper d del another close biden ally yet sanders calls for a higher minimum wage universal health care and tougher environmental regulations have been embraced by most of his rivals whether or not he s the nominee the democratic party is now partially the party of sanders his once skeptical senate colleagues concede he brings a dimension to our primaries sen ben cardin d md said that will be helpful for us to win
