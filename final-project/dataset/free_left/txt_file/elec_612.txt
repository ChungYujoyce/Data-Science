advertisement supported by transcript tk by patrick healy and jonathan martin get live updates about the florida primary senators marco rubio and ted cruz fighting for their political lives relentlessly demeaned and baited donald j trump at thursday s debate all but pleading with republicans to abandon a candidate with a long history of business failures deep ties to the democratic party and a taste for personal insults warning that mr trump would lead the party to a historic defeat in november mr rubio and mr cruz delivered their attacks with urgency as if trying to awaken voters who had fallen under mr trump s spell mr rubio derided mr trump as untrustworthy and uncivil while mr cruz bashed him for donating money to hillary clinton s 2008 presidential campaign and to other democrats mr trump looked on with disgust but as in their 10 previous debates he seemed impervious and perhaps unstoppable at times the face off in detroit also deteriorated into the kind of junior high school taunts that have startled many republican elders but have done little to dent mr trump s broad appeal as mr trump and mr rubio traded insults over their manhood mr trump recalled mr rubio s innuendo that mr trump s small hands correlated with another part of his anatomy mr trump who has boasted about his sexual exploits insisted that nothing was small about him i guarantee you he continued with little subtlety there s no problem i guarantee you the two senators repeatedly urged republicans to align against mr trump in nominating contests over the next two weeks saying that mr trump could sew up the nomination even though a majority of voters so far have cast ballots for other candidates two thirds of the people who cast a vote in a republican primary or caucus have voted against you mr rubio told mr trump the reason why is because we are not going to turn over the conservative movement or the party of lincoln or reagan for example to someone whose positions are not conservative the pleas reflected not only mr trump s advantage in the race but also the party s growing disquiet about the implications of nominating him the specter of mr trump as the republican standard bearer has long troubled both establishment aligned and conservative leaders but his initial hesitation to condemn the ku klux klan in an interview on sunday and his success in seven states on super tuesday have set off a new wave of anxiety that mr trump could tarnish the party this year and perhaps beyond still in a striking moment all of mr trump s rivals on stage indicated that they would support him if he became the republican nominee the consensus was especially unusual in the case of mr rubio who has been caustically attacking mr trump as a con man while mr rubio savaged mr trump repeatedly on thursday mr cruz combined his jabs with high minded appeals to conservatives he emphasized his support for a simple flat tax and a strong national defense trying to position himself ahead of mr rubio as the more competitive candidate against mr trump the new york times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign mr cruz also appealed directly to mr trump s supporters by saying that their desire for a political outsider to lead the country was misplaced for 40 years donald has been part of the corruption in washington that you re angry about mr cruz said and you re not going to stop the corruption in washington by supporting someone who has supported liberal democrats for four decades from jimmy carter to john kerry to hillary clinton donald trump in 2008 wrote four checks to elect hillary clinton as president mr cruz added turning to mr trump to demand why he had done so actually it was for business mr trump said before noting that he had also given to ronald reagan and george w bush mr trump found himself on the defensive throughout the night challenged by his rivals and the fox news moderators to explain his inconsistent stands in the past he also had to defend himself against a movement begun earlier thursday by mitt romney the 2012 republican nominee who shredded mr trump as a phony and a fraud who must be blocked from the nomination mr trump offered the chance to respond to mr romney with harshness or with substance chose the former he was a failed candidate mr trump said he should have beaten president obama very easy mr cruz and mr rubio who have been grappling for ways to halt mr trump s political momentum seemed intent on trying to bait him into losing his cool at one point as mr cruz tarred mr trump for donating to mrs clinton s 2008 campaign mr trump tried repeatedly to interrupt count to 10 donald count to 10 mr cruz said later in an exchange over supreme court nominations mr cruz taunted breathe breathe breathe you can do it that prompted mr rubio to joke that his two rivals were primed for yoga especially mr trump he s very flexible mr rubio said a quip referring to mr trump s changes in political positions mr rubio tried to get under mr trump s skin by boring in on trump university the defunct education and training venture over which mr trump is facing civil litigation alleging that he defrauded students recalling that he had spoken to one of the victims mr rubio said that what students had gotten in the courses was stuff you could pull off of zillow why won t you give them their money back mr rubio asked mr trump who described the litigation as a minor civil case claimed that almost all students who had signed up for the courses said it was terrific but he quickly lost patience with mr rubio calling him little marco a phrase he used several times mr trump noted that the senator was losing to him in florida polls before the state s march 15 primary transcript na the people in florida wouldn t elect him dogcatcher mr trump said mr rubio his voice ragged appeared frustrated at times as he repeatedly sought to sow doubts about mr trump he has been trying for months to catch fire against mr trump whom he holds in low regard on policy matters and now the florida primary looms as make or break for mr rubio s candidacy you have yet to answer a single serious question about any of this mr rubio said referring to mr trump s generalities on foreign affairs as mr trump responded by reiterating praise he had received from president vladimir v putin of russia mr rubio threw his arms up and turned away in exasperation if mr trump struggled to deflect the attacks on his character business sense and political viability against mrs clinton in the fall he seized opportunities to reassure conservatives that he would be a forceful commander in chief questioned by the moderators about his past advocacy for torture and for killing the families of terrorists mr trump stood firm and argued that we should go tougher than waterboarding pressed about whether military officers would carry out such orders killing terrorists family members would violate the geneva conventions mr trump offered a boast if i say do it they re going to do it he said at another point in a rare concession from mr trump he acknowledged that he was changing one of his positions in the highly charged immigration debate and was now open to offering visas for highly skilled foreign workers he also lamented that foreign citizens go to the best colleges in america and as soon as they are finished they get shoved out and said he was softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country while his shift could appeal to some business leaders and moderate voters he would need in a general election his campaign also issued a statement after the debate saying he would institute an absolute requirement to hire american workers first for every visa and immigration program no exception mr trump s shifting positions have been a target for months but during this debate his rivals received help from the fox news debate moderators they played a compilation of video clips in which he was depicted changing his mind on issues like the war in iraq mr trump was then asked directly if he had a core i have a very strong core but i have never seen a successful person who wasn t flexible mr trump said one of the most anticipated face offs of the night was between mr trump and the moderator megyn kelly who infuriated the candidate with her aggressive questions at the first republican debate in august ms kelly and mr trump breezily engaged each other on thursday night but ms kelly was pointed if polite in her questioning both mr rubio and mr cruz repeatedly challenged mr trump to release the full transcript of his meeting with the new york times s editorial board earlier in the year buzzfeed reported this week that mr trump in off the record comments had told the newspaper that he was willing to soften his hard line immigration views but mr trump stood his ground saying he would never release off the record conversations pressed by mr cruz he shot back i ve given my answer lying ted i ve given my answer the fourth candidate gov john kasich of ohio who has positioned himself as the positive sounding and seasoned executive in the race largely stuck to that strategy but mr kasich who is lagging far behind mr trump and the other candidates struggled to leave a mark in the debate
