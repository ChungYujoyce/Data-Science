he dressed as a mermaid with a red wig and shiny sequined skirt the burden of handling coronavirus quarantine in many homes was falling on moms families said with much of the new tension in couples caused by fights over what women thought were battles that had already been won when lea geller a novelist blogger and mother of five in riverdale n y first thought about a quarantine it seemed it could be fun i thought it would be a week of snow days ms geller said but now it s lasting forever and ever to some degree it feels like we re running a wework she said my husband s running tech support running round with cables and i m just shoveling food into everyone s mouths and loading and reloading the dishwasher a million times a day ms geller thought maybe she would have extra time with her husband mike geller but the only private time they have had was when they literally hid from their children in a back room the other day she said my new office mates are significantly more high maintenance mr geller said referring to the kids he added that at least the tech support was now largely sorted and ready for week 2 and more the hardest part is that ms geller s own work has gone on hold when her husband s office shut down she gave him her home work space now she is having trouble thinking creatively in the 30 minute increments when she can sneak away from the family there s the constant certainty that someone is about to interrupt me and ask me for food or a stapler ms geller said maria colacurcio chief executive of syndio a human resources analytics company in seattle and the mother of six children said the lopsidedness was not a surprise even without a pandemic domestic labor largely falls on women so now where do you think the extra falls ms colacurcio said leah wagner edelstein a director of an academic institute at university of california berkeley and the mother of a 5 year old and a 3 year old who are now home all day said she and her husband jason had what she considered an equal arrangement i still manage more or less our whole household the cooking most of the cleaning the bulk of the home schooling she said those gender divisions they just come out immediately toddlers need constant entertainment and can focus on only one thing for a few minutes so ms wagner edelstein got some younger cousins to sign up on a spreadsheet to help with entertaining her children every day they can choose hand puppets a dance party or name that color teachers she said need to be paid much more despite it all ms wagner edelstein said she was finding that her love for her husband was deeper she is being gentler with him and vice versa they are focusing on small joys we think of fun as big vacations she said but now maybe it s just digging a hole in the front yard and finding what color the soil is not all cabin fever families are dealing with toddlers college students have been sent home repopulating their parents empty nests other
