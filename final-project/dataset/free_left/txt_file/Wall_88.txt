advertisement supported by dr rick bright testified that he made early appeals that the trump administration prepare for the coronavirus president trump and his health secretary snapped back by sheryl gay stolberg washington the whistle blower who was ousted as the head of a federal medical research agency charged on thursday that top trump administration officials failed to heed his early warnings to stock up on masks and other supplies to combat the coronavirus and that americans died as a result lives were endangered and i believe lives were lost dr rick bright who was removed in april as the director of the department of health and human services s biomedical advanced research and development authority told a house subcommittee as he warned the window is closing to address this pandemic over nearly four hours of testimony dr bright told lawmakers that the outbreak would get worse and be prolonged if the united states did not swiftly develop a national testing strategy he also predicted vaccine shortages if the administration did not draft a distribution plan now after holding back for nearly a month president trump his health secretary alex m azar ii and his trade adviser peter navarro all hit back at dr bright in a three pronged assault that elevated the confrontation mr trump dismissed dr bright as a disgruntled employee and mr navarro whom mr bright considered an ally in the white house called him a deserter in the war on the china virus mr azar insisted officials followed through on the scientist s ideas everything he was complaining about was achieved mr azar told reporters as he and mr trump were preparing to board the presidential helicopter to leave for allentown pa what he talked about was done he said he talked about the need for respirators we procured respirators at the president s direction he said we need a manhattan project on a vaccine we had a manhattan project this is like someone who was in choir trying to say he was a soloist back then mr azar continued adding his allegations do not hold water they do not hold water the president joined in i don t know him mr trump said i never met him i don t want to meet him but i watched him and he looks like an angry disgruntled employee who frankly according to some people didn t do a very good job dr bright s testimony was the first time a federal scientist or any federal official had gone before congress and openly accused the administration of endangering american lives by bungling its coronavirus response he said americans would face the darkest winter in modern history if the administration did not move quickly as people become restless to leave their homes that came two days after dr anthony s fauci the government s top infectious disease expert contradicted mr trump by warning of needless suffering and death if states reopened too quickly amounting to a one two punch for the administration mr azar and dr bright s immediate supervisor at the department of health and human services robert kadlec declined invitations to testify as did mr navarro representative anna g eshoo democrat of california who led the hearing said later in an interview that she did not intend to subpoena them i don t want to go down any legal rabbit holes ms eshoo said adding that she found dr bright s testimony quite chilling in an 89 page complaint filed with the office of special counsel this month dr bright said he was reassigned to a narrower job at the national institutes of health as retaliation for his objections to the widespread distribution of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine malaria drugs that mr trump was promoting as a treatment for covid 19 he accused top officials of cronyism in awarding contracts a charge health and human services has strongly denied on thursday shortly before dr bright took the witness stand his lawyers disclosed that the office of special counsel which is investigating dr bright s complaint had made a preliminary determination of a substantial likelihood of wrongdoing regarding the cronyism allegation and had asked mr azar to investigate last week the special counsel found reasonable grounds that dr bright had been retaliated against and requested that mr azar reinstate him at the research agency for 45 days while the office investigated health and human services officials have not replied to either request said debra s katz a lawyer for dr bright but mr azar suggested that dr bright was being derelict in his refusal so far to take his new assignment at the national institutes of health a sentiment mr navarro echoed in a brief interview on thursday night health and human services officials initially said dr bright would lead a new shark tank type effort to develop coronavirus therapeutics but mr azar said he was supposed to be helping with a crash effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine called operation warp speed oh and by the way whose job was it to actually lead the development of a vaccine dr bright s a visibly angry mr azar said so while we are launching operation warp speed he s not showing up for work representative markwayne mullin republican of oklahoma echoed mr azar he hit dr bright for taking a medical leave for hypertension as his complaint went public then taking vacation time to rest but having the strength to show for a hearing on capitol hill the congressman noted that dr bright s job paid 285 000 a year you re too sick to come into work but you re well enough to come here mr mullin said dr bright told lawmakers he was testifying in his personal capacity and not as a government employee he was calm and measured throughout pushing back on republicans who at various points also complained he had not shown up for his national institutes of health job and suggested he should have brought his concerns to an inspector general he said he did instead of putting them in a whistle blower complaint representative susan w brooks republican of indiana reminded dr bright that the trump administration had engaged in pandemic planning and that he was a part of it i can say that those plans have been in place he replied evenly it is disappointing that they were not put on the table with a strong leader indicating these are our plans everyone falls in line and follow through with this plan such tension marked the hearing as did a flash of profanity when dr bright described his email exchanges with mike bowen the executive vice president of prestige ameritech a texas based company that makes protective masks mr bowen who has been warning for more than a decade that the united states was too dependent on masks from china emailed dr bright in january warning of a shortage in quiet tones dr bright recounted the email we re in deep shit the world is and we need to act mr bowen who testified after dr bright confirmed the account and said the issue was not partisan it seemed like everybody who was beating up on dr bright was a republican and everybody who was defending him was a democrat he said adding i m a republican i voted for president trump in addition to buying masks dr bright recommended that the federal government stock up on remdesivir a drug that has since been shown to shorten hospital stays for covid 19 and has been approved by the food and drug administration as a treatment dr bright also told the panel that he asked the pentagon for a plane to bring in nasal swabs which were in short supply and needed for coronavirus testing from italy after dr kadlec rebuffed him he said he called mr navarro who got permission from defense secretary mark t esper within hours as for a coronavirus vaccine dr bright said the prediction that it would take 12 to 18 months might be overly optimistic there s no one company that can produce enough for our country or the world he said it s going to be limited supplies democrats painted dr bright as a prescient man of courage it all adds up to one inescapable conclusion it didn t have to be this way said representative john sarbanes democrat of maryland things are upside down in you we have someone who made the right call in the early days who has been removed from your position when so many people who made the wrong call still have their jobs republicans though tried to discredit dr bright suggesting his performance was lacking representative richard hudson republican of north carolina told dr bright that congress should examine serious allegations that have been made against you without elaborating he cited a politico article that said his whistle blower complaint left out context and that his colleagues gave him mixed reviews dr bright said he finally appealed to the public after he tried to put limits on the distribution of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine representative gus bilirakis republican of florida told dr bright he knew of a veteran who was cured by hydroxychloroquine representative buddy carter republican of georgia noted that dr bright had shown initial enthusiasm for the drugs and pushed him on whether he soured on them because mr trump was promoting them dr bright said he was not opposed to testing the drugs but had safety concerns and wanted to wait for the results of clinical trials he said he assented to the f d a s emergency use authorization for chloroquine which is unapproved in the united states because the f d a limited its use to hospital patients under close medical supervision it had nothing to do with politics sir he responded to mr carter i wanted to make sure that americans were aware of the risks of this drug
