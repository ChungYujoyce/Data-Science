as the past week began the unites states was crossing 50 000 reported deaths from the coronavirus pandemic as the new week arrives the u s death total is 70 000 of the countless extraordinary events in these seven days a few that are worth noting 1 empathy and simple kindness this past saturday former president george w bush released a brief video whose subtweeted message was unmistakable it recognized the suffering of those who had lost family members or economic prospects or hope itself it emphasized the all of us rather than the us and them response to national crisis and it appealed to the generous rather than the resentful in human nature in short it was the kind of message that leaders of any nation have been expected to transmit as part of their duty in time of national hardship and it highlighted by contrast the signals of empathy and simple kindness that donald trump himself had never managed to convey or even feign i have been as harsh as anyone on george w bush s responsibility in his time in office for america s foreign policy and economic travails for more see this this this and this but it would be wrong not to recognize the way he was trying 11 years after leaving office to express the thoughts a nation expects from its leaders the video raised a further possibility and question for this former president what will he say as the next election draws near the three other living former presidents jimmy carter bill clinton and barack obama are all democrats so for them there will be no conflict between policy goals and party loyalty all will of course try to help joe biden beat donald trump in the 2016 election the extended bush family made no secret of its distaste for donald trump who had after all ridiculed low energy jeb bush in the primaries this new video suggests that george w bush s estimation of trump has not gone up for the record two years ago during the brett kavanaugh confirmation fight bush did his best to persuade republican senators to stick with kavanaugh who had been a white house staffer for bush but would a former republican president dare go public with a plea to save the country and what he thinks of as his party s principles by voting for the opposition the logic of this video suggests that bush should could he actually do so i m not holding my breath but bush loyalists should be raising the question with him 2 a great success story this past wednesday donald trump s son in law jared kushner went on the first family s favorite tv program fox and friends he told the hosts that the federal government rose to the challenge and this is a great success story you can listen to him yourself starting 9 00 minutes into this clip the day before kushner spoke the confirmed u s death toll from the pandemic exceeded the 58 000 plus u s fatalities inscribed on the vietnam veterans memorial the famous black granite wall in washington since then they have increased by about 2 000 per day it is conceivable that selected parts of the federal response will eventually be seen as successes though overall they appear to be catastrophic now it is inconceivable that a favored in law s cheery declaration of a great success story as tens of millions of people are losing their jobs and tens of thousands have lost their lives will stand up well 3 i will never lie to you i noted last month that the new white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany differed from her immediate predecessor in planning to hold press briefings at all but she differed from past administrations press secretaries in that her history as a public figure was entirely in the role of cable news partisan advocate at her first press briefing this past week she told the assembled reporters i will never lie to you you have my pledge on that you see her saying so 8 minutes into this c span video then she proceeded to lie on matters ranging from the mueller investigation to the prosecution of michael flynn to the history of sexual assault allegations against donald trump to a range of others dan froomkin set out the details in salon and annie karni did so in the new york times my earlier argument was the best press secretaries have recognized the fundamental torment of the job the good ones are torn day by day between their assignment to put the best face on the administration s policies and their desire to stick as close as possible to the truth like trump himself kayleigh mcenany seemed in her debut to be unconflicted her duty is only to the administration 4 the plague should never have happened back in march i noted donald trump s penchant for projection that is attacking others for the failings that seem most evident in himself bear that in mind in considering trump s comments at a white house event this past week and comparing them with the verdict likely to be rendered upon his administration trump said as shown in this c span video this plague should have never happened it could have been stopped but people chose not to stop it and it s a very sad thing for the world indeed on the day when the access hollywood tape came out one month before the 2016 election i wrote a trump time capsule item whose first paragraph in its entirety was good god that tape of course was the one on which a vintage 2005 donald trump was recorded in his always recognizable voice saying that when you re a star they let you do it you can do anything leading up of course to grab em by the pussy you can do anything then as captured on tape trump swallowed some tic tacs stepped off a bus and smilingly greeted and embraced the female tv host he had been ogling and talking about while aboard the bus good god because personal crudeness of this scale was far beyond revelations that had stopped pre trump political campaigns edmund muskie early in 1972 thomas eagleton later in 1972 gary hart in 1988 howard dean in 2004 i won t go into details but by the standard of grab em by these previous political storms would qualify as minor showers actually i encourage you to look into the possibility that the embarrassments that stopped gary hart s campaign in 1988 could have been the result of a political setup as i wrote in 2018 but of course trump s campaign was not derailed by this or anything else recall what happened next what s the connection to current events these past few days have been another good god moment even by the standards of the past few years at his multi hour rally briefing on thursday evening trump speculated that heavy external or internal exposure to ultraviolet light or perhaps drinking or injecting disinfectants could be a solution to the virus because trump later falsely claimed that he had been quoted out of context or had just been joking it s important to observe what he looked and sounded like when saying these preposterous things starting at time 26 00 of this c span video you can see that he was in dead earnest and acting as if he was offering a great insight which had escaped the detail minded professionals when he said the following words here s a question that some of you the press are probably thinking of if you re totally into that world of science which i find to be very interesting supposing we hit the body with a tremendous whether it s ultraviolet or just very powerful light supposing you brought the light inside the body sic either through the skin or some other way and then i see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute one minute and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs so it would be interesting to check that while trump was saying these words one of his scientific advisers dr deborah birx was captured on film as her face went ashen at the idiocy of his comments but she was then called to the microphone and as she has done several times before she pointedly avoided saying that trump s comments were not just ignorant but actively dangerous especially if anyone was considering drinking disinfectant as noted earlier her medical colleague anthony fauci has continued to pull off the remarkable and public spirited trick of maintaining his long earned reputation for honesty while retaining a position in trump s retinue fauci is unique in that status everyone else who has entered trump s service has fallen into the pit of reputational destruction the next day trump claimed that he was being sarcastic and only joking with the comments this is his standard last line of defense when caught in a particularly egregious statement for instance he says his public call on russia to release hillary clinton s emails had just been a joke that excuse was a lie and anyone who saw the disinfectant video knows he is lying about this now almost immediately the manufacturers of lysol and other disinfectants along with numerous public health agencies put out statements warning against drinking these products reporters from the washington post quoted dara kass of columbia university medical center on the difference between this and trump s previous now discredited advice that people start taking a certain kind of pill the difference between this and the chloroquine pills is that somebody could go right away to their pantry and start swallowing bleach they could go to their medicine cabinet and swallow isopropyl alcohol kass said a lot of people have that in their homes there s an immediate opportunity to react kass explained to the post that people who ingest such chemicals often die and those who survive usually end up with feeding tubes because their mouth and esophagus were eroded by the cleaning agents it s horrific she said and of the 53 republicans who make up mitch mcconnell s senate majority how many have spoken up to criticize the president on the specifics of this new plan or on what the comments reveal about his approach to reality in general or to warn the public against his advice as best i can determine two days after trump s comments that number is zero this is the vichy republican bargain they made after the access hollywood tapes it is the bargain that keeps an obviously unwell man in power now it is the bargain for which they should be remembered on friday april 17 yesterday as i write donald trump sent out three tweets that were unusual even for him they followed angry protests by groups objecting to the shut down orders in several states news photos showed many of the protesters wearing trump hats many carrying weapons and some with confederate flags why is this spate of tweeting notable as so often with trump because of its mere existence of course there have been clashes between federal and state policies through u s history in post world war ii america the clearest cases are from the civil rights era for instance in 1957 dwight eisenhower ordered troops from the 101st airborne to little rock arkansas to overcome resistance to school integration orders led by the governor orval faubus in the 1960s both john kennedy and lyndon johnson directed federal efforts to enforce civil rights orders in mississippi and elsewhere in the south but these were efforts to bring local practice into accord with nationwide policy trump was doing the reverse implicitly encouraging local resistance to the very strategies his administration is recommending for the country as a whole nothing like this has happened since at least the time of reconstruction and probably not since before the civil war because of its partisanship in a time of national emergency one state that moved even earlier toward shutdowns than michigan minnesota or virginia was ohio and in ohio as in the other three states there were angry open things up protests at the state capital this week but the governor of ohio mike dewine is a republican while the governors of the other three states are all democrats gretchen whitmer in michigan tim walz in minnesota and ralph northam in virginia also all six u s senators from these states are democrats so at a time when his own white house task force has been trying to work with governors of both parties trump was notably singling out opposition governors also as reported in the new york times and the guardian many of the protests were planned and financed by partisan conservative organizations because of the sharpness of the reaction a few hours before the statement from chris murphy above new york s governor andrew cuomo gave an extended mocking retort to trump at his daily briefing yesterday you can see it on this c span video starting at around time 1 05 thank you mr president cuomo said recounting how often trump had asked governors for their support thank you for doing your job and he was just getting started as you can see through these past weeks of pandemic crisis cuomo and other governors have been notably collegial and respectful toward trump and his administration in their public presentations like other leaders during other crises they set aside for the time being their personal and partisan differences but yesterday it was no more mister nice guy from cuomo all this during the week when total u s deaths from the coronavirus crossed the 35 000 line and for the first time in u s history every state in the nation was officially subject to a federal major disaster declaration in a rally briefing lasting more than two hours this past monday afternoon donald trump issued a royalist view of executive power not once but several times which is of course his tendency with any point he wants to make you can see one of the clearest instances in this c span video starting around time 46 40 trump is asked what he would do if he decided to open up the economy but state governors didn t agree what would be his authority in that case when you say my authority it s the president s authority it s not me when somebody is the president of the united states the authority is total and that s the way it s gotta be it s total several things were remarkable about this statement i note this claim for the long term record an american president asserted his absolute executive authority from a white house podium with virtually no resistance from america s conservative party bullet style more items for the record there is so much unprecedented behavior nonstop the people now enabling trump will someday claim that no one really knew what was happening at the time but they know part of the point of this chronicle like its 2016 predecessor is to set out a record of what is known while it s going on they know they re just looking the other way this week donald trump announced the departure of a press secretary who differed from all predecessors in a basic way she didn t do the job in more than eight months in office this press secretary stephanie grisham appeared frequently on fox programs but never once held a white house briefing for reporters three of her predecessors in the trump era sean spicer anthony scaramucci and sarah huckabee sanders appeared often enough in the white house press room for their briefing styles to become the basis for saturday night live cold open routines this was before sanders suspended briefings in her final months on the job grisham s briefings couldn t be mimicked because they didn t occur her successor will also be someone who differs from anyone who has held the job before the new secretary kayleigh mcenany will be the first press secretary to begin the job with a bone dry reservoir of trust and goodwill from the press through the modern history of this job which probably begins with steve early spokesman for franklin delano roosevelt through most of his long years in office press secretaries have been in an impossible situation they need to be discreet enough about an administration s internal dealings that the president will still trust them but they also need to be open enough that reporters will still think the press secretary is trying to get them closer to rather than farther away from the truth they need to speak the truth to maintain trust and respect from the press but not the full truth not every single detail they know to maintain trust from the president and other officials finding the right position is a day by day struggle if a president can t trust a press secretary to keep some things quiet then the secretary will be left in the dark away from the white house inner circle then if the reporters realize that a press secretary is an outsider his or her influence practically vanishes but if reporters find out later on that a secretary was withholding information that could have been shared or worse sending false signals then the damage to the press secretary is even worse in the days before trump awareness of this struggle is what distinguished the best press secretaries some of them come straight from jobs on the other side of the press politics divide for instance jay carney went from time magazine to become an obama press secretary ron nessen was an nbc news correspondent and then worked for gerald ford some are longtime aides and confidants of a president jody powell a young campaign staffer represented jimmy carter as press secretary and bill moyers played a similar role with lyndon johnson some are public affairs professionals who have done this job in other circumstances for instance dana perino who became press secretary at the end of george w bush s time in office or marlin fitzwater who worked for ronald reagan and the first george bush they came from different backgrounds but all these previous press secretaries tried to strike the balance between giving out too much information and not enough under donald trump only one press secretary seemed even to recognize this challenge from day one the unfortunate sean spicer was stuck trying to defend largest inaugural crowd in history claims spicer s awareness of his preposterous position was the most appealing thing about his brief time on the briefing room podium with sarah huckabee sanders the struggle abated since her remarks were aimed at a one person audience trump himself stephanie grisham avoided the tension by not dealing with the press at all and confining herself to fox kayleigh mcenany is one more step down this road since her background as a public figure was as a cable tv panelist during the 2016 campaign where her role was not to express a conservative or even gop loyalist perspective but instead to defend whatever it was that donald trump had done or said as caleb ecarma pointed out this week in vanity fair mcenany like her press bashing boss has taken every opportunity to attack the news media the media s best hope is for donald trump to suspend his rallies she said they have been wanting him to stop this they know it s his avenue to speak directly to the american people so we re going to follow the president s lead we re not going to cave to the media and joe biden there appears to be nowhere mcenany isn t willing to follow trump even dating back to his conspiracies about barack obama s place of birth in 2012 when trump was accusing america s first black president of being born in kenya and was thus ineligible to serve mcenany chimed in support of the unfounded theory tweeting how i met your brother never mind forgot he s still in that hut in kenya obamatvshows in a 2016 cnn segment archived by media matters mcenany stepped out to defend the then candidate s infamous grab em by the pussy hot mic moment shrugging off the remark as implie d consent jf note i wrote about the grab em episode at the time here every press secretary has ups and downs in his or her relationship with the media they add to their store of trust in certain moments they run it down at others the struggle between duties to the president and to the public between saying too much and saying too little defined the job now the struggle is over no previous press secretary has started the job with no cushion of credibility whatsoever that s where this one begins for the record here are several events of the past few days any one of which would have been week defining news in previous eras on tuesday mr trump was asked in a typically tendentious question why he had compared the coronavirus to the flu instead of saying he had been hoping for the best but was wrong when he d said that he got into a fight over the severity of the flu this sort of exchange usually devolves into a useless squabble that helps mr trump s critics and contributes little to public understanding the president s outbursts against his political critics are also notably off key at this moment this isn t impeachment and covid 19 isn t shifty schiff it s a once a century threat to american life and livelihood in his rally briefing yesterday at the white house donald trump announced that the centers for disease control and prevention was recommending that americans wear masks or similar face coverings when in range of other people you can see c span s coverage of the whole briefing here including trump s repeated emphases that this was a voluntary recommendation you don t have to do it and that he personally would not comply important fact note trump unlike virtually all other americans is exposed only to people who have already been tested for the virus as reported here by npr around time 3 50 in this clip he says i don t think i m going to be doing it then more definitively this is voluntary you don t have to do it i am choosing not to do it this is not the first time presidents have been called upon to deliver public health messages nor even the first time during a presidential election year in the fall of 1976 gerald ford who had never been elected either president or vice president but who became president two years earlier when richard nixon resigned was in a close race for reelection he ultimately lost very narrowly to the former one term governor of georgia jimmy carter for the record i was a speechwriter on carter s campaign staff then the race became close enough that practically every controversial stand that ford took could arguably have made a difference in the outcome among the issues that fall was swine flu starting early in that election year public health officials had been worrying that the newly mutated virus could reach pandemic proportions and become a modern counterpart to the deadly flu of 1918 they launched an all out effort to produce a vaccine and to get as many americans as possible inoculated the story is long and tangled both in scientific and in political terms you can read fascinating accounts of what health officials got right and wrong in the 1970s swine flu era here and here with links to other reports one central issue was that the vaccine available by the fall of the year was a live virus version rather than killed virus which entailed a greater though statistically still small chance of side effects for the moment the relevant point is the country s political leadership was asking the public to take a controversial step namely getting swine flu shots and the ultimate political leader gerald ford himself as president prominently set an example by doing this himself thus the photo you see above the obligation to model the behavior they would like others to adopt is one all presidents have been aware of even if they have imperfectly complied they talk about faith and most of them have gone to religious services they say that citizens should pay taxes and they produce evidence that they have done so themselves they urge people to be charitable and they know that their own donations will be scrutinized they talk about families and they are photographed with their spouse and children no matter what they re doing when photographers aren t there some part of their brains recognizes the value of connecting with what we as a government say with what i as a person do and they make sure the public sees evidence of them setting this example as barack obama did during the h1n1 flu wave of 2009 trump s reaction to the mask wearing recommendation fine for the rest of you but that s not for me is of course far from the only illustration of his feeling that he need not set a personal example see also military or civic service marital fidelity scrupulousness about the appearance of financial conflict or family favoritism recognition of no person is above the law etc it is also not the most unreasonable stand he has taken as npr noted everyone he meets is tested for the disease so he is not likely to catch it from any of them and they will be monitored after contact with him and as trump himself pointed out yesterday the oval office is not a surgical operating room and masks would seem odder there than in some other venues but gerald ford also had reasons not to follow the advice he was giving the country he could have said i m extremely busy i m in the middle of an intense reelection campaign i have great medical care around me if i should get sick i am thinking about the reception gerald ford would have met if he had said i want all americans to be inoculated i am just choosing not to do it myself the episode i m about to mention has been receiving saturation social media attention for the past few hours as i write but because the accelerating torrent of news tends to blast away each day s events and make them hard to register even a moment like this which i expect will be included in histories of our times i think it is worth noting this episode while it is fresh until a few days ago brett crozier would have been considered among the u s navy s most distinguished commanders he graduated from the naval academy in 1992 and then entered training as a naval aviator he was qualified first as a helicopter pilot and then in the navy s f a 18 fighter planes he was deployed aboard the aircraft carrier nimitz during the iraq war and he held an ascending series of staff and command jobs as you can read in his pentagon biography here he received a master s degree from the naval war college he became executive officer second in command of the nuclear powered carrier ronald reagan and he became commander of the amphibious ship blue ridge then late last year as a navy captain he took command of the nimitz class nuclear carrier uss theodore roosevelt and the 4 000 plus people in its crew last week coronavirus sickness spread rapidly among the roosevelt s crew members five days ago on sunday matthias gafni and joe garofoli of the san francisco chronicle published an email by crozier addressed to his naval superiors asking that the ship be diverted from its normal duties so that sick crew members could be treated and the spread of disease could be slowed gafni and garofoli did not say how they had received the email but it had been copied to a large number of recipients and not marked as sensitive crozier must have known it was likely to become public when he sent it the four page letter which you can read in full at the chronicle s site used the example of recent cruise ship infection disasters to argue that closed shipboard environments were the worst possible location for people with the disease it laid out the case for immediate action to protect the roosevelt s crew and ended this way 7 conclusion decisive action is required removing the majority of personnel from a deployed us nuclear aircraft carrier and isolating them for two weeks may seem like an extraordinary measure a portion of the crew approximately 10 would have to stay aboard to run the reactor plant sanitize the ship ensure security and provide for contingency response to emergencies this is a necessary risk it will enable the carrier and air wing to get back underway as quickly as possible while ensuring the health and safety of our sailors keeping over 4 000 young men and women on board the tr is an unnecessary risk and breaks faith with those sailors entrusted to our care this will require a political solution but it is the right thing to do we are not at war sailors do not need to die if we do not act now we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset our sailors request all available resources to find navadmin and cdc compliant quarantine rooms for my entire crew as soon as possible breaks faith with those sailors entrusted to our care we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset our sailors unnecessary risk in any walk of life such language would have great power within the military where terms like faith and trust and care have life and death meaning and are the fundamental reason people follow leaders into combat these words draw the starkest possible line this course is right the other course is wrong thus a leader spoke on behalf of the people entrusted to our care the letter got widespread attention in the press and became a pr problem for the pentagon and the administration a commander was in effect saying that the command structure was mis serving the troops the command structure was not amused brett crozier will no longer be one of the navy s most powerful commanders he remains in the service but his command has been taken away he will likely be remembered among its leaders at his rally press conference this evening march 29 donald trump effectively said that doctors and hospitals in new york are selling masks out the back door accounting for current shortages you can see it for yourself here on this c span video starting at time 12 00 trump notes the shortage of masks and says something s going on and you ought to look at it as reporters where are the masks going are they going out the back door through his public career trump has been notable for his projection in the psychologists sense of that term what he is aware of in himself is what he claims to detect in others for instance he has a long history of making up sources his posing as john miller in leaks to new york reporters back in his real estate days and in his lots of people are saying stories thus he accuses reporters of doing the same his own children are dealt into his business arrangements thus this is his point of attack against joe biden and his son hunter s dealings in ukraine if you asked most americans why emergency rooms and icus might be running short of masks the last possibility they would think of is that the masks were going out the back door we are talking about doctors nurses and medical staff working around the clock in increasingly difficult circumstances we are talking about hospital administrators now thinking about beds ventilators space in temporary morgues all of these health staffers are coping with sick and dying people while wondering when they themselves might get the disease it had not even occurred to me that people like these might be skimming off masks and selling them but this is what occurred to donald trump projection it s something he might have thought of himself this afternoon trump put out a tweet that rivaled out the back door in its bottomless lack of empathy he said trump is a problem but clearly he cannot help himself no one who could talk about his personal ratings when the public was dealing with economic collapse and mounting deaths would do this if he had any sense of empathy decency or impulse control the 53 republicans who control the senate could do something on the country s behalf but the number who have spoken up about trump s descent these past few days zero as far as i can tell just before the 2016 election and then again after its results became clear i did a series of atlantic items on a challenge i thought the press was not prepared for the challenge was dealing with a major political figure donald trump who fit no previous pattern of how presidents or other major figures conceived of truth versus lies all politicians like all people will lie about matters large and small but most politicians like most people usually lie for a reason they want to avoid blame or embarrassment they want someone to like or treat them better they want to paint themselves in a better light they ve talked themselves into believing a more comfortable version of perhaps painful truths we all know examples from daily life in the life of public figures it means things like richard nixon lying about watergate in hopes of not getting caught bill clinton lying about his affairs ditto lyndon johnson concealing what he knew about the worsening situation in vietnam so as not to complicate his re election chances fdr concealing his physical limitations so as not to have them complicate his political and policy goals so in dealing with the political universe as of the summer of 2015 the time when donald trump entered the presidential race the press could start by asking what s the reason a certain statement might be a lie what would a president a mayor a senator have to gain by shading the truth the related assumption was that people wouldn t go to the trouble of crafting a lie without a reason to do so lies are harder to remember than the truth they involve more work in getting people to back up your story they involve the risk that you ll be caught what made donald trump different was not how much more frequently he lies though he does so at a prodigious rate as daniel dale and the washington post s fact check team among others have tirelessly chronicled rather the difference was that trump so plainly recognized no distinction between true and false between what the facts showed and what he wanted them to be between what he wanted people to think and what they could see for themselves some public figures are unusually willing to lie trump seemed not even to notice he was doing so the philosopher harry frankfurt s famous book on bullshit bears on this phenomenon people who just talk in a slurry of true and false with no concern or even awareness of the difference between the two in trump s case it became clear long ago that he lacked the mental filter that alerts most people to the boundary between true and false he would probably sail through any lie detector test he does not care if his claim can be instantly disproved eg his landslide victory actually one of the narrowest in history he does not care if his lies contradict one another as when he attributes the same someone told me story to different sources from one day to the next or rolls out his ludicrous sir anecdotes he does not care if a lie does him any good who believes or cares whether his uncle was a great super genius as a professor at mit he does not care that the adonis like heroic portrait that has hung for years at mar a lago would be a source of mirth for most viewers the news media are not built for someone like this i wrote two months before trump was sworn in we have as president elect a man whose nature as a liar is outside what our institutions are designed to deal with donald trump either cannot tell the difference between truth and lies or he knows the difference but does not care our journalistic and political assumption is that each side to a debate will try to tell the truth and will count it as a setback if they re caught making things up until now the idea has been that if you can show a contrast between words and actions claim and reality it may not bring the politician down but it will hurt for instance bill clinton survived i did not have sexual relations with that woman but he was damaged then and lastingly when the truth came out knowledge of the risks of being caught has encouraged most politicians to minimize provable lies none of this works with donald trump he doesn t care and at least so far the institutional gop hasn t either in that item a reflexive liar in command and then a follow up dealing with trump s lies i set out press guidelines for the time ahead the first one was 1 call out lies as lies not controversies in covering trump s latest illegal voting outburst that millions of people had snuck into the polling places and voted presumably for democrats the washington post and the la times took the lead in clearly labeling the claim as false rather than controversial or unsubstantiated by contrast the nyt takes a more objective tone there s no evidence for trump s claim much as there was no evidence for his assertion that ted cruz s dad played a part in the jfk assassination what s the difference the nyt said that the claim had no evidence the post said it was false the times s is more conventional but it is also normalizing in suggesting that trump actually cared whether there was evidence for what he said i think the post s is closer to calling things what they are it s nearly three and a half years later everything we saw about trump on the campaign trail we have seen from him in the white house including the limitless fantasy lying i submit that these three and a half years later much of the press has still not rebuilt itself to cope with a time or a person like this or with a political party like the subservient trump era gop to choose only a small subset of examples from only the past three days worth of history here are some illustrations these are words and deeds that each on its own would likely have been major black mark news events in other eras now they are just part of the daily onrush 1 us and them two days ago on march 27 donald trump signed in the oval office the most expensive spending bill in american history getting it enacted required sustained major efforts from nancy pelosi the democratic speaker of the house and from chuck schumer the senate minority leader who got every one of his fellow democrats to vote for the bill after lyndon johnson relied on republican support to get his civil rights and medicare legislation through the congress he made sure that the republican leaders from the house and senate were with him for the signing ceremonies to receive some of the first pens he used when barack obama signed the affordable care act in the oval office he had only democratic legislators around him but that was because of near unanimous republican opposition to the bill structurally trump s situation this week was like lbj s he was signing a bill the other party had played a crucial role in passing but when trump signed the bill yesterday not a single democratic legislator was present pelosi said she had not been invited every other president has tried at some point to expand his support beyond those who originally voted for him which is why all others have at some point had popularity ratings of 60 percent or 70 percent every other one has at some point tried to express the interests of the entire public not just the base trump has never done either and that failure is so baked in that it barely registers now obama used precious months in his first year trying to get gop support for his medical plan he failed and a running press critique thereafter was that he should have been doing more to reach out to the other side recall the whole have a drink with mitch mcconnell motif i haven t seen any columns fretting about trump s failure to reach out to pelosi or schumer that s just trump 2 if they don t treat you right i don t call in this past friday s version of his marathon tv sessions the supposed health briefings that have become daily hour long substitutes for trump s campaign rallies trump said that most of the governors now requesting federal aid were friendly to him but not all and the ones who weren t appreciative had better watch their step trump was asked what he meant about being appreciative his answer as you can see starting at time 24 00 of this c span video q you say the governors are not appreciate of what the federal government has done what more a breaking in i think the governor of washington jay inslee is a failed presidential candidate he leveled out at zero in the polls he s constantly tripping and i guess complaining would be a nice way of saying it in michigan all she does is she has no idea what s going on all she does is saying whining voice oh it s the federal government s fault i want them to be appreciative we ve done a great job mike pence i don t think he sleeps any more he calls all the governors i tell him i m a different kind of guy i tell him don t call the governor of washington you re wasting your time with him don t call the woman in michigan you know what i say if they don t treat you right i don t call what would have made news about this passage in any other era there was some brief press followup on all these points but mainly it was again normalized as trump being trump 3 lies lies lies i ll leave to the other chroniclers a complete list of the several dozen lies in trump s live broadcast appearances in the past few days on thursday he went on at length about the bounty of tariff payments that the u s was receiving from china which revealed either a black is white misunderstanding of how tariffs work or a harry frankfurt style indifference to the bullshit of what he was saying none of the white house reporters challenged him about his tariff claim here is just one consequential lie to stand for the rest trump repeatedly claims and has done so every day this past week that no one possibly could have seen this pandemic coming and that everything was great until just a few weeks ago of the countless reasons to know this is false consider this politico story on the detailed 69 page playbook the national security council had prepared for coping with just this kind of emergency the exact timing origin and biology of this new disease of course came as surprises but the consequences and choices are ones any competent government would have foreseen just a month before the 9 11 attacks in which more than 3 000 people were killed george w bush received a memo famously titled bin laden determined to strike in u s many years later press analyses still pointed this out for years after the attack on a u s consulate in benghazi in which four americans died congressional republicans held several dozen hearings to determine whether the obama administration should have been more prepared in the past few days papers i see no followup on this nsc report press standards for covering trump have already factored in and thus implicitly forgiven the corruption and incompetence 4 repeating the mistakes of 2015 starting in the summer of 2015 cable channels began running live trump rallies because they were so interesting people watched ratings went up and by election day trump had received billions of dollars worth of free airtime one calculation of the value was 5 billion another 2 billion in either case a lot without this coverage this decision by tv outlets to improve their ratings by giving limitless free live airtime to trump he could never have become the republican nominee let alone the president trump himself clearly views the briefings about the virus really rallies about his greatness as this year s substitute for the live rallies he can no longer hold but the cable and broadcast outlets as if 2015 and 2016 had never occurred are covering his daily briefings as they did the rallies of days gone by for more on why this is a mistake please see this suggestion from jay rosen of pressthink about how the media could shift to emergency setting and this from the washington post s erik wemple on the problem of nonstop live coverage of trump telling lies the media were not built for someone like this that someone has not changed the media must change update as confirmation of the bottomless amorality of trump s view of his duties he tweeted this message this afternoon as infection rates and death tolls soared across the country in the second of his two extended live tv performances yesterday a white house coronavirus update following a fox news virtual town hall donald trump said that prospects in the effort to control the virus were improving as you can see starting at time 2 30 of this c span video he said i m very proud to be your president i can tell you that there s tremendous hope as we look forward and see light at the end of the tunnel most of today s living americans were born in 1980 or afterward the median age in the u s is now just over 38 most of them would not instantly recognize the phrase light at the end of the tunnel but donald trump was born in 1946 and he would know this phrase during his teenaged years and his early 20s when hundreds of thousands of his contemporaries were being drafted for service in vietnam and when more than 50 000 of them were killed those words were among the most infamous parts of the american lexicon like it became necessary to destroy the town in order to save it a possibly apocryphal phrase attributed to a u s military officer about the scorched earth policy light at the end of the tunnel came to symbolize the sustained folly of the war in general and the illusion that success was near at hand the closest post vietnam examples would probably be early proclamations about the iraq war dick cheney s pre war assurance that we will in fact be greeted as liberators and george w bush s triumphal appearance under a mission accomplished banner shortly after the fall of baghdad or early in the disaster of hurricane katrina brownie you re doing a heck of a job among pre vietnam examples a counterpart might be neville chamberlain in 1938 shaking hands with adolf hitler in munich and then returning home to declare that they had ensured peace for our time during and after the vietnam war light at the end of the tunnel became so familiar and polarizing that one of the most publicized libel suits of the era in which four star general william westmoreland sued cbs news for 120 million centered on these very words as the new york times reported during the trial in 1984 gen william c westmoreland and a lawyer for cbs argued yesterday over one of the most memorable phrases of the vietnam war with the lawyer suggesting that the general had misled washington into believing there was light at the end of tunnel in 1967 and the general saying he had not used that expression i never had quite that degree of optimism general westmoreland told the jury at his libel trial against cbs in federal court in manhattan but the lawyer david boies showed the witness a nov 26 1967 cable he had sent during a visit to washington to his deputy in saigon gen creighton w abrams in which the phrase some light at the end of the tunnel was bracketed in quotation marks people of my parents generation would hesitate or catch themselves before peace for our time news conscious people of my children s generation would recognize the freight that comes with saying mission accomplished or heck of a job and people of trump s generation and mine would recognize that light at the end of the tunnel is not what you would say if you wanted to convey genuine confidence any more than you would say i am not a crook if you wanted to convey genuine innocence you cannot have been alive in that time and not have absorbed this phrase the typically young members of a white house speechwriting staff the people who worked on the script from which trump read yesterday would not know this phrase from their own experience but in normal white houses they would have looked these things up when i worked in my 20s on a white house speechwriting staff our spare time reading was from the volumes of past presidential addresses but trump himself would have to have been familiar with this phrase so yesterday as he saw the note cards did he see the phrase and not remember it did he remember and not care i don t know and it doesn t make a difference in his response to the current pandemic but it is one more illustration of things we have heard and seen which we would never have seen before two other for the record elements from trump s public performances yesterday that was a flu where if you got it you had a 50 50 chance or very close of dying in fact the mortality rate during that devastating worldwide illness was between 2 and 3 percent not around 50 percent as trump claimed most of the experts around trump knew better none of them said anything i can t quickly think of a case of another president making such a wildly inaccurate basic fact claim without a quick for the record the president meant to say cleanup this year s easter day is april 12 or 19 days after trump s announcement as of yesterday afternoon while trump was talking about the easter timeline the official confirmed case count for the united states was nearing 47 000 and the death toll was in the low 600s i ll note in this space where the numbers stand 19 days from now being president is even harder than it looks success in the job requires a wider range of talents than any one human being has ever had private persuasive and horse trading skills public ability to inspire the analytical capacity to grasp decisions that lack any good answer the emotional capacity to read the moods and needs of the country as those change physical stamina psychological balance a ruthless ability to judge character especially among allies and staff members a similarly steely ability to block out bitter and hurtful criticism otherwise you couldn t function without becoming deaf to warnings of genuine problems and that s just the start of the list as i noted in a piece about barack obama as he neared the end of his first term these demands of office are so many so different and so complex that the question is not whether a given president will fail in office all of them will fall short in some parts of the job the relevant question is whether the areas of each president s inevitable failures will matter more or less than those of his success john dickerson went into the ramifications of the hardest job in the world in a big atlantic story two years ago update dickerson did an eloquent brief segment on the requirements of presidential leadership in crisis on face the nation yesterday because this job is impossible people who hold it go through a predictable change of attitude toward their living predecessors on arrival new presidents usually think look at me i ve won the biggest prize in public life i don t know why these other guys messed things up so badly let me show them how it s done the years go on the problems mount congress is a headache the public can t be pleased predictably presidents develop strange new respect for the only other human beings who understand what they are going through usually when running for the office presidential candidates criticize those who came before directly if mounting a challenge or indirectly in suggesting how much better things will be under new management but after a president has been roughed up for a while he s more careful in his criticism really it s hard to find on the record examples of many of the first 44 presidents criticizing their predecessors sometimes in public more often in private presidents go to those who have left office to ask what do you think or can you help us out this reality was the premise of a question an hour into donald trump s very long press appearance yesterday afternoon in the exchange which you can see starting at time 59 00 of this video a reporter asked trump in previous crises like the tsunami and katrina past presidents have called their predecessors and said hey i need you to step in and do something like that do you have any interest in reaching out to presidents bush clinton obama carter before he finished the question trump was talking over him to challenge the premise trump answered look i have the best people in the world i think we re doing an extraordinary job if you look at the h1n1 under obama if you look at that whole that was a disaster that was a tough period of time for our country you look at so many other things that weren t handled very well whether it s katrina under gw bush or something else look i respect everybody but i feel i have an incredible team and i think we re doing an incredible job i don t want to disturb them bother them i don t think i m going to learn much what this reveals about donald trump s self regard and dunning krugerism is too obvious to need elaboration also his intolerance for even imagined criticism and his instinct to respond with an attack in this case the question invited him to step into the long tradition of presidents facing crisis instead he used it not only to elevate himself but also to diminish the others so many things that weren t handled very well others presidents likely thought such things to themselves especially early in a term but they would not have said them on nationwide tv during a crisis when supposedly trying to inspire unite and heal two other remarkable events of the day again many public leaders might have thought this of their rivals no others would have said it out loud the atlantic s peter nicholas had an interview with fauci yesterday morning in which he said that the administration had not pressured him to be more visibly supportive i m not sure why later in the day jon cohen of science published an interview unlike any i have read from a figure who was still serving within trump s orbit a sample q you re standing there saying nobody should gather with more than 10 people and there are almost 10 people with you on the stage a i know that i m trying my best i cannot do the impossible q what about the travel restrictions it just doesn t comport with facts a i know but what do you want me to do i mean seriously jon let s get real what do you want me to do what i want as of today march 23 is for him to stay there as long as he can these things were notable about yesterday s installment of what has become the regular daily white house briefing on the coronavirus pandemic update as i write i see that jay rosen at his press think blog has come to the same conclusion about live event coverage his item covers many other steps in what he calls emergency mode handling of trump but on live events he says switching to emergency mode means our coverage will look different and work in a different way as we try to prevent the president from misinforming you through us we will not cover live any speech rally or press conference involving the president the risk of passing along bad information is too great instead we will attend carefully to what he says if we can independently verify any important news he announces we will bring that to you after the verification step i agree with that and with rosen s conclusion addressed to readers we feel we cannot keep telling wild and newsy stories about the unreliable narrator who somehow became president not with millions of lives at stake we have to exit from that system to keep faith with you and with the reason we became journalists in the first place why don t the president s supporters hold him to their own standard of masculinity so many mysteries surround donald trump the contents of his tax returns the apparent miracle of his graduation from college some of them are merely curiosities others are of national importance such as whether he understood the nuclear weapons briefing given to every president i prefer not to dwell on this question but since his first day as a presidential candidate i have been baffled by one mystery in particular why do working class white men the most reliable component of donald trump s base support someone who is by their own standards the least masculine man ever to hold the modern presidency the question is not whether trump fails to meet some archaic or idealized version of masculinity the president s inability to measure up to marcus aurelius or omar bradley is not the issue rather the question is why so many of trump s working class white male voters refuse to hold trump to their own standards of masculinity why they support a man who behaves more like a little boy we will need a comprehensive strategy to reduce the sort of interactions that can lead to more infections updated at 12 08 a m et on may 26 2020 covid 19 has mounted a sustained attack on public life especially indoor life many of the largest super spreader events took place inside at a church in south korea an auditorium in france a conference in massachusetts the danger of the

we the restaurant workers stay on the other safely preparing your order so i stepped outside to ask our would be patron who was old enough to be my grandmother if she might refrain from crawling over
