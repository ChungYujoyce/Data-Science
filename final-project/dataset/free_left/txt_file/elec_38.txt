your inbox sign up here with breannedeppisch and joanie greve the big idea tuesday was the best day for democrats politically since barack obama won reelection in 2012 remember conservatives scored significant victories in the november 2014 2015 and 2016 elections democrats desperately needed some wins after they went all in on a house special election in georgia this spring and lost last night they got them voters came out in droves they braved the rain and the cold to send a message to president trump the results across the country represent nothing less than a stinging repudiation of trump on the first anniversary of his election democrat ralph northam was elected governor of virginia tuesday by an unexpectedly large margin of nine percentage points he won more votes than any previous candidate for virginia governor republican ed gillespie could not escape trump s unpopularity despite his best efforts to thread the needle four in 10 virginia voters yesterday approved of the job that the president is doing according to preliminary exit polls gillespie received over 9 in 10 votes from trump approvers but among the larger group of trump disapprovers northam had nearly as large an advantage 87 percent trump s impact on the race was also clear from other questions in the exit polling 34 percent of voters said expressing opposition to trump was a reason for their vote with almost all of this group favoring northam per our in house pollster scott clement half as many 17 percent sought to express support for the president while 47 percent said trump was not a factor in their choice women made the difference white women with college degrees a group that split evenly in the 2013 virginia governor s election favored northam by 16 points over gillespie in preliminary exit polling 58 percent to 42 percent northam s margin is more than twice as wide as the margin hillary clinton won those voters by last year 50 percent to 44 percent married women voted for northam by 10 points according to preliminary exit polls 54 percent to 44 percent in the 2016 presidential election trump eked out a one point lead with this group 48 percent to 47 percent married women consisted of 30 percent of virginia voters this year about the same share as in 2016 and 2014 check out our interactive exit poll graphic here rep scott taylor a republican who represents virginia beach said both democrats and republicans registered their disenchantment with trump i don t know how you get around that this wasn t a referendum on the administration i just don t he told reporters some of the very divisive rhetoric really prompted and helped usher in a really high democratic turnout in virginia ed couldn t escape being a proxy for trump which killed him added tom davis the former gop congressman who represented northern virginia it s a huge drag on the ticket he told paul schwartzman it motivated the democratic base democrats came out en masse in protest this was their first chance to mobilize the base the lesson here is that republicans have to get their act together ed did as well as he could do with the hand he was dealt tweeting from south korea trump quickly distanced himself from gillespie who he had embraced earlier in the day ed gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what i stand for don t forget republicans won 4 out of 4 house seats and with the economy doing record numbers we will continue to win even bigger than before but democrats prevailed last night from sea to shining sea up and down the ballot democrats didn t just run up the score on blue turf though for the first time democrats were winning because of obamacare not in spite of it maine approving medicaid expansion by such a margin should be a warning sign for republicans to tread very carefully when it comes to their continuing efforts to repeal the affordable care act in virginia the network exit poll asked respondents which one of five issues mattered most in deciding their vote for governor 39 percent said health care far more than any other issue and health care focused voters favored northam by a giant 77 percent to 23 percent margin in preliminary exit polls gillespie won handily among those who named taxes and immigration as their top issue the candidates split among those who picked gun policy to understand the true magnitude of the democratic victory look to the down ballot races in virginia democrats many of them unknown first time candidates are poised to pick up at least 14 seats in the house of delegates unofficial returns showed democrats unseating at least 11 republicans and flipping three seats that had been occupied by gop incumbents who didn t seek reelection four other races were so close that they qualify for a recount and results will determine control of the chamber democrats needed to pick up 17 seats to gain control of the house of delegates no one thought going into last night that it was seriously in play the results marked the most sweeping shift in control of the legislature since the watergate era writes fenit nirappil the biggest battleground for the house was prince william a washington exurb where people of color constitute a majority of the population a diverse group of five democratic challengers hoped to channel demographic changes and democratic energy to take seats held by white men and all won virginia s most socially conservative state lawmaker was ousted from office by a democrat who will be one of the nation s first openly transgender elected officials the race pitted danica roem a 33 year old former journalist who began her physical gender transition four years ago against robert g marshall a 13 term incumbent who called himself virginia s chief homophobe and earlier this year introduced a bathroom bill that died in committee discrimination is a disqualifier roem said in her victory speech per antonio olivo this is a tidal wave said david wasserman who tracks u s house races for the nonpartisan cook political report it s hard to conclude anything other than that democrats are the current favorite for control of the house in 2018 one ominous sign for congressional republicans northam won the district held by rep barbara comstock r va in the d c suburbs by 13 points several other democrats who won these down ballot races are going to have national profiles in southwest virginia former television news anchor chris hurst whose girlfriend was fatally shot during a live broadcast in 2015 toppled republican incumbent joseph yost the results are a big validation for outgoing gov terry mcauliffe d who is term limited and could use the gains as a rationale to run for president in 2020 he was surprised by the scale of the pick ups i always say you re going to get it back because you have to say that politically but in my mind i was thinking six to eight seats gained would have been a great night for the democrats he told one of my colleagues virginia s general assembly has a well earned reputation as an old boy s club but the composition of the body changed bigly last night all 14 of the seats that democrats flipped are held by gop men ten of their replacements will be women supporters of ralph northamcheeras he speaks at his victory rally at george mason university in fairfax michael robinson chavez the washington post more on turnout trump proved to be just the boogeyman that democrats have needed to galvanize their liberal base for an off year election when obama was not on the ballot 28 percent of voters identified as liberals in preliminary exit polls up eight points from the 2013 governor s race and two points from last year democrats composed 41 percent of the electorate up four points from 2013 and one point from last year republicans were 31 percent of the electorate a record low in two decades of exit polls turnout was the highest in 20 years for a gubernatorial race fivepercentage points and 10 percentage points higher than the last two northam s vote margin in hampton roads was more than 4 000 votes bigger than clinton s last year a surprise since so many more people vote in presidential elections northam s military background and hometown on the eastern shore may have provided extra momentum in that region dan keating and kevin uhrmacher explain northam s margin in central virginia around richmond was similarly more than 4 000 votes bigger than clinton s there his margin in northern virginia did not top clinton s but it was bigger than obama won it by in either of his winning campaigns gillespie was not able to mount anywhere close to trump s margins in the republican areas consider this amazing statistic in 2014 gillespie won loudoun county dc exurbs by 456 votes he lost it today by 23 432 votes here s a cool visualization of how turnout changed by region compared to the previous governor s race the huge liberal turnout in northern virginia is especially remarkable when you consider that a massive rainstorm was pummeling the d c suburbs during rush hour last night nonwhite voters turned out at presidential election rates in virginia surprising the experts who were trying to model the election on both sides african americans accounted for 21 percent of voters according to the exits the same as in 2016 when mcauliffe won four years ago nonwhite voters accounted for 28 percent of the electorate on tuesday they made up 33 percent of those who voted that 5 percent is pivotal because black voters favored northam by a 73 point margin and hispanics favored northam by 33 points from the upshot turnout in precincts where hispanic or asian voters represent at least 20 of the population is 15 percent higher than our pre election estimates obama went to richmond last month for his first campaign rally since leaving the white house to help gin up african american turnout off year elections midterm elections democrats sometimes y all get a little sleepy you get a little complacent the former president said in his speech and so as a consequence folks wake up and they re surprised how come we can t get things through congress how come we can t get things through the state house because you slept through the election well democrats weren t sleeping yesterday gillespie suffered mightily from the utter failure of the republicans in washington to do what they said they d do said former virginia attorney general ken cuccinelli r who lost the governor s race four years ago trump is trump he told our marc fisher last night let s not kid ourselves that he s going to make any changes it s up to the republicans in congress if they can t deliver to their voters those voters simply won t come out and that should scare the bejesus out of the republicans in washington seattle mayor elect jenny durkan right joins supporters waving signs ontuesday ted s warren ap a night of firsts other results more wapo team coverage republicans seek new path after failure of gillespie s trumpism without trump by michael scherer and david weigel it was not clear that a further embrace would have produced any better results in the short term the defeat is likely to broaden a deepening divide between traditional republicans who have lost influence among grass roots gop voters and the new populist conservatives who have embraced the polarizing approach of the president in the aftermath of defeat some republicans called for staying the course rep steve king r iowa argued that the solution for the virginia republicans woes was running corey stewart a former trump campaign adviser who lost the primary to gillespie in the 2018 senate campaign against tim kaine the shape of northam s victory gave democrats both hope and pause writes marc fisher he drew larger portions of the vote than clinton did in every region of virginia outperforming her especially among young people and white women with college degrees according to preliminary exit polls but northam failed to make gains in democratic weak spots such as with rural and less educated voters from the washington post s opinion page what smart commentators are saying elsewhere how the returnsplayed on social media yes virginia went for clinton last year yes the demographics are changing but it was anything but inevitable that northam would win from the director of the center for politics at the university of virginia dear pundit friends please stop attributing this d landslide in va to changing demographics va hasn t changed that much since last nov 8 hillary by 5 the bigger explanation is a backlash to trump and trumpism pure and simple vagov gillespie s embrace of divisive wedge issues kept the race close but it was not enough democrats were gleeful and expressed hope that republicans elsewhere will be less inclined to replicate the tactics in 2018 from a former senioradviser to barack obama at least ed gillespie still has his dignity oh wait never mind he sold his soul to trumpism from obama s former chief speechwriter in case there was any doubt the resistance is real from the msnbc host another question how do republicans react to gillespie losing does this give them pause about running as trumpist anti immigrant neo confederates the new republic s senior editor pinned gillespie s defeat on a certainconfederate general once again robert e lee turns out to be a loser from a spokesman for the democratic congressional campaign committee now we have to build a statue of ed gillespie otherwise how will future generations know who lost this election https t co esyent6tke many establishment republicans were relieved that gillespie s embrace of trumpism did not work from the chief strategist for ohio gov john kasich r a possible 2020 challenger to trump another thing gop candidates to thine own self be true don t go down the path of these nationalist loons and lose both the election your honor twopaths but many on the right said that their losses were so bad because republicans have not kept their promises especially on immigration from ann coulter if realdonaldtrump doesn t keep his campaign promise to build a wall deport illegals what happened to va will happen to the entire country one headline right now on breitbart news the republican swamp got the loss they wanted now they re going to try to tame us for his part jerry falwell jr the president of liberty university blamed the loss on the growing dominance of the suburbs outside washington in virginia politics and offered a novel idea dc should annex nova and return the governance of va to virginians the founders intended dc to include all fed employees who are conflicted while you were sleeping trump in asia trump harshly denounced north korea and its nuclear ambitionsduring a speech to the south korean national assembly ashley parker and david nakamura report in a 35 minute speech here for which he received a standing ovation trump offered a tough and blunt message to pyongyang and dictator kim jong un do not underestimate us and do not try us we will defend our common spirit our shared prosperity and our sacred liberty but the president drew no red lines for what would prompt the united states to use military force nor did he offer any additional ideas on how to coax north korea to the negotiating table trump also attempted to make a surprise visit to the dmz but was forced to turn back because of bad weather our colleagues report president moon jae in had been expected to join trump at the border in what white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders billed as a historic moment the first time leaders of both the united states and south korea would have visited the dmz together the trip was kept under great secrecy with sanders alerting reporters traveling with the president to the surprise visit by holding up a piece of paper on which dmz had been scrawled and announcing this is where we re going trump nowheads to china a country where social media platforms like twitterare banned david nakamura notes president xi jinping has overseen a deepening crackdown on the internet using the great firewall to stifle self expression in the name of bolstering the already tight grip over society by the communist party foreigners are generally still able to tweet via their cellphones and trump is expected to continue his daily dose of high octane missives over the three day state visit but it s what he might chose not to say that could send a more subtle but equally important message trump s predecessor barack obama spoke out in support of free speech in two visits to china but trump has shown little inkling for confronting xi on the issue get smart fast texas mourns texas church gunman devin p kelley escaped from a mental health facility in 2012 after he was caught sneaking guns onto an air force base and threatening his military superiors eva ruth moravec and mark berman report the report said

as nearly everyone did the trolls final election mission was to sow doubt about the legitimacy of the vote mike pompeo speaks to the media on capitol hill jacquelyn martin ap west wing intrigue cia director mike pompeo recently met at the urging of president trump with a dnc conspiracy theorist who circulated a theory that last year s email hacking was an inside job rather than the work of russian government actors that theory runs counter to a long standing conclusion of the u s intelligence community cnn s jim sciutto and mary kay mallonee report william binney the former nsa employee turned whistleblower who circulated the conspiracy theory confirmed that he met with pompeo for about an hour on october 24 binney who has theorized that the theft and release of thousands of dnc emails was actually carried out by a dnc employee told cnn that pompeo began the meeting with him by saying the president told me i should talk to you intelligence sources said that many people inside the cia were very uncomfortable with the meeting binney said pompeo concluded the meeting by telling him he would like binney to meet with the fbi and the nsa as well but but but when it comes to russia pompeo keeps doing controversialthings says the fix s aaron blake at an event three weeks ago pompeo made a highly curious remark saying that the intelligence community s assessment is that the russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the election this mirrored a talking point previously offered by trump but that talking point is categorically false the intelligence report said clearly that it wouldn t weigh in on how much impact russia may have had not that it didn t have an impact that might be a slip of the tongue from an amateur but how the cia director of all people could get something of such importance something that for him should be completely basic knowledge so wrong sure seemed odd more problems for wilbur ross the commerce secretary told forbes that he had 2 billion in trusts evidently to maintain his position on the magazine s list of richest americans but it now appears that the trust money never existed forbes s dan alexander reports a fter examining the financial disclosure forms he filed after his nomination to trump s cabinet which showed less than 700 million in assets forbes was intent on removing him from the list entirely ross protested citing trusts for his family that he said he did not have to disclose in federal filings and after one month of digging forbes is confident it has found the answer that money never existed it seems clear that ross lied to us the latest in an apparent sequence of fibs exaggerations omissions fabrications and whoppers that have been going on with forbes since 2004 trump administration officials sound far more hesitant about the saudi purge of influential citizens than the president himself karen deyoung reports defense secretary jim mattis asked if he was concerned
