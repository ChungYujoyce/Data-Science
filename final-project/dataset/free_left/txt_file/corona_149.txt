advertisement supported by the pandemic has begun to sweep through new york city s medical ranks and anxiety is growing among normally dispassionate medical professionals by michael schwirtz a supervisor urged surgeons at columbia university irving medical center in manhattan to volunteer for the front lines because half the intensive care staff had already been sickened by coronavirus icu is exploding she wrote in an email a doctor at weill cornell medical center in manhattan described the unnerving experience of walking daily past an intubated critically ill colleague in her 30s wondering who would be next another doctor at a major new york city hospital described it as a petri dish where more than 200 workers had fallen sick two nurses in city hospitals have died the coronavirus pandemic which has infected more than 30 000 people in new york city is beginning to take a toll on those who are most needed to combat it the doctors nurses and other workers at hospitals and clinics in emergency rooms and intensive care units typically dispassionate medical professionals are feeling panicked as increasing numbers of colleagues get sick i feel like we re all just being sent to slaughter said thomas riley a nurse at jacobi medical center in the bronx who has contracted the virus along with his husband medical workers are still showing up day after day to face overflowing emergency rooms earning them praise as heroes thousands of volunteers have signed up to join their colleagues but doctors and nurses said they can look overseas for a dark glimpse of the risk they are facing especially when protective gear has been in short supply in china more than 3 000 doctors were infected nearly half of them in wuhan where the pandemic began according to chinese government statistics li wenliang the chinese doctor who first tried to raise the alarm about covid 19 eventually died of it in italy the number of infected heath care workers is now twice the chinese total and the national federation of orders of surgeons and dentists has compiled a list of 50 who have died nearly 14 percent of spain s confirmed coronavirus cases are medical professionals new york city s health care system is sprawling and disjointed making precise infection rates among medical workers difficult to calculate a spokesman for the health and hospitals corporation which runs new york city s public hospitals said the agency would not share data about sick medical workers at this time william p jaquis president of the american college of emergency physicians said the situation across the country was too fluid to begin tracking such data but he said he expected the danger to intensify doctors are getting sick everywhere he said last week two nurses in new york including kious kelly a 48 year old assistant nurse manager at mount sinai west died from the disease they are believed to be the first known victims among the city s medical workers health care workers across the city said they feared many more would follow mr riley the nurse at jacobi said when he looked at the emergency room recently he realized he and his colleagues would never avoid being infected patients struggling to breathe with lungs that sounded like sandpaper had crowded the hospital masks and protective gowns were in short supply i m swimming in this he said he thought i m pretty sure i m getting this his symptoms began with a cough then a fever then nausea and diarrhea days later his husband became ill mr riley said both he and his husband appear to be getting better but are still experiencing symptoms like generals steadying their troops before battle hospital supervisors in new york have had to rally cajole and sometimes threaten workers our health care systems are at war with a pandemic virus craig r smith the surgeon in chief at newyork presbyterian hospital wrote in an email to staff on march 16 the day after new york city shut down its school system to contain the virus you are expected to keep fighting with whatever weapons you re capable of working sick is relative he wrote adding that workers would not even be tested for the virus unless they were unequivocally exposed and symptomatic to the point of needing admission to the hospital that means you come to work he wrote period arriving to work each day doctors and nurses are met with confusion and chaos at a branch of the montefiore hospital system in the bronx nurses wear their winter coats in an unheated tent set up to triage patients with symptoms while at elmhurst hospital center in queens patients are sometimes dying before they can be moved into beds the inviolable rules that once gave a sense of rhythm and harmony to even the busiest emergency rooms have in some cases been cast aside few things have caused more anxiety than shifting protocols meant to preserve a dwindling supply of protective gear when the pandemic first hit new york medical workers changed gowns and masks each time they visited an infected patient then they were told to keep their protective gear on until the end of their shift as supplies became even more scarce one doctor working on an intensive care unit said he was asked to turn in his mask and face shield at the end of his shift to be sterilized for future use others are being told to store their masks in a paper bag between shifts it puts us in danger it puts our patients in danger i can t believe in the united states that s what s happening said kelley cabrera an emergency room nurse at jacobi medical center an emergency room doctor at long island jewish medical center put it more bluntly it s literally wash your hands a lot cross your fingers pray doctors and nurses fear they could be transmitting the virus to their patients compounding the crisis by transforming hospitals into incubators for the virus that has happened in italy in part because infected doctors struggle through their shifts according to an article published by physicians at a hospital in bergamo a city in one of the hardest hit regions frontline hospital workers in new york are now required to take their temperature every 12 hours though many doctors and nurses fear they could contract the disease and spread it to patients before they become symptomatic they also say it is a challenge to know when to come back to work after being sick all medical workers who show symptoms even if they are not tested must quarantine for at least seven days and must be asymptomatic for three days before coming back to work but some employers have been more demanding than others workers said lillian udell a nurse at lincoln medical center another public hospital in the bronx said she was still weak and experiencing symptoms when she was pressured to return to work she powered through a long shift that was so chaotic she could not remember how many patients she attended by the time she returned home the chills and the cough had returned updated may 26 2020 if air travel is unavoidable there are some steps you can take to protect yourself most important wash your hands often and stop touching your face if possible choose a window seat a study from emory university found that during flu season the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people disinfect hard surfaces when you get to your seat and your hands are clean use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest the seatbelt buckle the remote screen seat back pocket and the tray table if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather you can wipe that down too using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them common symptoms include fever a dry cough fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu making detection difficult but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common the c d c has also added chills muscle pain sore throat headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since march one in five who were working in february reported losing a job or being furloughed in march or the beginning of april data from a federal reserve survey released on may 14 showed and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning 40 000 or less lost work compared with 13 percent in those making more than 100 000 a fed official said there is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes the lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions but they are usually common in the coldest winter months federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms but some dermatologists are pushing for a change saying so called covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don t live in your home even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea taking one s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds as normal temperature numbers can vary but generally keep an eye out for a temperature of 100 5 degrees fahrenheit or higher if you don t have a thermometer they can be pricey these days there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever or are at risk of covid 19 complications the c d c has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms until now the c d c like the w h o has advised that ordinary people don t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing part of the reason was to preserve medical grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply masks don t replace hand washing and social distancing if you ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing call a doctor they should give you advice on whether you should be tested how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others if you re sick and you think you ve been exposed to the new coronavirus the c d c recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears they will decide if you need to be tested keep in mind that there s a chance because of a lack of testing kits or because you re asymptomatic for instance you won t be able to get tested charity navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak you can give blood through the american red cross and world central kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities i knew it was still in me she said i knew i wasn t myself christopher miller a spokesman for the health and hospitals corporation said the agency could not comment on ms udell s claim but said its hospitals had never asked health care workers who are sick and have symptoms of covid 19 to continue to work or to come back to work there is also the fear of bringing the disease home to spouses and children some medical workers said they were sleeping in different rooms from their partners and even wearing surgical masks at home others have chosen to isolate themselves from their families completely sending spouses and children to live outside the city or moving into hotels i come home i strip naked put clothes in a bag and put them in the washer and take a shower one new york city doctor at a large public hospital said because the pathogen has spread so widely even medical workers not assigned directly to work with infected patients risk contracting the disease a gynecologist who works for the mount sinai hospital system said she had begun seeing women in labor who were positive for the coronavirus because she is not considered a front line worker she said restrictions on protective gear are even more stringent than on covid 19 units she said she was not aware of any patients who had tested positive after contact with doctors or nurses but felt it was only a matter of time we re definitely contaminating pregnant mothers that we re assessing and possibly discharging home said the doctor who spoke on condition on anonymity because her hospital had not authorized her to speak mount sinai said in a statement that it had faced equipment shortages like other hospitals but added the issues had been solved in part by a large shipment of masks that arrived from china over the weekend the hospital moved mountains to get the shipment the statement said this week the health and hospitals corporation recommended transferring doctors and nurses at higher risk of infection such as those who are older or with underlying medical conditions from jobs interacting with patients to more administrative positions but kimberly marsh a nurse at westchester medical center outside new york city said she has no intention of leaving the fight even though she is a 53 year old smoker with multiple sclerosis and on a medication that warns against getting near people with infections it almost feels selfish she said though she acknowledged that with two years before retirement she could not afford leave if she wanted to even so she said the fear is palpable each time she steps into the emergency room a nurse on her unit has already contracted the virus and one doctor is so scared he affixes an n95 mask to his face with tape at the beginning of each shift ms marsh said she sweats profusely in her protective gear because she is going through menopause and suffers from hot flashes we all think we re screwed she said i know without any doubt that i m going to lose colleagues there s just no way around it somini sengupta
