 i m going to walk away with it and win outright i m going to get in and all the polls are going to go crazy i m going to suck all the oxygen out of the room i know how to work the media in a way that they will never take the lights off of me donald trump donald trump s blend of bombast amorality and media savvy has carried him to the republican nomination he s proven that an ability to dominate coverage and dictate the narrative is sufficient in today s political climate none of this is surprising trump s a tv man with a gift for self promotion his entire career has been preparation for this moment this campaign he saw our broken perverted process with clear eyes and he s exploited it with aplomb you have to give him credit for that while the republican party is ultimately responsible for trump they welcomed him into their big tent after all the media is equally culpable for the calamity that is his candidacy every american is entitled to be as undiscerning and uncritical as they like there s nothing in the social contract that demands voters educate themselves a democracy for the most part can tolerate its share of credulous citizens but the media has a special obligation in a free society it s the only profession protected by the u s constitution for a reason it s a check on power and a gadfly for crooked politicians and abusers of power the media has failed spectacularly this election it trump s campaign may not be good for america said les moonves the ceo and executive chairman of cbs but it s damn good for cbs man who would have expected the ride we re all having right now the money s rolling in and this is fun i ve never seen anything like this and this is going to be a very good year for us sorry it s a terrible thing to say but bring it on donald keep going this is the plundering reaction trump expected they will never take the lights off of me he famously said to republican officials two years before announcing his candidacy importantly trump also understood how to navigate the process without engaging issues that matter to call his campaign substance free is too generous it s been a cavalcade of insults and ethno nationalist dog whistling punctuated by populist platitudes if we had a functional media trump would be challenged by journalists and anchors instead they re too busy monitoring the ratings to notice he s using them to prop up his campaign part of the problem as columbia journalism professor todd gitlin notes in the washington post is that trump has cracked the campaign reporters code gitlin writes trump regularly runs circles around interviewers because they pare their follow up questions down to a minimum or none at all after 30 plus years in the media spotlight he knows how to wait out an interviewer offering noncommittal soundbites and incoherent rejoinders until he hears the phrase let s move on he takes advantage of the slipshod shallow techniques journalism has made routine particularly on tv techniques that in the past were sufficient to trup up less media savvy candidates but that trump knows how to sidestep examples of this abound gitlin cites interview after interview in which trump rope a dopes reporters when they ask questions he can t answer or when they suggest however passively that he s wrong or lied about the record trump is a master of darting from slogan to slogan gitlin writes that s why interviewers must do their homework and be prepared to go at least 2 3 questions deep on any issue great idea but it s difficult to dive deep when interviewers are forced to shoehorn serious questions in limited time between competing toothpaste commercials trump gets away with this because of the mutually beneficial relationship he has with the press he knows people like moonves are interested in selling penis pill ads not informing the electorate voters for their part are happy to project whatever they want onto the empty vessel that is trump meanwhile the truth is an afterthought and the whole sordid circus continues unimpeded gitlin urges journalists to honor the good name of their profession and take off the kid gloves sound advice but i m not holding my breath sean illing is a usaf veteran who previously taught philosophy and politics at loyola and lsu he is currently salon s politics writer follow him on facebook and twitter read his blog here email at silling salon com copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
