benincasa many people are waiting for benefits to kick in or worse struggle even to apply as state benefits systems are swamped by others filing claims in states like florida new york north carolina

new website and software for filing unemployment but one expert said that has only caused further confusion now the state is directing people to use this new software to file the claims but it seems that both softwares do the same thing so it s unclear if someone should use one or the other said daniel rowinsky staff unemployment attorney at legal services of greater miami in north carolina
