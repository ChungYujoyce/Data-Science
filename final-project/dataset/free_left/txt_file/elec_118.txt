 dan roberts in washington and sabrina siddiqui in philadelphia mon 24 oct 2016 12 18bst first published on sun 23 oct 2016 19 26bst hillary clinton s increasingly confident campaign has warned against complacency as new poll numbers suggested donald trump may drag republicans into a rout in just over two weeks time in the final days after their televised debates the candidates have adopted starkly different tactics to reach the more than 200 million americans who have registered to vote in the election while trump has doubled down with raucous swing state rallies that some have compared to a rock music tour clinton is spending heavily on tv advertising and local organising with an eye toward states in once safely republican territory the strategy could take the candidate well past the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the white house and marks a turn to helping other democrats win back control of congress speaking at a rally in orlando florida on sunday night democratic vice presidential candidate tim kaine said data from early voting states suggested clinton was headed toward a very big and historic win on 8 november however clinton campaign aides insisted they had not discounted the risk that trump could benefit from an unpredictable 2016 electorate especially in swing states like ohio where polling remains tight these battleground states are called that for a reason her campaign manager robby mook told cnn on sunday they are going to be incredibly close we don t want to get ahead of our skis here we are just as focused on ohio iowa florida as we have ever been trump advisers acknowledge they are facing an uphill battle but maintain the country s anti establishment mood will work in their favour in the final few days we are behind campaign manager kellyanne conway told nbc she has some advantages like 66m in ad buys just in the month of september she has a former president happens to be her husband campaigning for her and she s seen as the incumbent conway argued that the electoral map reshaped by trump would benefit the businessman our advantage going in when we re behind one three four points in some of these swing states that mitt romney lost to president obama she said is that donald trump is just going to continue to take the case directly to the people he doesn t expect to be able to cut through the noise and the way we re treated by some so he s taking the case he s going to visit all of these swing states many times and we feel that with hillary clinton under 50 in some of these places even though she has run a very traditional and expensive campaign that we have a shot of getting those undecided voters eric trump the nominee s son echoed these sentiments but rejected the idea that his father was playing to his base of support abc host george stephanopoulos pressed the case asking whether the businessman might be in a bubble of your own support trump answered no i don t i don t think so at all some republicans are sceptical trump can find a way to win karl rove who masterminded george w bush s narrow election victories over al gore and john kerry was sceptical on sunday that there was enough time left i don t see it happening he told fox news maybe it could but i doubt in the just over two weeks we ve got left and conducting the kind of campaign he is conducting that he is going to be able to swing one out of every 10 voters the clinton campaign remains confident that it can spare resources on punishing the republican party for standing with trump who has repeatedly broken the norms of american politics and energised once shunned leaders such as former ku klux klansman david duke i think in general you re going to hear her do more of what she did in pennsylvania in terms of trying to raise the stakes of the down ballot races brian fallon a spokesman for clinton s campaign told the guardian after the secretary spent a day supporting the state s democratic senate candidate kate mcginty fallon said the clinton campaign wanted to extend an open hand to traditionally republican voters even as it targets the different strain within the party that continues to support trump despite his offensive remarks about women immigrants and minorities although many senate veterans including john mccain and kelly ayotte have rescinded their endorsements of trump he has retained his vociferous base and the muted support of house speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell fallon said such leaders should be held accountable in two and a half weeks for having played a role in trump s rise and for standing by him even after he s gone around and offended people and shown himself to be completely temperamentally unfit the aide said clinton s campaign would continue to court reasonable republicans and independents who might be willing to defect across party lines trump jr also told abc that his father would 100 accept the results of the election if it was fair i think what my father is saying is i want a fair election eric trump said on abc s this week if it s a fair outcome he will absolutely accept it there s no question about that
