unified he said in the meeting emmer also defended the nrcc s communications team which is facing criticism from even gop lawmakers for its personal attack on a democrat calling the 5 6 new york rep max rose little and undercutting republican leadership s support for congressional pay raises with a press release slamming democrats for backing the salary bump our communications team has a direct

compelled to address the incidents underscores the broader frustration that is bubbling up inside the gop conference according to interviews with more than a dozen members aides and gop consultants working on battleground races across the country it s a disaster what is going on across the street at nrcc said one gop lawmaker who was granted anonymity to speak more freely their communication is bad some of the stuff is bizarrely overly aggressive they re not raising the money they don t have buy in from members and it s getting worse one of the chief complaints from gop lawmakers is that the party has yet to unveil its rival to actblue the online fundraising platform that democrats have used to rake in massive amounts of small dollar donations the nrcc in conjunction with the national republican senatorial committee republican national committee and trump s political team announced back in january they would launch their own small donor fundraising vehicle dubbed the patriot pass which has since been renamed win red gop sources said an announcement is coming very very soon but many republicans expected it to already be up and running i would have hoped it would be launched by now because i do believe sooner is better than later said gop rep tom reed of new york it s a real concern by a lot of members this needs to get done but nearly six months into the new election cycle members have still not been briefed on the details of the operation or when it will be functional lawmakers also don t know which incumbents or first time candidates will have access to it according to multiple gop consultants and several gop fundraising firms have no plans to integrate with the win red database i didn t realize it wasn t up and running yet rep pete king r ny a democratic target said when asked about win red and while the nrcc isn t the only gop outfit to blame for the delay house lawmakers say they are feeling more pressure to compete with democrats in the small donor space i don t know when it s coming but i hope soon i hope real soon said texas republican brian babin it was a huge disadvantage to us last time and so a whole lot of us thought if there s an actblue there needs to be an actred one of the hiccups according to multiple sources is the name had to be changed because new england patriots owner robert kraft a top ally to president donald trump complained it sounded too similar to his nfl team we need to counteract this and we don t see something yet added rep chris collins r n y it s just so obvious the other side s got a juggernaut the nrcc defended its fundraising operation in a statement to politico spokesman chris pack said that online fundraising is up 250 percent compared to 2017 and in the five months of 2019 the nrcc outraised the entire 2017 fiscal year and broke every monthly record thus far he said we offer email list exchanges to every single member running for re election which has helped participating members achieve similar growth in their online fundraising that the committee has achieved pack said win red is a collaborative effort of multiple organizations pack added it s unrealistic to think this massive undertaking would happen overnight if there s an actblue there needs to be an actred said rep brian babin jacquelyn martin ap photo allies of gop leadership also pointed out that rank and file members venting about the nrcc is hardly new and it s only natural that those complaints are amplified now that republicans have been relegated to the minority but those frustrations have now reached the upper levels of gop leadership at a private meeting earlier this month emmer questioned whether some leaders were pulling their weight in party dues and fundraising numbers according to multiple sources at one point emmer asked cheney r wyo if he could count on her to keep contributing cash to the campaign arm as she contemplates a senate bid cheney fired back that she has been meeting her fundraising benchmarks and paying her dues cheney also told emmer that she s heard from members who are concerned with the general direction of the nrcc while some lawmakers are worried emmer is artificially inflating his own fundraising numbers according to multiple sources adding to the internal drama rep susan brooks r ind head of nrcc recruitment and one of just 13 female lawmakers in the house gop stunned party leaders when she announced last week that she would retire at the end of her term in 2020 the surprise departure reignited questions about the party s efforts to attract and elect more female candidates when trump will be at the top of the ticket while the nrcc said brooks would stay on as recruitment chair through the cycle democrats seized on the news to highlight the lack of women in
