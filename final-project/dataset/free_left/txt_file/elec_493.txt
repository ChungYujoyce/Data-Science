donald trump s defiant assault on the presidential election s integrity reverberated thursday among his allies and rivals as the gop campaign and hillary clinton s inner circle argued over how best to face the outcome after the votes are counted trump on wednesday amplified one of the most explosive charges of his candidacy that if he loses the election he might consider the results illegitimate because the process is rigged questioned directly as to whether he would accept the outcome should democratic nominee clinton prevail nov 8 trump demurred i ll keep you in suspense the republican nominee said clinton called trump s answer horrifying saying he was talking down our democracy trump reiterated the point after flying to columbus ohio to campaign thursday joking i would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the united states that i will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election if i win he added later on a more serious note of course i would accept a clear election result but i would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result right fact checker 24 fishy claims at a rally at a downtown charlotte brewery one of two to kick off north carolina s early voting period democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine said that trump s claims of a rigged election reminded him of the third world politicking he had seen as a missionary in honduras we have a tradition unbroken back to the beginning of this nation kaine said he wouldn t defend our democracy but he wouldn t condemn vladimir putin s attempts to tinker with our democracy kaine also used his speech to criticize the republican run north carolina state legislature for passing a voter id bill that a federal court later overturned after finding evidence of racial discrimination there was a difference said kaine between legal efforts to extend voting rights and claims of a rigged election if there s a legitimate concern on election day sure we re going to let a court figure it out kaine said kaine said it was important for the democratic ticket to win by a large margin the bigger we can win by the harder it is for him to whine and have anyone believe him he said a new clinton fundraising pitch made the same point thursday we ve got to beat trump so definitively that hillary s victory is undeniable read the email to donors we need to build up our ground game even more if we want to make that a reality for trump strong start and then killer mistake even as the two campaigns exchanged barbs president obama and his wife michelle hit the campaign trail on clinton s behalf the first lady spoke in phoenix a sign that democrats now see

attack on all of us and we know that that is not who we are she called the 2016 election a crossroads and said that clinton s powerful vision of america is backed by policies to make that vision a reality hillary has comprehensive policies to help people her opponent has tweets you decide she said the first lady also blasted trump for his suggestion wednesday night that he may not consider the election results legitimate if he loses you do not keep american democracy in suspense because look too many people have marched and protested and fought and died for this democracy she said meanwhile

obama in 2008 said in a statement i didn t like the outcome of the 2008 election but i had a duty to concede a concession isn t just an act of graciousness it is an act of respect for the will of the american people an act that is every american leader s first responsibility the campaign took yet another unexpected turn thursday morning when trump suggested that clinton had gotten the questions to wednesday s debate in advance why didn t hillary clinton announce that she was inappropriately given the debate questions she secretly used them crooked hillary he tweeted many republicans have questioned the debate process in the wake of a recent wikileaks revelation that interim democratic national committee chair donna brazile may have shared a question in advance of a cnn town hall in march in an email to clinton campaign chairman john podesta brazile a cnn contributor at the time wrote from time to time i get the questions in advance and highlighted the issue of the death penalty then cnn contributor donna brazile to clinton camp sometimes i get the questions in advance clinton received a question right along those same lines the next day trump picked up on that theme during his columbus speech saying his opponent received the exact questions to a previous debate word for word by donna brazile who is now under tremendous pressure to resign from the dnc as she should be that is cheating at the highest level he said as the crowd booed at the mention of brazile s name but i ask you why shouldn t hillary clinton resign from the race in an interview with fox host megyn kelly on wednesday night brazile rejected the allegations of improper collusion with the clinton campaign i am not going to try to validate falsified information she said i do my homework i communicate i talk cnn has never provided me with questions some of trump s supporters were also circulating a different debate theory on social media thursday that the glow emanating from a screen on clinton s lectern proved she was learning fox moderator chris wallace s questions in advance the democratic nominee quickly turned the accusation into a fundraising pitch retweeting it with the line show trump his tweets come at a cost because hillary supporters are pledging to donate every time he tweets the sparring between the two camps came after the two parties candidates got into fiery exchanges over their fitness to serve as president and character traits wednesday night but over the course of the third and final debate they delved deeper into their substantive differences than they did in the first two forums and offered a clearer contrast in the directions they would take the country they drew sharp distinctions on the economy trade terrorism immigration and hot button
