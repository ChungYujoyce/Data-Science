street where mr dimon often expounds at length on topics like the bank s performance taxes and america s role in the world this year s edition was especially anticipated because it will be the first time mr dimon has communicated publicly since undergoing emergency heart surgery a month ago he returned to work remotely last week mr dimon expects a bad recession he wrote combined with some kind of financial stress similar to the global financial crisis of 2008 jpmorgan s huge and powerful earnings stream enables it to absorb losses he wrote halting stock buybacks was a very prudent action but a decision to suspend dividends would be made only out of extreme prudence under the bank s most pessimistic economic scenario this scenario is quite severe and we hope unlikely he wrote mr dimon wrote of a need for a disciplined return to work once the rate of infection slows and the health care system is under less strain he cites the need for antibody testing that shows who is likely not to get sick again or infect anyone that makes mr dimon one of the few corporate leaders to speak publicly if gently about restarting the economy and minimize the time extent and suffering caused by the economic downturn he also wrote that jpmorgan won t ask for regulatory relief but criticized what he views as poor financial regulations now isn t the time to debate any wider overhaul he wrote generally speaking the current pandemic is only one example of the bad planning and management that have hurt our country he wrote as we have seen in past crises of this magnitude there will come a time when we will look back and it will be clear how we at all levels of society government business health care systems and civic and humanitarian organizations could have been and will be better prepared to face emergencies of this scale he didn t have much to say about his health beyond that he appreciated the well wishes while he recuperated from heart surgery it s not easy to spend 2 trillion the u s government is learning several of the targeted aid programs begun in recent days have struggled amid heavy demand and unclear instructions passing the stimulus quickly is one thing but implementing it is another small businesses are having trouble applying for emergency loans banks have been overwhelmed by inquiries in the early days of a 349 billion program and borrowers say that many lenders are limiting the crisis loans to a narrow subset of existing customers stimulus checks for individuals could be delayed by months although millions of checks worth up to 1 200 per person will go out by mid april people without direct deposit information on file with the i r s may have to wait until august airlines are balking at the conditions attached to aid about 50 billion in funds has been set aside for the industry but executives are wary of giving equity stakes to the government to get access to it the next phase of stimulus is taking shape the washington post s jeff stein reports measures under discussion could prove more politically contentious with some republicans including the new white house chief of staff mark meadows and the economic adviser larry kudlow opposed to large scale spending on infrastructure while democrats are likely to resist tax cuts and other proposals favored by republicans as mr stein describes it the white house has been pitching a payroll tax cut a capital gains tax cut creating 50 year treasury bonds to lock in low interest rates and a waiver that would clear businesses of liability from employees who contract the coronavirus on the job the hedge fund billionaire captured wall street s attention for his panicky appearance on cnbc last month when he said hell is coming now it appears he s in much better spirits i am beginning to get optimistic mr ackman tweeted yesterday citing what he believed to be a slowing rate of infection in new york a potentially lower than expected covid 19 fatality rate and other signs that newfound cheer ran up against skeptics who recalled his previous outburst a few weeks ago a reminder mr ackman fretted that shares in hilton could sink to zero then later revealed that he had bought shares in the hotel chain and generated more than 2 billion in returns on short bets one twitter user pithily responded to mr ackman s newfound optimism is this because you ve gone long now america s central bank has pledged to provide billions of dollars to businesses through one of its lending programs known as talf but the giant investment firm apollo thinks the fed can do much more it thinks the fed should expand talf to accept more types of collateral according to a presentation prepared by marc rowan an apollo co founder talf short for term asset backed securities loan facility was last used during the 2008 crisis it accepts only some kinds of debt assets chiefly securitized bundles of credit card auto loans or small business loans that carry the highest possible credit ratings the fed should accept more types of assets mr rowan says including other kinds of mortgages certificates of deposit and short term business loans known as commercial paper across the investment grade spectrum mr rowan s argument lending markets are more troubled than they appear so a broader program is needed to support a wider range of players aaa rated borrowers will mostly stockpile funds they receive from aid programs apollo says its concerns are shared by other nonbank organizations like fellow investment firm tpg as well as insurers and retirement plans a bipartisan group of congress members also sent a letter to the fed chairman jay powell last week urging him to expand talf s eligible assets it isn t clear how much apollo itself stands to benefit from a change in the fed s program many of its investments wouldn t qualify because of their credit ratings but some of its other businesses would mr rowan argues in his presentation that he s looking out for the economy as a whole and that failure to act would lead to a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs that said investment firms are eyeing opportunities amid the panic one area of interest for firms like
