published on mon 13 nov 2017 23 40gmt donald trump jr the eldest son of the us president was in direct communication with wikileaks in the crucial final stages of the 2016 presidential election a new leak of private correspondence from inside the trump circle reveals the younger trump exchanged direct messages with the wikileaks account on twitter between 20 september and 12 october 2016 copies of the correspondence were handed to congressional investigators by trump jr s lawyers and subsequently obtained by the atlantic magazine the communication occurred at a highly sensitive moment for both the trump presidential campaign and for wikileaks just weeks before election day and at the height of wikileaks publication of hacked emails belonging to senior democratic figures at the instigation us intelligence agencies allege of the russian government the most politically explosive communication between the two parties according to the atlantic came on and after 12 october 2016 hey donald great to see you and your dad talking about our publications the wikileaks account wikileaks said to trump jr two days after his father had proclaimed at a campaign rally i love wikileaks strongly suggest your dad tweets this link if he mentions us there s many great stories the press are missing and we re sure some of your follows sic will find it the message continued the message went on to offer a link to wlsearch tk a search tool that facilitates the exploration of the database of leaked emails from john podesta hillary clinton s 2016 campaign chairman that wikileaks had by then begun to publish julia ioffe author of the atlantic article writes that trump jr did not reply to the wikileaks message but two days later on 14 october he did tweet that same link to wlsearch tk encouraging those who have the time to read about all the corruption and hypocrisy exposed by the wikileaks emails for those who have the time to read about all the corruption and hypocrisy all the wikileaks emails are right here https t co sgceem9rcs the guardian contacted wikileaks which referred to a twitter post by the group s founder julian assange he suggested that the atlantic had selectively edited the messages full text of alleged dms with context provides a different reading unsurprisingly https t co dbwikxwp74 assange also wrote that the messages from wikileaks including ones urging trump jr to release his father s tax returns through the organisation showed its chutzpah a lawyer for trump jr told the atlantic we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum on monday evening trump jr tweeted what he said were copies of the entire chain of messages with wikileaks the first contact from wikileaks was made on 20 september 2016 the magazine reports in it the open information website informed trump jr that a new political action committee called putintrump was about to launch trump jr replied the following morning off the record i don t know who that is but i ll ask around according to leaked information obtained by the atlantic trump jr shared the news that wikileaks had been in touch with him with several members of the inner campaign team among those he allegedly told were steve bannon then chief executive of the trump presidential campaign as well as the candidate s son in law jared kushner on 3 october there was a further exchange through twitter in which wikileaks encouraged the trump team to publicise a comment by clinton about wanting to just drone the head of wikileaks julian assange already did that earlier today trump jr replied according to the atlantic soon after the businessman sent a second dm to wikileaks asking to know more about an upcoming leak from wikileaks that had been teased by roger stone the trump supporting political agitator according to the atlantic the information flow continued until as late as july this year although after 12 october 2016 it was entirely in one direction after that date the younger trump did not respond to any approaches beyond that point the leak becomes more revealing about wikileaks and its maverick founder assange holed up in the ecuardorian embassy in london where he has lived since 2012 than about the circle of the us president the most revelatory detail in that regard dates back to 21 october 2016 when the wikileaks account presumably controlled by assange himself though the identity of the correspondent is unknown contacted trump jr urging him to allow wikileaks to publish his father s tax returns wikileaks suggested the move would be positive as it would undermine suggestions that the organisation was in the pocket of the kremlin if we publish the tax returns it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality wikileaks says that means the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on clinton will have much higher impact because it won t be perceived as coming from a pro trump pro russia source on election day itself 8 november wikileaks contacted trump jr to make the extraordinary suggestion that should his father lose the contest as was then widely expected he should refuse to concede the race and instead turn the spotlight on the media for rigging the result even more bizarrely wikileaks wrote again in december by which time donald trump sr was the president in waiting to ask for support in assange s legal battles against the governments of sweden the uk and australia it would be real easy and helpful for your dad to suggest that australia appoint assange ambassador to dc the twitter message added they won t do it but it will send the right signals to australia uk sweden to start following the law and stop bending it to ingratiate themselves with the clintons the younger donald trump did not reply this is not the first controversy involving trump jr and links to russia in june 2016 he met a russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya in what was presented to him as part of a russian government effort to aid his father s campaign by providing information that could be used against hillary clinton
