for democrats who might be rooting for donald trump thinking he would be easy to beat in november i have some advice be careful what you wish for in his campaign or rampage trump has done more than take a sledgehammer to the republican party he almost seems to be reinventing politics in a way that makes both major parties seem hidebound sluggish and concerned mostly with self perpetuation which in fact they are when he announced his candidacy no one outside of trump s household dreamed he would be dominating the republican field with three weeks to go before the iowa caucuses given the way he has set the agenda for the campaign it s tempting to call him a master strategist except i don t believe he has a strategy or needs one instead trump is guided by instinct the whole campaign has been like his stream of consciousness twitter feed or his improvisational jazz riff campaign speeches he tests a new theme and gauges the response if it s working he pushes harder if not he moves on kick out the illegal immigrants and build a wall on the border bar muslims from entry because they might be terrorists abolish gun free zones even in schools many of trump s positions are abhorrent many are inconsistent with traditional american values republican party dogma various articles of the constitution and trump s own views in the past but substance is in a way less important than style trump couldn t possibly do half of what he promises and probably doesn t really want to do much of the rest the important thing is that trump by being transgressive in the way he speaks gives listeners the license to be transgressive in the way they think when he rails against political correctness he s talking about the manners and courtesies that many of us would call being civil but his in your face bullying strikes a chord with the large segment of the republican electorate that is tired of being polite lower middle class non college educated white voters who have not prospered over the past two decades and see demographic change as a threat trump was quick to understand how angry the republican base is with the party establishment vote for us gop leaders said and we ll stop illegal immigration repeal the affordable care act slash spending to the bone reduce the long term federal debt and basically stop everything president obama is trying to do they failed to deliver and now someone is calling them on it for trump saying outrageous things that would end any other politician s campaign or career is no risk on the contrary it s a necessity his appeal to primary voters involves a bald faced appeal to racial and ethnic animus he gives his supporters permission to bemoan the fact that they mexicans and muslims primarily but also african americans and uppity women are changing the nation trump s arena size rallies have become set pieces in which big boisterous crowds get to act out their make america great again fantasies if protesters didn t show up to advocate the black lives matter movement or tolerance toward muslims trump would have to hire actors to play those parts antagonists are necessary for the moments of catharsis when interlopers are identified scorned and physically ejected it is theater not politics a symbolic enactment of the grand purification trump promises the other candidate touching a nerve with the cultural and economic left behinds minus the racism is sen bernie sanders the vermont independent who is also kind of an un politician this is a bad year to rule anything out so maybe sanders will win both iowa and new hampshire and go on to seriously challenge hillary clinton for the democratic nomination but if he falls short the eventual gop nominee will face a formidable and experienced politician who cannot possibly run as anti establishment if the republican nominee is trump do you believe for a minute he would consider himself bound by the things he said during the primaries i don t trump can hardly back away from his categorical pledge on immigration to expel 11 million undocumented migrants and build a wall along the border with mexico so maybe that would energize latino voters in support of clinton but he would do everything possible to lower passions among other loyal democrats while stoking them among the new take back the country voters he hopes to turn out how disgusted is the country with traditional politics and politicians democrats had better explore that question or be surprised by the answer read more from eugene robinson s archive follow him on twitter or subscribe to his updates on facebook
