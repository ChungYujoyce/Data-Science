2016 in large part by stoking racist fears about non white immigrants a key feature of the speech announcing his candidacy rapists criminals drug dealers and while he s never strayed from the hateful rhetoric he knows his supporters love as president he s had to make room on his plate for other issues too like self defeating trade wars with china possible real wars with north korea one sided feuds with pro athletes and at least four to six hours of cable news a day but with make or break midterm elections looming and the very real possibility that republicans will lose the house the president has redoubled his efforts to get the base all riled up about scary brown people essentially suggesting that he s the only thing standing between them and democrats enacting a new policy wherein for every migrant allowed to stay in the country three u s citizens have to go live in guatemala this began last week when trump threatened to cut off aid to countries whose citizens attempted to cross the southern border and it was further amplified on monday when he tweeted with no evidence whatsoever that criminals and unknown middle easterners are mixed into the migrant caravan moving toward the u s calling the fake situation a national emergy sic and now there s this president trump is considering taking executive action to bar migrants including asylum seekers from entering the country at the southern border according to people familiar with the plan three people briefed on the plan said it would invoke broad presidential powers to bar foreigners from entering the country for national security reasons under the same section of immigration law that underpinned the travel ban to block central american migrants from crossing the southern border they said at the same time the administration would put in place new rules that would disqualify migrants who cross the border in between ports of entry from claiming asylum according to those briefed mr trump is weighing the new measures as he prepares to order 800 to 1 000 united states army troops to help secure the southern border defense department officials said on thursday jim mattis the defense secretary was expected to sign papers in the coming days to send the troops they will include engineers to help with the construction of tents and fencing doctors for medical support and potentially some personnel to operate drones along the border the officials said speaking on the condition of anonymity because the deployment had not yet been finished american immigration law says that people arriving at ports of entry on the united states border have a right to seek asylum as do those apprehended crossing the border without authorization if they are able to demonstrate a credible fear of returning home but president border wall who has no idea how the law actually works has painted those fleeing violence and persecution and those simply thumbing their noses at immigration laws for yuks as one and the same to those in the caravan turnaround sic we are not letting people into the united states illegally trump wrote on twitter thursday go back to your country and if you want apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing as many have pointed out it s unlikely that the spanish speaking asylum seekers have the wi fi necessary to read this message which almost makes it appear as though it was actually addressed to his base human rights and immigrant advocacy groups have unsurprisingly panned trump s transparent attempt to instill fear in voters just before the midterm elections the approach of a caravan of migrants that includes refugees fleeing persecution and violence is not a crisis but president trump is yet again spreading hatred and fear hoping to score political points by making americans fear refugees mike breen the chief executive of human rights first told the new york times meanwhile when asked if there was any scenario in which people who force their way across the border could be shot at homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen told fox news we do not have any intention right now to shoot at people emphasis ours because that sure sounds like a roundabout way of saying some people might get shot who knows if you would like to receive the levin report in your inbox daily click here to subscribe trump s trade war is totally going according to plan nothing is f ked when donald trump launched his trade war with china he promised that the pain of slapping tariffs on billions of dollars worth of imports and the ensuing retaliatory levies on u s goods would all be worth it for the avalanche of jobs to which the putative measures would lead and for once in his presidency he may have been right there s a good chance new jobs will come out of all of this in china per the new york times bmw the largest exporter of cars from the united states has already moved some production of its popular x3 sport utility vehicle once made exclusively in spartanburg s c to a factory in shenyang china analysts expect the german automaker to also move some production of its larger x5 by shifting production bmw can avoid china s punitive tariffs on cars imported from the united states which have ensnared foreign automakers with large american factories it could also insulate bmw if mr trump follows through on his threat to tax imported vehicles and parts a move that would further increase the cost of building cars in the united states and selling them abroad the chinese government unsurprisingly is all for this expansion letting bmw up its stake in a joint venture from 50 percent to 75 percent an unprecedented majority share for a foreign carmaker other car companies that could follow suit include mercedes benz which employs roughly 4 000 workers at a factory in alabama and volvo which opened a plant in south carolina in june south carolina you might recall was all about donald trump back in november 2016 but perhaps that may change people vote with their pocketbooks h david britt a member of the spartanburg county council told the times i m not suggesting south carolina would go democrat but when people start losing jobs a lot can happen the president is super mad about the bombs sent to prominent democrats and members of the media you can tell by the way he calls out supporters for chanting about one of the targets telling them that such a thing is totally inappropriate in any setting but particularly at the white house and that they really need to get over their deranged ideas about george soros being some kind of liberal boogeyman as it leads to crackpots putting bombs in people s mailboxes oh wait that never happened https twitter com jordanfabian status 1055865508397019137 but seriously trump is really upset
