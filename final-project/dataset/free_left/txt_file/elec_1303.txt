the big idea assuming ted cruz wins the wisconsin primary tonight expect most of the media coverage to focus on the increasing likelihood of a contested republican convention cruz is trying to win a clean sweep of all 42 delegates from the badger state last minute attack ads against john kasich are part of an effort to run the table delegates are apportioned by congressional districts and there are one or two of eight total where the texan believes he s within the margin of error with trump polls show most of kasich s supporters in wisconsin would pick cruz over trump as their second choice kasich s folks would be inclined to go with cruz says marquette pollster charles franklin there s very little evidence that they d go over to trump kasich wants to win some delegates to show that he s running a credible campaign he s eyeing the district that includes the liberal college town of madison which is represented by democratic rep mark pocan the ohio governor has begun to argue that it is mathematically impossible for cruz to win a delegate majority he needs 102 percent of the delegates going forward kasich said of cruz at a short press conference outside theodore roosevelt s old home on long island last night the 102 percent numbers came from a wall street journal story with more nuance than kasich offered the journal also said trump needs to get 66 percent of the remaining bound delegates left to be awarded which will become a heavier lift after wisconsin cruz has been awarded 463 delegates and must take 102 percent of remaining bound delegates to reach 1 237 reid epstein writes in the journal though his campaign believes its total is higher because of private commitments made by unbound delegates and delegates now tied to candidates who have suspended their campaigns there are other counts that show cruz could technically still win outright but it s hard to imagine anyone pulling away decisively with the race as muddied as it has become the hope of putting cruz out of outright contention for the first ballot comes in new york where 95 delegates wait to be assigned and an average of polls collected by realclearpolitics puts trump 32 points ahead of the field david weigel who is traveling with kasich explains a result like that would end cruz s ability to reach 1 237 in pledged delegates unless a deal were worked out with a defeated candidate whose delegates are currently adrift trump and cruz each believe they are hurt most by kasich staying in the race kasich also thinks that neither of his rivals could win a general election and that anything could happen in a contested convention even if he s very likely to come into cleveland having only won his home state of ohio cruz is saying he s taking my voters trump is saying he s taking my voters yeah they re right they re both right kasich said i m taking both of their voters because we re going to continue to do well after staying out of the fray for months the ohioanhas shown a new willingness over the past week to hit trump and cruz more directly and forcefully this could make him a much more consequential player during the three months leading up to the convention yesterday in new york for instance he called cruz a smear artist we have one guy with no experience and the other guy whose experience amounts to shutting down the government and calling the majority leader a liar said kasich how do we go to a convention and we pick somebody that can t beat hillary while you were sleeping a game for the ages villanova beat north carolina in the ncaa title game forward kris

written to the post s bob woodward and robert costa trump says he will threaten to cut off the flow of billions of dollars in payments that immigrants send home to mexico an idea that could decimate the mexican economy and set up an unprecedented showdown between the u s and a key diplomatic ally entitled compelling mexico to pay for the wall the memo is the latest attempt by trump to offer more specifics about his proposal at a time when he faces tough head winds the memo includes rationales for a number of potential intimidation tactics including increased trade tariffs the cancellation of visas and higher fees for border crossing cards trump s national lead dipped only slightly after a rough week according to the nbc news surveymonkey tracking poll while the real estate mogul still leads the republican field his national lead dropped by three points from 48 percent to 45 percent cruz is at 28 percent and kasich is at 18 percent trump also fell four points with voters who

sanders reported 125 843 in total income the publication s scathing article notes that sanders had dismissed the idea of charities in his early days as mayor and that view was confirmed in his 1995 tax return which showed sanders donated just 1 percent of his income 1 369 to charity actor tim robbins stumpingfor sanders in wisconsin said clinton s victory in south carolina was as significant as winning guam because no democrat will ever carry the state in a general election philip bump explains why this is a bad argument robbins s real point the real frustration of the anti clinton left is why do these victories have so much significance in other words why are these lopsided wins in the south so important when clinton and sanders have played to ties in so many other places what you need

theater is barely half full with no lines outside pic twitter com lssm6qw6rh the upshot s nate cohn argues that trump s struggle in wisconsin is more the result of demographics than momentum all considered the model based estimates make mr trump a five point underdog with a 40 35 edge for mr cruz he writes in today s times to get a sense of whether mr trump really lost ground after his controversial remarks the key number to watch is 35 percent the expected share of the vote for mr trump based on the results so far if he falls short he has lost ground because of momentum not demographics local newspapers are urging residents to be prepared for record voter turnout despite forecasts for rain and snow the milwaukee journal sentinel reports the state issued 214 500 early voting ballots as of friday more than double the 94 000 ballots issued in 2012 the higher turnout is expected to benefit sanders who continued to add last minute stops if there is a large turnout we

appears to have bolstered his prospects against trump in the republican race meanwhile the two democrat rivals are using walker as a punching bag criticizing his anti union policies and spending priorities when you want to think about a sanders administration think about walker in reverse sanders said what s more surprising is that trump has repeatedly attacked walker people are saying he shouldn t be fighting the governor the governor s popular said trump first of all he s not popular i think i made him unpopular in the state and the fact is he s doing very mediocre in his closing argument sanders hit clinton pretty hard on labor and trade i am not a candidate who goes to the unions goes to workers then leaves and goes to a fundraiser on wall street he said i m glad that she s

back every republican presidential nominee since 1972 and one of just four states to back all but one on the democratic side more on the republican race cruz leans on allied super pac as nomination

super pac that has effectively served as an extension of cruz s official campaign cruz has appeared at nearly 20 ktp organized rallies as a special guest in an arrangement that takes advantage of federal rules governing how campaigns and pacs interact ktp s move into event production shows how super pacs allied with 2016 s presidential candidates have expanded portfolios beyond television

kelly and audience members at a town hall event monday early in the event a woman who described herself as a moderate pro choice republican told cruz she s afraid if he becomes president he will outlaw abortion entirely cruz said he wants to see people s hearts and minds changed on the issue he argued laws should be changed at the state level not through judicial decisions he also said he believes the supreme court s roe v wade decision is not settled law calling it an example of judicial activism kelly then noted that cruz doesn t favor exceptions to allow abortion in cases of rape or incest full quote from cruz when it comes to rape rape is a horrific crime against the humanity of a person and needs to be punished and punished severely but at the same time as horrible as that crime is i don t believe it s the child s fault and we weep at the crime we want to do everything we can to prevent the crime on the front end and to punish the criminal but i don t believe it makes

divisive battle over gay marriage on the party s official national platform both sides are mobilizing in anticipation of a bitter clash over whether the party should embrace a more moderate approach

sticks to republican script on supreme court nomination by kelsey snell in rock rapids iowa despite massive pressure from democrats the judiciary committee chairman is sticking steadfastly to his vow not to hold hearings or a confirmation vote on garland before november s elections for grassley 82 the political calculus is pretty simple conservatives have posed a problem for grassley in the past six years ago when he was last up for reelection he faced an uprising from the right for trying to craft a bipartisan health care plan with then sen max baucus d mont grassley abandoned those plans in summer 2009 and is not keen on facing another conservative insurrection in 2016 i m not surprised with the pressure i m getting now but it s a lot more fun to have it come from the democrats than it is from republicans grassley said tuesday as he headed for his car at the end of one of nine meetings with iowa voters in two days right leaning groups are backing up the senator more than left leaning groups are attacking him the anti abortion rights group susan b anthony list is buying television and radio ads and the judicial crisis network has spent over 750 000 on the other side liberal group justice not politics led by a group of female iowa politicians intends to spend about 100 000 on ads that urge voters to call grassley and demand he hold hearings be vigilant and careful the strange seasonality of violence by michael s rosenwald mass murder researchers and terrorism experts do not like turning their calendars to april for them it marks the beginning of what one calls the killing season april is the month of the oklahoma city bombing the boston marathon bombing the shootings at columbine and virginia tech in 2007 as well as waco s attack and a stabbing in pennsylvania but why would april with cheerful tulips and spring sunshine trigger so much extreme violence some say warm temperatures could actually be a contributing factor stirring action among the depressed and socially isolated you have these people coming out of hibernation with anger peaked and ready to go said professor adam lankford adding that rage may build by seeing people out in groups that highlights discrepancies between socially healthy individuals and those who aren t another factor is the desire to pay homage to other violent anniversaries on april 19 1992 thefbi stormed a compound to capture the branch davidians sect leader killing 76 people and two years later timothy mcveigh blew up a federal building in oklahoma city on the same day terrorists consider dates to be very
