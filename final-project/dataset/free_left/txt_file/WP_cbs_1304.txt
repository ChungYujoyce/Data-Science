as she leaves her position as head of the international monetary fund to run the european central bank christine lagarde tells john dickerson about the possible signs of a global recession with the global economy at risk of recession the man for the job is a woman since 2011 christine lagarde has been managing emergencies as head of the trillion dollar international monetary fund before that she was france s finance minister during the great recession in november she will take on a new crisis as president of the european central bank trying to keep the world s second largest economy stable as it is battered by trade wars brexit and historic uncertainty last month we spent time with lagarde in france and in washington d c during a rare pause between jobs she was surprisingly candid about the danger of a global recession the threat of nationalism and what she says is a big question mark in the global economy president donald trump john dickerson when you think of the challenges to the global economy where is donald trump on that list christine lagarde i think he has many keys that would unlock the uncertainty and the risks john dickerson what are some of those keys that he has christine lagarde i think the biggest key that president trump has is in relation to predictability and and certainty of the terms of trade it s the unknown which is hurting because you can t adjust to the unknown so what do you do you build buffers you build savings you wonder what comes next that s not propitious to economic development john dickerson people stop taking risks christine lagarde yeah they sit on their cash the imf the international monetary fund which christine lagarde led for eight years says the instability caused by the u s china trade war is the main reason why global growth is estimated to fall this year to its slowest pace since the 2008 financial crisis last week president trump announced preliminary steps to a partial deal with china but the biggest and toughest issues remain john dickerson the trade war between the united states and china is it possible that it could tip the global economy in the wrong direction christine lagarde it s certainly going to give a big haircut to the global economy and if you shave off you know almost a percentage point of growth that means less investment less jobs more unemployment reduced growth so of course it has an impact john dickerson what s gonna happen christine lagarde my very very strong message to all policymakers is please sit down like big men many men in those rooms and put everything on the table and try to deal bit by bit piece by piece so that we have certainty christine lagarde has spent her career telling men what to do and she ll keep doing that as the first woman to head the ecb the european central bank it s like the u s federal reserve but for 19 countries known as the eurozone last month lagarde invited us to visit her in normandy france near where she grew up john dickerson across the channel in great britain they are in the middle of brexit what does brexit mean to you christine lagarde to me personally it s a source of great sadness and to see them drifting away from the european union is sad at the ecb lagarde will be tasked with keeping europe the world s second largest economy afloat in the midst of brexit john dickerson what will the fallout be economically christine lagarde it will affect both the uk and certain countries in the european union ireland in particular germany the netherlands and everybody will be a little less well off as a result john dickerson why is that important to americans if the european union thrives christine lagarde if things go wrong in one part of the world it is going to affect the rest of the world as well we buy american products in huge quantities the united states buys european products in huge quantities massive numbers of european firms have set up shops in the us vice versa we penetrate each other s markets if there is a core belief that guides lagarde s life and her economic outlook it s that we are all in this together christine lagarde you know when i was growing up i think there was a huge gratitude towards the allies the americans it was here on omaha beach where americans landed on d day in 1944 today lagarde hears echoes of the anger that led to world war ii in nationalist leaders who turn their countries inward shoving everyone else away christine lagarde nationalism in europe is associated with very very horrible developments that always led to war president trump at rally you know what i am i m a nationalist ok john dickerson president trump has called himself a nationalist he s proud of the nationalist label this is a big debate this is the central debate you could argue on the global stage as countries decide maybe this idea of interconnectedness is not so wonderful christine lagarde international trade connections movement of people and movement of capital has taken hundreds of millions out of poverty now some people in the advanced economies might say pooh what do i care well of course we care for the person next door and because of the interconnections next door is not down the pathway next door is everywhere around the world and if my neighbors from across a border are feeling desperate are starving are fighting there will be consequences back at home john dickerson do you think the president who believes in walls gives a strong argument to people who make the opposite case from the one you make christine lagarde but you know what can walls do about pandemics what can walls do about terrorism what can walls do about climate change and destruction of the environment this is not the answer to the global questions and issues that interconnect whether we like it or not but that message enrages people who don t want global bureaucracies like the imf telling them how to live their lives and who think leaders like lagarde are elitist and out of touch john dickerson what happens though when somebody says madame lagarde you are the global elite christine lagarde i think i m also a very regular down to earth person and i m proud to participate in the intellectual effort that we put in order to bring about that stability financially so that people are protected people are more secure at the european central bank lagarde faces weak growth spurred by a slump in manufacturing raising fears of a european recession what s worse lagarde s main tool to stimulate the economy lowering interest rates may be useless that s because in europe rates are already negative which was once unthinkable christine lagarde there s a limit to what central bankers can do there s a limit to how far and how deep you go into negative territory john dickerson so there s a bottom christine lagarde there s a bottom to everything but we re not at that bottom at this point in time president trump likes the idea of low even negative interest rates so much that he s spiked the decades long tradition of presidents not interfering with the federal reserve even calling the chairman jerome powell and his colleagues boneheads for not cutting rates more lagarde s advice for the president be cautious christine lagarde when the unemployment rate is at 3 7 you don t want to accelerate that too much by lowering interest rates because the risk you take is that then prices begin to go up you have to be very careful you know it s like navigating a plane and you have to watch everything altitude speed winds and that s what a central banker has to do john dickerson if you re a pilot looking at all of those delicate measures do you want a leader behind you saying you re a bonehead christine lagarde a central bank governor does best his job if he is independent john dickerson you ve met president trump would you talk to him about this and make the case that you ve had about independence of central bankers christine lagarde absolutely john dickerson and what would you say christine lagarde market stability should not be the subject of a tweet here or a tweet there it requires consideration thinking quiet and measured and rational decisions and for those qualities lagarde instructs bring in the women they are better at judging risk she believes famously saying if the investment bank lehman brothers which triggered the 2008 financial crisis had been lehman sisters the whole mess might have been avoided christine lagarde do you know how many women are president of banks two percent this is ridiculously low because women around the world in most families women generally handle the money and they do that pretty well there is a clear correlation between good solid management good attitude towards risk and the number of women on board and executive boards as well christine lagarde poverty is sexist and we have to remember that and make sure that women are not forgotten now 63 lagarde has become a global force not just for what she says about women but because she acts on it for the first time in its history lagarde has tied imf loans to improving conditions for women in countries like argentina and jordan and take a look at what the imf staff looks like now under lagarde the percentage of women working at the imf has grown to 44 she s charming but exacting lagarde has locked conference room doors not allowing anyone to leave until consensus is reached and she has announced she will not attend meetings where she is the only woman in the room john dickerson you once described yourself as bossy you know bossy is now a dirty word christine lagarde i don t mind laugh john dickerson you don t mind christine lagarde you know sometimes you have to be a boss john dickerson is there a french idiom for bossy that feels like a very american word christine lagarde you use boss in french c est le boss elle est le boss but there is an element of respect about it when you say it in french c est le boss as volatile as the global economy may be lagarde is not she is controlled even on vacation at her home in normandy she gave us a glimpse of how finely calibrated that control is john dickerson you have learned how to pretend you re drinking wine when you re not drinking wine christine lagarde yes yes john dickerson how do i pretend to drink wine but not drink it christine lagarde oh okay i ll show you i ll do it with water so you go you have to smell terribly important then you go you move it around to check the color then you go very important watch this here you go i didn t drink anything john dickerson that s dangerous you re going to keep your wits about you christine lagarde yeah glasses were raised weeks later to honor lagarde s time at the imf she bid farewell to an institution formed in america to ensure global cooperation as she starts her new job she worries that the country which has helped preserve stability during her lifetime may now be the one weakening it christine lagarde i was brought up as a citizen of this world the risk i see is that the united states is at risk of losing leadership and that would be just a terrible development john dickerson because christine lagarde because it has been a force for good and for those principles that i respect highly the rule of law democracy free market and consideration for the individual and and respect it s the same message the allies sent to the world 75 years ago on these shores we re all in this together produced by denise schrier cetta associate producer katie brennan john dickerson is the co
