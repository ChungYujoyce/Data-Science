we didn t even get through the first five minutes of applications a jpmorgan chase senior banking executive said the bank received over 60 000 applicants for the paycheck protection program within those first five minutes a senior executive at chase said when funds ran dry after less than two weeks only 27 000 loans had ultimately been approved chase said after reports revealed details about which companies had been successful in securing emergency funding small business owners across america were angry about having never made their way to the front of the line but according to some large lenders there was no time for a line the ceo of an independent bank said it was like a stampede through the eye of a needle a senior bank of america executive said that on the first day alone the bank received over 10 000 applications per hour the bank had just thousands of those approved by the sba ceo brian moynihan said during an earnings call last week separately wells fargo said the sba had approved a total of 1 051 applications for 120 million over 170 000 expressions of interest were filed with the bank within just the first two days the bank said the high demand outstripped penalty restrictions on its ability to lend that were imposed by federal regulators two years ago following a fake account scandal wells fargo s participation in the sba coronavirus loans program was initially capped at 10 billion but on april 8 the federal reserve allowed a temporary relief from those limits more than 1 8 trillion may be ultimately needed to meet the needs of small business
