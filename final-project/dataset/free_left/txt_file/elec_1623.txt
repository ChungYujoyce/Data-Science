 by farah stockman oct 23 2016 in june in san jose calif a tug of war over a sign supporting donald j trump sent one man to jail for six days and another man to soul searching this is their story it was a fleeting confrontation between two strangers that might have otherwise been forgotten but the tussle over a donald j trump campaign sign after a june rally in san jose calif has already sent one man anthony mcbride to jail for six days and left another steven tong lamenting the loss of civility in our democracy the rally where these two lives collided by happenstance erupted into one of the most violent episodes of this contentious presidential election video footage of protesters punching egging and tackling trump supporters went viral sparking outrage among republicans and soul searching among democrats today the clashes between ordinary people like mr mcbride and mr tong are playing out in the california courts in a series of criminal prosecutions brought about as republican officials accused a city led by democrats of failing to protect trump supporters at the rally the san jose rally and its aftermath may be the most powerful illustrations of the dangerous polarization that has gripped the country during the 2016 election but a closer look at mr tong one of rally s 24 victims and mr mcbride one of 22 people charged with crimes after the event suggests that there is much that the two men share the economic struggles and personal dreams that guided them that day are not so different after all on june 2 mr tong woke up in his parents house where he has lived for the past three years ever since he found himself unable to afford a place of his own he is 46 an age he does not like saying out loud because it reminds him how far he is from where he had hoped to be he had dreamed of becoming a product designer and starting his own company but art school was too expensive and he left after only a year companies like facebook and these so called social networking companies here in silicon valley became the economy he said if your occupation is in anything other than that he added there are not a whole lot of jobs mr tong s faith in the american dream has been shaken but that day he had a ticket to see mr trump speak about making america great again despite the sweltering heat mr tong parked in the garage at the san jose convention center and walked a few blocks to the rally that same morning anthony mcbride who is anti trump woke up in his friend s mother s apartment where he has lived for the past three years ever since he found himself unable to afford a place of his own he is 21 too young to carry the stain of life s disappointments he dreams of being a fashion designer and starting his own company but art school is too expensive he works two jobs at a car dealership and a clothing store to save for it he also designs shirts that read be yrslf he hopes they will inspire a movement where people are just being themselves and are not following trends or what society says they have to be he said mr mcbride s faith in the american dream remains intact but it is marred by the bigotry that he sees as a product of mr trump s campaign on the morning of the rally mr mcbride put on a be yrslf t shirt and boarded the light rail to the convention center eager to see for himself what a trump event was really like it was hot that day mr tong recalled i was still debating whether or not i wanted to go and i just kind of thought oh i got to show my support in the convention hall mr tong delighted in the diverse makeup of the crowd i was really surprised he said a rally he had attended earlier in the spring in southern california he said was mostly caucasian and middle aged but in san jose a city that is about 30 percent asian and 30 percent hispanic more minorities turned out outside the hall beyond the police barricades protesters waved signs demanding socialism young men handed out the revolutionary communist party s newspaper like many asians in san jose mr tong was born in vietnam he was 4 when communists captured saigon his family had three strikes against it his father had worked with the united states military his grandfather had an import export business and they hailed from china a country that once colonized vietnam officials forced mr tong s family to move to a remote hut with a dirt floor the communist philosophy was if you are a teacher a professor an intellectual wealthy then we are going to make you suffer mr tong said when he was 9 his family made it to california like others who had fled vietnam they embraced the republican party s strong anticommunism stance mr tong considers himself a moderate during the booming 1990s he once cast a ballot for bill clinton he says he does not agree with mr trump s remarks about immigrants and mexicans still mr tong feels anxious about the racial unrest flaring up across the country like many trump supporters he blames president obama he seems more polarizing mr tong said of mr obama he stirs people up mr tong once felt boundless optimism about the united states his parents who worked entry level jobs in electronics had been able to buy a three bedroom home in a well off san jose suburb but now mr tong cannot afford to rent let alone buy a home of his own he was drawn to the june rally by mr trump s promise to make america as strong as it was when mr tong arrived in the country mr trump took the stage and declared we have a country that s not working anymore we have a chance to be greater than ever before he told the crowd mr tong left the rally clutching a sign the silent majority stands with trump he meandered back to his car chatting with a teenager from mexico who held a sign opposing trump they joked about trading signs nothing seemed threatening or out of the ordinary but when mr tong reached the parking garage he witnessed something shocking protesters trying to steal trump hats off the heads of an older hispanic couple he added at that moment i felt the whole crowd surrounding me you re fearing for your life mr tong ran into the garage he noticed a tall black man coming behind him it was mr mcbride s day off he recalled i slept in watched some tv he said while checking twitter he noticed that mr trump was coming to town mr mcbride hoped to get into the rally to go experience what he says for myself he said but a wall of police officers blocked the entrance so he drifted to the free speech area where protesters including some friends from oak grove where he had gone to high school gathered mr mcbride had fond memories of oak grove even though he was asked to leave it in his senior year he had attended a basketball game against a suburban school from a more affluent community rival fans chanted that oak grove students were on welfare mr mcbride said he and his friends responded with their own chant we drive sober a painful reference to a drunken driving death the rival school had recently suffered afterward mr mcbride said school authorities asked him to finish his credits with independent study the school s principal declined to comment at the time mr mcbride lived with his aunt who told him he had to be in school to stay with her he ended up on the couch in the apartment of his best friend s mother three years later he is still there mr mcbride considers himself a moderate he opposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants he believes that the entrepreneurial spirit should be rewarded but it is racism not government regulation of the economy that worries him the son of an african american father and an irish mother he has not seen since he was 4 mr mcbride blames the recent racial unrest on injustice not democratic politicians people are just frustrated he said with police brutality with feeling not equal to white people to mr mcbride s generation the spate of high profile police killings of black people shows the limits of politics and the need for activism protests not the election of a black president have brought a modicum of justice joining the gathering crowd outside the convention center mr mcbride felt he had justice on his side at first he said it felt like a carnival outside the arena people danced to mexican music street vendors sold watermelon but then the rally inside ended trump supporters poured out protesters chanted obscenities at them they hurled insults back a blonde woman named rachel casey who was wearing a trump shirt filmed herself sticking her middle finger up at the crowd protesters traded insults with her as she drifted past the police barricades to the marriott hotel next door protesters surrounded her in the doorway then someone threw a piece of watermelon i was in the front just clapping mr mcbride said someone in the back started throwing eggs one of them hit me i was like wow who brought eggs a hotel security guard opened the door and ms casey slipped inside the crowd marched on a black female protester burning an american flag got into a shoving match with a white female trump supporter a white teenager got scared and started running a black teenager tackled him a first generation mexican who opposes mr trump punched in the nose a third generation mexican who supports the candidate the police later traced the most violent run ins to local gangsters with long criminal records according to sgt brian anderson who headed the san jose police team that pored over thousands of hours of videos from the rally some oak grove high school students were also charged several of them were good students and athletes but they decided to forget their upbringing sergeant anderson said mr mcbride might have fit into in that category he was an athlete but he said his father who works at a warehouse allowed him to play sports only if he got good grades but mr mcbride admits that he got angry that day at the rally he says trump supporters mistook him for mexican and shouted insults at him i heard go back to your country wetback he said he started taking every trump sign he saw and ripping it in half he followed a wave of protesters into a parking garage that s where he spotted an asian man with a trump sign i was kind of disappointed in him mr mcbride recalled he s a minority and i didn t see why he s supporting trump mr mcbride snatched mr tong s sign mr tong grabbed it back for a split second they held it together in a tug of war mr mcbride could see the fear in mr tong s eyes months later mr tong looked back at the encounter and wondered about mr mcbride was he a college student he didn t seem like a gangster mr tong recalled there are protesters who are just upset and i think if i was in their position i d be upset too but no protester no matter how angry they are can break things and harass people maybe because of the stress of what happened to him at the rally mr tong dreams of escaping on election day he thinks about camping in death valley on nov 8 just so he can get away from the news but sometimes he has the opposite desire he wants to visit an old friend a black man he met in a long ago photography class so they can have political debates about mr obama that he keeps bottled up inside meanwhile mr mcbride thinks back on that moment and regrets being the source of mr tong s fear i d probably have been afraid too mr mcbride said i didn t agree with any of the fighting but two weeks after the rally police officers showed up at mr mcbride s job at the mall and asked him to answer some questions mr mcbride who has no criminal record cooperated he did not ask for a lawyer i wasn t scared because i didn t do anything he said he said he told them everything he could remember afterward he expected to be allowed to go home instead they handcuffed him and took him to jail where he remained for six days accused of vandalism battery and the attempted theft of mr tong s sign on a recent wednesday mr mcbride sat in court on a row of benches filled with black and hispanic men nearly all of them represented by a single public defender mcbride you re our trump guy right she asked she explained that because of what he had told the police about the confrontation outside the rally prosecutors were adding a new charge the false imprisonment of ms casey who had been egged we ll try to get it down to disturbing the peace she said i don t know if we re going to get there but that s our goal now mr mcbride who cannot afford a lawyer is not sure if he should plead guilty to a crime he doesn t feel he committed or fight the charges he thinks about that moment when he grabbed mr tong s sign and about what made him let it go i realized it was stupid he recalled if it was on a different street at a different time i probably would have just talked to him about why he was supporting trump but it was not a regular day advertisement
