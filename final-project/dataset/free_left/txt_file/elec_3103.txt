st paul minn with just 66 days to go before the polls closed evan mcmullin made his inaugural campaign stop in one of his most promising states on friday afternoon the nevertrump conservative candidate for president stopped by the booth of minnesota s independence party an outgrowth of ross perot s and jesse ventura s campaigns that successfully petitioned him onto the ballot he s the alternative said a party volunteer to passersby what took you so long yelled a fairgoer that s a good question said mcmullin standing below a photo of himself and the message that it was never too late to do the right thing i was waiting for someone else to run and no one did i believe both hillary clinton and donald trump are unfit for the presidency and it s time for a new generation of leadership in this country less than a month after announcing his first bid for office one that was not likely to end up on most states ballots mcmullin drew a steady crowd for an hour that was punctuated with media interviews this has been a very good year for third party candidates who have found a lower barrier to credibility than any of them expected that barrier of course tumbled when clinton and trump won their parties nominations the very first political rally i ever covered in 2000 was for a third party a chicago mega rally for the green party s ralph nader he won just 2 2 percent of the vote in illinois that year and while that safe blue state has been only lightly polled this year the anybody else vote is likely to soar past that why you can probably guess but having spent five of the past nine days with third party candidates i have some extra answers 1 people are actually showing up to see third party candidates that s not always the case nader drew gigantic crowds in 2000 but his fatal success a split in the progressive vote that many of his supporters came to regret helped quash third party momentum from 2004 through 2012 no third party candidate was able to wage a campaign in the way we usually see it with business visits and rallies this year is different the libertarian party s gary johnson and bill weld drew hundreds of people to events in new england last week on a run through colorado last weekend the green party s jill stein filled indoor and outdoor music venues with hundreds more in both cases this took work johnson and stein basically lived on tv for weeks making themselves available for cameras in washington and new york mcmullin did the same drawing a remarkable amount of coverage for a candidacy that is unlikely to make the ballot in california or texas but it did not take much for people to start viewing a third party event as a decent use of an afternoon 2 these events are cultural be ins people who associate with the fringes of american life have the best time at third party rallies marijuana legalization campaigners get signatures at johnson rallies alternative hip hop artists come by jill stein rallies at her denver event an organizer folk singer rewrote phil ochs s love me i m a liberal into a riff on the weak progressives who were settling for hillary clinton i went to occupy ralliesi protested the wto i love rachel maddow and chris matthews and i hope gays get married in droves but you re talking about revolution well sister i surely don t know so love me love me love me i m a liberal there is a family feeling to these events one that keeps people coming back 3 third parties are getting better at organizing affiliates of the green party and the libertarian party have used nationbuilder a cheap organizing software to build and mobilize lists of supporters it s something they have in common with donald trump s campaign scoffed at seen to be a paper tiger that would be devoured by stockier gazelles but the once expensive work of telling supporters where to show up and what to do has become dirt cheap johnson has boasted of the millions of people watching his speeches on facebook stein s campaign plugged her into the unfathomably popular harambe meme which got fresh eyeballs on her campaign even if some were under raised eyebrows 4 many third party voters don t care about policy listening to mcmullin i was struck by how few voters wanted to know about his stances on the issues any issues one asked if he thought wikileaks would torpedo the clinton campaign leading mcmullin to say that he was not a julian assange fan several complained that pollsters did not ask about him for a while his campaign leaflets which deal in light detail with policy went untouched this is not unusual a lot of the upsurge in third party support is attitude based a loose sense that politics are broken and therefore a vote for a nontraditional party will fix it in colorado several stein voters told me that they might vote for gary johnson whose positions on taxes climate change and the role of government itself could not be more different if on election day he seemed to be better positioned for a breakout 5 hey neither do the third parties sort of johnson and weld the highest profile candidates in libertarian history had to fight for their nominations the radical wing of the libertarian party viewed both as interlopers who wanted to turn their party into a diet pepsi version of the gop both were forced onto second ballots at their conventions since then neither the libertarians nor the greens have had to answer many questions about their respective party platforms johnson weld have inspired semiregular condemnation from libertarian blogs and magazines for defending the existence of the federal environmental protection agency or suggesting that some gun restrictions might make sense in colorado stein avoided endorsing a universal health care initiative backed by the local greens the minnesota independence party is campaigning for instant runoff voting something mcmullin did not even address when he stopped by the booth 6 and they re not even seizing on the most popular issues the three most hyped third party candidates johnson stein and mcmullin favor some version of immigration reform as trump has discovered opposition to increased immigration levels is one of the most resonant populist issues there is https twitter com evan mcmullin status 771813295284187136 johnson and mcmullin have little to say about economic inequality and stein talks about it only in the context of her green new deal promising millions of new jobs but as bernie sanders discovered class consciousness and the reality of depressed wages were powerful voter mobilizing topics 7 third party candidates acknowledge that one of the big two parties is better for their voters than the other mcmullin is the least secretive about this his campaign massaged by republican consultants is in some states designed to bring out republicans who might stay home if their options were limited to clinton trump and johnson stein acknowledged it during an interview she gave me in denver and at a news conference last month voters who did not see greens on the ballot for key races she said were probably going to see the most agreement on their issues from democrats no third party is offering a full slate for voters in any state that could start to change this year especially if strong results get them expanded ballot access but it is not changing quickly receive the most
