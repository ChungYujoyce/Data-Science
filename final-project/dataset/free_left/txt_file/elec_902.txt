 we re going to sharpen the message kellyanne conway says by nick gass 08 18 2016 09 43 am edt the woman in charge of running donald trump s campaign wants to let trump be trump but in a more disciplined way kellyanne conway a republican pollster and longtime trump associate who was elevated to be his campaign manager this week indicated thursday in separate television interviews that under her guidance the campaign will be more focused with its messaging while still allowing the boisterous former reality tv star and businessman to be comfortable being in his own skin advertisement what i would like him to do is let everyone get the benefit of his leadership he scores very well in strong leader and that s what so many americans are starving for conway told cnn s alisyn camerota during a lengthy two part interview on new day when trump is able to give a speech in his own words in his own delivery system then people can actually focus on the content conway remarked adding i think that s what s so important trump has repeatedly bucked calls to rein in the kind of brash aggressive rhetoric that has made even republicans uncomfortable though he has delivered several scripted policy speeches in recent weeks i am who i am it s me he told a wisconsin tv station on tuesday i don t wanna change everybody talks about oh well you re gonna pivot you re gonna i don t wanna pivot i mean you have to be you if you start pivoting you re not being honest with people conway suggested in thursday s interviews that the media was to blame for how trump s rhetoric has been perceived if we re going to cover campaigns as comedy shows or no content no substance i think we re doing a disservice to the voters she told cnn when people talk about a pivot alisyn most of the advice he receives whether it s on tv or in person is pivoting stylistically but substantively the issues that benefits donald trump accounting for what will be different about the campaign in the weeks ahead conway said we re going to sharpen the message and we re going to make sure donald trump is comfortable about being in his own skin that he doesn t lose that authenticity that you simply can t buy and a pollster can t give you and voters know if you re comfortable in your own skin she continued and let him be him in this sense he wants to deliver the speech if he wants to go to a rally if he wants to connect with the crowd in a way that s very spontaneous that s wonderful and that s how he got here that s how he became the nominee in large part alisyn but at the same time we have some really serious pressing problems in this country that i m hoping will start to be addressed more by the media by nick gass trump delivered a speech on economic issues last week in detroit followed up by separate speeches on national security in ohio and michigan on monday and tuesday as well as a campaign rally address focused on law and order in wisconsin conway exclaimed that she is thrilled we ve gotten so much coverage this week just on the first two speeches you ll see more of those conway promised next week is immigration week followed by education week and we re really excited about that conway played up the campaign s first general election ad buys set to start running later this week in ohio pennsylvania florida north carolina and virginia she also revealed that the campaign will begin debate prep this weekend though she would not say who would be playing the role of hillary clinton only that it s actually a wonderful choice and i think he ll be very happy with the choice i won t say it because it s private and confidential she said smiling and we have many people who are willing to help on both cnn and on the set of cbs this morning conway noted that trump made no mention of her being a woman as reason for her promotion i m told i m the first female republican campaign manager in presidential political history and that tells you a lot about donald trump it also tells you a great deal about him he never said that to me hey we d like a woman are you available she remarked responding specifically on cbs to a question about what texas sen ted cruz whom conway supported in the primaries does not know about trump i m there based on merit but i think it s symptomatic of who donald trump has been in his own corporation elevating and promoting women she also sought to dampen criticism of trump s new campaign ceo stephen bannon who took a leave of absence from leading the far right conservative breitbart news empire seated across from conway on set cnn s camerota read a list of headlines from the website under bannon including there s no hiring bias against women in tech they just suck at interviews sympathy for the devils the plot against roger ailes and america big trans hate machine targets pitching great curt schilling and birth control makes women unattractive and crazy so i haven t read those stories conway conceded while adding but i can tell you the man is a brilliant tactician he has a long history of i think being unafraid i ll tell you what donald trump needs he needs people who are like him in this sense you have to be unapologetically unflinchingly unafraid of hillary clinton and bill clinton and all that clinton campaign means because we feel like we re up against a major machine here and we you know you need people girded for battle who are at least willing to leave it all on the field give it our best shot the battleground project by steven shepard most reports of trump s campaign shakeup have seen the moves as a downgrade for his embattled chair paul manafort who has faced a number of damaging reports in recent days about his links to pro russian figures in ukraine trump has not yet defended manafort and while the campaign has said he s staying it hasn t publicly clarified who now reports to whom asked on cbs who has the final word conway said i d say it is a combination of us trump has made it very clear who it is perhaps alluding to recent reports that have described the nominee as sullen and erratic behind closed doors conway took pains on both programs to emphasize that mr trump is finding joy in the campaign trail i m confident that he is finding joy on the job this week and he relishes being out there with the crowds and giving these speeches whether as a scripted speech or in a rally setting conway told cbs and you don t see on the camera is also the local interviews the meetings with families and other folks while expressing confidence that trump could remain on message conway added but also the message has to be one of substance and it has to be about issues i d rather lose a campaign where we put it all on the field substantively where people saw the difference on the major issues of the day than when a campaign is based on style if this is about style he can go back to the apprentice that was fun and successful and lucrative for him conway said
