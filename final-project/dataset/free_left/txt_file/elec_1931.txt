 analysis interpretation of the news based on evidence including data as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events with breannedeppisch and joanie greve the big idea the reactions to the allegation that alabama senate candidate roy moore initiated sexual contact with a 14 year old girl when he was a 32 year old assistant district attorney have highlighted deep divisions within the republican party and underscored the growing tribalism that has infected the nation s politics at the capitol establishment republicans expressed alarm if these allegations are true he must step aside senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said in a formal statement on behalf of all republican senators a host of his members made similar comments including jeff flake david perdue john thune cory gardner and pat toomey sen john mccain r ariz was unequivocal the allegations against roy moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying he should immediately step aside and allow the people of alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of sen lisa murkowski r alaska lost a republican primary in 2010 but stayed in the senate by waging a write in campaign against the gop nominee she publicly urged appointed sen luther strange who lost to moore in the september primary to try repeating that feat meanwhile down in montgomery republican leaders mostly circled the wagons behind moore the deadline has passed to take his name off the ballot the alabama state party could disqualify him from the election but there was relatively little appetite locally to do so samuel h givhan the senior vice chairman of the alabama republican party was dismissive when asked about mcconnell s statement i m not sure sen mcconnell has any say so in this he told our michael scherer jonathan p gray a republican consultant in alabama who is not working with any of the senate candidates this year was even more pointed when scherer reached out i think it was already perfectly well stated that no one in alabama gives a s what mitch mcconnell or john mccain thinks we should do the most remarkable pushback came from alabama state auditor jim zeigler who dismissed the allegations by saying that there was also an age gap between the biblical joseph and mary mary was a teenager and joseph was an adult carpenter they became parents of jesus he told the washington examiner there s just nothing immoral or illegal here maybe just a little bit unusual zeigler said the allegations even if true are much ado about nothing as part of his defense he argued that moore fell in love with one of the younger women and noted that the woman he wound up marrying later on is 14 years younger than him there is nothing to see here zeigler said predicting that voters would be angrier at the washington post for writing the story than at moore for his behavior he made another biblical reference zachariah was extremely old to marry elizabeth and they became the parents of john the baptist he said the republican national committeeman from alabama paul reynolds said that he trusts vladimir putin more than moore s accusers my gosh it s the washington post if i ve got a choice of putting my welfare into the hands of putin or the washington post putin wins every time he told the hill this is going to make roy moore supporters step up to the plate and give more work more and pray more alabama gov kay ivey r who got the job this year when republican robert bentley resigned in disgrace to avoid jail time called the allegations deeply disturbing but then she stressed that she will withhold judgment until we know the facts the chairman of the bibb county republican party jerry pow said that he d vote for moore even if it was proved he committed a sex crime against an underage girl i would vote for judge moore because i wouldn t want to vote for doug he told the toronto star referring to democratic candidate doug jones i m not saying i support what he did the same reporter heard similar things from other local party leaders he called yeah covington county gop chairman william blocker tells me he d consider voting moore even if hard proof of sexual abuse emerged there is no option to support to support doug jones the democratic nominee when you do that you are supporting the entire democrat party for its part the white house is trying to thread the needle like most americans the president does not believe we can allow a mere allegation in this case one from many years ago to destroy a person s life press secretary sarah huckabee sanders told reporters accompanying president trump as he flew from china to vietnam overnight however the president also believes that if these allegations are true judge moore will do the right thing and step aside vice president pence also found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes if true this would disqualify anyone from serving in office added alyssa farah his spokeswoman moore vehemently denies any wrongdoing he defiantly pledged in a flurry of tweets last night that he will not step aside referring to his opponents and the mainstream media as evil the obama clinton machine

access hollywood obtained by the washington post this is just the latest in a string of character tests that republicans have faced in the past few years many but not all have related to trump scores of gop leaders who bristled after the access hollywood tape emerged in october 2016 chose just days later to rally behind trump anyway republicans came to greg gianforte s defense after he admitted physically assaulting a reporter this june and he won a special election to keep montana s sole house seat in gop hands in 2012 the national republican senatorial committee publicly announced that it was abandoning gop nominee todd akin in the missouri senate race after he declared that legitimate rape does not lead to unwanted pregnancies because he said the female body has ways of shutting them down but when polls showed that akin was within striking distance of beating sen claire mccaskill d mo senate republican leaders quietly reversed themselves and funneled nearly 1 million to fund a last minute tv ad blitz on his behalf in those three cases republican leaders in washington stomached their initial concerns and chose to prioritize politics above principles with moore making clear that he will not step aside now they face another legacy defining test will they follow their moral compasses or their political ones if not here where will they draw the line to be sure the stakes are very high in the dec 12 special election to replace jeff sessions who resigned to become attorney general republicans only have a two seat majority in the senate and they ve struggled to get 50 votes for priorities like repealing obamacare if democratic candidate doug jones wins he will hold the seat through at least 2020 and his party will have a clearer path to retaking the majority next

between the ages of 16 and 18 when they said the incidents occurred if you haven t seen the piece yet take the time to read the whole thing this is the lead anecdote leigh corfman says she was 14 years old when an older man approached her outside a courtroom in etowah county ala she was sitting on a wooden bench with her mother they both recall when the man introduced himself as roy moore it was early 1979 and moore was a 32 year old assistant district attorney he struck up a conversation corfman and her mother say and offered to watch the girl while her mother went inside for a child custody hearing he said oh you don t want her to go in there and hear all that i ll stay out here with her says corfman s mother nancy wells 71 i thought how nice for him to want to take care of my little girl alone with corfman moore chatted with her and asked for her phone number she says days later she says he picked her up around the corner from her house in gadsden drove her about 30 minutes to his home in the woods told her how pretty she was and kissed her on a second visit she says he took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes he touched her over her bra and underpants she says and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear i wanted it over with i wanted out she remembers thinking please just get this over with whatever this is just get it over corfman says she asked moore to take her home and he did aside from corfman three other women interviewed by thepost in recent weeks say moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s episodes they say they found flattering at the time but troubling as they got older the stories are not the product of opposition research hypocrisy alert moore says he s the candidate of traditional values but historically the behavior that he s accused of would not be tolerated by voters especially evangelicals think about how some of these same people in alabama might respond if a democratic senate candidate was accused of the same stuff recall the reaction to bill clinton in the 1990s and more recently liberal donor harvey weinstein the fix s amber phillips made a list of 13 self righteous things that moore has said about sex and morality remember moore has been removed twice as chief justice of the alabama supreme court for refusing to follow federal court orders related to the separation of church and state he argues unabashedly that his personal interpretation of the bible trumps the u s supreme court s interpretation of the constitution in 2003 he disregarded a court order to remove a ten commandments monument from the state judicial building in 2016 he was suspended after trying to block the implementation of the scotus ruling that legalizedsame sex marriage unpacking the tale of two parties theme outsider republicans around the country rose to moore s defense fox news host sean hannity described moore s actions as beyond reprehensible if they are true but then he stressed to his viewers that they should not rush to judgment this should transcend politics however everyone also has the right to defend their name how do we ascertain what happened 38 years ago if in this case let s say the allegations turned out to be not true where would judge moore go to get his good name back before an election former white house chief strategist stephen k bannon who now runs breitbart and went all in to help moore win the gop primary dismissed the story as nothing more than a smear campaign speaking in new hampshire last night he noted that the post broke both the story about moore and revealed the access hollywood tape now is that a coincidence breitbart editor joel pollak argued that only one of the relationships documented in the post s investigation was problematic the 16 year old and the 18 year old have no business in that story because those are women of legal age of consent he said on msnbc roy moore speaks at a rally in fairhope ala in september brynn anderson ap meanwhile the conservative elites who have traditionally dominated the party but find themselves on the outs in the trump era distanced themselves conservative columnist jonah goldberg argues on national review that saving roy moore isn t worth it the post has offered an enormous amount of evidence i am one of those naive fools who actually believed that the conservatives who often talked the loudest about the supreme importance of character were sincere the last two years disabused me of that but just as a matter of cold realpolitik i cannot grasp why so many people think it s a good idea to stand by a man who if elected will serve as a negative campaign ad made flesh in the long run a senator moore would cost republicans more seats than the one he might give them he d be an albatross for every elected republican including president trump who will be asked to take a side on every scene in the clown show moore would bring to washington weekly standard editor bill kristol tweeted the terrible truth in trump s republican party roy moore politically demagogic and morally bankrupt seems to be not a bug

a good man tough prosecutor he wrote on twitter from a former george w bush speechwriter these are the same things republicans said after the access hollywood audio emerged then they changed their minds from the longtime conservative radio host in wisconsin will the party that accepted the access hollywood president draw the line at roy moore and a 14 year old girl a biblical reality check several prominent theologians outside of alabama pushed back hard on the state auditor s dubious invocation of scripture to defend moore bringing joseph and mary into a modern day molestation accusation where a 32 year old prosecutor is accused of molesting a 14 year old girl is simultaneously ridiculous and blasphemous said ed stetzer a pastor and church consultant at wheaton college told our michelle boorstein even those who followed ancient marriage customs which we would not follow today knew the difference between molesting and marriage women were chattel back then they were traded
