largest newspapers had pulled their endorsements which the candidate had been touting in tv ads the billings gazette which serves montana s largest city told readers that it had made a poor choice by ignoring questionable interactions the candidate has had with reporters in the past the helena independent record which serves the state s capital city wrote that the concepts of democracy and press freedom were under attack by gianforte and the missoulian which had taken heat from readers for backing gianforte pulled its support and suggested that the candidate who narrowly lost a race for governor last year should bow out of public life the american health care act the republican replacement for the affordable care act had become the dominant issue in the campaign in the closing days of the race quist focused his events and tv ads on his opposition to the republican bill and brought in sen bernie sanders i vt to help promote his position on u s health care universal coverage ryan on gianforte there s never a call for physical altercations gianforte meanwhile had struggled to explain his position in early may reporters for the post and the new york times received a tape of gianforte telling donors that he was glad that the ahca had passed the house but in public he said he still had questions about the bill in a commercial that was still running on election day

quist s final rally at a missoula microbrewery voters were skeptical that the attack could change the race gianforte entered the contest with high negative ratings and an image as a hard charging bully who had joked about outnumbering a reporter at a town hall meeting and sued to keep people from fishing on public land near his home he had nearly won the governor s mansion anyway and had
