former arkansas governor mike huckabee is certainly on the go he traveled to 38 states last year to help candidates in the midterms and this week alone is in six states whether he runs for president or continues to work the trail for others he certainly sees a lot of america and talks to a whole lot of people in a real sense he truly does reflect the views of many social conservatives and conservative populists in the heartland with huckabee however who has been going to israel for 42 years one is compelled to start with prime minister benjamin netanyahu s speech it was a tremendous speech he told right turn it was more than how he said it but what he said he called attention to the nature of the iranian regime he recited two well known points iran is the world s largest state sponsor of terror and a regime committed to wiping out israel and reiterated that iran has cheated on every agreement it has ever entered into if every time i ve bought a car from a used car dealer 10 out of 10 he s sold me a lemon do i really want to buy the 11th he sounds genuinely aggrieved about the president s behavior and the conduct of democrats who refused to go to the speech what i lamented is that the once bipartisan agreement on israel and national security has been abandoned by the democrats he said they are more interested in protecting obama s petulance than in protecting israel he hastened to note that he was in israel yet again last week and met with netanyahu he makes the keen point that this hardly was a political winner for netanyahu back home it was divisive back home in israel what he did was brave this was a political risk he noted pointing to the controversy and criticism the trip generated among his opponents and running through the list of other middle east countries he has been to egypt jordan saudi arabia etc he observes that this is not just about the jewish state the egyptians the jordanians the emiratis the saudis are absolutely with israel on this the iranian threat he confesses that in watching the president s conduct and the reported concessions i m stunned i can t figure out what the president is thinking what his advisers are telling him there are few people who know the clintons like fellow arkansan huckabee he s not surprised in the least about the recent e mail and foundation scandals again and again democrats and especially the press are willing to let the clintons skate by it s pretty bizarre is he going to run for president he sticks to his previous statements that he will decide sometime this spring he cracks looking at the weather it s premature to decide huckabee is an economic populist to be sure and takes pride in being attacked for it i talked about this economic message eight years ago i was being pilloried by the wall street journal and other folks in your community the mainstream media he says events have proved him right and now everyone is talking about wage stagnation he asserted the bottom 90 percent in the past 40 years have had stagnant wages in the 25 years before that 90 percent saw an increase he cites the tax code it is punishing people who work on their feet if they take a second job they are thrown into a new tax bracket cheap foreign labor that devalues american labor and cheap products from china people he said are worried about the college grad with debt and no job and the small business person bedeviled by taxes and regulations huckabee s diagnosis of what troubles america may be sound but many conservatives will disagree with his solutions huckabee may be missing some important pieces of the picture in the 1950s europe and asia were not yet economic powerhouses labor unions kept wages artificially high and most families had only one working adult so labor was more scare and hence wages were high in a global economy many would argue that huckabee s proposals don t fit the times in fact we need to expand markets for our trade enhance our technological edge and change our immigration system so that we siphon off the best and brightest to work build businesses and invest in america that formula becoming a 21st century economic giant that beats the world competition together with tax education and regulatory reform is the building block of the policy agenda of two other potential 2016 contenders former florida governor jeb bush and sen marco rubio r fla those two make for an interesting contrast to economic populists who fear losing what they have and tend not to think about how to get more of the world economic pie if huckabee would get to the white house he lists two priorities at the top of the list would be reestablishing relations with our allies i ve challenged my democratic friends to come up with one country just one that we have better relations with they can t because there is not one second i d evolve power out of washington d c he said it s so dysfunctional i don t think it can be fixed he d rather give the power back to the states where people have to balance budgets it is easy to see why he was such a hit on fox he s entertaining and an excellent conservative analyst whether he wants to and can translate that into a presidential platform and campaign remains to be seen but the candidates who are definitely running might pick up some pointers by watching him receive the most important pandemic developments in your
