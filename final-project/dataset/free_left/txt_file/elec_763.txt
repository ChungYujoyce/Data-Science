advertisement supported by by mark landler amy chozick and jason horowitz washington the two leading democratic contenders for president are competing to wrap president obama in a tight embrace he is hugging only one of them back with hillary clinton and senator bernie sanders of vermont locked in an increasingly taut battle in the final days before the iowa caucuses both are laying claim to mr obama s mantle and to the young voters he turned out in 2008 and 2012 mr sanders is selling himself as an insurgent in the spirit of mr obama mrs clinton as the custodian of his legacy so far legacy is winning out mrs clinton s eagerness to tie herself to her old boss most conspicuously in last sunday s debate has been gratifying to mr obama s aides given the tangled history between the president and his onetime rival turned lieutenant his aides still view mrs clinton as more electable and better qualified to protect his record than mr sanders though they have been impressed by the senator s recent performance and unsettled by hers mr obama has said he will not endorse a candidate during the primaries his advisers are careful not to root publicly for anyone but the white house is working with mrs clinton s campaign in ways large and small their two staffs consult on issues ranging from the campaign s use of mr obama s image in advertisements to the positions she takes on his policy priorities like the trans pacific partnership trade deal which she pushed as secretary of state and then came out against as a candidate the president s recent vow that he would not support any democratic candidate who did not vote for common sense gun reform was interpreted as a gift to mrs clinton she seized on it to portray mr sanders who has voted against some gun control measures as being at odds with mr obama the perception was reinforced when the white house press secretary josh earnest suggested that mr sanders was among those lawmakers mr obama had in mind when he made the vow in an article published in the new york times on jan 7 it s hard to think they weren t mindful of what the effect would be said geoff garin a democratic pollster who is working for priorities usa action a super pac supporting mrs clinton white house officials denied that mr obama was targeting mr sanders noting that he had already shifted his position on background checks for gun buyers the white house is sensitive to suggestions that it favors mrs clinton it does not want to alienate the young voters who are flocking to the sanders campaign voters who are critical for reassembling the coalition that vaulted mr obama to victory there is no question that when it comes time the president will be out there pounding the pavement for the nominee said jennifer r psaki the white house communications director but right now his focus publicly and privately is not on one candidate over another it is on engaging the american people and about reminding them what is at stake mr sanders is eager to open his own channels to the white house at a holiday party last month mr sanders told the president he wanted to drop in and chat white house officials said they were trying to find a time for the two to sit down we have a very positive relationship mr sanders said in an interview on thursday and yet he is not blind to the institutional advantages mrs clinton has in enlisting white house support there are clinton people in the white house who clearly would like to see hillary clinton nominated mr sanders said i understand that and i simply hope that they will be as fair minded as they can be he said adding i take president obama and vice president biden at their word they re not going to be tipping the scales here the relationship between mrs clinton and the white house is not without its own baggage her about face on the trade deal angered mr obama s aides especially given her previous vocal support for it some still recall the bitterness of her campaign against mr obama in 2008 the president himself reacted to the trade deal shift with resignation rather than anger aides said viewing it as an understandable if opportunistic move the clinton campaign is trying to smooth out future bumps by maintaining contacts at multiple levels including high level calls on policy between the campaign chairman john podesta and the white house chief of staff denis r mcdonough and routine check in calls about public statements between the campaign s communications director jennifer palmieri and her white house counterparts ms psaki and mr earnest if we re going to do something we think we need to give them a heads up on jennifer or i will call our former colleagues and let them know said mr podesta who was a senior obama adviser before joining the clinton campaign if we re out on the campaign trail and rolling out a new policy building on something he s done or taking a position different than his we ll let him know we re going to do it mrs clinton meets periodically with mr obama most recently last month when he invited her to the white house for a private 90 minute lunch the day after they each delivered speeches about how to confront the terrorist threat from the islamic state in her remarks mrs clinton portrayed the threat posed by the militant group in darker terms than the president and reiterated her proposal to enforce a no fly zone over northern syria to protect civilians a step mr obama has so far resisted history suggests that each party s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions as measured by endorsements fund raising and polling shared history makes these contacts easier in the four years mrs clinton was a member of mr obama s cabinet their staffs became friendly she hired several of his advisers to work on her campaign including mr podesta ms palmieri and the pollster joel benenson in addition her policy adviser jake sullivan worked closely in the white house with mr obama s deputy national security adviser benjamin j rhodes mr obama s political director david simas speaks periodically with robby mook mrs clinton s campaign manager on practical issues like the use of the president s image or voice in advertising the two sides do not coordinate on political strategy and will not unless mrs clinton becomes the nominee in that case they will negotiate a list of appearances by mr obama on mrs clinton s behalf which would be true for mr sanders as well in any event white house aides said promoting mr obama s agenda takes precedence over catering to the political interests of mrs clinton or any other candidate the president for example will continue to push for a congressional vote on the trans pacific partnership even though mrs clinton and mr sanders both oppose the deal we ve got 365 days left to go mr simas said the sense of urgency to get as much done in that period of time is great as a general proposition the things we want to get done 95 percent to 99 percent of the time are the types of things that democrats across the board support so the president is going to do what the president is going to do these days neither candidate is likely to complain in the interview on thursday mr sanders whose rationale as a presidential candidate is based in part on being a more liberal correction to mr obama said mr obama had a great sense of humor he is a very very funny guy and a sharp intellect one of the smartest guys smartest people ever to be president mrs clinton for her part has weaved a stout defense of mr obama into her stump speech i don t think president obama gets the credit he deserves for saving the american economy she says to rousing applause from new hampshire to nevada advertisement
