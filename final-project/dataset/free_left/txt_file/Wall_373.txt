advertisement supported by by nominating john ratcliffe for director of national intelligence president trump gave the senate a choice accept a trump stalwart or stick with the acting stalwart by elizabeth williamson and julian e barnes washington the legal career of representative john ratcliffe republican of texas almost ended before it began as a teenager the future federal prosecutor confused reverse and drive on a borrowed stick shift car and plowed through the window of a hearing aid shop in carbondale ill where the proprietor had to yank an older customer to safety my daughter told him he could drive but what he did not say was that he didn t know how said mary koster whose chevette hurtled through the window that day the accident is an apt metaphor for mr ratcliffe s recent political trajectory in which he has ridden light experience and a flair for at times reckless braggadocio to become president trump s nominee to be america s top spy the director of national intelligence mr ratcliffe gunned for the job last july slammed on the brakes but is back in drive with mr trump giving senators a choice confirm a nominee they objected to last summer or accept an equally contentious candidate the acting director richard grenell for at least the rest of the year both men are thinly experienced combative trump loyalists who raise concerns about bringing political bias to a sensitive role guiding 17 intelligence agencies in the 2000s mr ratcliffe was an appointee of president george w bush to the u s attorney s office in the eastern district of texas where he led an antiterrorism unit the last time mr trump floated his name for the job he abruptly pulled the plug after it emerged that mr ratcliffe had overstated his counterterrorism experience mr grenell who also serves as mr trump s ambassador to germany and was previously a u s spokesman at the united nations has already taken action at the office of the director of national intelligence freezing hiring and initiating a review intended to shrink the office lawmakers are divided some want a quick senate confirmation vote on mr ratcliffe who would in theory be more accountable to congressional oversight committees others in congress say mr grenell possesses more intelligence heft having spent years immersed in national security issues by contrast they say mr ratcliffe has done relatively little to augment his thin experience as a member of the house permanent select committee on intelligence he has a reputation for absenteeism and lackluster interest in complicated intelligence issues preferring loud defenses of mr trump s foreign policy stances mr ratcliffe s allies say he possesses personal qualities that would offset his lack of experience and that it is difficult to discern how much antiterrorism experience he had as a prosecutor because some records are classified he s a good listener always well grounded in law and the principles that undergird democracy and the justice department john d ashcroft attorney general in the george w bush administration and a former ratcliffe law partner said in an interview these are personality traits and characteristics that would serve him extremely well telegenic with a fraternity president demeanor mr ratcliffe grew up in chicago s northwest suburbs the youngest of six children born to educators in 1977 his father robert took a job as a dean at southern illinois university in carbondale mr ratcliffe worked as a golf caddy in summer and went to the university of notre dame where he was on the golf team and graduated in three years he received his law degree from southern methodist university near dallas where he met his wife michele a native of detroit and a former federal prosecutor now in private practice the ratcliffes and their two daughters live on a golf course in heath texas a suburb of dallas during the eight years he worked for the justice department mr ratcliffe served simultaneously as heath s mayor an unpaid nonpartisan job that was his first elected office it was in the mayor s office that he said he got valuable experience for his u s attorney post i ve really enjoyed my public service work as the mayor of the city of heath mr ratcliffe said acknowledging he had no law enforcement experience when he got the position at the u s attorney s office he was working as a corporate lawyer in dallas when mr bush named him assistant u s attorney and chief of antiterrorism and national security for the eastern district of texas mr ratcliffe told a texas reporter the new job would provide me an opportunity to expand my public service into issues of national security in an interview ms ratcliffe said news stories about mr ratcliffe s lack of terrorism related experience in those years were at times downright wrong he has experience i don t even know about she said we ve been married for 30 years and i know there s some things he cannot talk about arnold spencer a former prosecutor who reported to mr ratcliffe in the u s attorney s office said the office handled about 1 500 cases a year roughly half of them involving guns and drugs up to one quarter immigration related about one fifth white collar crimes he said he can t discuss some terrorism related cases because they are classified but of those that are public i don t remember anything of national prominence they were mostly garden variety laundering schemes distantly related to terror financing but mr spencer said that was beside the point i would much rather have somebody who has john s level of thoughtfulness and intelligence and commitment to carrying out our best interests in an ethical proactive way than have someone who spent 24 hours a day for 30 or 40 years on national security issues who doesn t have those characteristics mr spencer said in july mr ratcliffe s teased nomination foundered after it emerged that he had said during his 2016 campaign and on his website that he tried suspects in a high profile terrorism financing case in fact he investigated side issues related to an initial mistrial that he did not prosecute he did not handle a successful second trial either the case united states v holy land foundation for relief and development was one of the government s most prominent efforts to shut down funding of terrorist organizations in the decade after the sept 11 2001 attacks a muslim charity had been sending money to hamas the militant group that controls gaza but mr ratcliffe played no part in the substance of the case which was prosecuted in a different district said three former government lawyers and a former senior f b i official directly involved mr ratcliffe has worked to correct his inflated claims including deleting a 2015 news release on his house website that said he convicted individuals funneling money to hamas and a line from another part of the website stating that he put terrorists in prison mr ratcliffe served as interim u s attorney for texas s eastern district for less than year between the departure of one presidential appointee in 2007 and the arrival of another in 2008 he coordinated an immigration raid on pilgrim s pride a chicken processor in which 280 foreign nationals were arrested at plants in five states during his 2016 congressional campaign he said i am opposed to amnesty period but don t just take my word on it ask any of the over 300 illegal aliens i arrested in a single day in fact 45 foreign nationals were arrested at the pilgrim s pride plant in texas that day according to local news reports by u s immigration and customs enforcement after president barack obama took office in 2009 mr ratcliffe joined mr ashcroft to form ashcroft sutton ratcliffe a law firm working on corporate governance and regulatory issues in 2014 mr ratcliffe mounted a successful primary challenge for the house seat held by a 91 year old fellow republican ralph hall though mr ratcliffe initially ran as a tea party deficit hawk mr trump won 76 percent of his district and he followed the president s lead as the federal deficit surged i don t have a whole lot of experience walking into the oval office and negotiating with a president mr ratcliffe told the dallas morning news after a white house meeting with mr trump about efforts to repeal the affordable care act this is why i ran for congress i wanted a seat at the table on the national and international issues of the day mr trump initially said he wanted mr ratcliffe for the intelligence job after he impressed the president by berating the special counsel robert s mueller iii for five minutes on live television you managed to violate every principle and the most sacred of traditions about prosecutors not offering extra prosecutorial analysis about potential crimes that aren t charged mr ratcliffe told mr mueller a former f b i director theatrically slamming the mueller report onto the table but mr ratcliffe has one of the worst attendance records on the intelligence committee attending only about half of its closed door proceedings according to people familiar with the matter he missed a contentious classified briefing on 2020 election security in february when panel members grilled intelligence officers on russian interference when the panel held a closed door hearing on the classified intelligence budget mr ratcliffe dipped in for just a few minutes and asked no questions his defenders note that as one of the few members who has sat on four committees he often has conflicts the white house has grown skeptical of some of the analysis coming from the intelligence community believing a few bad apples inject political bias and manipulate reports to undermine the president or his policies according to one intelligence official mr trump wants an intelligence director who will root these officers out mr ratcliffe also believes intelligence has become politicized but to many current and former intelligence officers the administration s effort to depoliticize the office amounts to exactly the opposite some former intelligence officers bristle at suggestions that political opinion shapes intelligence analysis some intelligence officials believe facts and nuanced assessments are falling prey to partisanship with the trump administration and its congressional allies eager to play down russian interference in the 2020 election for example and congressional democrats keen to highlight moscow s influence operations a partisan intelligence director whether mr ratcliffe or mr grenell heightens those concerns douglas h wise a retired c i a senior officer said by nominating mr ratcliffe the president had clearly prioritized unwavering political loyalty over deep intelligence experience trump depends on that brand of loyalty because he can t manage the agencies by himself mr wise said he must have a loyal consigliere to keep the intelligence community agency heads in line and be the firewall between himself and inconvenient intelligence kitty bennett contributed research advertisement
