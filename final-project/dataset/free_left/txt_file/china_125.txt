03bst huawei has hit back at donald trump s administration after it declared a national emergency to ban technology from foreign adversaries and subjected the chinese telecommunications company to strict export controls an executive order issued by the us president on wednesday declared a national economic emergency that empowers the government to ban the technology and services of foreign adversaries deemed to pose unacceptable risks to national security including from cyber espionage and sabotage the order did not name specific countries or companies but came after months of us pressure on huawei it reflects government concerns that equipment from chinese suppliers could pose an espionage threat to us internet and telecommunications infrastructure in a statement reported by the state run global times huawei said if the us restricts huawei it will not make the us safer nor will it make the us stronger it will only force the us to use inferior and expensive alternative equipment lagging behind other countries and ultimately harming us companies and consumers the company said it was willing to communicate with the us to ensure product security echoing reassurances given to the uk trump s executive order invokes the international emergency economic powers act which gives the president the authority to regulate commerce in response to a national emergency that threatens the us the order directs the commerce department working with other government agencies to draw up a plan for enforcement within 150 days the commerce department said it was adding huawei and 70 affiliates to its entity list banning the company from acquiring components and technology from us firms without government approval the world s two largest economies have recently increased tariffs in a battle over what us officials call china s unfair trade practices talks between washington and beijing have ground to a halt causing volatility amid concerns about a global trade war gao feng a spokesman for china s ministry of commerce said china has emphasised many times that the concept of national security should not be abused and that it should not be used as a tool for trade protectionism a foreign affairs spokesman described us actions against specific chinese companies as disgraceful and unjust we urge the us side to stop oppressing chinese companies under the pretext of security concerns and provide a fair just and non discriminatory environment for their normal investment and operation the spokesman said at a press briefing ahead of the executive order trump s commerce secretary wilbur ross said the order which has been under review for more than a year was aimed at protecting the supply chain from foreign adversaries to the nation s information and communications technology and services supply chain under president trump s leadership americans will be able to trust that our data and infrastructure are secure he said huawei is a chinese telecoms company founded in 1987 us officials believe it poses a security risk because the chinese government will make the firm engineer backdoors in its technology through which information could be accessed by beijing donald trump has banned us companies from sharing technology with huawei and has been putting pressure on other nations to follow suit the uk has accepted there is some risk in working with huawei but security services do not believe it to be unmanageable it has designated huawei a high risk vendor but the company will be given the opportunity to build non core elements of britain s 5g network the head of mi5 recently said he was confident the us uk intelligence sharing relationship would not be affectedif london gave huawei the nod much of the doubt surrounding huawei stems from founder ren zhengfei s time as an engineer in the china s people s liberation army from 1974 83 his daughter meng wanzhou a senior huawei executive was arrested in canada in december 2018 over allegations of iran sanctions violations huawei insists the chinese government has never asked it to build a backdoor into its technology and has offered to sign a no spy agreement with countries adopting it the trade rivalry between the us and china has intensified in recent years and the firm believes the white house is simply using itas a weapon in that larger fight kevin rawlinson us officials have previously labelled huawei a threat and lobbied allies not to use huawei network equipment in next generation 5g networks calling it untrustworthy beijing has pledged to take necessary counter measures against the us actions announcing plans this week to increase tariffs on nearly 60bn 46 7bn worth of us imports beginning on 1 june in what the chinese government said was a retaliatory move after washington imposed tariffs on 200bn 155 8bn of chinese goods observers say other measures could include added regulatory hurdles for us companies operating in china lu kang a spokesman for china s foreign ministry said the chinese government naturally cares about the rights and interests of chinese businesses and the government will take necessary measures to safeguard their rights as for foreign businesses in china as long as their operation is lawful they should not be concerned trump is expected to meet china s president xi jinping in japan next month huawei has strongly denied us allegations that its equipment could be used by the chinese state to spy ren zhengfei the company s founder and chief executive claimed in february that huawei would reject any efforts to gather intelligence through its products even if the chinese government required it to do so we never participate in espionage and we do not allow any of our employees to do any act like that and we absolutely never install backdoors he told cbs news in august trump signed a bill that barred the us government from using equipment from huawei and another chinese provider zte corp the export restriction is a grave escalation with china that at minimum plunges the prospect of continued trade negotiations into doubt eurasia group analysts said in a report unless handled carefully this situation is likely to place us and chinese companies at new risk it appears the law invoked in wednesday s executive order has never before been declared in a way that affects an entire commercial sector huawei said in a statement on thursday that the decision was in no one s interest and would affect tens of thousands of american jobs and disrupt the current collaboration and mutual trust that exist on the global supply chain
