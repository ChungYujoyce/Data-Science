advertisement supported by trying to win over progressives and aware that the coronavirus crisis is upending the political landscape joe biden is increasingly using the language of systemic disruption by katie glueck and astead w herndon throughout the democratic presidential primary joseph r biden jr s rivals criticized his focus on restoring america to the pre trump era accusing him of promoting a backward looking political vision that ignored the deep rooted causes of the nation s problems mr biden s message to voters sometimes fueled that perception he constantly invoked the obama legacy he leaned on longtime party donors and endorsements from establishment democrats some of whom had been out of office for years he criticized some of the progressive ideas of his primary rivals but as he steps into the general election having vanquished the party s left wing and the nation reels from a pandemic that has devastated the economy mr biden is striking fewer of the moderate notes that won him the nomination instead courting progressives with a new openness to systemic disruption the clearest sign of that shift came on wednesday when mr biden announced a slate of joint policy task forces with senator bernie sanders focused on issues ranging from climate change to criminal justice reform the task force members include stalwart biden allies but also a who s who of medicare for all champions advocates for eliminating college debt and critics of the obama administration s immigration policy the kind of activists who have long been skeptical of mr biden s more incremental instincts representative alexandria ocasio cortez of new york perhaps the nation s most prominent young progressive is co chair of the climate change task force along with former secretary of state john kerry a significant development as mr biden seeks to improve his standing with younger and more liberal voters while the task forces have yet to convene and it is far from clear whether they will produce policy results or simply the appearance of political harmony mr biden is plainly trying to unite the most progressive wing of the party with the democratic establishment that s a goal critical to delivering a big democratic vote against president trump and his united republican party in november i think i can speak for a lot of young people in that i was not motivated or inspired by biden s refrain of a return to normalcy said varshini prakash the executive director of the progressive climate activism group sunrise movement who will join ms ocasio cortez on the climate policy working group if you want to energize our generation give us a vision of what we re fighting for and not just what we re fighting against in recent weeks mr biden has detailed an agenda that increasingly features progressive policies and language where he once pitched a message anchored in electability he has now embraced a rhetorical stew that mixes the hope of former president barack obama with the populism of mr sanders and senator elizabeth warren it s a reflection of political sensitivity to the national mood which risks turning to overwhelming anger as economic pain builds but it is also an implicit acknowledgment that mr biden cannot win by merely promising to remove mr trump yes i ve endorsed vice president biden and yes we re working to help organize progressives said representative barbara lee of california a former chair of the congressional progressive caucus but we have to make sure that an agenda that speaks to the aspirations of all americans is an agenda that he embraces in recent weeks mr biden s words and his policies have drifted left he announced a new plan last week focusing on systemic racism and indicated in a snapchat interview that he supported a federal rent bailout in discussing big businesses and stimulus money he recently snarled in a politico interview this is the second time we ve bailed their asses out and this month he was co author of an op ed article with ms warren in mcclatchy newspapers acknowledging that for many americans our economy wasn t working even before the devastation of the covid 19 crisis the blinders have been taken off mr biden said at a recent fund raiser because of this covid crisis i think people are realizing my lord look at what is possible such a messaging shift presents both opportunities and challenges for mr biden who spent much of the primary keenly focused on how a presidential candidate s promises would play in moderate states and in down ballot races in the general election his recent words have been met with skepticism from progressive critics who argue that his long legislative record in washington suggests that the current changes are cosmetic at the same time at another fund raiser a donor told mr biden s wife that the candidate was already moving too far to the left an illustration of the competing forces mr biden must navigate mr biden s advisers have indicated to donors and other supporters this spring that the campaign is focused on uniting the democratic party before turning to broader general election outreach jared bernstein who during mr biden s vice presidential tenure served as his chief economic adviser and continues to informally advise him said it was a fair conclusion that mr biden s calls for change had grown more pointed in recent weeks mr bernstein said that the economic ruin and the struggles of the trump administration loom very large for him given mr biden s role in leading the obama administration s response to the recession in 2009 like many of us he s trying to suss out whether we re at a kind of turning point mr bernstein said where on the other side of this virus a lot of people are going to look around and say we need a far more competent government sector that can insulate us from shocks that come fast and furiously in a global economy more urgently the mark of a successful campaign will be if working class americans believe that joe biden s on my side and donald trump betrays workers said senator sherrod brown a pro labor democrat of ohio who speaks regularly with mr biden s staff in any earlier presidential cycle mr biden s policy proposals could have been considered far reaching promoting a public option for health care for example and embracing the overarching themes of the green new deal to combat climate change but throughout the primary he opposed many of progressives litmus test issues he also predicted that the republican party will have an epiphany once mr trump is out of office a view of political compromise that some democrats believe is out of step with trump era tribalism despite that skepticism party leaders who have recently endorsed him including mr obama mr sanders and ms warren have each pitched mr biden s potential administration as one capable of ushering in an era of progressive change mr obama in his endorsement video even hinted at the criticism lodged by ms ocasio cortez and others saying there s too much unfinished business for us to just look backwards we have to look to the future at a recent virtual fund raiser mr biden described a need to move in a bolder direction while also avoiding mr sanders s brand of democratic socialism look at the institutional changes we can make without us becoming a socialist country or any of that malarkey mr biden said the remark ruffled some on the left who thought mr biden was being dismissive while some conservatives accused him of using a crisis to press his agenda but amid skyrocketing unemployment and significant disapproval of mr trump s handling of the crisis it captured how mr biden is one of many politicians adjusting their ideological framing to the scale of the current crisis former representative steve israel of new york a biden ally said the former vice president must navigate a fine line engage progressives without alienating moderates like those who helped him secure the nomination you cannot afford to allow a swath of the electorate to sit home stewing on election day he said advertisement
