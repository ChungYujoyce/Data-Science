as my colleague simon maloy deftly explained yesterday matt bevin s tuesday victory in kentucky s gubernatorial race is yet another sign that the democratic party is in trouble sure bevin is better on the campaign trail than he was during his failed attempt to oust sen mitch mcconnell in 2014 but as a recent piece about the race in the atlantic made clear he still isn t good and while the voters of kentucky are undoubtedly conservative a look over of bevin s political history reveals a man on the wrong side of the line separating hyper conservative from radical fringe but he won anyway and despite what pre election polls suggested the outcome wasn t even close this raises myriad questions for the democratic party both in kentucky and the nation as a whole most of those questions will center on the party s get out the vote apparatus which increasingly seems to be useless for any election in which barack obama isn t a candidate in general i chalk that up to the decline of organized labor but kentucky was never exactly michigan in fact the state is something of an outlier recently when it comes to the nation s larger de unionization trend regardless of unions strength though democrats had hoped that policy successes would inspire their constituents to come out and vote specifically they hoped that bevin s vow to dismantle the affordable care act in kentucky as much as he can that is would inspire the hundreds of thousands of kentuckians who ve benefited to vote for its protection by almost any metric after all kynect what they call the aca in kentucky has been an inspirational success democrats hoped voters would reward the party for successfully implementing such a major policy but from today s vantage it s painfully obvious that they didn t and that s not just a problem in the bluegrass state it s a problem for all democrats because one of the foundational assumptions behind kynect the aca and much of the entire democratic party agenda is that good policy makes for good politics in kentucky at least it didn t what does good policy good politics mean it basically means that an effective program can survive even if it s unpopular at the outset those who benefit the theory goes will eventually become a constituency if they aren t already and will organize to preserve it think of social security or medicare they weren t necessarily super popular when they were first implemented but once people started relying on them they became the so called third rail of american politics but as left wing critics of the democratic consensus have long argued there s a problem with analogizing the aca and social security one of the programs is universal everyone puts in everyone takes out and the other isn t and this isn t incidental it s the reason why so many tea party types will rail against handouts but cherish their medicare it s because they believe they re simply receiving what they re owed they aren t and that the benefits go to them instead of good for nothing moochers there are plenty of people in kentucky right now who are better off because of the aca but many of them are beneficiaries of the law s medicaid expansion which bevin has promised to change if not revoke and thus lack political influence and the rest as far as many of them know it s not the aca or obamacare that they now rely on it s kynect and bevin didn t campaign against kynect he campaigned against obamacare kentucky democrats got the policy right in other words but it never paid political dividends in fairness it s too early to say the debate is over if bevin tries to make good on his promises and is greeted with a backlash he may trim his sails or abandon the initiative still it s not like democrats didn t spend much of the campaign warning about bevin s plans for health care in kentucky they did a lot it didn t make a difference elias isquith is a former salon staff writer copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
