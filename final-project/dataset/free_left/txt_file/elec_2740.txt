with less than five weeks before voters begin weighing in on the 2016 gop presidential nomination the establishment contenders who until now have been relatively restrained have begun aiming their fire at each other the tactical shift on the part of the candidates and their allies reflects a long standing assumption as to how this crowded nomination battle is likely to play out many believe the race will come down to a one on one contest between an outsider who channels the angry republican base and a candidate more in line with the wishes of the party hierarchy the establishment pick has almost always prevailed in the past though it is far from certain that will be the case in 2016 the insurgent faction of the party appears likely to rally around either front runner donald trump or the ascendant sen ted cruz r tex the leading possibilities on the establishment side include three sitting or former governors and a florida senator all of whom are running far behind trump but before any of them can get a shot at taking him on they must deal with one another trump s latest targets new hampshire s largest paper and its favorite candidate christie sen marco rubio r fla on tuesday found his record of senate absences under attack from two directions a blistering ad in iowa by a super pac supporting former florida governor jeb bush and a taunt by new jersey gov chris christie dude show up to work christie said during a town hall meeting in muscatine iowa rubio was making his own swing through iowa which is set to hold the first contest of the primary season on feb 1 he responded at a news conference hours later in the town of clinton you know chris has been missing in new jersey for half the time rubio said but candidates i think as we get down the stretch here some of them get a little desperate and a little nasty in their attacks and that s fine he dismissed the attack ad by the pro bush super pac right to rise usa as par for the course i mean obviously you ve seen that as we get closer to election day and millions of dollars of spending have not changed bush s fortunes he s become increasingly negative in his attacks meanwhile right to rise usa also launched a spot in new hampshire contending that the gubernatorial records of christie and ohio gov john kasich do not stack up against that of bush the ad was gentler in tone than the super pac s assault on rubio but it attempted to draw a contrast on the experience that all three of the candidates consider to be their greatest asset new day in america a super pac supporting kasich responded what team jeb has failed to address is the political baggage dragging behind bush and christie the country doesn t have an appetite for another bush or another clinton for that matter as for governor christie his mishandling of his state budget and the bridgegate scandal have earned him a 60 percent unfavorable rating from those who know him best the people of new jersey the crossfire said gop political consultant alex castellanos is beginning to look like a fistful of dollars gunfight referring to the 1964 spaghetti western that launched clint eastwood to stardom it s now down to the last five weeks here christie told reporters in muscatine we need to make distinctions between candidates not just on issues but on experience so i ll be talking about it i think it s an important distinction to make the young and charismatic rubio is regarded by many as potentially the strongest contender running in the establishment lane if he can find an opening it s pretty clear in this race that marco rubio is the candidate of the future if he ever breaks through the line he s got a lot of running room said castellanos who is not working for any of the 2016 candidates the only one who everyone fears for his explosive potential is rubio will rubio work hard enough to become president some backers are worried right to rise usa said it plans to spend 1 4 million on the new ad in iowa in which an announcer says over the last three years rubio has missed important national security hearings and missed more total votes than any other senator politics first that s the rubio way christie sounded a similar theme during a town hall in muscatine where he noted that rubio had announced his opposition to a 1 8trillion year end spending bill and tax package but then failed to show up to vote against it it passed the senate 65 to 33 just show up to work and vote no christie said and if you don t want to then quit rubio spokesman alex conant said his campaign is unfazed noting that rubio s skill at dealing with barbs during the candidates debates has only increased his stature obviously we feel very good about our campaign and where we re at with success comes scrutiny conant said we ve been taking some incoming for several months now and we re not worse for the wear rubio does have the worst attendance record of all the senators including the five who have run for president this year a fact he does not dispute a c span analysis released last week found that rubio cast votes for just 219 of the 339 recorded senate roll call votes in 2015 a 65 percent attendance record he spoke on the senate floor eight times just 5 percent of the days that the senate was in session c span said i m running for president because i want to change the direction of this country and it will require me for the time being to miss some votes in the u s senate because i want those votes to matter again rubio said before tuesday s exchanges the most high profile attack on rubio s attendance record had been launched by bush during an october republican presidential debate rubio shot back with a response that threw bush off balance someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you rubio told bush and then recounted how other senators who ran for president had equally bad attendance records that had not drawn much comment in his own appearances recently bush has been focusing most of his attacks on trump and hillary clinton by law candidates are not allowed to coordinate with the super pacs that support them however right to rise usa is run by political consultant mike murphy who has been one of bush s closest political advisers for most of his political career o keefe reported from nashua n h rucker reported from muscatine iowa o keefe reported from
