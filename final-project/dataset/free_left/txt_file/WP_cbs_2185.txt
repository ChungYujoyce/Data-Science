watch cbsn live by stephen gandel april 10 2020 8 29 pm moneywatch citigroup ceo michael corbat pledged during an april 1 appearance on cnbc that his bank was working non stop to help clients through the growing economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus outbreak we are making sure that our customers and clients can take advantage of the government assistance programs corbat said nearly two weeks later that announcement is starting to look like an april fools day prank a few days ago the president said citi was doing a great job complained carlos martin solo owner of a law firm that has been a citibank small business client for over a decade they are not doing a great job either they are dragging their feet because they don t see a profit in small business help or they are incompetent it wasn t until thursday that citi announced it would begin offering applications for the federal paycheck protection program the 350 billion government loan program to help small businesses making it the last of the nation s four largest banks to do so the stimulus program offers low interest loans that are forgiven including the interest as long as a company retains and pays its workers for the following eight weeks the loans are available until june 30 and citi says it will lend until then bank of america was the only one of the nation s biggest banks toallow customers to file applicationswhen the program opened nearly a week ago jpmorgan chase began taking preliminary applications a few hours later citi s website on the other hand for much of the week said only that applications would be coming soon giving no indication when clients would be able to apply applications are still not available on its website instead there is a notify me button to request an application the bank said friday it will reach out to clients that qualify for the program directly and offer an application but the sba loans are on a first come first serve basis at least for now most customers have to go to their primary bank to apply for the loan that appears to have put citi clients at a disadvantage on thursday the small business administration announced that loans for more than a third of the money in the program 140 billion had already been approved on friday evening citi said it had received applications for just 2 billion in loans far less than bank of america and others had reported that could be because citi s small banking unit is smaller than many of its rivals competing operations but citi also said friday that a number of its approved loans had already been made with clients receiving the funds in their accounts on friday afternoon that appeared to be faster than at other banks which have taken applications for days but appear to have made relatively few loans we are working with our clients as quickly as possible to complete and submit their applications and have already started to distribute funds to our clients a citi spokesperson said in a statement the timing of the digital portal launch was driven by our focus on testing our process and origination capabilities most all of the major banks have been subject to criticism on social media sites like twitter this week citi s seemed to be focused on the fact that the bank s ppp information page which said applications were not ready yet was titled supporting small business when it matters most jillonmoney good morning jill watching your segment on cbs this morning it is still beyond frustrating that citi does not have a sba ppp program running coming up to a week since
