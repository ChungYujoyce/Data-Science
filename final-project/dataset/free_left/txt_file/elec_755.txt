when hillary clintonstepped up to the microphone in the waning hours of monday night shecalled it an incredible honor to have campaigned in the state but one suspects that if she had the option of wiping one place off the map it would be iowa the place where her presidential aspirations keep getting dragged down by voters unwilling to endorse her as much as she needs the iowa caucuses are by and large a ridiculous affair more about hazy notions of momentum and expectations than any real statement of what the broad american electorate thinks that is how third place marco rubio could be hailed as a triumphant winner on the gop side or how actual winner ted cruz could be given a huge political boost off the back of just 51 000 votes which is roughly the equivalent of two new york city blocks nevertheless iowa is the reality we all live with and it has once more been cruel to clinton in 2008 she came in third a harbinger of what was to come on monday she watched as bernie sanders a man who was virtually unknown to most of the country a year ago a man who she was leading by 25 percent in state polls last september fought her to a standstill and permanently erased what traces of inevitability she was still carrying around as she rallied her troops you could almost feel her wanting to shout again with this for sanders the results in iowa cap a remarkable year whatever happens now he has just performed a gravity defying feat of political dexterity he has enlisted a groundswell of grassroots support and thoroughly defined the contours of the primary race much more than clinton has that was evident in her speech in which she declared in bernie esque fashion that the status quo is not good enough the speech was also entirely focused on the domestic issues that sanders has embraced there was no mention of isis here for his part sanders was almost giddy as he bellowed out his stump speech to a rapturous crowd on the greatest night of his political life what happens next who knows sanders has a commanding lead in new hampshire which it s hard to see him giving up after that the campaign heads to nevada and south carolina where the demographic profile of the electorate vastly shifts clinton is way up in both places but polls change it seems more likely than not that sanders will ultimately be overwhelmed by clinton what is clear though is that the race is going to take much longer than just about anyone imagined there are going to be a million thinkpieces about why exactly hillary clinton has found herself in such a sticky spot how long she stays there is another matter i think that to really get what is going on we have to look beyond the somewhat narrow confines of party politics for all of his skill in outmaneuvering clinton in driving his message through in sparking people s passions sanders is the beneficiary of forces beyond his or clinton s control why has the democratic party been shifting left it s not because of bernie sanders it s because of occupy wall street and black lives matter women s rights activists and climate change activists and immigrants rights activists and lgbt activists as ever it is the power of movements of people pushing the boundaries people going into the streets people forcing the scope of discourse to open up and to move that has trickled down into the political process there were people waiting for bernie sanders the best idea he ever had was to show up jack mirkinson is a writer living in new york follow him on twitter at jackmirkinson copyright 2019 salon com llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon is registered in the u s patent and trademark office as a trademark of salon com llc associated press articles copyright 2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
