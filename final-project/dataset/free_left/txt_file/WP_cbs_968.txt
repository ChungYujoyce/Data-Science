guild after all let me explain why i am boycottblizzard it s really unlike anything i ve seen in games which i ve been competing or designing or commenting on for 20 years now and this is by far the biggest incident i ve seen said brian kibler a broadcaster for online video games kibler was slated to host an online broadcast of the tournament finals for hearthstone the same game that hong kong player ng wai chung was competing in at blizzard s biggest annual video game convention next month but he said he pulled out in protest of blizzard s decision to ban chung known in gaming circles as

video game show hosts blizzard also seized chung s earnings from the tournament which amounted to 10 000 as of november 2016 chinese technology giant tencent had a 4 9 stake in activision blizzard some players now appear to be withdrawing from blizzard s platforms or at least considering it some reported having trouble deleting their blizzard accounts blizzard s customer support feed on twitter

struggling to boost results at blizzard which primarily makes games for pcs the stock has been largely flat this year but fell 26 in 2018 activision merged with blizzard as part of a deal with vivendi in 2008 blizzard s titles last year made up just over 30 of activision s overall 7 2 billion in sales but sales led by its aging world of warcraft game have been falling even before the hearthstone brouhaha analysts had expected blizzard s revenue to slump 28 this year to 1 7 billion hearthstone alone generated 385 million in sales in 2018 a figure forecast to drop to just over 300 million this year blizzard is supposed to announce new titles at its upcoming gaming confab early next month activision s biggest game is call of duty the company launched its latest mobile version of the game last week and it has already garnered 100 million downloads but activision is still waiting for approval from the chinese government to launch the latest version of call of duty there a factor that could explain why activision was quick to ban a gamer for comments supporting hong kong analysts expect call of duty to generate 1 1 billion in revenue for activision in the final three months of 2019 or more than 40 of its revenue in the key christmas quarter activision s other big money maker is the mobile phenomenon candy crush which it got in 2016 when it acquired king digital entertainment in 2016 the candy crush franchise is expected to generate nearly 1 6 billion in sales in 2019 or about a third of activision s annual overall sales with a burgeoning middle class the chinese market has become vital to many u s companies looking to expand but the swirl of censorship and outrage around the hong kong protests also highlights the fine line american businesses must walk when dealing with china especially companies like blizzard or the nba that have enjoyed reputations as socially progressive blizzard has won praise for the diverse set of characters populating its multiplayer game overwatch some users are taking overwatch hero mei as a symbol for the hong kong pro democracy resistance hoping to turn the only explicitly chinese character in the game into a meme that will get blizzard censored by china the chinese government has already banned winnie the pooh after internet users likened the cartoon bear s appearance to chinese president xi jinping after blizzard chose the ccp over hong kong protestors artists are reclaiming overwatch heroes this version of mei showed up on reddit pic twitter com 03wbojnvw2 on tuesday at blizzard s offices in irvine california a small group of blizzard employees reportedly staged a walkout to protest the hong kong controversy according to the daily beast the employees gathered around a statue of an orc at the entrance where plaques etched with slogans from overwatch such as every voice matters and think globally were papered over by workers who felt the sentiments conflicted with blizzard s decision to ban chung not everyone at
