companies intellectual property the threat of import tariffs on chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks where trump is seeking changes to beijing s trade policy tariffs have been imposed by

goods including steel and aluminium in may 2019 the us president further ratcheted up existing import tariffs of 10 on 200bn 153bn of chinese goods sold in the us to 25 hitting everything on a long list of products trump has previously warned that 25 tariffs could be slapped on a further 325bn of goods which would mean all chinese imports being covered by tariffs however talks in november 2019 aimed at easing tensions were welcomed as the beginning of a thaw in the trade war between the two nations richard partington and jasper jolly one of the biggest competitive advantages of chinese exports is their low price after tariffs are imposed prices for chinese made goods will rise and we ll lose our comparative advantage said a representative for sanhua micro channel which makes components for air conditioners in china s eastern zhejiang province the company said it had already moved some production to the us and mexico and would likely move more others say they are turning their focus to chinese consumers china is a big market for us if we can seize our own market we will be less affected by the trade war said a spokesperson for topsun a furniture manufacturer in zhejiang province chinese tariffs on us agricultural products will also affect chinese importers lu who runs a shop at a fruit retail centre in central beijing said the prices of imported us fruit subject to tariffs of as much as 50 are certain to rise still he understands the us perspective americans want to earn more money so they started a trade war i can understand that who doesn t want to earn more money he said chinese media reported a container ship carrying 70 000 tons of us soybeans was racing to reach the port of dalian on friday before retaliatory tariffs were implemented some chinese ports have stopped clearing us goods while waiting for official guidance according to reuters trump has threatened to raise tariffs if china retaliates to roughly the value of total chinese exports to the us last year of 506bn he told reporters aboard air force one on thursday you have another 16 billion dollars in two weeks and then as you know we have 200bn in abeyance and then after the 200bn we have 300bn in abeyance ok so we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300 analysts say tariffs are not the most effective way of putting pressure on china which the us accuses of unfair trade practices and stealing intellectual property from us companies syracuse university economics professor mary lovely and researcher yang liang found 87 of electronics products to be levied by us tariffs came from multinationals and joint ventures rather than chinese firms china s economy is no longer as dependent on exports domestic consumption now accounts for more than half of the country s gdp exports to the us account for only 19 of all of china s exports the reciprocal tariffs on us 50bn of goods in both directions will have minimal impact in china andy rothman an investment strategist at matthews asia wrote in a blog this week china s tariffs on major us exports like soybeans sorghum and autos target republican areas ahead of us midterm elections the impact on the us political environment is however likely to be far greater he said one area that will be hurt by us tariffs is china s high tech industries in things like new energy vehicles robotics and other forms of smart manufacturing that form the country s made in china 2025 industrial plan cheng dawei a professor of international trade at renmin university in beijing says these industries are still in their early stages and need inputs from global supply chains in the short run china will be affected badly but the tariffs will bring double lose results china is never the only side to suffer she said imposing high tariffs definitely hurts china badly but we will not be beaten down additional reporting by wang xueying
