 2016 while some allies want her to nudge sanders out others say he s only behaving like she did eight years ago by annie karni 04 26 2016 10 55 pm edt hillary clinton speaks during a campaign rally at snug harbor s great hall on april 17 2016 in the staten island borough of new york city getty philadelphia pa in the wake of her victories in pennsylvania maryland connecticut and delaware some of hillary clinton s top operatives are ready for bernie sanders to call it quits but clinton s own refusal to give up in 2008 even after she had no real path forward remains an obstacle to ramping up that pressure indeed some veterans of clinton s 2008 campaign are urging empathy and space for sanders emphasizing that the decision to slog on is not about having a viable path forward it s about feeling that you ve gone as far as you can go advertisement at rallies women would literally grab her hand say don t you dare drop out don t you quit recalled howard wolfson clinton s former communications director of the 2008 end game your head told you the math didn t add up but your heart said we re continuing to win states we re continuing to draw big crowds and it s very hard to walk away from a contest when you have millions of supporters who are clearly still determined to help you get elected like others in clinton s 2008 brain trust wolfson said he understands why sanders wants to keep fighting you begin to conclude this is a cause that s bigger than yourself he explained of the campaign s mindset in the spring of 2008 i m sure there are the same sets of pressure on the sanders camp today but for current clinton officials in the trenches in brooklyn there has been growing frustration with the tone of sanders campaign and in particular his bullish campaign manager jeff weaver who seems to double down on the attacks with each setback rather than make any overt calls for sanders to get out clinton s top campaign officials tried a subtler approach stressing that after tuesday night s losses it will be virtually impossible for sanders to catch up and her army of surrogates have been told not to call on sanders to drop out but to change his tone and drop the attacks for now though he s still fighting even as clinton appears to have wrapped up the nomination but hinting at a new approach on tuesday night sanders put out a statement congratulating clinton on her wins and hinting that he would stay in through the convention to promote his driving issues a 15 minimum wage ending disastrous trade policies and breaking up the big banks among other bullet points 2016 by patrick reis the clintons themselves have a philosophy of fighting on as bill clinton likes to say until the last dog dies and in 2008 hillary kept kicking through the final primaries on june 3 where she won south dakota and barack obama won montana but that gritty philosophy does not engender sympathy for her challenger frustrated by sanders ability to capture the public s imagination with a powerful message that has exposed the amorphous nature of her own clinton close allies said does not regard his decision to stay in the race through the convention as comparable to her own in 2008 on her victory night party stage at the philadelphia convention center the venue where the democratic national convention will be held in july clinton said she applauded sanders for pushing the issue of income inequality whether you support sen sanders or you support me there s much more that unites us than divides us she told an enthusiastic crowd of 1 300 supporters sanders campaign has said the path ahead now depends on flipping superdelegates to his side come summer a similar strategy to clinton s last ditch efforts in 2008 back then bill clinton was phoning superdelegates reportedly trying to convince them that the country wasn t ready to elect an african american president hillary clinton refused to make such calls out of what allies say was a mixture of fear of rejection and sense of entitlement this time sanders campaign is pointing to national polls where he still beats clinton but just like eight years ago democrats said it is hard to see a scenario where superdelegates would go against the candidate leading in pledged delegates as well as the popular vote some democrats said they wonder if in the same way clinton s campaign hoped for a bombshell that would undermine obama s nomination the potential existence of an alleged tape which never materialized showing michelle obama using the word whitey animated the clintons in the final months of the campaign sanders is holding out for an outside blow to clinton mused one clinton ally is sanders secretly banking on an fbi report like clinton in 2008 sanders also appears to be making a last ditch racial argument tucked into a demographic one it was after clinton won indiana on may 6 that she told usa today senator obama s support among working hard working americans white americans is weakening her comment which she believed was stretched to contain an unintended racist subtext is reminiscent of sanders dismissal of clinton s victories in the south where she overwhelmed him thanks to support from african american voters that is the most conservative part of this country sanders said at the brooklyn debate earlier this month that s the fact but you know what we re out of the deep south now and we re moving up but there are also differences in the candidates behavior in the final months of the primary calendar clinton developed a constituency in the final third of the campaign and came into her own impressing people with her grit sanders in contrast has been hammering home the same message that has driven his campaign since day one and escalated his attacks as the road ahead narrows on tuesday his wife jane said sanders would only release his past tax returns after clinton released the transcripts of her paid speeches in front of wall street firms the campaign also released a heated fundraising plea accusing clinton allies of saying that sanders presence in the race he was helping donald trump let me be clear weaver wrote there is one candidate in this democratic primary who donald trump said would make a great president and it s not bernie sanders by daniel strauss clinton s own history may prevent her from calling for sanders to drop out of the race but she can point to her own ultimate embrace of obama if sanders continues on the attack after the may primaries of kentucky and west virginia 2008 veterans recalled clinton tried to pivot away from a contrast with obama and focus more on a positive message for now sanders senior strategist tad devine has kept an open line of communication with the clinton campaign but he said he s not ready for any negotiations we decided he s going to compete all the way through to california and d c he said we think that s good obviously how good that is for her depends on what he says but nobody can deny the good of registering voters even clinton s sympathetic 2008 allies however said it would be critical for sanders to give up a floor fight at the convention the republican convention will devolve into total chaos wolfson said which will have a negative impact on the perception of the part it would be enormously beneficial to demonstrate a contrast to that clinton s 2008 traveling press secretary mo elleithee who fielded the intense pressure to drop out said now that clinton can campaign as the presumptive nominee it will be the most challenging period for sanders operatives i had to go to the back of the plane everyday and justify to the press why we were in the race elleithee said it s one of the toughest jobs in politics when you have to argue against math
