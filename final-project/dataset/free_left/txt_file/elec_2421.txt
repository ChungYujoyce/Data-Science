please read our updated privacy notice and terms of use effective on december 19 2019 if you re a republican who has been clinging to the wan hope that donald trump might somehow in his eighth decade on earth develop into a plausibly competent president of the united states the first debate should have been your moment to abandon ship trump displayed the factual command of a small child the emotional stability of a hormonal teen and the stamina of an old man staggering and losing the thread as the 90 minutes wore on instead republicans without a single exception i have seen have responded very differently they have treated their candidate s glaring unsuitability for high office as at worst a handful of discrete errors that in no way reflect on his character and at best the dastardly unfairness of the liberal media among the optimists was conservative columnist holman jenkins who registered his approval with the candidate s ability to clear two impressive hurdles make it through the debate without literally dying and display the ability to make at least one planned action he is not a lifelong politician like mrs clinton and it showed writes jenkins but he survived on stage notice he also apparently made a strategic decision not to raise bill clinton s infidelities and stuck to it jenkins is at least conceding implicitly that the debate would be considered a loss for trump if he had keeled over dead but to pat him on the head for having made a strategic decision i e a decision not to attack hillary clinton for her husband s infidelity and then follow it is setting the bar very low the ability to follow through on a decision is a developmental step in children that ranks just above object permanence perhaps jenkins would be impressed if clinton left during a break and trump noticed she was gone the triumph of trump planning not to bring up the affairs and then managing not to is also mitigated by the fact that he immediately expressed his regret for it afterward national review which had published a splashy issue devoted to denouncing trump during the primary used its post debate editorial not to remind readers that the array of disqualifying traits it had once denounced were on vivid display but instead to chastise moderator lester holt for exposing them we have our criticisms of donald trump too wrote national review in the only sentence in the editorial that even hinted at any flaw on trump s part but his electoral fate should be up to the voters not lester holt and his colleagues likewise paul beston decried holt s query to both candidates if they would respect the outcome of the election as his lowest moment asking indignantly h ow he could even pose such a question perhaps holt asked because trump has repeatedly called the election rigged and told his supporters that massive fraud is the only way we can lose holt s alleged bias was a favorite subject on the right every question that exposed trump s unprecedented violation of political norms simply proved to conservatives that their party was being singled out for unprecedented scrutiny conservatives expressed a mix of resentment and confusion that trump faced hostile questions and scrutiny for his refusal to take the expected and routine step of releasing his tax returns they present trump as an innocent man guilty of nothing worse than failing to adequately defend himself these columns warned mr trump and gop voters during the primaries that by not releasing his returns he was giving democrats an opening to assert what he might be hiding warns the wall street journal note the scare quotes around the term hiding as if it is a hyperbolic and unfair term to apply to the act of not revealing something that is customarily shared trump did not refute clinton s charge reminiscent of harry reid s no evidence attack on mitt romney in 2012 that trump pays no federal income taxes complains byron york that makes me smart trump said which sounded if anything like a confirmation of clinton s accusation the charge had no evidence yet trump said words that sounded to people who understand words like a confirmation of the charge almost as if the charge is somehow true is it possible that trump is refusing to disclose his returns because they would show something disqualifying conservatives do not even consider the scenario anymore trump is simply the victim of a combination of insinuation and his own poor salesmanship the new york times which recently published a harrowing account of trump s debate preparation or lack thereof today has an equally harrowing account of his failures trump surrounds himself with completely unqualified advisers offering bad advice a large number of voluble people on his prep team including two retired military figures with no political background his advisers are hoping after the first debate to impress upon him the need to stick to a strategy and a plan of battle trump has a childlike attention span he did not seem to pay attention during the practice sessions and found his efforts at serious preparation derailed by the influence of serial predator roger ailes who turned the sessions into gripefests around the fallout from his serial predation so trump according to the people trying to help him win is unable to pick good staff manage his time follow advice or even accept the connection between preparing for an event and succeeding at it republicans have so internalized trump s wild unsuitability for the presidency that they have decided to treat these facts as mere hurdles to overcome on the path to the presidency but why are they trying to help him win in the first place update the sentence i originally cited was not the editorial s only criticism of trump national review s editorial does gently upbraid him for failing to anticipate the unfair questioning he faced and for not adequately attacking his opponent the institutional slant of the media being what it is the republican nominee is always at a disadvantage when it comes to debate moderators and should prepare accordingly it was clear from his performance last night that trump did not adequately prepare for what were entirely predictable lines of questioning he also missed several opportunities to go on the offensive against a uniquely vulnerable opponent he s a well known lover of the truth for loeffler a lot of damage has already been done the justice department notified three senators on tuesday that it will not pursue insider trading charges against them after an investigation into stock transactions from the early days of the coronavirus pandemic did not find sufficient evidence they had broken the law according to a person briefed on the investigations the department contacted lawyers for senators kelly loeffler republican of georgia james inhofe republican of oklahoma and dianne feinstein democrat of california all threehad sold substantial amounts of stockin late january or early february when lawmakers were being briefed on the novel coronavirus threat but before the pandemic began roiling financial markets or was fully understood by the public law enforcement officials appear to still be investigating senator richard m burr republican of north carolina whose own mid february stock sales have drawn scrutiny from the justice department and securities and exchange commission last week f b i agentsseized mr burr s cellphone good news out of new york katie miller the highest profile trump administration member to have contracted coronavirus is doing better a real sign of the times georgia s governor bids for the rnc amid talk that charlotte might not host after all there needs to be something for democrats to panic about and right now this is it in early april jason furman a top economist in the obama administration and now a professor at harvard was speaking via zoom to a large bipartisan group of top officials from both parties the economy had just been shut down unemployment was spiking and some policymakers were predicting an era worse than the great depression the economic carnage seemed likely to doom president donald trump s chances at reelection furman tapped to give the opening presentation looked into his screen of poorly lit boxes of frightened wonks and made a startling claim we are about to see the best economic data we ve seen in the history of this country he said the former cabinet secretaries and federal reserve chairs in the zoom boxes were confused though some of the republicans may have been newly relieved and some of the democrats suddenly concerned everyone looked puzzled and thought i had misspoken furman said in an interview instead of forecasting a prolonged depression level economic catastrophe furman laid out a detailed case for why the months preceding the november election could offer trump the chance to brag truthfully about the most explosive monthly employment numbers and gdp growth ever risk public health or else president donald trump on monday morning threatened to move august s republican national convention out of north carolina unless there are guarantees the state will let everyone attend i love the great state of north carolina so much so that i insisted on having the republican national convention in charlotte at the end of august unfortunately democrat governor roycoopernc is still in shutdown mood unable to guarantee that by august we will be allowed full attendance in the arena he began in a string of four tweets the rncis scheduled to be held in charlotte on aug 24 27 less than a week after democrats are set to wrap up their rescheduled convention in milwaukee it s not clear where the republican convention might be moved or how easily that could be done on relatively short notice and this is only part of why the way too late european travel ban was a complete disaster the europe restrictions followed six weeks later but unleashed chaos in ways that surpassed even that of the muslim ban current and former officials said key agencies including the departments of homeland security and transportation had no meaningful input in the nature of the europe restrictions or how and when they would be executed an administration official said officials from both agencies were present at meetings where the ban was discussed the administration scrambled to round up contractors to conduct temperature checks on tens of thousands of passengers officials said the magnitude of the mobilization was unprecedented even so the contractors were overrun by the rush of travelers that trump had helped unleash even the most basic screening steps seemed to backfire the cdc failed to distribute a new paper questionnaire in time for it to be shared with airlines in advance meaning passengers had to fill it out upon arrival as a result travelers found themselves reaching around one another for slips of paper and pencils
