while we may feel powerless over this threat we are not there are important things we can and must do and right now the world health organization has declared the covid 19 outbreak to be a pandemic official recognition that the virus respects no borders and now affects masses of people in countries all over the world and there is no denying the world is changing in painful ways we see it in financial markets where prices are plunging and in supermarkets where customers are stripping shelves bare all driven by fear as the number of virus cases grows with each passing day while we may feel powerless over this threat we are not there are important things we can and must do and right now to borrow a phrase from the war on terror the coronavirus only has to be right once to infect us we have to be right every time to prevent it so every time you cough or sneeze use a tissue or the crook of your arm every time you think of it wash your hands as frequently as you can every time you can practice social distancing stay away from others during this outbreak social distancing is now being enforced throughout our society schools are closing sporting events of every kind are being canceled the curtain has even come down on broadway shows as the great white way goes dark despite our best efforts it s likely many of us will eventually get infected by the virus since we have no immunity to it if that s the case you may ask does it really matter whenwe get infected the answer is a resounding yes and here s why slowing the spread of coronavirus and consequently delaying infections can make an enormous difference in our ability to handle the pandemic take a look at the illustration below which is based on a cdc report the yellow curve shows what happens when you do nothing the number of infections peaks relatively quickly this can overwhelm a health care system that is not prepared to handle such a huge number of patients emergency rooms and hospitals can become overloaded we may see shortages of medical supplies including protective gear and breathing machines and shortages of health care workers especially if many of them become infected but look at the purple curve it shows what can happen when you slow the epidemic the outbreak is stretched out and while it may last longer the peak number of infections is much lower putting less stress on the health care system and allowing better care for each patient it also gives scientists more time to develop new treatments and vaccines is there any evidence this works absolutely especially when coupled with the time proven technique of aggressive testing to find and isolate infected people as early as possible in china where there has been strict quarantine and social distancing in the epicenter of the outbreak new infections have dramatically slowed in south korea where health officials cleverly used drive through testing we re also seeing the number of new cases slow down and there s a history lesson from the1918 flu pandemic back then philadelphia held a parade attended by several hundred thousand people soon every hospital bed in the city reportedly was filled with sick patients st louis on the other hand practiced social isolation and saw fewer cases so we have work to do and it won t be easy because it means changing the way we live our daily lives and how we interact with our neighbors and we have to start now when we can make the most difference a very helpful visual to explain the critical importance of school sports and public assembly cancellations and why everyone has a role in reducing the spread of covid19 flattenthecurve pic twitter com 3bssrdhyzs one important approach is to try to protect the most vulnerable especially people with serious medical problems such as hypertension diabetes heart disease or a weakened immune system and older people have been more severely affected than the young in italy for example there has been a dramatic spike in death rate in patients with covid 19 who are 70 and over therefore it makes sense for the elderly and people with serious medical conditions to voluntarily self isolate now and here s something we need to keep in mind we are all in this together so even as we keep a distance from each other physically we need to stay close emotionally social isolation is bad for your health if ever there was a time to call or video chat with friends and loved ones it is now and don t forget to reach out to the elderly who may be alone and afraid demonstrating grace under pressure is easier said than done but that is this doctor s prescription for getting through this and if we treat each other with kindness and empathy we will dr jonathan lapook is the chief medical correspondent for cbs news follow him on twitter at drlapook copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
