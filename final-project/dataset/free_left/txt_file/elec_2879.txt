donald trump s presidential campaign is how he has convinced millions of middle class white americans that he truly gives a shit about them how can it be i ve often wondered that a billionaire who lives in a pink marble triplex high above fifth avenue one who flies around in his own aging boeing 757 and who owns a weekend home in palm beach and property in new jersey horse country can somehow become the hero of the people left in the wake of the new digital economy these voters indeed have every right to wonder what happened to their american dream they have every right to be worried about their livelihood and their future they have every right to be equally terrified and aggrieved about the slow growth of the real economy and how it has made the life that we have come to expect for generations all but unattainable trump of course has never quite evidenced sympathy for the common man according to a recent bombshell report in the washington post in fact we now know that trump s own foundation reportedly spent 20 000 to purchase a six foot portrait of trump himself perhaps trump s appeal to the rust belt results in part from the fact that he is a former television star who showed up in our living rooms every week in a fictitious corporate boardroom sara flynn a 55 year old mother of four sons in hebron kentucky recently explained to reporters from the new york times that she has liked trump ever since she watched him on the apprentice she said that she believes trump when he says he can make america great again she seemed wistful that s a bygone era that s when america was great she said of the old days it hasn t been like that for me trump s brand depends upon fever dreams more than realities i suspect part of the reason that flynn and others like her feel an affinity for trump is because of the promises he makes in his speeches like the one he gave on thursday to the economic club of new york at the waldorf astoria hotel which is now owned by a chinese insurance company the speech was likely written by one of the reagan era economic disciples who whisper in trump s ears these days maybe it was larry kudlow the ex bear stearns economist and cnbc veteran he was on the dais over trump s right shoulder or maybe it was stephen moore formerly a columnist at the wall street journal who is now a visiting fellow at the conservative heritage foundation trump s words certainly sounded a bit like reagan s fresh from his two hour photo op in flint michigan the day before he told the invitation only crowd in new york it used to be cars were made in flint and you couldn t drink the water in mexico now the cars are made in mexico and you can t drink the water in flint it s a good line and trump presumably knew it he had in fact also used it in flint the day before like some of what trump says it is funny but like much of what he says it isn t true we make millions of cars and car parts in america a recent study by the center for automotive research in fact revealed that the auto industry accounts for about 3 percent or nearly 75 billion of all foreign direct investment in the united states but trump s brand depends upon fever dreams more than realities trump laid the promises on thick at the waldorf we are going to turn this around he continued my economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining that our jobs will keep leaving and that our economy can never grow as it did once before we reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise and that all that s left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources everything that is broken today can be fixed and every failure can be turned into a great success trump subsequently promised to create 25 million new jobs more jobs than certain credible economists believe that there will be workers to fill he promised to cut taxes he promised to cut regulations he promised to repatriate the trillions of dollars in corporate profit he estimated the figure at 5 trillion and to make child care costs tax deductible he promised to rip up the trade agreements that he despises nafta and the t p p he promised that the economy which has been stuck at around 2 percent annual economic growth for the last 10 years or so would start growing at 3 5 percent per year and maybe 4 percent per year if everything goes as he predicts it will should that happen trump suggested our 600 billion annual deficit would decrease he also promised to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent an explosion of new business and new jobs will be created he said it will be amazing to watch he then engaged in a little voodoo economics we are proposing a 4 4 trillion tax cut that will score as 2 6 trillion under a dynamic growth model which is how taxes should be scored he said if larry kudlow is around could he please translate that sentence into a language one of trump s supporters or even mere journalists might understand trump then promised to put coal miners and steel workers back to work despite the fact that so many of the companies that operate in the coal sector face existential struggles and those that operate in the steel sector are a shadow of their former selves in his hyperbolic way trump reminds me of harold hill from the music man i am going to lower your taxes he told the bankers at the waldorf i am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations on business and in your life i m going to unleash american energy i m going to repeal and replace obamacare i m going to appoint justices to the supreme court who will follow the constitution i m going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets i m going to save your second amendment i m going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country and yes we will build the wall mexico will pay and i m going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals especially nafta and we will only make great trade deals that put the american worker first i would be shocked if a president trump succeeded at accomplishing any of these things since most of them are far outside the boundaries of what most americans want or believe is right during a question and answer session however trump started bashing the zero interest rate policies of the federal reserve the fed is quickly becoming one of trump s favorite whipping boys in ohio earlier this month trump said that the fed was keeping interest rates artificially low so that president obama can claim that he has run the economy well he s wrong about that obama can t influence the fed or not easily anyway but he said we have a bad economy everybody understands that but it s a false economy trump is right to criticize the fed s zero interest rate policy which has been in effect since 2008 and has done much to add to the growing gap between rich and poor in this country by keeping interest rates so low for so long the fed has penalized the approximately 50 million americans who live on fixed incomes dependent as they are on interest income on their savings pensions or other retirement plans the low interest rates mean their interest income is minuscule and has been for years for instance the interest rate my bank pays me on my savings is 06 percent goldman sachs meanwhile which is trying to attract deposits is paying 1 05 percent in other words these days the big banks get the use of our money nearly for free and then make a fortune off of it who else benefits from the low interest rates anyone who makes money from money bankers traders hedge fund moguls and private equity mavens they can borrow money more cheaply than ever before and then they can turn around and lend it or invest it for higher rates of return than what they paid for it thanks to the fed the stock market has never been higher and interest rates have never been lower but as one hedge fund manager told me recently he doesn t know a single person who is happy about those things or much else trumpism has capitalized on that frustration among others at the waldorf however trump admitted he has benefitted from the fed s low interest rate policies too he is a multi billionaire after all and he lamented that being president would prevent him from further benefitting from them since presumably he will be required to put the entire trump extravaganza into a blind trust in the end fittingly the one issue upon which trump is actually on the right side of history is not one he even believes in it was yet
