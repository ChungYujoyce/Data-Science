the big idea bernie sanders campaign expressed concern before saturday night s debate about cbs decision to put additional emphasis on foreign policy in the wake of the paris attacks that left 129 dead many expected that hillary rodham clinton would show a command of global issues that the senator from vermont lacked further consolidating her status as the frontrunner for the democratic nomination clinton indeed highlighted her experience but the shift wound up working to sanders advantage for the first 30 minutes of the two hour debate the former secretary of state was on the defensive about everything from the obama administration being caught off guard by the rise of the islamic state to her 13 year old vote for the iraq war regime changes have unintended consequences sanders said on this issue i m a little more conservative than the secretary it was a taste of the debate as a whole which turned to a far greater extent than the previous meeting on clinton s record and positions with only three candidates on stage sanders and former maryland gov martin o malley also got more time to speak in las vegas the candidates were unprepared to attack clinton on foreign policy no one even challenged her when she characterized libya as a success story this time it was clinton who had to explain why removing muammar gaddafi was justified with the world on fire and rising fears about terrorism at home clinton quickly distanced herself from president obama at the top the day before the paris attacks he told abc that isis has not been completely decapitated but that u s efforts had contained the group i don t think they re gaining strength and we have contained them the president told george stephanopoulos in a not subtle line hillary declared we have to look at isis as the leading threat of an international terror network it cannot be contained it must be defeated she also referred to her early support for arming moderate rebels in the syrian civil war which the president hesitated on to be sure sanders did not look like a commander in chief and his insistence that climate change is still our biggest national security threat made him look out of his depth and unserious in the face of global terrorism but very few democrats still believe that someone besides clinton will actually be their nominee so there s less concern about him actually having the nuclear launch codes instead all eyes were on her when the debate moved to the domesticissues on which sanders is more comfortable the event became more spirited the most heated fight of the night came over reforming wall street sanders said clinton s wall street proposal was not good enough and o malley called it weak tea the des moines debate will ultimately be remembered for just one moment clinton playing both the gender card and invoking the sept 11 attacks to defend her coziness with and campaign cash from wall street here is the exchange that everyone is talking about many liberal thought leaders concurred that clinton sanswer was giuliani esque the kerfuffle is breaking through to voters twitter and facebook both say thatthe 9 11 moment generated moreconversation than any other exchange during the face off npr calculatesthat wall street and the banks got more time than any other issue by its count the back and forthtook up 11 minutes and 18 seconds of airtime compared to 9 minutes and 16 seconds on foreign policy and 6 minutes on isis specifically the 9 11 related clips that posted overnight are brutal and it seems certain that the mainstream media and cable news will zero in withsecond day follow ups a taste of how rivals are already trying to capitalize clinton tried to walk it back later in the debate as twitter exploded cbs presented herwith an emblematic viewer tweet university of iowa law professor andy grewal wrote have never seen a candidate invoke 9 11 to justify millions of wall street donations until now clinton replied i m sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression yes i did know people i had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds and say i don t agree with you on everything but i like what you do i like how you stand up in the spin room her communications director highlighted a tough on wall street speech from before the financial meltdown clinton argued that her financial regulatory proposal is tougher more effective and more comprehensive than sanders because i go after all of wall street not just the big banks demonstrating the passion and enthusiasm of his supporters sanders also received more buzz and mentionsthan she she did according toour analytics partners at zignal labs sanders accounted for 202 000 of the 370 000 mentions of the candidates during the debate compared to 152 000 for clinton facebook also saidsanders got more mentions than clinton on its platform and vermont was the most engagedstate on the social network during the debate here s a chart tracking mentions over the two hours to be sure many observers point outthat very few people were watching last night and the race s underlying dynamics still remain the same the post s dan balz and philip rucker write on ourfront page that the result appeared unlikely to change the overall shape of a nomination battle that has moved back in clinton s direction in recent weeks otherthemesin the post debate coverage looking ahead clinton understands that the democratic race has once again become a referendum on her you ve heard a lot about me in this debate she said in her closing statement i m going to keep talking and thinking about all of you the next two democratic debates are also scheduled for weekends when very few will watch the saturday before christmas and the sunday before mlk day the dnc denies it naturally but this was an obvious ploy to minimize viewership in order to help out the front runner after the first debate suppressing viewership seemed unnecessary after last night
