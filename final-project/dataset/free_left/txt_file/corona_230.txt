source of reprieve some expired n95 face masks stockpiled by the state for emergency use the california department of public health said friday that some of its 21 million n95 filtering masks have been made available to use at hospitals and health care facilities to ease shortages of personal protective equipment in the state many of those are expired masks that have been saved from prior uses such as wildfire season in the medical community there has been growing concern over consumers emptying store shelves of equipment they might not need those working in medical settings are advised to wear protective masks particularly to prevent transmission between patients and professionals but u s surgeon general jerome adams urged consumers earlier this week to stop buying masks because they have not proved effective at preventing transmission in public now medical professionals are facing a shortage of those supplies medical professionals can use masks that are past their shelf life according to the california department of public health because a study by the centers for disease control and prevention found them to be just as effective as those on the store shelves the cdc said that the release of expired masks for the coronavirus outbreak was an extraordinary measure the respirators exceeding their manufacturer designated shelf life are only being released due to the

quarantine or they could give workers the average amount of pay they usually earn if they have to stop working in statements shared with the washington post the companies said they were looking into how to handle coronavirus issues but none committed to warner s suggestions uber went the furthest saying it was exploring compensation for drivers who have been quarantined or diagnosed with coronavirus whether independently through a fund or in partnership with peer companies warner cited a march 2 article in the post that highlighted gig workers concerns and their potential vulnerability if the virus spreads both because of the nature of their work and the lack of a safety net the companies have long insisted that those who deliver goods and food pick up groceries and transport passengers using the companies digital platforms are not employees but contract workers as such they are not entitled to benefits such as health care and sick days which are provided to

that those travelers are going through extra screening but instead of having it done once they arrive in the united states it s being done before they even board their flights at an industry event sponsored by the u s chamber of commerce this week david e short deputy assistant transportation secretary for aviation and international affairs said that the trump administration has agreements in place with south korea and italy to screen passengers when they leave those countries administration officials determined that doing the screening once they land in the united states was seen as not

federal employees have extensive interaction with the general public as part of their regular duties the letter said of particular concern are those who have been or are likely to be called upon to

that the travel restrictions china implemented domestically once the scope of the outbreak of a novel coronavirus in wuhan became apparent likely only delayed the spread of the illness by three to five days in addition the international travel restrictions including ones the trump administration imposed starting in late january and continues to tout as its most effective policies to combat the virus significantly delayed but did not prevent the spread of the virus abroad the study which simulated the spread of the disease using travel data and epidemic modeling found that the combination of an extended stringent set of travel restrictions with policies to cut transmission of the disease within the united states will be needed to gain control of this outbreak moving forward we expect that travel restrictions to covid 19 affected areas will have modest effects the study states and that transmission reduction interventions will provide the greatest benefit to mitigate the epidemic the trump administration has repeatedly pointed to its travel restrictions as an effective tool in keeping americans safe from the virus at the same time the united states has not taken many of the steps other affected nations such as italy have in limiting large public gatherings to cut transmission rates u s officials have also lagged behind in making test kits available to states which may have let many cases go undetected the study found that even once china implemented its strictest internal travel bans numerous disease carrying individuals had likely already traveled abroad seeding disease

was taking into account factors like whether they were physically near and whether they hugged or shared food gayles said each contact is then assigned a risk level and depending on that assessment

400 people the world health organization on tuesday stated that the global case fatality rate is 3 4 percent but that figure can be misleading if not framed correctly u s health officials on thursday briefed lawmakers in congress and said they believe the case fatality rate in this country will most likely be in the range of 0 1 to 1 0 percent meaning that somewhere between one of every 1 000 and one of every 100 people diagnosed with covid 19 will die that is roughly the same lethality range as influenza another respiratory disease that can trigger severe pandemics although the coronavirus is not believed to be as contagious as a typical flu the who s fatality number is based simply on the ratio of the number of deaths globally the numerator to the number of confirmed cases of covid 19 the denominator as of friday the who had counted 3 381 deaths among 98 202 cases but the official numbers do not capture the full scope of the contagion the actual number of deaths from the virus might be
