advertisement supported by by jonathan martin and richard fausset roswell ga jon ossoff a democrat making his first bid for elective office narrowly missed winning outright in a heavily conservative house district in georgia on wednesday throwing a scare into republicans in a special congressional election that was seen as an early referendum on president trump mr ossoff received 48 1 percent of the vote just short of the 50 percent threshold needed to win the seat and he will face karen handel the top republican vote getter in a june runoff a documentary filmmaker and former congressional staff member mr ossoff 30 had hoped to avert a runoff in the sixth district a republican dominated section of the atlanta suburbs that had been represented by tom price who is now mr trump s health and human services secretary but despite his financial advantage mr ossoff had raised 8 3 million more than quadruple that of the next closest candidate and a highly energized liberal base a majority was just out of reach in a district that has not sent a democrat to congress since the carter administration mr ossoff released a statement early wednesday after the race was called this is already a remarkable victory he said we defied the odds shattered expectations and now are ready to fight on and win in june mr ossoff s strong showing will ensure that national democrats continue to compete here and will increase pressure on the party to contest a special house election next month in montana that it has so far ignored combined with democrats better than expected performance in a special house election in kansas last week the georgia result will be an immediate boon to democratic groups lifting their fund raising and bolstering candidate recruitment efforts while sobering republicans who are assessing whether to run in mr trump s first midterm election already republican candidates and outside groups have had to spend over 7 million against democrats in a series of deeply conservative districts early wednesday mr trump who had posted a number of twitter messages on the contest in the last few days claimed a victory for republicans before the race was called as mr ossoff faces ms handel in a head to head race on june 20 it is unclear whether he will be able to sustain the success he enjoyed on tuesday in an 18 person field ms handel who received just under 20 percent of the vote is a former georgia secretary of state and is viewed as an establishment friendly republican while she has struggled in her two most recent campaigns losing primaries for governor and senator she will receive the full support of a party that dominates georgia politics as well as nearly unlimited resources from washington republicans in the runoff ms handel 55 has portrayed herself as a trump supporter though she was less fervent in her backing for him than were the other republican candidates in the race who adopted mr trump s catchphrases and style in an attempt to stand out the intense republican competition and liberal enthusiasm lifted democratic hopes that they could snatch a surprise victory we are certainly going for an outright win here today mr ossoff told cnn on tuesday before the polls closed here s how we analyzed georgia s special election through about 11 p m eastern on tuesday which the democrat jon ossoff who just narrowly missed an outright win had cast as a referendum on president trump much as they did in last week s race in kansas democrats initially got their hopes up after promising early vote returns were posted soon after polls closed but as the election day results trickled in it became clear that those early and absentee ballots reflecting their fired up base would not be sufficient to match the republicans structural advantage in the district on tuesday night hundreds of ossoff supporters crammed into a ballroom at a crowne plaza hotel cries of delight erupted as early returns flashed on big television screens but many attendees were cautiously optimistic with an emphasis on caution janice owens 60 a project manager who had been knocking on doors and making calls for mr ossoff said she and others would not feel the effort was wasted if mr ossoff failed to avert a runoff i don t think anybody thinks it s for naught she said because we re not giving up if anything the ossoff campaign showed how democrats had been successful even in this republican friendly chunk of suburbia in converting an enthusiastic but inchoate anti trump movement into a real political force ms handel took the stage at a lightly attended victory party of her own shortly after 11 p m to claim her spot in the runoff and urge republicans to unify to stop democrats effort to steal a seat this year there will be seven special house and senate elections five to fill vacancies left by members of the trump administration ms handel battling a few bouts of feedback from a microphone invoked the great legacy of a district that she noted had produced the former house speaker newt gingrich senator johnny isakson and mr price but she made no mention of mr trump ms handel dismissed her opponent as a young man beholden to national liberals and vowed to kick a little ossoff the contest here effectively represented the first performance review at the ballot box for mr trump and the republican congress among the sort of upscale voters who were left without a political home last fall mr price s former district is the most highly educated republican controlled district in the country and while the president won here in atlanta s booming northern suburbs he did so by just a single point four years after mitt romney romped to a 23 point victory for all of the attention lavished on the working class rust belt voters who flocked to mr trump s campaign voters who have flourished in the 21st century economy will prove more crucial when it comes to the fight for control of congress next year if democrats are to have a chance at recapturing the house they will have to win over the dominant constituency here suburbanites who only grudgingly cast a presidential ballot in november and have no deep affinity for either mr trump or the democrats none of the major republican contenders pointedly distanced themselves from the president they did not dare anger the partisans most likely to vote in a spring special election but most of them did not make him central to their appeals either with republican party officials worried that democratic enthusiasm might be enough for mr ossoff to get more than 50 percent of the vote and win the seat outright though mr trump eventually did weigh in on the contest he recorded a robocall delivered monday to republican voters in the district warning that mr ossoff would raise your taxes destroy your health care and flood our country with illegal immigrants and he posted on twitter a series of messages similarly criticizing mr ossoff while prodding republicans to force runoff mr ossoff walked a careful line when it came to mr trump he opened his bid with donor tailored appeals to make trump furious and continued similar targeted advertising throughout his campaign but he also sought to cast himself as a consensus oriented moderate focused on the district dismissing mr trump s late intervention as so much noise from washington sensing an opportunity to deliver an early blow to mr trump and nudged ahead by an animated base hungry to register its fury democrats aggressively competed to win outright on tuesday and avert a more directly partisan runoff in addition to mr ossoff s astounding 8 3 million haul through the end of march the house democratic campaign arm poured money and staff into the district republicans were as fractured as democrats were unified with political veterans such as ms handel on the ballot as well as newcomers who saw an opportunity at a moment when the party seemed to be in flux the republican field was divided over the failed bill to repeal the affordable care act but it treated the issue delicately in what amounted to a concession that what was once the safest stance in a republican primary demanding full repeal of president barack obama s health care law was not so clear cut any longer in an illustration of how nationalized the race became 95 percent of mr ossoff s fund raising haul was from out of state and even more was from outside the district where the candidate himself does not reside though he grew up there republicans blistered him on this score and much else a kitchen sink campaign that totaled 5 million yet also stirred muttering within the party about why there had not been a more coherent approach to a district they knew would be competitive given mr trump s weakness here but the unrelenting republican assault eventually paid off raising mr ossoff s negative ratings and nudging conservative voters to show up for an unusual spring election advertisement
