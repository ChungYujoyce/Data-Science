coronavirus began in china several months ago and since then the virus and fear of it have been spreading around the world there is no vaccine for coronavirus yet but there is a treatment for fear it s called facts and here is a dose of them coronavirus causes a respiratory disease called covid 19 symptoms include fever cough and shortness of breath most cases about eight out of ten are mild the more serious cases can lead to severe lung damage coronavirus is thought to spread mostly through close contact an infected person coughs or sneezes sending droplets containing the virus through the air someone nearby say up to about six feet away breathes those droplets and can become infected the virus can also spread hand to hand you touch an object that has the virus on it then touch your mouth nose perhaps even your eye scientists are studying how long the coronavirus can survive on various surfaces or whether there are other ways of spread just two days ago a study from china of nearly 1 100 patients with covid 19 reported a mortality rate of 1 4 percent that means that of every thousand people infected 14 will die the death rate with flu is about 1 in a thousand but some scientists feel the actual rate with coronavirus may be lower and in fact closer to flu because there are likely many cases we don t know about either because they are mild or the patients have no symptoms at all also people who are older or who have other ailments such as diabetes or lung disease appear to be at greater risk for getting a severe case of coronavirus but for some reason children seem to be relatively spared right now there s a shortage of testing kits for the virus when more testing is available we ll get a better idea of how widespread this virus is we ll be able to screen communities for both active infection and evidence of past infection in the united states we re starting to hear about a small number of cases of covid 19 from what s called community spread that means there is no clear source of infection such as travel to an affected region or close contact with a patient this is not at all surprising especially since people will likely not have effective immunity to this new type of coronavirus we should expect the number of these community spread cases to continue to rise vaccines are being developed at record speed and several will begin clinical testing in the coming weeks but it will take time to confirm their safety and their ability to protect against the virus so they aren t expected to become widely available for at least a year antiviral drugs and other therapies are also being studied but for now the main treatment involves supportive care including breathing tubes in cases of severe lung damage so where does that leave us what can you do to protect yourself here are a few suggestions 1 get the flu vaccine and get your family protected the flu can mimic coronavirus and make you think you have covid 19 when you don t 2 stuff your mother could have told you wash your hands including the tips of your fingers for 20 seconds i know that s a long time but do the best you can keep your hands away from your face and cough into the crook of your arm not into your hand or worst of all into the air 3 stay home if you re sick you re not doing the boss a favor by coming to work and making everyone else sick 4 stay informed a great source of information is the cdc website cdc gov it s especially helpful for information and advice about travel what about those surgical face masks so many people are wearing they may give some partial protection by catching droplets containing virus but the virus is so tiny it can go right through the mask or around it if you re sick a mask might help protect others but the cdc does not recommend it for routine use since this is a new type of coronavirus it s very difficult to predict respiratory viruses often like cold dry air and may possibly start to die down with warmer moister weather but we don t know that for sure and there could be more waves of infection to come bottom line there s no way of knowing right now how long coronavirus will remain a problem one thing we should definitely expect is another outbreak of another type of virus covid 19 is just the latest example of a deadly viral disease jumping from animals to people sars mers and ebola are others we need to study why this has been happening in asia deforestation may have increased contact between humans and bats which can carry the virus that causes sars or covid 19 and we must think globally about how to prevent and respond to future outbreaks story produced by alan golds dr jonathan lapook is the chief medical correspondent for cbs news follow him on twitter at drlapook watch cbs news anytime anywhere with the our 24 7 digital news network stream cbsn live or on demand for free on your tv computer tablet or smartphone copyright 2020 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved
