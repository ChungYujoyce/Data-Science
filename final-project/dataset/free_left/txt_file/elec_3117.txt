advertisement supported by by alexander burns join us for live updates of the republican debate the story is getting familiar donald j trump won the biggest contests of the night as senator ted cruz of texas captured the most conservative state up for grabs hillary clinton kept a clear upper hand in the democratic race but senator bernie sanders of vermont proved he would not be driven away anytime soon tuesday s elections could have brought new clarity to the presidential primaries instead they only seemed to confirm that both parties would probably settle their nominations by battling for delegates well into the spring nothing silences criticism like victory and mr trump racked up several on tuesday his successes in hawaii michigan and mississippi dealt a painful psychological blow to republicans who had convinced themselves that his campaign was losing steam but mr trump won and he won big with no obvious cracks in his support from disaffected lower income whites still mr trump has a lot to prove in the race he is only now being subjected to withering well funded attack ads and mr cruz notched another small state win in idaho again proving the tenacity of his support with hard core conservatives if mrs clinton had crushed mr sanders in michigan their contest might have been over in all but name but his narrow win there ensures the fight will go on yet in the bigger picture the basic battle lines of the democratic race have barely moved in weeks in michigan mr sanders dominated with young voters independents and white liberals his core constituencies all along mrs clinton handily won partisan democrats low income voters and black voters in michigan and routed mr sanders in mississippi with overpowering black support the outcome in michigan showed how difficult it could be for mrs clinton to knock mr sanders cleanly out of the race but mr sanders has still not attracted the kind of coalition that would make him a genuine threat to win the nomination it was a miserable even disastrous night for senator marco rubio of florida he finished fourth in michigan and mississippi languishing in single digits and collecting no delegates from those states he must fight for survival in his home state next week where even an upset win might not rescue his campaign mr rubio s core problem is that he has claimed no distinctive space in the race exit polls showed that mr cruz and gov john r kasich of ohio have seized big pieces of the party s right and left wings mr rubio has claimed no particular constituency at all mr kasich wins college towns mr cruz wins ultraconservative outer suburbs mr kasich wins liberal republicans mr cruz overperforms with evangelicals for most of the 2016 campaign the republicans vying to overtake mr trump have squabbled bitterly but mr kasich and mr cruz have so far avoided direct conflict and tuesday s results show why they are just not competing for the same voters in theory they could keep hassling mr trump from opposite sides of the republican party for weeks or months to come a coalition of republicans is banking on a scenario in which donald j trump fails to reach the 1 237 delegates required to secure the party s nomination before its july convention creating a potential opening for another nominee as the delegates vote on the convention floor the results in michigan gave mr sanders a big lifeline and they may be somewhat encouraging to mr trump s principal challengers too despite mr trump s double digit win he collected less than two fifths of the vote with about half of voters opting for either mr cruz or mr kasich for the underdogs in both parties those results point the way toward a hard fight for delegates in the midwest where mr trump s appeal is limited among republicans and mr sanders s hard left message plainly appeals to liberal whites the political calendar is teed up for just such a battle in the rust belt for all the focus on florida s primary on march 15 three midwestern states vote on the same day illinois missouri and ohio wisconsin follows soon after on april 5 if tuesday s democratic primaries had been restricted to democrats mrs clinton would have won landslides in michigan and mississippi had only republicans voted mr trump would have won narrower victories over mr cruz and mr kasich would have been relegated to a distant third place while mrs clinton won democrats by 16 points mr sanders won independents who made up less than a third of the electorate by 42 points according to exit polls there is nothing illicit about winning primaries with support from independents but the collection of states that allow crossover voting have become a frustrating obstacle to mrs clinton as she works to lock down the democratic nomination and a potentially crippling problem for mr cruz as he tries to build a winning coalition against mr trump advertisement
